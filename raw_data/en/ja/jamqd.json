My undergraduate degree is from Columbia University, where I graduated magna cum laude with a degree is Pre-Medical Studies and Sociology. After graduating, I spent a year living on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in South Dakota working at a health center for indigenous people. My next adventure was working for a breast cancer education non-profit in NYC for two years. I was then accepted to a number of medical schools. During that time I also had a painful injury that was helped tremendously by acupuncture. I felt a strong pull to study acupuncture and Chinese medicine rather than allopathic medicine and started acupuncture school in 1998. I opened my acupuncture practice in Rosendale in 2001. My intention is to provide compassionate, non-judgemental holistic health care. Chinese medicine is intrinsically \"holistic,\" always considering the whole person when looking to resolve specific symptoms. I also am wary of the judgemental attitude I sometimes observe in the holistic medicine world. I reject the messages that a person causes their own illness by not being \"good\" or \"pure\" enough. I see humans as complex organisms interacting with a complex environment with many forces beyond our control. I don't believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to healing and aim to support my patients in finding what works for them. I bring the wisdom I have earned through my own experiences dealing with an autoimmune disease, chronic pain, depression and anxiety, pregnancy, parenting a child with special needs, and 20 plus years of treating patients, to the care I provide. The tools at my disposal are a combination of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), trigger-point acupuncture, massage, gua-sha, cupping, stretching exercises, yoga poses, breathing exercises, meditation instruction, Chinese herbal medicine, dietary and lifestyle counseling, and nutritional supplements. Treatments and modalities are tailored to the individual client and the condition being treated. I treat all ages, from infants to senior citizens and everyone in between. People of all backgrounds are welcome. Creekside Acupuncture is a LGBTQAI+ welcoming space. "}
