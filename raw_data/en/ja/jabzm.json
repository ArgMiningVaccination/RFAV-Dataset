Scientists once thought babies were protected by the placenta but now research has found that's not the case. A 2005 [study](https://www.ewg.org/research/body-burden-pollution-newborns) done by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) in collaboration with Commonweal found \"an average of 200 industrial chemicals and pollutants in umbilical cord blood,\" and a total of 287 chemicals in the 10 babies tested. That's scary! But there IS a solution... There are ways to safeguard your family from these threats.

There is a simple procedure to clean up your toxic home: - Pick ONE item to start. This should be something easy and affordable. For example, tossing out the plastic in your cupboard is free and replacing with Pyrex is fairly affordable. Get a quick, painless win like this on the board to start. - Prioritize what's next. I recommend you dig into detoxing your food since that has an immediate impact. Strategize budget, food replacements, and how to transition to cooking regularly if you're a frequent fast-food or restaurant eater. - Plan out your year. This is not an overnight or \"in a month\" process. It'll take some time and doing but that's ok! Everything you eliminate will make your body healthier. - Look out for detox symptoms. As you clean out your system, you may have reactions, like a cold/flu symptoms, rash, emotional or behavioral struggles. This is a good thing! I recommend you look into homeopathy for remedies. [Boiron](https://www.boironusa.com/)is one of my favorite and accessible companies for products! - Budget wisely. Some things are just costly. For example, there are affordable ways to partially detox your water but for best results, you need to look into a Berkey and a whole-home filter that removes metals, fluoride and more.
