Alternate vaccine schedule-help Alright, I'm going to start by saying I'm not anti-vaccine but I do believe we give many unnecessary vaccinations and too many at too young an age. My LO is going in for 6 month visit today. Up until now I have followed standard vaccination schedule but I can't in good conscience continue to do so. I'd like to approach my doctor about a modified schedule and there are certain vaccines I do not wish to continue like rotavirus and I want to wait and schedule last hep B until 12-18 months. Ideally I'd like to do the minimum state requirement for kindergarten. My pediatrician gives pentacel which is a combo of dTap, IPV (polio), and Hib. It's not ideal because that's a lot in one shot. I am willing to just get that one done today but I'm not adding rotavirus, Hep B, and pneumococcal on top of that. They did that once already at 2 months and I wish I had been more proactive about it then. Anyone else dealt with their doctor on this? How did it go? What did you say? Did you have to find another pediatrician? I am not trying to be any type of extremist but I refuse to go with the status quo just because that is what is pushed. I'm not naive enough to think something is safe just because it's the norm. And unfortunately I know too many mothers now dealing with autism. [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=Alternate+vaccine+schedule-help) Update: long story short I have to find new doctor. It's company policy not to deviate from AAC schedule. Pediatrician could not provide compelling argument to give so many vaccines at once. She only said they give them at certain times for a reason and that changing schedule would be confusing for their record keeping. She was very nice about it and didn't look at me like I was crazy. The funny thing is she didn't try to convince to keep to their schedule at all. She just said sorry that they couldn't accommodate my request. They went ahead and gave one vaccine I wanted and that was it. You would think if it was so important to get all these vaccines at theses times for my baby's health that the doctor would have been more concerned. I think you did the right thing. There are many risks associated with each vaccine and their very own insert will list them. They are often the very same risks as the diseases themselves. Giving no more than one vaccine at a time has always worked well for us and my children have never so much as had a fever or any of the lethargy that comes along with the recommended schedule. My pediatrician is on board completely and never fights with me about it. I keep track of my own schedule and he will help me to decide which one is best to do next if I want his help. If you go in armed with your own schedule I don't see why they feel like it will be too hard to keep track of. And just so you know according to my ped you do not have to stick to the space between each shot for them to be effective. For instance my daughter got her hep b at her 2 year appt and he said she can get the second and third whenever we are there. Doesn't have to be 6-8 weeks. We've waited 6 months in fact. So do your research and make a schedule you are comfortable with and don't let the doctors scare you! The vaccine timing isn't just some arbitrary schedule that someone came up with and there is zero credible evidence of autism being linked to vaccination. Your pediatrician probably didn't put up a big fight because it's not her kid, so she's fine with you as the parent taking on the risk of not vaccinating your child. I am vaccinating my child but I don't believe in overloading their system. (I also don't think it's wrong not to vaccinate). I understand the concept of titers and boosters and why certain vaccines are given at certain intervals. I spent most of my undergrad studying biomedical biotechnology. I do know vaccines I wasn't required to have until I was almost in college are now given to newborns. I'm just simply asking if others have taken an alternate scheduling path and how it was handled at pediatrician. Honestly the impression I got from my pediatrician was that she understood where I was coming from but her hands were tied. She was very apologetic that she couldn't modify schedule for me. But if you don't trust your pediatrician to provide medical care for your child then you should find a new doctor that you do trust. There are risks for vaccinating & not vaccinating. I would do more research into what your state laws are about vaccination. I've personally never heard of a doc office saying its against comp policy to not follow the AAP schedule. Vaccines have been studied, yes. Many have not been studied in the groups they are given & there are NO published studies of long term effects of vaccination. Infants will not show these signs because it's long term. That's why many kids end up with problems when they are older. I've even heard that the placebo in vaccination studies is not just sugar water. Possibly aluminum, maybe Mercury. Mercury which they say not to eat a lot of fish because it can be toxic to you, but they can or have had it in vaccines that inject DIRECTLY into the blood stream. Much different that going through the digestive system. A completely diff process is taken place when it comes to secreting toxins. You can delay vaccinations for as long as you want (check state laws) but you can never taken vaccination out of your child. You will always (should always) be welcome to go in get your child & even yourself vaccinated whenever you want. Now I'm not knocking you for vaccinating or not vaccinating. Although, I do think docs / pedis push vaccination because they are taught it's 'safe & effective' but I think they are not taught all info. I think they get money for vaccine numbers their office produces. I also think there's other reasons, but I'll leave it at that. However, vaccination is not the only fault. Processed foods, sugar, unhealthy drinking habits, chemical exposure, antibiotics/hormones/etc in meat, dairy. Pesticides on produce. Preservatives in most to all food. Don't forget about health care products, beauty products, cleaning products. With all these things acting together, it's no wonder we are unhealthy, sick, ill, etc. Ok well your baby has plenty of time to do school required vaccines. I'm also in TX & am trying to figure out what we are going to do. My hubby is against home schooling. I just might have to for the years I can get through at least. I do want her to have the social part of schooling, but I do not want to load her up with vaccines. I've done research & will continue until I feel like I'm 100% with a decision. In schools, in Texas - currently - you can give exemptions forms based of religious, medical, & philosophical reasons. They stay on file for 2 years. Now the vaccinate all children act 2015 I mentioned may not allow that, for anyone. I read something. Let me get what it said & paste it. The exemption form is your life saver if you feel for any reason under the categories I've mentioned u do not want to vacc just because the school says so. I'm in Texas. And my pediatrician scheduled included a combo shot of 5 vaccines plus 3 more and a push toward getting flu shot too. The number of vaccines the AAP schedule and Texas schedule sets out is so much more than even the schools require. Texas now requires chicken pox vaccine for kindergarten now which I'm against. It's too new and could put child at risk for contracting disease as an adult based on its efficacy. I'm vegan and I have been doing my best to remove as many toxins from home as possible. I make my own cleaners and buy or grow organic and local. The worst part is I am a food scientist in R&D and understand all too well the chemicals and substances deemed safe for use in foods and medicines. The actual research and safety studies done are short term and often biased with any negative results thrown out or labeled as outliers. I just want what's best for my child. Now I'm on the hunt for a pediatrician that will work with me. :( But if u r in CA - exemptions need to be filed by 12/31/15 Forgot to mention that when vaccinations are tested for safety, sometimes or maybe all the time they are not tested to see the reaction of giving them with multiple vaccinations. In chemistry we were taught when different atoms come together, a reaction happens. Sometimes good/bad. Company's even can fast track their product to get it on the market to make money even when their trails are not complete. I would check nvic.org for information. Personally, I stopped vacc @ 4 mo because I do not believe they are doing things the best the can. I like the concept of providing protection against diseases. I am currently awaiting to see if the 'vaccinate all child act of 2015' becomes law. I am seriously looking into homeoprophylaxis. Homeopathic immunizations. They are not vaccines. But they provide equally effective protection against the same AAP schedule, even more that vaccines don't cover. I would look into possible exemptions for public schooling or daycare - unless u r in CA. I personally haven't had an alternated schedule because my daughter is 8 mo. You can look up vaccinate alt. Scheduling & find different ones online. I think you can just pick & chose yourself for what you want. [http://www.nvic.org/Vaccine-Laws/state-vaccine-requirements/texas.aspx](//www.nvic.org/Vaccine-Laws/state-vaccine-requirements/texas.aspx) I don't know if vacc exemption can go towards just one vacc. Like the varicella - chick pox. You could do some digging into that. \"Dear NVIC Supporters: While much of the media attention and gloating by the pharmaceutical industry and organized medicine focused on the loss of the personal belief and religious exemption in California and the loss of the philosophical exemption in Vermont, our huge successes occurred with very little media coverage or acknowledgement by those who worked against our mission. We are very proud of our successful involvement and contribution to protect exemptions in multiple states. The following states derailed legislative attempts to outright eliminating the conscientious/philosophical exemptions: Maine, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington. During the 2015 legislative cycle the following states came out on top of attacks that would have eliminated or severely restricted their religious exemption: Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont. Regarding adult employees, bills to mandate vaccines for child care employees passed in California but bills to require health care workers in Connecticut, Missouri and New Jersey to be vaccinated and school employees in Texas failed.

I didn't use his but did just split my babies vaccines up so she didn't get them all at the same time. So she would get a couple and then get a couple a month later. My pediatrician also did this with his children so he was supportive and we discussed which ones were most important for that time period based on thing like if we would be traveling or cold/ flu season/age of kids she was on daycare with. I'm going to follow Dr. Sears schedule but I've been wondering do the people around me need to be vaccinated? I'm due in 3 weeks. Is it too late for everyone to get vaccinated? Same here! I followed Dr. Sears schedule and also went based on if my daughter attended daycare, traveled, etc Best thing I could've done! I personally made sure me and my husband both had the Dtap and flu vaccine. I will be doing a delayed schedule with my little one. I will be starting her vaccinations at 4 months and only two vaccinations at a time unless they are combo vaccines in which then it'll just be one vaccine then the rest to follow in two-3 weeks. I feel we are just over loading the poor child's system. I will not be doing the rota virus or varicella vaccines. And the hep b will be done in middle school like mine was done. No reason to push all these vaccines at such a young age of development. - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [PregnancyHow to Find the Best Pediatrician for Your Baby](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/checklist/potential-baby-doctor.aspx) [PregnancyWeek-by-Week Pregnancy Advice for Expecting Dads and Partners](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/for-dad/week-by-week-pregnancy-advice-dads-partners/) [PregnancyYour Pregnancy Week-by-Week](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/) ParentsNorth friendly/tolerant pediatricians?May 03, 2023 | by Nancy12321Hello Moms, My baby came 10 days early and we still haven't located a pediatrician who is willing to accommodate an alternate vaccine schedule.
