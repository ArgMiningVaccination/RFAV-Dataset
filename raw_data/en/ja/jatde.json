Sadly, today there is no miracle cure or one pill to take those years away instantly. However, health and beauty both start from the inside, and there is a lot you can do about it yourself each day. Because just like any other tissue in your body, your skin has a vital tasks to fill and it requires specific nutrients and certain lifestyle to stay healthy and function properly. Nutrient deficiencies, junk food, toxification and dehydration can quickly change the view of your skin and make it look tired, dry, full of wrinkles or hyperpigmented. Thus, if you want to look younger and keep your skin smooth and glowing, your focus shouldn't be on makeup to cover the imperfections, but on nourishing foods, anti-aging food supplements, certain nourishing face creams and minor lifestyle changes as all these play the key role in a healthy and youthful look. Given below are 9 simple beauty tips and [14 beauty supplements]that can improve skin health and help you look and feel younger for longer. How to Look Younger Naturally - 9 Simple Tips 1. Walk at Least 15 Minutes Each Day to Look Younger Because walking is such a common activity for us, its effects on various aspects of human health have been thoroughly studied. Based on the results of a 12-year study, a daily 15-minute walk reduced mortality by as much as 22%. This percentage was even higher for longer and more active workouts. Though, some do not see walking as an \"aerobic\" workout and ignore the benefits of walking. However, aerobic exercise can be defined as an exercise that stimulates the heart and respiratory tract to pump more oxygen into the muscles. Even slow walking does all this. But the faster you walk, the higher the aerobic activity. The Sleep Research Foundation published a study that found that vigorous, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (such as walking) reduced time spent sleeping and increased sleep length among people with chronic insomnia compared to nights where they did not exercise during the day. Their advice is to do at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day. Or a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intense exercise per week in order for the protective properties of the body to be affected. The recommended time (walking is the easiest) does not have to be done all at once. If you cannot walk 30-minutes, walk two times a day for 15 minutes, it is just as good. Not everyone can work out in the gym or run 10 floors down the stairs, but most of us can walk. With all these benefits mentioned below, one small walk a day is worth it. You can start gradually and progress according to your endurance and the right pace. All you need is a decent pair of shoes and 15 minutes a day! Benefits of walking: - Increased cardiovascular, respiratory and circulatory activity means that nutrients go where they need to go to support training. - Instead of storing energy, it is used and the organs, muscles and bones become stronger. Our bodies are designed to move! - Without the slightest doubt, a sedentary lifestyle that does not allow the body to exercise enough leads to disease.

Change Lifestyle Reduce smoking, alcohol and coffee. 2. Healthy Diet Look over your diet. You might suffer from food intolerance and food allergies. In the case of food intolerance, the non-digestible food is a poison on the body that adversely affects the nervous system. Wheat, dairy, sugar and meat products are the main foods that your body may not tolerate. 3. Less Sugar Reduce the consumption of sugar products as they cause acidification of the body. Inflammation and various serious illnesses occur in an acidic environment. Even more, excess sugar also damages the nervous system. 4. More vitamins, minerals, fat and amino acids Let your levels of vitamins, minerals, fat and amino acids be measured as much as possible. Missing micro- and macro-nutrients may cause anxiety in the body, so the body simply has no substances to keep it running and build itself up. For example, brain cells consist of a large amount of fats. If a person does not eat fats such as fish oil, olive oil, hemp oil, walnut oil (omega 3, 6, 9 fats), then the brain is panicked because there is no essential substance for brain and brain activity. The lack of [magnesium]and B vitamins causes disturbances in the nervous system causing anxiety, irritability, and so on. 5. Drink more water 6. Physical exercise Move more! Physical movement is the best tool for releasing negative energies and a hormone serotonin manufacturer. The movement burns the sugar in the body (calories). Burning sugar (carbohydrate) releases energy in the body. The more movement and oxygen, the more the mitochondria \"cell power stations\" in the body cells are generated. They are responsible for energy production. 7.

Try natural depression and anxiety-relieving supplements In less severe cases, prior to chemical antidepressants, try natural anxiety-relieving supplements such as: - B vitamins - Vitamin D - Magnesium - Ashwagandha 9.
