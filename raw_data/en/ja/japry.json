A vintage tea cup, a gorgeous flower arrangement, a ruffled shower curtain. Styling your mind is not just about your personal development, it's also about creating a beautiful environment and nourishing rituals to support your new mindset. Whether its your home, your car, or your office, its crucial that you curate the world around you to reflect the way you want to feel inside. For me personally, my space must feel glam, feminine, and clean. Over the years, I've developed go-to rituals and must-haves in my home that help nurture my mind, body, and soul. And the best part? You don't need to invest thousands of dollars to make your life feel luxurious. Here are my 7 tried-and-true ways to elevate your environment and raise your glam vibration: Subscribe to a home delivery of your favorite newspaper. Ever turn on the news in the morning and immediately feel anxious? Between the drama, the debating \"experts,\" and the commercials, watching the morning news can be toxic. I cut out television in the mornings years ago and it has transformed my world. I subscribe to the New York Times home delivery and receive my news that way. I light a candle, savor my coffee, and catch up what's going on in the world on my terms, without all the noise. Curate a beautiful coffee mug collection. It may seem small, but drinking your coffee out of a pretty mug makes all the difference. I am head over heels for this [stunning gold H&M mug](http://rstyle.me/n/bxbeahb7j47) right now (pictured above with a vintage saucer). I also love mugs with positive quotes and affirmations. This [\"Boss\" mug](http://rstyle.me/~8K3us) also has my heart. Get uniform hangers for your closet. I recently talked about my [capsule closet transformation](http://caraalwill.com/the-case-for-a-capsule-wardrobe/), and let me tell you, it has shifted me in a way I could never have imagined. One of my favorite aspects of my new closet is the fact that my hangers are now all uniform. I am obsessed with [these black velvet hangers.](http://rstyle.me/~8KlfS) They make everything look so sleek, I seriously feel like I'm shopping in a boutique every time I pick out my outfits. Use an aromatherapy diffuser. Want your home to instantly smell like a spa? [Buy an aromatherapy diffuser](http://rstyle.me/~8LvHh) and use it with your favorite essentials oils. Eucalyptus is my thing right now. I fire this baby up every morning and it energizes me and makes me feel like I'm working from a 5-star hotel. You can choose whatever aromas work for you: lavender, peppermint, the list goes on. Research the benefits of essential oils and go to town. Invest in luxurious pajamas. If there is one thing I love, it's luxe loungewear. I don't know about you, but I'm one of those people who get home and immediately change into comfy clothes. I will admit, I was having a love affair with sweats for a while, but I have since upgraded to [this delicious pajama set](http://rstyle.me/n/bwx9jmb7j47) and I've never looked back. They are soft and glam and look great whether you're wearing them to bed or just as your Saturday outfit. They're a little pricey, but so worth it. Splurge. And thank me later. Use pretty pens and stationary. I'm big on writing lists. Lists of goals, dreams, things I'm celebrating, etc. And there is no better way to upgrade that practice than by using pretty pens and stationary. If you follow me on Snapchat and Instagram, you probably always see my [gold pens](http://rstyle.me/~8HWQr) and [Louis Vuitton agenda](http://rstyle.me/n/bxbstdb7j47). You don't need to invest in a designer agenda, but make sure that whatever you are using to write your goals down feels beautiful. Home Goods has some fantastic note pads at great prices. Upgrade your skincare routine. Okay, this is admittedly not a \"little\" luxury, but its something I feel strongly about. I get tons of questions about my skin and how I care for it. And while part of it is genetics (my grandmother's skin was seriously like butter), part of it is SoulCycle (sweating out toxins 4x a week will certainly give you a glow), a huge part of it is my skincare regimen. I use the following 3 products religiously: my [Clarisonic](http://rstyle.me/n/bxbtzwb7j47), [this face wash](http://rstyle.me/~8K3Nu), and [this moisturizer.](http://rstyle.me/~8K3Mb) These are not cheap, but I have learned time and time again that you get what you pay for. If you can't scoop them all up at once, set aside a budget and begin saving. Believe me when I tell you, your skin is worth it. "}
