Patients sometimes feel dissatisfied with their regular medical care or are interested in minimizing the use of medications and procedures. They want to have greater control over their health through optimizing lifestyle, or employing healthy nutrition, exercise, careful use of supplements, and mind-body practices. Integrative Medicine and Primary Care for Chronic Illness Generally speaking, we will work with your current doctors to create the best plan of care. However, if you are interested in transferring your care to our center, [Dr. Kogan](https://gwcim.com/wp22/people/mikhail-kogan-md/) and [Dr. DeMocker](https://gwcim.com/people/sharon-democker-md/) can assume the role of your primary care physician. If you are looking for a naturopathic doctor as your primary care physician, [Dr. Orceyre, ](https://gwcim.com/wp22/people/deirdre-orceyre-n-d-msom-l-ac/) [Dr. Ledenac](https://gwcim.com/wp22/people/marianna-ledenac-np/) and [Dr. Sadrolsadot](https://gwcim.com/people/paymon-sadrolsadot-nd/) are taking new patients. While the majority of blood work, specialty tests, and procedures can be performed at the GW Center, we work closely with the George Washington University where most imaging, blood work, and other tests can be done quickly and should be covered by most major health insurance plans. In addition, we have a large referral network of medical specialists at the [Medical Faculty Associates](www.gwdocs.com), Multi-specialty Outpatient System at George Washington University.
