However, the misuse of antibiotics for human and animal purposes has fueled the process of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), considered now a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), which significantly increases the mortality risk and related medical costs linked to the management of bacterial diseases. The current research aiming at developing novel efficient antibiotics is very challenging, and just a few candidates have been identified so far due to the difficulties connected with AMR. Therefore, novel therapeutic or prophylactic strategies to fight AMR are urgently needed. In this scenario, vaccines constitute a promising approach that proves to be crucial in preventing pathogen spreading in primary infections and in minimizing the usage of antibiotics following secondary bacterial infections. Unfortunately, most of the vaccines developed against the main resistant pathogens are still under preclinical and clinical evaluation due to the complexity of pathogens and technical difficulties. In this review, we describe not only the main causes of AMR and the role of vaccines in reducing the burden of infectious diseases, but we also report on specific prophylactic advancements against some of the main pathogens, focusing on new strategies that aim at improving vaccine efficiency.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-01", "cleaned_text": "The Potential Role of Vaccines in Preventing Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR): An Update and Future Perspectives [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11020333](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11020333) [Vaccines Against Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria: From Bench to Bedside]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/vaccines_against_antibiotic_resistant_bacteria )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00333)]. Since their discovery, antibiotics have been successfully employed by physicians to halt the progression of several infections. In this respect, different classes of antibiotics are available according to the strain of infecting pathogens and the stage of the disease [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00333)]. Consequently, the morbidity and mortality caused by bacterial infections, as well as the healthcare-related costs, have been significantly reduced over the last few decades thanks to the availability of effective antibiotics. Despite the outstanding therapeutic benefits offered by these drugs, the enthusiasm of clinicians has progressively diminished over the last few years as a serious concern related to their effectiveness has emerged. This is, in fact, seriously affected by antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is the ability developed by pathogens to resist the drugs intended to kill them. AMR is particularly alarming as it may cause persistent infections, as well as increased patient mortality and medical costs, and for this reason, is nowadays regarded as a serious global emergency. According to recent estimates, the average annual deaths due to AMR will exceed those due to cancer by 2050 [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00333)]. This clearly explains the increasing attention paid to new cures and prophylactic interventions for contrasting microbial diseases and resistance phenomena. However, current efforts for the identification of new efficient antibiotics are not sufficient to overcome the threat represented by AMR. Even though the use of antibiotics is still crucial in the presence of a number of infectious diseases, other solutions that aim at eradicating resistant pathogens are imperative. In this context, vaccines hold a great potential to diminish the spread of highly pathogenic microbes and to minimize the necessity of antibiotics: the main cause of AMR. However, currently, there are no vaccines available for several resistant pathogens, and their applicability is hampered by numerous obstacles encountered by scientists and companies. 2. Main Causes of Antimicrobial Resistance [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00333)]. This is largely due to the possibility of having access to antibiotics without any medical prescriptions, which occurs in most developing countries such as Africa [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00333)] and the Philippines [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00333)]. Purchasing antimicrobials in pharmacies, in fact, allows one to avoid long waiting times and to discuss directly with the seller about therapeutic options, thus escaping counseling fees. However, the vendors are often untrained people and may not be aware of the drug's contraindications and the dosage required for specific patients. [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00333), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00333)]. A further determinant of increased AMR is the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics by doctors, which includes erroneous drug choice and incorrect dosage, eventually leading to the uselessness of pharmacological treatment. As shown in a pilot study performed on 270 patients from different regions of Lebanon, about half of the antibiotic prescriptions over a period of four months resulted in inappropriate use and did not conform to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, hence reflecting the variability in medical knowledge, the lack of clinical trials aimed at optimizing treatment duration, as well as the social factors of the country involved in medical decisions [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00333)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00333)]. Drug selection can be facilitated by performing an antibiotic susceptibility test (AST), an essential surveillance assay by which the susceptibility of any pathogens to specific antimicrobials is measured [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00333)]. However, the AST is a time-consuming procedure that may require the implementation of many approaches, such as bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, and flow cytometry, raising the costs of analysis [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00333)]. Obviously, most laboratories in rural places are not equipped to perform such analyses. In cases where AST is not possible, most health professionals are forced to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics instead of more specific ones in an attempt to treat infectious diseases, which significantly contributes to increasing the burden of AMR [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00333)]. This is made worse by the medical prescription of multiple antibiotics for treating the same infection following both the lack of a specific diagnosis and the economic advantages coming from drug suppliers. Furthermore, the huge number of patients usually under care by family doctors limits the time required for their optimal training with respect to the knowledge of a given disease and the available therapeutic options. Even more alarmingly, patients often rely on self-medication, which in turn leads to therapy failure as a result of unjustified drug discontinuation or dosage changes. This is particularly true when patients experience symptom relief, typically occurring before a pathogen is completely eradicated [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00333)]. Antimicrobials are also employed as prophylactic agents to prevent infectious diseases and as chemotherapy drugs in high-risk animals, as well as those that are exploited to facilitate the growth of livestock. Noteworthy, the amount of antimicrobials used for these purposes greatly exceeds that used for human therapy [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00333)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00333)]. As demonstrated by the high levels of antimicrobials residues found in meat for consumption and its derivatives, livestock represents a major source of resistant pathogens, which are more likely to be transmitted to humans, especially in countries where people live in close contact with animals [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00333), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00333)]. It has been proven that the misuse of antibiotics in domestic animals for zootechnical use may lead to new mutations in the bacterial genome. This phenomenon, together with the transmission/acquisition of plasmids, allows pathogens to escape antimicrobial action which usually occurs through drug detoxification, target modification, or changes in metabolic pathways [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00333)]. Alterations in target biomolecules can greatly affect molecular binding with antimicrobials. Such changes can involve targets such as the ribosomal 30S and 50S subunits but also cell wall precursors and enzymes with crucial roles in RNA transcription or DNA replication [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00333)]. [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00333-f001)) are inhibited through the use of three main key enzymes: beta-lactamases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases, respectively ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-00333-f002)), which clearly leads to dramatic scenarios of AMR [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00333)]. As above mentioned, the misuse of antibiotics has generated a plethora of resistant pathogens that easily escape the antimicrobial attack. Therefore, research is constantly focused on the identification of novel compounds that may be effective in treating such microbes. 3. Challenges in Developing New Antibiotics [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00333), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00333)]. The search for new antimicrobials is challenging, and this can be due to several factors, which are mainly classifiable as scientific and commercial difficulties [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00333)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00333)]. Similar results were reported by several other profitable companies, including AstraZeneca, and huge research costs have been sustained without any satisfactory outcomes. [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00333)]. [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00333)]. Most of these visits are due to allergic reactions accounting for 79% of all the adverse effects of antibiotics; however, other conditions, including gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and/or neurologic symptoms are also associated with antimicrobials [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00333)]. The chemical nature of the compound, is reconsidered and modified when a safety issue is observed during a lead identification program, causing further time and cost consumption. In addition to these concerns, the conduction of clinical trials to test antimicrobials in vivo is generally hampered by several factors. For example, the recruitment of new patients involved in clinical trials requires that they have not been treated with antimicrobials 24 h before starting the trial. However, this often represents an insurmountable barrier as some patients, especially those with advanced pneumonia, need to assume antibiotics as soon as possible in order to reach high survival rates. As a consequence, the clinical study is greatly delayed [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00333)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00333)]. To overcome these difficulties, there is an urgent need for commitment to national funding and international coordination on this theme. Sadly, governments of many countries are reluctant to invest significant resources in the fight against antimicrobial resistance that they see as an issue that is not solely their own. On the other hand, low-resource countries, where AMR has the highest burdens, have fragile economic conditions that do not let them lead the reform of the antimicrobials discovery and market [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00333)]. 4. Effect of Vaccines on AMR [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00333)]. Among these, vaccines may be the key to limiting the spread of resistant pathogens and the consequent AMR. Vaccines have represented an important achievement in the field of immunology since their implementation in the prophylaxis therapy of patients worldwide contributes significantly to the prolongation of life expectancy. The importance of vaccination has recently emerged with the COVID-19 pandemic, for which the fast development of safe and efficient vaccination was an urgent necessity [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00333), [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00333)]. [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00333)]. As a proof of concept, the effect of vaccination against Streptococcus in the USA reduced by 84% the cases of Streptococcus pneumonia caused by multidrug resistance in children younger than 2 years of age ( [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00333-t001)) [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00333)]. While an antibiotic is designed against a specific target, vaccines are directed against multiple targets, which makes resistance episodes in the vaccinated population very rare. In fact, more mutations conferring resistance are needed if multiple immunogenic epitopes are exposed [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00333)]. Additionally, the duration of the protection and the herd immunity, if reached, make the vaccines more efficient and reliable tools than antibiotics. According to the above-mentioned study [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00333)], vaccination reduced the transmission of Streptococcus pneumonia in unvaccinated 65-year-old people by 49% ( [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00333-t001)). Even in the rare case of a resistance to vaccines, such as the three examples reported by Kennedy and Read [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00333)], two of which involved vaccination against bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumonia and Bordetella pertussis), a severe outcome of the disease is still avoided due to the preventive nature of vaccines. On the contrary, the antimicrobial therapeutic effect is completely blocked in the case of resistance to antibiotic drugs [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00333), [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00333)]. [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00333)] and rinderpest virus [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00333)], almost eliminated poliomyelitis, and significantly contributed to reducing the incidence of other diseases, including pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00333)]. [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00333)]. According to a clinical trial carried out in 2018 on 6-35 months old children, individuals receiving quadrivalent Influenza vaccines showed a 47% lower incidence of influenza compared to the placebo group ( [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00333-t001)). This outcome was accompanied by a 50% reduced antibiotic prescription [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00333)]. [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00333)]. An indirect effect of vaccines is to prevent secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia and otitis, which can easily occur following viral infection. By inhibiting secondary infections after vaccination, the inappropriate consumption of antibiotics is averted. As described in a single-blind study by Ozgur et al., 119 Turkish children who underwent influenza vaccination experienced a significant reduction in acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and total otitis compared to the unvaccinated group, confirming the usefulness of vaccination in preventing secondary infections [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00333)]. 5. Current Vaccines in Preclinical and Clinical Development [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00333)]. On 12 July 2022, the first report on the pipeline of vaccines in the course of development to mitigate the AMR has been published by WHO, stating that the clinical trials of last-stage development vaccines should be speeded up, and the implementation of existing vaccines boosted ( [https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2022-urgent-call-for-better-use-of-existing-vaccines-and-development-of-new-vaccines-to-tackle-amr](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2022-urgent-call-for-better-use-of-existing-vaccines-and-development-of-new-vaccines-to-tackle-amr)accessed on 9 December 2022). This report describes not only vaccines in preclinical and clinical development but also failed candidates. Moreover, it classifies pathogens into different groups according to the feasibility expressed as the progression of the candidate vaccine in clinical trials, its biological as well as product development feasibility, and access and implementation feasibility. The biological feasibility takes into account factors including immunity from natural exposure and the likelihood of a vaccine to protect against most pathogenic strains. On the other hand, the product development feasibility relies on the availability of in vivo and in vitro models to assist vaccine development, the set-up of a late-stage clinical test, and the usage of human models, if required. Access and implementation feasibility refer to the possibility of easily introducing novel vaccine candidates in a target population, such as through children's vaccination programs, by means of commercial incentives and political transparency. Pseudomonas (ETEC), which were listed as critical priority pathogens, have shown 4, 5, 4, 5, and 10 vaccine candidates, respectively. For Staphylococcus aureus, a high-priority pathogen, there were 14 candidates. The highest number of candidates (20), however, has been found in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is a well-established priority pathogen. The numbers mentioned above refer to preclinical analyses carried out in 2021, where a total of 94 candidates were confirmed. ( [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00333-t002)), ( [https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2022-urgent-call-for-better-use-of-existing-vaccines-and-development-of-new-vaccines-to-tackle-amr](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2022-urgent-call-for-better-use-of-existing-vaccines-and-development-of-new-vaccines-to-tackle-amr)accessed on 9 December 2022). A total of 61 candidate vaccines were confirmed in active clinical trials. S. pneumonia and M. tuberculosis have the highest number of candidates (16 and 13, respectively). K. pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae both have one candidate vaccine. Instead, no vaccine candidates have been identified for high and critical-priority pathogens tend to show fewer vaccine candidates compared to the medium-priority ones both in preclinical and clinical trials. Vaccines against Shigella sonnei and H. pylori have been discontinued, reflecting a common issue of vaccine production represented by economic, logistic, and scientific obstacles. [https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2022-urgent-call-for-better-use-of-existing-vaccines-and-development-of-new-vaccines-to-tackle-amr](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2022-urgent-call-for-better-use-of-existing-vaccines-and-development-of-new-vaccines-to-tackle-amr)accessed on 9 December 2022). 5.1. Group A 5.1.1. Salmonella enterica ser. Typhi [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00333)]. For this reason, the scientific community has devoted its efforts to new strategies aimed at overcoming the burden of Salmonella disease by developing novel candidates. [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00333)]. Phase II trials of this candidate (NCT03527355) showed high safety and immunogenicity in 6-23 years old children after 6 months from the vaccination with the first and second doses [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00333)]. Currently, it is involved in phase III with the purpose of obtaining qualification from WHO and becoming a crucial vaccine for global health. A glycoconjugate trivalent candidate triggering NTS enterica ser. Typhimurium, and Enteritidis, and typhoid are actually under evaluation in a phase I trial in the United States (NCT03981952) [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00333)]. Another candidate is represented by M01ZH09, a live attenuated oral vaccine directed against S. enterica ser. Paratyphi A and Typhi. The phase II trial proved that M01ZH09 was effective in reducing the risk of typhoid infection by 50% in patients where anti-Vi antibodies were found before the vaccination. (NCT01405521). Additionally, M01ZH09 was characterized by high immunogenicity and high tolerability and was able to greatly delay the onset of infection and reduce noticeably the burden of infection [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00333)]. Typhax was an additional candidate vaccine that exploited a matrix to entrap Vi polysaccharide from S. enterica ser. Typhi. In a previous phase I study (NCT03926455), Typhax was demonstrated to be safe, immunogenic, and well-tolerated following a single dose. Nevertheless, a further boost in antibody levels was not reached with a second dose [ [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00333)]. A very recent trial carried out on mice, rabbits, and monkeys showed that Advax-CpG adjuvant boosts the Vi antibodies response to Typhax compared to the previous formulation, hence, giving durable and sustained protection over time [ [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00333)]. 5.1.2. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00333)]. Despite the good results demonstrated in preventing tuberculosis disease, this attenuated vaccine shows a wide variability, confirmed by the absence of immunity found in the Indian population compared to 80% of efficiency among the British population. The different strains, as well as the route of administration, have been shown to affect the levels of immunization and, in turn, the efficacy of vaccination [ [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00333)]. Indeed, the percutaneous inoculation of BCG in Japanese people led to a higher production of BCG-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to intradermal administration in Danish people [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00333)]. In addition, the different strains of BCG caused an evident heterogeneity in the formation of crust, redness, and erythema in different countries, showing that genetic factors are crucial for the immunity system [ [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00333)]. While the BCG vaccine is largely employed in those countries with a high-risk population, a selective vaccination is preferred in low to moderate-risk countries [ [49](#B49-vaccines-11-00333)]. Therefore, new strategies in BCG vaccination are needed in order to obtain safe and efficacy vaccines in all groups. Currently, there are more than 20 candidate vaccines in preclinical studies and 13 novel candidates in active clinical trials. Among these, nine are prophylactic vaccines, while three have exclusive therapeutic effects. Another candidate has both effects. VPM1002 is a recombinant (r)BCG vaccine, genetically modified at the Max Plank institute, that reached phase 3 trials and showed better immunogenicity and safety compared to BCG (NCT04351685). This vaccine candidate is scheduled to complete phase 3 in 2025. [50](#B50-vaccines-11-00333)] and infants [ [51](#B51-vaccines-11-00333)], demonstrating the possibility of a promising candidate. Additionally, the administration of MTBVAC to rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in preclinical studies was well tolerated and gave similar results obtained in humans during clinical trials of the same candidate [ [52](#B52-vaccines-11-00333)]. The good results achieved during phase 2 trials conducted in Africa on infants (NCT03536117), as well as on adolescents and adults (NCT02933281), allowed MTBVAC to enter the phase 3 evaluation where it is currently involved (NCT04975178) [ [53](#B53-vaccines-11-00333)]. MIP/Immuvac is a heat-killed Mycobacterium indicus pranii vaccine that is currently involved in Phase 3 trials in India (CTRI/2019/01/017026). The first purpose of this study is the efficacy assessment of this candidate by evaluating the incidence of tuberculosis among healthy Indian people in contact with sputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients over 3 years. Clinical reports demonstrated the high tolerability and efficacy of the MIP vaccine in preventing and treating pulmonary tuberculosis in a double-blind, randomized multi centric clinical study [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-00333)]. An immunogenic fusion protein-based vaccine, M72/AS01E, is a candidate that showed high efficacy in a phase 2b trial concluded in 2018 by preventing tuberculosis in adult patients which were negative for HIV with latent tuberculosis infection in the absence of active disease (NCT01755598) [ [55](#B55-vaccines-11-00333)]. A more recent report confirmed that M72/AS01E protected against tuberculosis disease in about 50% of patients following 36 months of treatment. As a proof of concept, a single dose of M72/AS01E induced an increase in specific antibodies and CD4+ T cells, which was prolonged over the entire trial [ [56](#B56-vaccines-11-00333)]. ID93 + GLA-SE is a recombinant subunit vaccine that has been recently tested in a phase 2 trial involving individuals vaccinated with BCG when both infected and non-infected with M. tuberculosis. (NCT02465216) [ [57](#B57-vaccines-11-00333)]. In a preclinical study carried out on mice, this candidate vaccine induced a CD4 T cell response and a decreased number of bacteria in the lungs of animals infected with resistant or virulent strains of M. tuberculosis, confirming their potential as a promising candidate for human vaccine [ [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00333)]. In the randomized double-blind study above mentioned, a strong antibody response was shown after two injections of ID93 + GLA-SE, which lasted throughout 6 months of trials. This response was not further boosted following a third administration. Additionally, it was well tolerated, and no serious adverse effects were noticed [ [57](#B57-vaccines-11-00333)]. Further evaluation of this candidate is needed to contrast the transmission of tuberculosis disease. 5.2. Group B 5.2.1. Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04899336](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04899336), 2022). ExPEC10V is a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine consisting of 10 serotypes of the ExPEC that are separately conjugated to the carrier protein. This candidate has been evaluated in a phase 1 study involving Japanese patients between 60 and 85 years old with the purpose of assessing the safety and reactivity of different doses of ExPEC10V (NCT04306302 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04306302](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04306302), accessed on 9 December 2022). It is currently involved in a phase 1/2 clinical trial, which aims to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of three different doses of ExPEC10V to further choose the optimal dose for future investigations (NCT03819049, [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03819049](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03819049), accessed on 9 December 2022). Another candidate vaccine is based on FimH ( [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00333-f003)), and an adhesin protein present in the type 1 pili of E. coli, which is crucial in promoting the attachment on mammalian bladders. [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00333)]. As a result of the good outcomes obtained so far, the FimH-based vaccine will be enrolled in a phase 2 study. A recent prophylactic strategy against ExPEC is represented by Uro-Vaxom\u00ae (OM Pharma, Geneva, Switzerland), made by membrane proteins of heat-inactivated E. coli that are able to stimulate, not specifically, the cells of the innate immune system. This vaccine is actually evaluated in a phase 2 trial for the assessment of the prevention of urinary infection in participants with chronic neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NCT02591901) [ [60](#B60-vaccines-11-00333)]. 5.2.2. Salmonella enterica ser. Paratyphi A [61](#B61-vaccines-11-00333)]. Therefore, the need for efficient vaccines against S. enterica ser. A is a priority. There are a few vaccine candidates enrolled in preclinical studies, and three vaccines are actually being involved in clinical trials. All of them are bivalent and target both ser. Typhi and ser. A. The candidate O:2 is a conjugate vaccine that showed immunogenicity and safety in phase 1 and 2 studies after a single dose. Although it was not able to arouse a booster response following a further dose, O:2 is currently involved in phase 3 trials [ [62](#B62-vaccines-11-00333)]. [63](#B63-vaccines-11-00333)]. This vaccine has been licensed by the Indian company \"Bharat Biotech International\" and has been proposed to be commercialized together with the live oral S-typhi vaccine CVD 909, giving rise to a bivalent live oral vaccine against the two strains of S. Typhi. CVD 1902 is actually enrolled in a phase 2 study involving 76 individuals in good health who will receive two doses of this candidate to evaluate the resulting immune response and tolerability. This trial is scheduled to finish within 2023 ( [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20220426/Phase-III-trials-of-new-paratyphoid-vaccine-begin-in-Oxford.aspx](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20220426/Phase-III-trials-of-new-paratyphoid-vaccine-begin-in-Oxford.aspx)accessed on 9 December 2022). The relatively poor incidence and mortality associated with S. Paratyphi A as well as the lack of specific animal models to study this infectious disease represents a big challenge in the development of an efficacy vaccine against paratyphoid. 5.2.3. Neisseria gonorrhoeae [64](#B64-vaccines-11-00333)]. A few candidates have been identified and investigated in preclinical phases, showing promising results, including a reduced duration of infections in mice, a Type 1 T helper (Th1) response, and the production of bactericidal antibodies [ [65](#B65-vaccines-11-00333)]. The retrospective case-control trial by Petousis-Harris et al. suggested the possibility that the vaccination developed for serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis might induce a cross-protection against N. gonorrhoeae. The proof of concept came from a mass vaccination against meningococcal group B executed in New Zealand with an outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-type vaccine (MeNZB). Interestingly, individuals receiving the MeNZB vaccine showed a lower chance of developing gonorrhoeae compared to not vaccinated participants (41% vs. 51%). The efficacy of this vaccine was estimated to be 31% following adjustments of gender, ethnicity, and geographical area [ [66](#B66-vaccines-11-00333)]. A further study performed in New Zealand two years later demonstrated moderate effectiveness (24%) of a MeNZB vaccine in reducing hospitalization, specifically against gonorrhoeae [ [67](#B67-vaccines-11-00333)]. These data are not surprising because N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae hold at least an 80% nucleotide sequence identity. Moreover, many antigens of meningococcal B OMVs are conserved in N. gonorrhoeae [ [68](#B68-vaccines-11-00333)]. Overall, this represents the first evidence of the effectiveness of vaccines in exerting a protective effect against N. gonorrhoeae. 5.2.4. Clostridioides Difficile [69](#B69-vaccines-11-00333)]. A vaccine against C. difficile is not currently available on the market. There are only five candidates in preclinical studies, and even fewer reached the clinical trials. GSK has recently evaluated in a phase 1 trial a recombinant vaccine against C. difficile, based on the F2 antigen with or without the adjuvant AS01B (NCT04026009). The purpose of this study is to administer the vaccine GSK2904545A to healthy adults from 18 to 45 years and from 50 to 70 years to assess the safety and reactivity profile of this vaccine candidate ( [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04026009](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04026009), accessed on 9 December 2022). Another recent candidate has been identified by Pfizer, which had encouraging results in a phase 3 trial (Clover) testing a vaccine (PF-06425090) on 50 years old or older adult patients at risk of developing CDI. The aim was to investigate if the vaccine was able to prevent the burden of disease in a safe and efficacy way (NCT03090191, [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03090191?term=vaccine&cond=clostridium+difficile&rank=7](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03090191?term=vaccine&cond=clostridium+difficile&rank=7), accessed on 9 December 2022). Mechanistically, this vaccine targets toxin A and toxin B (TcdA and TcdB, [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00333-f004)): the main pathogenic factors of C. difficile. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02316470?term=vaccine](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02316470?term=vaccine), accessed on 9 December 5.3.1. Klebsiella pneumoniae [71](#B71-vaccines-11-00333), [72](#B72-vaccines-11-00333)]. At present, no vaccines are available against K. pneumoniae. Five candidates have been identified in preclinical studies, while only one vaccine reached clinical trials. The tetravalent bioconjugate vaccine (Kleb4V) has recently been involved in a phase 1 trial on healthy humans to assess its safety and immunogenicity profile. Kleb4V, which includes O-antigen-polysaccharides of the most prevalent K. pneumoniae serotypes, is administered in four formulations, including a target dose or a low dose with or without the adjuvant AS03. The efficacy of the vaccine is evaluated in young adults (18 to 40 years old), followed by the oldest part of the population (55 to 70 years old, [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04959344](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04959344), accessed on 9 December 2022). [73](#B73-vaccines-11-00333)]. Uromone\u00ae showed protection against recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in female participants of phase 2/3 studies (NCT04096820; NCT02543827). 5.3.2. Non-typhoidal Salmonella [74](#B74-vaccines-11-00333)]. S. enterica ser. Typhimurium, Enteritidis, and Typhi. This vaccine is enrolled in a phase 1 study with the purpose of evaluating the corresponding immune response and tolerability following the administration of different doses of CVD1000 (NCT03981952, [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03981952](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03981952), accessed on 9 December 2022). Over the last year, new vaccines based on generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA) have been proposed to fight the burden of NTF. GMMA are bacteria-derived vesicles that are able to induce a robust immune response following the presentation of key antigens to the immune system. GMMA can be genetically modified to control undesirable immunoreactivity and to play a role as the delivery system for protein antigens [ [75](#B75-vaccines-11-00333)]. GMMA targeting many pathogens have been proven to elicit a good immune response and protection without particular adverse effects both in animal models and in clinical trials [ [76](#B76-vaccines-11-00333)]. GMMA-based vaccines against S. sonnei [ [77](#B77-vaccines-11-00333)] and meningococcus [ [78](#B78-vaccines-11-00333)] represent the most advanced vaccines in development in preclinical and clinical studies. The promising results obtained demonstrate the utility and efficacy of this novel strategy. The GMMA approach has been used to generate a vaccine against NTS. The work of Schager et al. showed that GMMA from S. typhimurium was able to evocate a strong immune response dependent on B cells and to produce antibodies against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and porins [ [79](#B79-vaccines-11-00333)]. 5.3.3. Shigella spp. [80](#B80-vaccines-11-00333)]. Despite no vaccines still being available for Shigella, this is a very intense area of research, as confirmed by the presence of multiple candidates both in preclinical and in phase 1/2 clinical trials. The vaccines against Shigella that have been enrolled for clinical studies target both S. flexneri and sonnei and include whole cell, bioconjugate, live attenuated, subunit, and GMMA-based vaccines. A very recent candidate that is being tested is CVD31000 (CVD 1208S-122): a bivalent live attenuated vaccine targeting ETEC and S. flexneri. The current phase 1 trial started in September 2021 and has the purpose to assess whether the oral vaccine is safe and immunogenic in three vaccine dosage cohorts involving 54 participants between 18 and 49 years. (NCT04634513). This study is scheduled to finish within September 2024 ( [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04634513](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04634513)accessed on 9 December 2022). The novel monovalent bioconjugate Flexyn2a vaccine, composed of the polysaccharide component of the S. flexneri 2a O-antigen, was previously evaluated in a phase 1 study in 2017, demonstrating a good safety profile associated with a robust immune response (NCT02388009) [ [81](#B81-vaccines-11-00333)]. A recent phase 2 study published by Talaat et al. confirmed that the Flexyn2a vaccine was well tolerated, immunogenic, and protected against Shigella in healthy adults. In particular, vaccinated participants exhibited protection efficacy in about 50% of cases, thus limiting antibiotic interventions. Moreover, subjects developing shigellosis showed a lower disease severity when receiving vaccination compared to the placebo group. This study will significantly contribute to the future license of the Flexyn2a vaccine as an efficacy prophylactic agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa [83](#B83-vaccines-11-00333)]. Despite efforts, there are no licensed vaccines nor candidates in active clinical trials against this pathogen. The vaccines that reached clinical studies in recent years were discontinued or failed to avoid high mortality risks, as demonstrated by the IC43 recombinant P. aeruginosa vaccine (NCT01563263) [ [84](#B84-vaccines-11-00333)]. A serious challenge for the development of an efficient vaccine against P. aeruginosa is represented by the high heterogeneity of proteins among the different strains of this bacterium [ [85](#B85-vaccines-11-00333)]. [86](#B86-vaccines-11-00333)]. Given the multiple virulence mechanisms used by P. aeruginosa and its ability to adapt to several host environments, other strategies exploiting the combination of multiple candidates should be considered. As shown in the work of Bianconi et al., the combination of specific candidates, rather than a single antigen, was able to control the burst of P. aeruginosa infections in a mouse model of respiratory infection. In particular, the synergic combination of PA5340 and PA3526-MotY proteins gave the maximum result in terms of protection, which could be used to develop an efficient vaccine against this pathogen [ [87](#B87-vaccines-11-00333)]. More research to better elucidate the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections, as well as the development of in vivo models that mimick human diseases more closely, is critical to developing new potential vaccines. 5.4.2. Staphylococcus aureus [88](#B88-vaccines-11-00333)]. V710, a vaccine containing the S. aureus iron surface determinant B, which showed protection in rhesus macaques and murine models of sepsis [ [89](#B89-vaccines-11-00333)], was tested in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery to evaluate the prevention of postoperative S. aureus infection. The outcome of this study revealed that the V710 vaccine did not prevent postoperative S. aureus infections compared to the placebo [ [90](#B90-vaccines-11-00333)]. 6. Next Generation Vaccines [91](#B91-vaccines-11-00333), [92](#B92-vaccines-11-00333), [93](#B93-vaccines-11-00333), [94](#B94-vaccines-11-00333), [95](#B95-vaccines-11-00333)]. The great advancement in the fields of genomics, bioinformatics, structural biology, and immunology offered new tools to improve the efficacy of new vaccine formulations against the AMR. These promising strategies include bioconjugation, reverse vaccinology, and novel adjuvants. Bioconjugation represents a novel technology in the field of immunology that permits the generation of conjugate vaccines in a biological environment, often represented by bacteria, thus preserving the native immunogenic structures. Bioconjugates are molecules composed of carrier proteins covalently linked to polysaccharide chains to elicit a strong immune response. This mechanism frequently occurs in vivo in E. coli, where the specific enzyme PglB permits the link between the glycan and specific moieties of the proteins. This strategy, which is advantageous in terms of rapidity, reproducibility, and costs, has been mostly used to generate potential vaccines directly against Gram-negative pathogens, including Shigella [ [96](#B96-vaccines-11-00333)] and K. pneumoniae [ [97](#B97-vaccines-11-00333)]. The concept behind reverse vaccinology is to find exposed surface proteins with a pathogenic role that can stimulate the immune system. The identification of such proteins occurs by whole genome sequencing approaches rather than searching from microbe cultures [ [98](#B98-vaccines-11-00333)]. Once the pathogen sequence is identified, the revealed proteins can be analyzed by using bioinformatic tools focusing on those ones predicted to be exposed on the surface. These proteins are thus transformed in bacteria, such as E. coli, which are purified and tested as potential candidate vaccines [ [99](#B99-vaccines-11-00333)]. This strategy has been used to develop successfully meningococcus B [ [98](#B98-vaccines-11-00333)], E. coli [ [100](#B100-vaccines-11-00333)], and, more recently, P. aeruginosa vaccines [ [87](#B87-vaccines-11-00333)]. The adjuvants are known to be crucial for sharpening the immune response induced by vaccines. Nonetheless, many adjuvants contained in vaccines have issues related to stability, tolerability, safety, or lack of efficacy. The development of novel adjuvants relies on new formulations based on micro- and nanoparticulate platforms, such as liposomes, aluminum salts, and emulsions. AS01 is a liposome formulation that showed strong efficacy with an improved T helper cell-mediated response and humoral immunity in mice as well as humans. Indeed, this adjuvant has recently been licensed for a vaccine against malaria [ [101](#B101-vaccines-11-00333)] as well as to treat Herpes Zoster [ QS21 as AS01, act synergically as immunostimulatory molecules to elicit a strong immune response. 7.
