Overarching Goal The overall goal of this review is to examine the contribution of good governance and innovative financing mechanism to scaling up the production of health workers in Africa, with a particular emphasis on the role of the private and non governmental institutions. The study will complement other ongoing work on scaling up the production of health workers by filling important gaps in the knowledge and clarify the potential contribution that could be made if government improved their engagement through private and nongovernmental institutions: 2. Specific Objectives The specific objectives of the study are to review: experiences on the ground in engaging private training institutions to contribute to scaling up the production of health workers needed to meet health challenges in the selected countries. governance and professional oversight arrangements used for private and non governmental institutions engaged in the production of health workers; new and innovative funding mechanisms that could be used to complement existing scarce public resources (financing of operating costs and capital investment); sustainable business models that could be used to scaled up production of health workers in the private sector; and equity and poverty implication of a shift to greater engagement with private sector institutions in the production of health workers. 3. Motivation Significant efforts have been made during recent years to better understand the role that the humanresources crisis plays in preventing access to health related goods and services, and health outcomes, in the Africa region. Numerous donor-led initiatives have already reviewed the origins of the problem and made recommendations on possible solutions. This includes: (a) the Rockefeller Foundation support for the Joint Learning Initiative; (b) the WHO Annual Report on Human Resources; (c) Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA) work under the Global Taskforce for Scaling up the Education of Health Workers; (d) USAID Capacity Project; and (e) follow up work undertaken by the World Bank, WHO and many other development partners. A noteworthy observation is that it has been difficult to translate the recommendations from global initiatives into local action on the ground. Even when there is strong agreement on the underlying problem and policy option for reform among government policymakers, training institutions, development partners and donors, of this is not translated into a clear strategy for reform, implementation plan, funding stream and action plan on the ground in terms. Current arrangements for the governance and oversight of the production of health workers is fragments and poorly coordinated between the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and other groups. There is an urgent need to increase public commitment and funding for this agenda. But new and innovative financing mechanisms are urgently needed because public funding, even under optimistic conditions will not be enough. The private and nongovernmental sectors already contribute to this agenda but there is a lack of knowledge about the current role they play and viable business models of private and nongovernmental training institutions. The application of recent innovative financing mechanisms in both the health and education sector are not well understood in relation to financing the education of health workers, especially in the case of private and nongovernmental institutions. And the impact of different arrangement for training health workers on equity and the poor is not well knows. 4. Background of Study World Bank Group Work on HRH With support from the Norwegian Government the World Bank has recently undertaken a series of country level assessment to better understand the current status of efforts to scale up the education of health workers and futUre challenges. This included development of a survey instrument, costing tool and market analysis. Country assessments of the challenges faced in scaling up education of health workers are currently being undertaken in Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Zambia. A second phase of work is planned to complete this initial work and extend it to Kenya, Nigeria Tanzania and Uganda. These country assessments include a broad review of health training institutions. Broader country assessments of the private health sector are also currently being undertaken in Ghana, Kenya and Mali under the Health in Africa (HiA) Initiative, with a second phase of broad private health sector assessments being planned for countries such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda. Work on innovative financing mechanisms in health care have been undertaken by several recent initiatives, including the Global Taskforce on Innovative Financing (Brown\u00ad Zoellick) and will be the focus of the 2010 World Health Report. Likewise the education sector has recently undertaken a review of innovative financing mechanisms for higher education. The lessons learned from these initiatives have not been applied to the financing of health training institutions. Recent country assessments of health training institutions in Africa have indicated that there is: Recent reviews of the issues and policy framework for scaling up education of health workers has often not been translated into action on the ground in terms of country level policy engagement or support by the international donor community for a credible investment program. Splintered oversight responsibility and weak stewardship by the MOH and Ministry of Education (MOE) over pre-service education associated with a significant misalignment between the country's human resources policy and the production of health workers through its training institutions. There is no coherent policy framework for the training of health workers across the two ministries and significant variations in knowledge and standards across the sector in terms the policy directions, governance, management, curriculum contents, the teaching environment (teaching material, infrastructure, lab requirements, and curriculum contents), funding and expenditure trends. There is no national strategy or implementation plan for reform. The MOE and MOH track data on enrollment, graduation, costs, quality or other important information separately and using different methods. There is no comprehensive database on the education of health workers (public, private and nongovernmental) that can be used by policymakers to take informed decisions. Recent pressures to scale up the intake and production without parallel increases in funding (recurrent and capital), shortages in the teaching staff and lack of adequate pedagogical material (text books, internet access and other electronic material), equipment in the teaching laboratories, and utilities (electricity, running water and air conditioning) has pushed many schools to the limit in terms of their ability to produce more graduates; In niost existing schools, the capital investment to recurrent spending ratio is significantly below international standards, especially in the MOE where the ratio is sometimes as low as 1.2 percent ( 6 percent being the norm); and Many schools are not using scarce resources in an efficient way in terms of staff deployment, modem pedagogical approaches and use of essential infrastructure and utilities. Links to Health in Africa Initiative This thematic study on financing and private investment in scaling up education of health workers intersects closely with previous and ongoing work under the IFC-World Bank Health in Africa (HiA) initiative. The study will build on the Business of Health in Africa Report, which highlighted human resources as one of the key constraints facing the development of an effective private health sector. The study will both integrate findings and data from other pieces of work, as well as contribute new outputs which can be integrated into the Health in Africa program, as shown in the diagram below: This study on financing and investment in the education of health workers forms one piece of a broader research agenda, which will cover a range of key topics in HRH, all of which will contribute to a more holistic view of the key issues affecting the HRH system in Africa, including on how the opportunities presented can be better leveraged and have an impact at the country level (see Figure 1).

Scope of Work Five topics will be explored in greater details over the next 6 to 8 months: (c) governance arrangements for more effective government engagement of private education institutions; (b) financing mechanisms (recurrent and capital); and (c) successful business models for private sector involvement in the education of health workers; (d) impact of different organizational modalities on equity in access to health services or inclusion of minority or disadvantaged groups in the workforce; and (e) a detailed review of a few success cases that could be used as a model for reform in other countries. a. Governance Arrangements for more Effective Engagement of Private Education Institutions Core Team: April Harding, Alexander Preker, (WHO Geneva), JeffMoe, Caroline Hope Griffith (GHWA and Duke University), This study will examine issues behind the current splintered oversight responsibility, governance and stewardship over pre-service education and possible solutions that would involve greater participation by the private sector. The objective of the study would be: Evaluate the structure and impact of existing stewardship, governance and management arrangements structures for the provision of different levels of medical education, both in the public and private sector, across a selection of African countries Identify success factors, key constraints, and provide recommendations, including organizational improvements and policy change, for improvement. b. Innovative Financing Mechanisms Core Team: Alexander Preker, Eric L. Richard Scheffler (Berkeley), This study would focus on the issue of financing mechanisms for medical education institutions (recurrent and capital), looking at both educational institutions and student financing (e.g. student loans) and drawing on recent innovations in public and private financing of both the health education and higher education sectors. Both public and private financing mechanisms would be considered, as well as innovative mixes of the two such as public private partnerships (PPPs). The objective of the study would be to: Evaluate current public and private financing mechanisms for public and private medical education training institutions and students across a range of African countries, Highlight key gaps and shortcomings in existing financing mechanisms and recommend opportunities for improvements to existing arrangements as well as new innovative financing mechanisms, and Provide detailed recommendations on the pre-requisites, including any policy changes, required to make the proposed improvements and innovative financing mechanisms a success. c. Successful Private Sector Business Models Proposed Team: Scott Featherston, (Fordam Business School) and Henry Mintzberg (McGill Business School) This study would explore the role of the private sector in contributing to solutions in scaling up the production of health workers in the Africa region. The objective of the study would be to: Generate new evidence and data on the role of the private sector in medical education, focusing on strengths and opportunities that it offers to address the key components of the crisis (successful business models), but also acknowledging the constraints and weaknesses of the private sector. Develop recommendations and highlight opportunities for investment and policy change which will result in better leveraging the private sector in alleviating the human resources crisis Based on a preliminary concept note, this study would address the following questions: Figure 3.

Impact of Different Choices on the Equity and Poverty Objectives Proposed Team: Jamil Salmi, Harry Burnett (R4D) This study will examine the impact of different combinations of public and private engagement in the production of health workers on equity and access to health services by the poor. The specific objective of the study would be to: Explore both successes and failures of private health education institutions in contributing to overall equity and poverty objectives. Develop recommendations and highlight opportunities for orienting private health training institutions more towards equity and poverty goals in the health sector. e. Illustrative Case Studies Core Team: Marko studywill examine experience on the ground in the above topical areas, through a series of country case studies. Initial proposed countries include: Africa: Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Mozambique, Kenya, Uganda South and East Asia: India, Philippines 6. Methodology The review will use a combination of cross sectional and longitudinal analysis to explore the business case within different health care sub-sectors. The analysis will build upon, not repeat, ongoing work on scaling up the education of health workers, including various private sector business models, financing mechanisms and governance arrangements. The following summarizes some of the methodological issues to be addressed under each of the three reviews described above. a. Governance Arrangements and Impact of Policies/Regulations This part of the review will look at government oversight and engagement with private training institutions. The policies and regulations that directly affect specific sub-industries will be identified. The firm's level of compliance and the costs associated with compliance will be surveyed. This sub-industry focus will provide an opportunity to identify where governments have productively engaged the private sector and therefore provided a favorable environment for accessing capital to make capital expenditures or provided a steady revenue stream through encouraging public-private linkages. b. Financial characteristics i. Asset requirements The specific asset requirements of different health training institutions will be examined. Different types of institutions may have common asset requirements and characteristics such as Scholl size, labor specialization, minimum scale, etc. ii. Recurrent expenditures Associated with the capital investment requirements are the recurrent expenditures such as labor costs, maintenance, capital costs, depreciation etc. which may vary by type of school (or accounting standard). iii. Revenues requirement and returns Where possible, characteristics of the revenues (sources, sustainability, dependence on macroeconomic environment) -clients such as public sector, charitable organizations, mechanisms for special contracting or socio-economic characteristics of students will be identified. iv. Financing instruments and capital structure decisions A review will be conducted of the demand for capital financing by examining current capital structure decisions of different types of schools. A survey will be conducted of the use of capital financing options for to see if there are any broad consistencies in capital financing decisions across types of training institutions, countries or other characteristics. This topology will be used to determine how schools respond to the different factors (institutional, policy, etc.) that influence the costs of capital and the resultant capital structures of health training institutions. This review will examine debt/equity considerations of both public and private investors who focus on private health education institutions. c. Firm characteristics i. Business models Survey data will be collected on firms' characteristics and investors who focus on the health education institutions will be undertaken. At a minimum, the data will include information about the core business, its size, its financial characteristics (profitability), its consumer base, its prospects for growth, and its compliance with quality and regulatory standards will be collected. The survey data will be analyzed to identify commonalities and differences in firm characteristics of different training institutions. This will be able to inform investors of the financial requirements (capital, time, etc) that are needed for investing in the training institutions. In addition, a best practices and common pitfalls of running a health training institutions will be identified. 11. Business risks \u00b7Common risks to health training institutions will be identified and separated from country-specific and general investment climate risks. Examples could include risks due to student population, exposure to government financing and changes in labor market characteristics. d. Equity and poverty implications 7. Audience Micro Household survey data will be used to assess the degree to which there is a connection between private training institutions and outreach to the poor once the graduates enter the health labor market The target audience of the studies is expected to span private sector investors, policy makers and donors. 8. Outputs The initial outputs from the proposed work would be four analytical studies, several country case studies and two stakeholder meetings. All studies will be charged with developing a strong set of recommendations and next steps/actions. Three key meetings will be convened to support preparation of the studies as follows: October 2009: Expert Meeting (Washington DC) The scientific expert meeting would launch expert discussion on the key focus topics for the studies and guide the subsequent analytical work. (Participation: 20-30 experts, organized in expert working groups on the 3 study topics) April2009: Education Conference of the IFC CHE Department Preliminary results from the review would be presented at a side meeting during the biennial Education Conference of the IFC CHE Department June 2009: Regional Conference (Africa) The objective of the conference would be to: Bring together policy makers and medical education providers from Africa to discuss key opportunities and challenges in medical education, and share in-country lessons learned \u00b7 Disseminate findings of analytical studies on the key topics Define desired future directions and identify assistance which may be required Define future follow up analytical agenda 9.

Preker, Marko Vujicic, Yohana Nicolas Materu Abstract: This report reviews the economics of scaling up education for health workers in the context of the Africa region. It provides an assessment of the likely resource envelope that might be available to the health and education sectors by 20 15 using different assumptions about economic growth, political commitment to spending on, health care, and institutional development; an estimate of the number of additional staff that could be hired by countries under the different resource envelope scenarios; and an estimate of the costs of scaling up the education of health workers in terms of recurrent and capital costs. All estimates were done on a country-by-country basis. Regional estimates are based on the sum of this detailed country level analysis. Scaling up health education has significant implications for both the health and education sectors. The cost of employing new staff falls on the health sector while the cost of educating health workers falls mainly on the education sector. Projecting economic trends based on the past ten years would allow countries in the Africa region to absorb around 648,000 new staff by the year 2015. If, however, there were a skills mix shift to more highly skilled workers the absorptive capacity would be reduced to about 412,000 additional workers; while a skills mix shift to lower skilled workers would increase the absorptive capacity to about 959,000 new workers. A wage increase of about 25 percent over time would partially offset this increase in staffing. Under a best case scenario and skill mix shift toward high skills, a number of countries could reach the WHO target of 2.5 health workers per 1,000 populations. Most countries, however, are not likely to enjoy the sustained growth, commitment to increasing public spending on the health sector or mobilization of additional resources through health insurance that are needed to achieve this target. In many countries, the binding constraint to scaling up health education is not only the limited absorptive capacity of the health sector to hire the resulting staff but the limited resources in the education sector to train the additional staff and make the needed capital investments to increase the capacity and throughput of training institutions. In a number of countries, the cost of educating the addition health workforce would outstrip the annual higher education budgets of the Ministries of Education. Furthermore, many countries trying to scale up health education also need to consider parallel measures to ensure that the secondary education system is producing a sufficient supply of graduates to feed a scaling up of health education. Although additional donor aid to both the health and education sectors is a possible solution, it is worth noting that the expenditure analysis used under the various scenarios already included current and projected levels of donor assistance. The analysis showed that increasing donor assistance by 100 percent improves the situation but still does not allow the region to attain the one million additional health workers under a projection of past trends scenario. There is considerable scope, however, for better earmarking of some ODA to scale up health education, especially in the case of some of the larger international funds devoted to addressing major public health priorities.

It provides an assessment of the likely resource envelope that might be available to the health and education sectors by 2015 using different assumptions about political commitment to economic growth, spending on health care, and institutional development; an estimate of the number of additional staff that could be hired by countries under the different resource envelope scenarios; and an estimate of the cost of scaling up the education of health workers in terms of recurrent and capital costs. All estimates were done on a country-by-country basis. Regional estimates are based on the sum of this detailed country level analysis. Scaling up health education has significant implications for both of the health and education sectors. The cost of employing new staff falls on the health sector while the cost of educating health workers falls mainly on the education sector. In this report, we will look at four important and interlinked issues. Where could additional money come from and how much would be expected? How much does it cost to train more health workers? Is it possible to get better value for money? What would be the contribution to overall growth and development? Where Would Additional Money Come From and How Much Could be Expected? The total resource envelope that can be used to train and hire health workers in the future can come from both domestic and foreign sources. The domestic sources of funding that can be used to train and pay for the salaries of health workers depends on several factors: Overall level of GDP Share ofGDP channeled through the public sector (central and local governments) o Share of public sector resources allocated to health care Share of health expenditure in public sector used to pay for health workers and to train them Share ofGDP channeled through the private sector (directly used by households) o Household spending of health care Share of private expenditure on health care devoted to health workers Shifts in any one of these variables affect the resource envelope available to pay for health workers. In practice, the range of freedom to make such changes is significantly reduced and often not directly affected by public policy. In the Africa region, three policy trends predominate: All countries in the Africa region are striving to achieve economic growth. All countries in the Africa region have made a commitment to increasing public spending on health up to 15 percent of total government expenditure (Abuja Target for health care spending). Many countries are trying to introduce health insurance as an attempt to channel some out-of\u00ad pocket household spending and some public subsidies through risk sharing mechanisms such as health insurance. Other factors that need to be considered include efficiency and effectiveness in the deployment of human resources in the health sector (including geographic distribution), productivity, and public/private mix. Table 1 provides an illustration of the impact on the total resource envelope that can be used to train and hire health workers through changes in three factors: GDP growth rates, percent of government spending on health care, and the introduction of health insurance (insurance effect). vii T bl 1 H lth E a e : ea xpen d't 1 ure s cenar10s Scenario Annual Economic Public Health Expenditures as Insurance Effect (as % of Growth(%) % of Gov. Expenditures by Out-of-Pocket Spending) 2015 (%) Worst Case -5 -5% change 0 Intermediate 1 -5 15 0 Intermediate 2 5 -5% change 30 Best Case 5 15 60 Projection of 10 past years Average growth Average HE from 1996-2005 0 Trend from 1996-2005 The best case scenario in terms of the total resource envelope available for hiring staff would occur if there were a steady GDP growth rate of five percent, an increase in political commitment to government spending on health care so that total public spending reaches the 15 percent Abuja target and a 25 percent insurance effect from channeling 60 percent of out-of-pocket expenditures through health insurance rather than direct payments to providers. The worst case scenario would occur if GDP dropped by five percent annually, political commitment eroded so that public spending on health dropped by five percentage points in absolute terms and there was no insurance effect. The two intermediate scenarios allow offsetting achievements under growth and government commitment (i.e. improvements in government spending but economic recession or economic growth with lack of political commitment). Finally the linear projection of past trends makes a forecast based on past performance in the variables examined. The implications in terms of the total resource envelope available to the health sector are major. If all the countries in the Africa region were to achieve the best case scenarios, health care resources would double between now and 2015 (see Table 2 below). A worst case scenario reflecting a slowdown in economic growth and lack of political commitment could lead to a 50 percent drop in overall resources, indicating the importance of these variables. Even significant changes in aid flows do not have nearly as big an impact on the future resource envelope available to the health sector. T bl 2E a e d't T d . Af .

For example, in 2005 Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mozambique had economic rates of growth that surpassed the 5 percent target. And spending on health care exceeded 15 percent of government revenues in Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Liberia and Malawi. Others are however progressing more slowly. For example, only 6 countries have exceeded the 5 percent growth target from 2000-2005. GDP in the majority of countries is 1 Total Population for 2005 was estimated at 736 million and the projection for 2015 is 912 million. viii growing but at a slower pace than the desired 5 percent and about a dozen countries have recently experienced negative growth. Likewise, since the Heads of State made a political commitment to spend 15 percent of government resources on the health sector, about 50 percent of the countries in the region have been moving towards that target while the rest have experienced erosion in political commitment to public spending on health care. Many of the countries that are performing well in this respect have enjoyed political and social stability. Those that have gone through social turmoil and civil war are among the poor performers. Finally only a few countries have so far succeeded in introducing health insurance. Among those that have pursued this path such as Ghana and Rwanda there is an increase in financial resources to the health sector from those sources. Other factors that would also have an impact on the total domestic resource envelop available to training and hiring health workers include: (a) the share of GDP channeled through the public sector (central and local governments), (b) the share of health expenditure used to pay for health workers; and (c) flow of funds through the private sector. Changing these factors often depends on a complex arbitrage among strongly vested stakeholders with competing economic motives. Since there are no clear-cut regional trends in this respect, these variables were held constant for the purpose of the above illustration. They should be included in detailed follow-up studies because they could have a major impact on the country level resource envelope made available to scaling up the education of health workers. The role of the IMP, the World Bank, and regional Banks in contributing to or constraining the overall resource envelope available to the health and other parts of the social sectors has been the topic of intense debate since the structural adjustment era of the 1980s. Today, achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a central mission ofthe Bank and many of the other International Finance Institutions (IFis). All are firmly committed to ensuring that fiscal policies contribute to both growth and povero; alleviation. Although, these policies are usually consistent with the reality on the ground, the health and other social sectors comprise a large and increasing share of the public budget. They are therefore particularly vulnerable to changes in fiscal policy. Given the importance of overall economic growth to the total resource envelope available to the health sector, any sectoral policy that increases the size of the labor force or the wage bill in the public sector must be closely coordinated to ensure that they are consistent with the overall fiscal policy. Uncontrolled public spending that might lead to inflation or a slowdown in economic growth would have a serious negative impact on the overall future resource envelope available to the health sector and more specifically the health labor force. Policy makers therefore must be careful that short-term policy objectives do not hurt medium- to long-term development objectives. How Much Does it Cost to Train More Health Workers? In estimating the cost of scaling up the education of health workers, the . factors that must be considered are the following: (a) the recurrent operating cost of training a higher number of students; (b) the number of students to be trained; (c) the associated investment cost of strengthening the capacity of the existing education system to scale up the production of health care workers; and (d) the cost of absorbing the additional graduates into the workforce once they complete their training program. The total cost of scaling up the education of health workers can be broken down into two major categories, each of which depends on several major factors: Total Recurrent Operating Costs o Average cost of training existing students; o Marginal cost of training additional students; o Total number of students to be trained IX The Capital Cost o Initial investment cost; o Depreciation over time; and o Cost of upgrading the existing capital stock over time Training Costs Estimates of the recurrent operating cost for educating health workers are complicated by several factors. Fixed overhead and other operating costs are shared with the institutions that provide tertiary education during the pre-clinical phase of the training. And they are shared with health care service delivery institutions during the in-service phase of their training. The resulting costs are spread across the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health, with additional support from NGOs and the private sector (see Table 3 below). Table 3 Education Sector Health Sector . Pre-service training. . In-service training . . Shared infrastructure and staff with tertiary . Shared infrastructure and staff with education institutions. hospitals and clinics. For example, students who are in the pre-clinical stage of their medical education may benefit indirectly from subsidies received from the ministry of education which allows the training institutions to lower their tuition and fees. The latter are therefore not a good indicator of the cost of this stage of their education. Following their pre-clinical education, the students continue to receive under-graduate clinical and post-graduate in-service training in a teaching hospital that receives funding from the ministry of education for providing training and the ministry of health for providing care. Where possible, detailed country level analysis was used to estimate the costs of scaling up the education of health workers. Such analysis indicates that the unit cost for training each type of health worker varies greatly from country to country and there are major differences between the cost of training health workers\u00b7 in developed and low income countries (see table 4 below). Table 4 Annual costs of training a doctor based on country level analysis (USD) US/UK US$70,000 to 100,000 Ghana US$8,000 to 12,000 These variations are often due to differences in the methodology of the estimation rather than true differences in the cost structure of the training program. Some of the key factors that need to be considered in the future to standardize such work are summarized in the following table (see Table 5). X T bl 5 a e : Recurrent an dC .

It has been observed that there is an inverse non-linear relationship between GDP per capita and public expenditures on tertiary education across all countries and within the Africa region, ranging from 0.4 to 12.1 times GDP per capita. This may be an indicator of the variable quality, inefficiency of tertiary education at lower income levels, fixed overhead and economies with increasing numbers of students. Analysis of existing training programs indicates that average annual costs of training a doctor is about 5 times the costs of a tertiary level student. The average annual costs of a nurse were about 2 times the costs of a tertiary level student. The expenditures on health professional, general tertiary and other non-tertiary education for 2015 were forecasted by applying the GDP growth rates used in the corresponding resource envelope scenarios. It was assumed that the existing political commitment to education, represented by the portion of GDP spent on education would remain the same. For countries that had a medical school but did not have medical training cost data, these multiples were applit:~d to estimate the costs of training a doctor and a nurse. The annual costs of training a community health worker was assumed to cost the same as a tertiary level student. For countries that did not have a medical school, it is assumed that the countries would have to send their students abroad to study. These countries without medical schools faced the costs of sending their students to a country within the same language cluster. For example, Anglophone African countries without a medical school were assumed to train their medical workers in South Africa (see Table 6 below). Table 6 Language Costs Applied (USD) Trainine: Countrv Anglophone 14,100 South Africa Francophone 10,700 Senegal Lusophone 8,500 Mozambique A combination of these methods was used to undertake a bottom up estimate of the overall training cost for the region. Number of Workers that could be Trained at Current Cost Structure with Additional Money xi Setting targets for the number of students that should be trained in a given country requires complex trade offs-between normative targets, expressed needs, competing priorities, and economic affordability. Factors that have to be considered include productivity, equity and efficiency (wage levels, skills mix, deployment and quality of care). Such analysis was beyond the scope of the analysis undertaken for this report. Instead, for illustrative purposes\u00b7 examples are given based on the existing wage bill and a rigid labour market cost structure (i.e. assuming that the ratio of the wage bill to total health care costs remain fixed). Allowances were made for population growth which would affect per capita ratios over time. Using this approach, the various economic scenarios can be translated into incremental staffing levels under each of the six major economic scenarios described in Section A and corresponding training cost for each country in the Africa region. T bl 7 P . a e ro1_ecte d S ffi L I . erent Resource Enve ope L eves Total Staff (millions) Additional Staff (millions) Baseline 2015 1.6 0 Worst Case 0.8 -0.8 Intermediate 1 1.2 -0.4 Intermediate 2 2.3 0.7 Best Case 3.3 1.7 Projection of past trends 2.2 0.6 Assumptions: Fixed labour cost ratio, no wag_e change and no skill mix shift Changes in labour cost ratio to total health expenditure, salary levels and skill mix would have a significant impact on the total staffing levels and additional staff under each ofthe six scenarios. Increase in the cost structure within the health sector, with a greater share of the total health expenditure allocated to the wage bill, means thatmore resources would be spent on labour costs. Wage increases and shifts to a higher skill mix (more expensive workers) would reduce the number of health workers that could be hired with the additional resources. The opposite would be true if real wages were to decrease over time and there was a shift to lower skill mix (less expensive workers). Precise estimates were not made of these tradeoffs. Total Operating Cost of Training Table 8 provides an illustration of scaling up the education of health workers to the level which would be affordable under different future resource envelopes described in section A. These estimates are derived by multiplying different scenarios of the future number of staff by the estimated unit cost of additional health workers to the workforce. Once again, these estimates are based on an assumption of a fixed labor cost ratio of total health expenditure, no wage change and no skill mix shift. Costs to increase productivity, equity and efficiency (skills mix, deployment and quality of care) factors were not included in the estimates. Such changes could have a significant impact on the estimated cost of scaling up education. Xll T bl 8 T t IT . .

The brain drain rate of graduates of the health profession in Africa is 28 percent for high skill workers such as doctors and pharmacists and 11 percent for nurses and public health workers. Most countries therefore have to train a significantly higher number of students than the end target for scaling up health education. As seen earlier, only the best case scenario would allow the health sector to meet the one million additional health care worker target set by the WHO for the Africa region. It is notable that in this case, the cost of scaling up the education of health workers would consume more than 50 percent of public expenditures on tertiary education. Investment Costs Scaling up health education also has significant implications in terms of the costs of strengthening existing education facilities and building new ones. Although information on investment costs are not readily available, recent pre-investment studies in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria and Rwanda indicate that the cost could easily range from US$1 0 to US$50 million, and in some large countries such as Nigeria be even higher than that. Costs vary depending on the state of existing infrastructure and staffing levels, the number of schools and the desired capacity of the training program. In post-conflict countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone there is a need to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure. This requires a significant investment even when the population size is relatively small. In more stable but larger countries like Ghana or larger federalist states like Nigeria, the needed investment costs may be much greater. Proper analyses of investment costs would be country-specific and not only examine costs of infrastructure development or rehabilitation but also the review the necessary investment to meet minimum standards of quality and efficiency for the education provided. Most major capital investments will lead to associated increases in recurrent costs. Is it Possible to Get Better Value for Money? This section will look at possible ways to get better value for money both in mobilizing additional resources and investing in the education of health workers so that the precious additional money devoted to scaling up the education of health workers will be well spent. At the international level, there has been a significant increase in aid flow to the health sector. This has already benefited many priority vertical programs that were previously neglected. Unfortunately, these programs are now at risk of failing and huge sums of money are at risk of being wasted because of the human resources constraints. xiii Two negative effects are at the root of this problem. First, although many of the vertically funded programs devote significant resources to short-term training of human resources and other capacity building activities, few support the basic education of health workers. At the same time they compete for funding with such basic education. A continuation of this trend will damage the priority programs that the international community has put so much emphasis on during recent years. Second, due to an ability and willingness to pay significantly higher salaries, these programs have caused a wage inflation and competition for staff that is damaging the ability of other core programs such as maternal and child health programs. M~ny of the later programs now face a severe shortage in staff because of the distortion caused buy a disproportionate amount of donor money flowing into a few programs. At the national level, the systems for educating health workers are often plagued with significant inefficiency. There is considerable scope for improving the unit cost of training by some of the following actions: Reducing the drop out rate of students Reducing the rate of brain drain Greater collaboration among schools and countries Sharing of staff and teaching facilities across different schools and among countries Sharing some of the cost and delivery of pre-clinical training with the basic science programs of associated universities Adaptation of the teaching curriculum to the appropriate skills level needed by individual countries. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The following are the main conclusions from this review: Scaling up health education has major implications for financial sustainability in both the health and education sector; The resource envelope available to scale up human resources is a major binding constraint that needs to be considered on a country by country basis; Significant donor funding will be needed to address the identified funding gap in reaching normative targets in scaling up the education for health workers; and Individual countries need to make institutional reforms in the education system a major priority in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the deployment of human resources, productivity, and public/private mix. Countries trying to scale up health education may also want to consider parallel measures to improve the earmarking of some ODA for this purpose, especially in the case of some of the larger international funds devoted to addressing major public health priorities. An effort is needed in many countries to ensure that the secondary education system is producing a sufficient supply of graduates to feed a scaling up of health education. RECOMMENDATIONS Detailed country level analysis is needed before specific recommendation can be made on the best policies for scaling up the education of health workers in specific countries. xiv Different countries have different circumstances with, for example, different levels of growth and different dependencies on aid. Moreover, it is the priority which countries give to tackling the health worker crisis and the decisions countries themselves make which will be crucial. Individual countries will make their own decisions on the difficult trade-offs they believe are appropriate to determine how many workers of what type they will support -and on what they agree are the priorities for aid expenditures with their development partners and the IFis. For example, on the revenue side, many countries are currently not on track in progressing towards the best case scenario in terms of the overall expenditure envelope due to weak growth, lack of political commitment and the significant out of pocket share of total health expenditures. Strong macro economic policies coupled with political stability and strong trade policies are among the most important factors that would lead to improved growth in the countries that currently lag in this area. The associated economic growth would also allow those countries to \u00b7meet past political commitments to increase public expenditure on health care. In countries that currently have a weak taxation capacity, finding other mechanisms for mobilizing resources could also be considered. The populations in many counties have a much greater willingness and ability to pay for health care than what governments have been able to mobilize through formal taxation instruments. Channeling some of these resources through a pre-paid risk pooling arrangement or health insurance program would be another way to mobilize more resources. In countries that are spending a very low share of health expenditures on the wage bill compared with total health expenditure, some shift in the relative allocation of human resources could also be considered. But institutional rigidity often makes such shifts difficult. Donor funding could be increased but as seen in section A, very significant increases in donor funding would be needed to address the current funding gap and even then would not have as great an impact as strong economic growth, public commitment to spending on health and a strong insurance effect of channeling out of pocket expenditure through a pre payment or insurance mechanism. On the expenditure, addressing some of the inefficiencies in the education of health care workers described in this report should be a major priority. This would include a significant drop in the drop out rate of students and decrease in brain drain. Much greater efforts should also be made to increase coordination among countries and among health education programs to achieve efficiency in the education of health workers (such as shared faculty and facilities among programs and some integration in the pre-clinical training between health education programs and general science training at the undergraduate university level); Donor agencies should coordinate their activities in a better way to avoid labour market distortions arising out of differential pay for staff working on some of the priority vertical programs. Some funds from these programs should be earmarked for general support in scaling up the education of health workers at the country level.

The research for this report was carried out to improve understanding of the economic implications of scaling up human resources in the health sector. The findings from the report will be presented at the Fourth Taskforce Meeting in Kampala, Uganda, Oct 11-12, 2007. KEY ISSUES While shouldering more than 24 percent of the global burden of disease, the Africa region receives less than one percent of global health spending and has less than three percent of total health workers (see Figure 1). Similarly, the lower the density of health workers the higher the mortality rates (see Figure 2). Recent research has shown that strong links exist between income levels, health spending, number of health workers and health outcomes.

LOW~-------------------------------------------------, LO'W Density of health workers Hlgll Source: WHO 2006 Report, Working Together for Health The Joint Learning Initiative commission (JLI) suggested that on average, countries with less than 2.5 health care professionals (counting only doctors, nurses and midwives) per 1,000 population will fail to achieve a minimum of eighty percent coverage rate for deliveries by skilled birth attendants and measles immunization. At the time the report was issued, there were 57 countries that fell below this threshold; 36 of 17 these were in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region (see Figure 3 for the health worker density). Although there has been a global increase in health workers (physicians, nurses and midwives), as reported in 2006, Sub-Saharan Africa is still lagging behind all other regions, with a density of 1.3 health workers per 1,000 population.

Securing an adequate level of training and skill mix is also important (Jishnu and Gertler 2007). Increasing the availability of the medical care is not enough. There is also a need to increase the skills of health workers so that the provide quality care Figure 4: Regional disparities in medical schools and graduates Ez.tin\"''.abed gracluat:es 200 s.oo 400 Based on this and other analysis, WHO estimates that Africa has a shortage of 817,992 doctors, nurses and midwives which are needed to meet the critical minimum threshold of2.5 health care professionals per 1000 population. 18 OBJECTIVES The specific objectives of the review are to: Estimate the resource envelope that could be made available to the health and education sectors over the next few years in different countries in the Africa region under different assumptions about economic growth, public and private spending and donor assistance. Estimate the number of additional staff that could be hired by different countries using the resulting resource envelope under different assumptions about total number of staff, skills mix and wage structure of the workforce. Estimate the cost of scaling up education in different countries based on the above in terms of: (a) the additional capital investment needed to strengthen the training institutions to handle the increased student volume; and (b) the additional expenditures needed to run the expanded capacity of the health education system. The overall goal of the review is to contribute to an understanding of the underlying economics of scaling up health education in the Africa region, and to shed light on both opportunities and financial constraints that countries will face in pursuing such a policy agenda. Much more detailed country-level analysis is needed before the conclusions from this study can be used to inform and guide the policy dialogue on scaling up health education at the country level. In the future, there is a need to improve the data and deepen the analysis used for this review. METHODOLOGY The review used a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis to explore the various dimensions of the economics of scaling up health education in the Africa region. Regional spending and trends were derived by aggregating country level estimates. Several economic models were built and tested based on available data on the countries' macro\u00ad economic contexts, sources of financing for the health sector, health expenditure trends, cost of both health education and higher education, and evidence on investment cost of health and higher education today. The analysis built upon ongoing work in the areas of: (a) fiscal space and public expenditure reviews; (b) national health accounts and marginal budgeting for bottlenecks; (c) financing and expenditure analysis in higher education; and (d) selected country level reviews on the cost of investing in health education and financing such education. ESTIMATING THE RESOURCE ENVELOPE A critical constraint to scaling up human resources in the health sector is the funding envelope available to: (a) employ staff once they have been trained (the cost ofwhich falls mainly on the health sector); and (b) educate the staff (both cost of health education and cost of expanding training capacity). This section describes an approach for estimating this resource envelope and projecting future scenarios for 2015 in the Africa region. Regional estimates are based on the aggregates of country level analysis. 19 Main Variables The total resource envelope that can be used to pay for staff depends on several factors: Overall level of GDP Share of GDP channeled through the public sector o Share of public sector resources allocated to health care Share of health expenditure in public sector used to pay for health workers Share of GDP channeled directly through households o Household spending of health care Share of private expenditure on health care devoted to health workers \u00b7 In theory, shifts in any of these variables will affect the total resource envelope available to pay for health workers. In practice, the range of freedom to make changes is significantly reduced and often not directly affected by public policy. In the Africa region, three trends predominate: All countries are striving to achieve economic growth All have made a commitment to spending 15 percent of total government budgets on health care (Ahuja Target for health care spending). Many countries are trying to introduce health insurance as an attempt to channel some out-of\u00ad pocket household spending and some public subsidies through risk sharing mechanisms such as health insurance, health maintenance organizations and other pre-payment schemes. For these reasons, the three main variables that were modeled under different scenarios include GDP growth, percent of government spending on health care, and the additional resource mobilized through the introduction of health insurance (insurance effect). Assumptions Several assumptions were made that would affect the overall resource envelope that could be used to pay for health workers. Assumptions were made based on current trends in the Africa region to model scenarios described in the next section. In the case of GDP growth, several countries in the Africa region are now growing at an annual rate of five percent or more, while a few have contracted at a similar or greater rate. The range for the growth in GDP was therefore set between an annual growth rate of five percent (best case scenario) and annual contraction of five percent {worst case scenario). In the case of shifts in the share of public expenditure on health, many countries have moved towards the Ahuja target of allocating 15 percent of the public budget on the health sector agreed by the African heads of state in 200 I. Some countries have moved more quickly and others have lost ground, spending less now than they did at the time of the agreement. The range for public spending for health was therefore set between a maximum of 15 percent oftotal government expenditure (best case scenario) and a drop in absolute terms of 5 percentage points (worst case scenario) by 2015. In the case of the insurance effect, it has been observed that total spending on health increases when health insurance is introduced as a resource mobilization mechanism. Populations that are willing and able to contribute to insurance often continue to pay some money out-of-pocket for health care not covered through 20 the insurance system. This is more pronounced at low-income levels where the services covered under insurance are often restricted. Current experiences in Ghana, Rwanda, Namibia and elsewhere indicate that countries can reach a coverage rate of 30 to 60 percent or higher even at low income levels. The range of insurance coverage was, therefore, set at zero percent (worst case scenario) to 60 percent of out of pocket spending with an insurance effect of 25 percent additional resources mobilized through the introduction of health insurance (best case scenario). \u00b7 The share of GDP channeled through the public sector was held constant. It was assumed that any increase in GDP channeled through the public sector would be associated with an offsetting decrease in private consumption and might have a negative effect on GDP. Likewise any decrease in GDP channeled through the public sector would. be associated with an offsetting increase in private consumption and might have a positive impact on GDP growth. Finally, the share of the health budget used to pay for health staff was assumed to be constant. It was assumed that any increase in relative spending on the wage bill would affect other spending in the health sector in a negative way, thereby offsetting the benefits of increasing the number or income level of staff. Likewise any decrease in relative spending on the wage bill would have an offsetting impact on other sources of increased health expenditure. Scenarios Several scenarios were modeled (see Table 1 below and Annex I for details), including a best case, a worst case, two intermediate cases, and a projection of past trends. In each case the scenarios and projections were made for each country in the Africa region using the current available data for health expenditure (public and private) and country level macro economic data.\u00b7 Regional estimates were based on the aggregate of such country level assessments. T bl 1 H lth E a e : ea xpen 1 ure s cenanos Scenario Annual Economic Public Health Expenditures as Insurance Effect (as% of Growth(%) % of Gov. Expenditures by Out-of-Pocket Spending) 2015 (%) Worst Case -5 -5% change 0 Intermediate 1 -5 15 0 Intermediate 2 5 ~5% change 30 Best Case 5 15 60 Projection of Past Trends Average growth Average HE from 1996-2005 0 from 1996-2005 The best case scenario in temis of the total resource envelope available for hiring staff would occur if there were a steady GDP growth of five percent, an increase in political commitment to government spending on health care so that total public spending reaches the 15 percent Ahuja target and a 25 percent insurance effect from channeling 60 percent of out-of-pocket expenditures through health insurance rather than direct payments to providers. The worst case scenario would occur if GDP dropped by five percent annually, political commitment eroded so that public spending on health dropped by five percentage points in absolute terms and there was no insurance effect. ESTIMATING AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE LEVELS With health expenditure scenarios modeled, a second model was developed to estimate the level and composition of the health workforce that is economically sustainable in 2015 for each of the health expenditure scenarios (see Annex II for methodological details). Comparing the economically sustainable health workforce levels in 2015 to current health workforce levels identifies the number of additional health 21 workers that can be absorbed into the labor market by 2015. This estimate -the health workforce gap -is then used to model additional training needs and training costs. Main Variables The main variables used to model the economically sustainable staffing levels under a given resource envelope included: (a) the skills mix of newly hired staff; and (b) wages of health workers. Assumptions Assumptions were made about the share of health spending devoted to the wage bill, efficiency and effectiveness in the deployment of staff (including geographic distribution), productivity, and public/private mix. Different scenarios were defined by making assumptions on the skill mix of newly hired staff and wages. The assumptions were based on current trends in the Africa region and elsewhere, subject to data availability. In the case of skills mix, it is assumed that policymakers may want to shift the skills mix of the future workforce towards highly skilled workers (doctors and nurses) or towards lower skilled workers (mainly community workers) or to maintain the current skill mix. Given that the overall skill mix of staff can change only so rapidly -i.e. you can not fire all staff and create any new skill mix -the scenarios for altering the skill mix are applied to newly hired staff only. In other words, the distribution of newly hired staff across cadres is either the same as the existing workforce, disproportionately concentrated on higher skilled cadres, or disproportionately concentrated on lower skilled cadres. The range of skill mixes for newly hired staff that was modeled is described in Table 2. T bl 2 Skill M\" S a e : IX cenanos or ewty Ire ta fi N I H\" d S ff Distribution (by cadre) of new High skill mix Low skill mix hires scenario (%) scenario (%) Doctor 50 Nurse 20 10 Midwife 10 20 Dentist 10 Pharmacist 10 Public Health 10 CHW 40 Lab Other 20 In the case of wages, many countries are introducing performance bonuses and other financial incentives to encourage workers to move to rural areas and to prevent them from leaving the country for better paid employment elsewhere. The range for altering wage changes was set at no change at the one extreme and a 25 percent wage increase at the other extreme. Scenarios Three scenarios were modeled for altering the skill mix: Skill mix of staff does not change Skill mix of staff shifts towards the higher skilled cadres (doctors and nurses) Skill mix of staff shift toward the lower skilled cadres (community health workers) Two scenarios were modeled for altering wages: 22 Real wages do not change Real wages increase by 25% by 2015 for all cadres This leads to six distinct labor market scenarios for each health expenditure level (see Table 3 below): T bl 3 Sh\"ft. Skill Mi a e : I 10 s xan dW age L eves Shift to Low Skill Mix No Skills Mix Chan~e Shift to Hi~h Skills Mix No Wage Change Least Expensive Largest Number of Staff 25% Wage Most Expensive Increase Smallest Number of Staff The best case scenario in terms of total staffing levels would occur if there were no increase in wages and if there was a shift in skills mix towards lower skilled (i.e. less expensive staff). The worst case scenario in terms of total number of staff would occur if there were a 25 percent wage increase and a shift in skills mix to higher skilled (i.e. more expensive) staff .. ESTIMATING FUTURE TRAINING COSTS AND INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH ED.UCATION Identifying the actual costs of providing health worker training is complicated because the infrastructure for medical training is shared with institutions that provide tertiary education and health care service delivery. As a consequence, the costs of training health workers are shared by multiple entities. For example, students who are in the pre-clinical stage oftheir medical education may be based in,a large public university that receives public funding from the ministry of education and private revenues from tuition and fees. Following their pre-clinical education, medical students may continue on to receive under-graduate clinical and post-graduate in-service training in a teaching hospital that receives public funding from the ministry of health and revenues for providing services. Because of these reasons, the detailed costs of educating health workers are not readily available (see Table 4). T bl 4 R a e : ecurrent an d C . I C a pita osts Education Health Recurrent Teacher salaries Cost share of salaries of Expemditures Administration of tertiary professors who provide level institutions clinical training, work in Infrastructure maintenance service delivery, conduct costs and materials medical R&D Administration of teaching hospitals Maintenance and materials at teaching hospitals Capital The cost of building The cost of building teaching Investment classrooms, purchasing hospitals, purchasing medical educational equipment equipment Assumptions The assumptions for estimating the costs of training were as follows: The costs of training the additional number of health workers that can be absorbed into the health system are considered outside of the resource envelope allocated for health because it is largely 23 financed by the education sector and other non-health expenditures. In reality, the resource envelope allocated for health must include some of the costs for training health workers. The drop out rate of students in the health profession is 30 percent. The graduation rates of medical students varied, from 10 percent in Mozambique to 56 percent in Namibia? An estimate of drop out rates in higher education in Africa based on Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa, however, found that drop out rates were approximately 30? To apply this attrition rate, it was assumed that 30 percent.ofthe students who begin their health training studies will drop out halfway through the length of the program. The brain drain rate of graduates of the health profession in Africa is 28 percent for high skill workers such as doctors and pharmacists and 11 percent for nurses and public health workers. Country-specific data on the 'brain drain', based on the Center for Global Development's database of health professional emigration from Africa, were applied to each African country4. Scenarios In the Africa region, the cost of tertiary education varies significantly across Sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from 0.4 to 12.1 times GDP per capita. In addition, there is an inverse non-linear relationship between GDP per capita and public expenditures on tertiary education across all countries and within the Africa region (see Figure 5). This suggests that applying a general factor to GDP per capita to estimate the costs of medical education would not appropriately capture the costs for countries in the lower and higher income quartiles. This may be an indicator of the variable quality and efficiency of tertiary education and subsequently, the education of health workers in Africa. In scaling up the number of health workers, this paper does not identify the current level of quality of the medical education offered in Africa nor does it try to defme the cost for improving quality. Instead, to generalize about the existing differences in costs and quality of medical education, we used the specific costs (from the limited, reliable data) from training programs for health workers , where available to estimate the country-specific costs of training health workers relative to the per student public expenditures on tertiary education. The average annual costs of training a doctor were about 5 times the costs of a tertiary level student. The average annual costs of a nurse were about 2 times the costs of a tertiary level student. 2 World Bank (2003).

The costs of training a community health worker was assumed to cost the same as a tertiary level student. However, for countries that did not have a medical school, it is assumed that the countries would have to send their students abroad\u00b7to study. These countries without medical schools faced the costs of sending their students to a country within the same language cluster. For example, Anglophone African countries without a medical school were assumed to train their medical workers in South Africa (see Table 5 below). Table 5 Language Costs Applied (USD) Training Country Anglophone 14,100 South Africa Francophone 10,700 Senegal Lusophone 8,510 Mozambique The expenditures on medical, tertiary and other non-tertiary education for 2015 were forecasted by applying the GDP growth rates used in the corresponding resource envelope scenarios. It was assumed that the existing political commitment to education, represented by the portion of GDP spent on education would remain the same. DISCUSSION OF MAIN FINDINGS The following describes some of the main findings in terms of the existing and future resource envelope, number of staff that could be trained using these resources and the cost of training them (both recurrent and capital costs). RESOURCE ENVELOPE Much progress has been made in recent years in terms of spending on health care in the Africa region, partially due to economic growth, increased government spending and greater donor commitment. Currently the region spends US$24.4 billion (three percent of the current regional GDP). Despite such progress, the 25 current analysis indicates that significant challenges lie ahead in terms of securing the resources needed to achieve the MDGs for health. The Role of Economic Growth Nearly half of the countries in Africa are now enjoying growth rates of five percent or more (see Figure 6). This economic growth has been the major driver of health expenditures during the past few years, translating into significant increases in total health expenditures (public and private). Although many countries have succeeded in sustaining growth over the past five years, only a few have done so at current high growth rates and a significant number have actually experienced negative growth (see Figure 7). Contracting economic performance has a very negative impact on both total and public expenditures on health. Poor economic management and civil war have been major causes of such poor economic performance. Figure If. 5 -5 -10 GOP Growth in Subsaharan Africa (2005) Percentage Point Change In GOP There is_ currently a great variation in public spending on health care across the Africa region both in absolute and relative terms (see Figure 8). The regional mean is around nine percent of total government spending. Most countries have not reached the Ahuja target of 15 percent government spending on health care agreed in 200 I by the African heads of state. Although many countries have increased the public sector commitment to health in terms of the share of government expenditures allocated to health, commitment in a number of countries has eroded (see Figure 9). Many of the countries that are performing well in this respect have enjoyed political and social stability. Those that have gone through social turmoil and civil war are among the poor performers. Figure 8 Share of Government Spending on Health 1.Buiundi 2.Nigeria Government Expenditure on Health as Percentage of Total Government Expenditure in Africa {2005} 27 25.Chad 26. There is a well known strong correlation between the level of GDP and total health care expenditures. In the medium term, countries going through rapid economic growth reach a higher level of spending on health care over time than countries that are growing more slowly. In the short term, however, changes in GDP growth is only weakly correlated with changes in public spending on health care (see Figure 10). This indicates that economic growth does not automatically translate into greater public commitment to spending on health care. Figure 10 AGO t MOZ BFA I SLE SEN 400 Instead, as countries get richer, many begin looking at health insurance as an alternative to core government subsidies in funding the health sector. Among the Anglophone group of countries, significant reforms have recently been introduced in Ghana, Rwanda and Nigeria, while Kenya, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa have a longer history of using health insurance. Others like Uganda and Tanzania 28 are currently considering a similar shift towards health insurance. Among the Francophone/Lusophone countries there is a long tradition of community financing and health insurance mutual organizations but coverage rates and total resources mobilized through such\u00b7 mechanisms have remained of marginal significance. Total Resources Generated under Different Scenarios If all the countries in the Africa region were to achieve the best case scenarios, health care resources would double between now and 2015 (see Table 6 below). Projection of past trends without any major policy change would also give a significant boost to health expenditure in the Africa region. 29 T bl 6 T t I H lth E d' a e oa ea xpen 1tnre Total Health Expenditure $US billions (constant) Projection of Baseline Worst Case Intermediate 1 Intermediate 2 Best Case past trends 2005 2015 2015 2015 2015 2015 27.0 15.8 20.7 45.1 57.5 42.4 Public Health Expenditure $US (constant) Projection of Baseline Worst Case Intermediate 1 Intermediate 2 Best Case past trends 2005 2015 2015 2015 2015 2015 11.5 6.6 11.4 17.9 31.1 19.6 The best case scenario is, however, very unlikely because many countries are struggling to achieve a five percent economic growth target and only a few countries have achieved the Ahuja public spending target of 15 percent of total government spending on health care. Only a few countries have embraced health insurance, a major new source of funding for the health sector. If a significant number of countries experience both a lack of political commitment to the current health agenda in the Africa region and a significant deterioration in economic performance, overall resources would go down compared with current spending levels. Since many countries in the region are heavily dependent on donors for core budget support to the health sector, donor fatigue could lead to such a situation, threatening the current resource envelope allocated to the health sector. TOTAL NUMBER OF HEALTH WORKERS The total health workforce levels (per capita and absolute) that are economically sustainable for the Africa region under the different health expenditure and labor market scenarios are summarized in Tables 7 and 8 below. The results require careful interpretation in order to take population growth into account.

It is clear from the results that wage changes and skill mix changes have a significant impact on the economically sustainable staffing levels. Wage increases and shifts to higher skill mixes reduce the number of health workers that can be hired with additional resources. Of course, such policies also result in higher skill mixes which may be desirable. The model is not designed to address these tradeoffs, simply to outline the implications of alternative skill mix and wage policies on aggregate staffing levels. The total number of additional health workers that can be absorbed into the labor market under each scenario is summarized in Table 9 below. The results for each cadre separately are summarized in Annex II.

This explains why training needs under the 'baseline' are zero in the table when in reality, in order to maintain a constant per capita staffing level the workforce must increase by 254,000 health workers by 2015. It is assumed that countries within Africa currently have sufficient training capacity to increase training throughput at the rate of population growth (i.e. to produce these 250,000 health workers by 2015). The model was designed to estimate the training capacity needed in addition to what is already on the ground, which in tum is assumed to be sufficient for maintaining constant per capita staffing levels. Under the best case for health expenditure, an additional 1. 7 million health workers can be absorbed. However, with even a relatively modest wage increase of 25 percent the additional training needs fall considerably to 1.1 million health workers. The additional training needs for each cadre are given in Annex II. Under the projection of past trends scenario with no change in skill mix or wages, an additional 68,000 doctors can be absorbed into the labor market. If the skill mix shifts to high skill, this number increases to 199,000 doctors. Under the best case scenario with no change in skill mix or wages, an additional163,000 doctors can be absorbed. If the skill mix shifts to high skill, this number increases to over 520,000. It is clear that the skill mix policies have the biggest impact on the training needs for particular cadres. COST OF TRAINING Estimating the cost of educating health workers is difficult for several reasons. Costs are spread across the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, NGOs and the private sector (see Table 10 below).

Shared infrastructure with tertiary education Only 2% of THE in OECD is spent institutions. on medical training. The cost of educating health workers and needed investment cost vary considerably across countries (Table 11).

Table 12 provides an estimate of the additional training cost that would be incurred under best case economic 5 The WHO estimated training costs by applying a multiple of 37X and 18X GDP per capita to estimate the costs of training a physician and nurse, respectively. This multiple does not account for the pattern found in higher education costs that suggest that it is relatively more expensive to pursue higher education in lower income countries. Source: AAMC, GHS, UK Medical Schools Council 32 conditions for each of the six staffing scenarios. The cost estimates reflect attrition due to brain drain and other factors as well as the high dropout rate (number of people who graduate versus number of people who begin the school observed in the Africa region). Costs to increase productivity, equity and efficiency (skills mix, deployment and quality of care) factors were not included in the estimates although these could have a significant impact on the cost of scaling up education.

Often, these activities are carried out by the ministry of health, donors, the private sector and may not be fully captured in this figure. 33 expenditures on tertiary education made by the African countries modeled. As expected the costs of training doctors, as seen in the no skill mix and high skill mix scenarios are a considerable portion of the total costs. Figure 12 shows the costs in a best case scenario, which comes closest to achieving the normative recommendation of having 2.3 health workers per 1,000 populations. It is notable that in the case of a no wage change but shift to low skilled workers (a scenario which would allow training of a maximum number of staff) the cost of scaling up health education exceeds by a large margin the total cost of public expenditure on tertiary education. Under this scenario even keeping skills and wages constant, scaling up health education has significant financial implications for both the health and education sectors. Scaling up the labor force by an additional one million health worker would require significant external assistance to both sectors.

Although information on investment costs are not readily available, recent pre-investment studies in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria indicate that the cost could easily range from US$10 to US$50 million, and in some case like Nigeria as high as US$100 million, depending on the size of the country and the state of existing institutions. In post-conflict countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone there is a need to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure. This requires a significant investment even when the population size is relatively small. In more stable but larger countries like Ghana or larger federalist states like Nigeria, the needed investment costs may be much greater. Proper analyses.of investment costs would be country-specific and not only examine costs of infrastructure development or rehabilitation but also the review the necessary investment to meet minimum standards of quality and efficiem:y for the education provided. In addition, any additional capital investments will be met with increasing recurrent costs, which are a significant component oftotal costs in health professional education. CONCLUSIONS The following are the main conclusions from this review: Past reviews have indicated that human resource shortages in the Africa region has become a binding constraint in implementing many priority health programs in the region; Scaljng up health education has major implications for financial sustainability in both the health and education sector; The resource envelope available to scale up human resources is a major binding constraint that needs to be considered on a country by country basis; and Other factors to consider include efficiency and effectiveness in the deployment of human resources in the health sector (including geographic distribution), productivity, and public/private mix. Countries trying to scale up health education may also want to consider parallel measures to improve the earmarking of some ODA for this purpose, especially in the case of some of the larger international funds devoted to addressing major public health priorities. 35 Finally, an effort is needed in many countries to ensure that the secondary education system is producing a sufficient supply of graduates to feed a scaling up of health education. 36 ANNEXI. METHODOLOGY METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING NUMBER OF HEALTH WORKERS The Model The following identity summarizes that relationship between health expenditure (HEXP) and staffing levels for different cadres of health workers (ni) in a particular country: Where Sw is the share of health spending devoted to the wage bill and wi is the wage level for cadre i. The overall staffing level (Lni) can be changed by i) altering health expenditure, ii) altering the share of health spending on the wage bill, iii) altering the skill mix, and iv) altering the wage level of the health worker cadre. For each of the health expenditure scenarios developed, it is possible to model the overall staffing levels (and skillmix) that are affordable under different assumptions on the share of health spending on the wage bill, skill mix of staff, and wages. Data The inputs to the model are the health expenditure scenarios and the current staffing levels by cadre. The ctl.rrent staffing levels and selection of cadres were taken from the WHO human resources for health database. The analysis is carried out in two ways. The first is by doing a country by country analysis and then aggregating across countries to reach a total for Africa. The second is by treating the Africa region as a single data point. As accurate wage data are not readily available for countries in the Africa region, wages were imputed for each cadre from expenditure and staffmg data. To do this, however, requires an assumption on the relative wages of one cadre to another. Using available data from a few country studies in the Africa region, the following assumption on relative wages was used in the analysis (see Table 1): TableAl Wage level relative to doctor Doctor 1.00 Nurse 0.33 37 METHODOLOGY OF TRAINING COSTS The total number of additional medical graduate output, t required as a result of the brain drain is as follows: 47 t = L di ( 1 +bi) i=I bi = The country-specific estimate for the brain drain rate of doctors and nurses, based on the Center for Global Development's database on stock of doctors and nurses from African countries that are practicing outside of Africa relative the number of doctors and nurses that are practicing inside of Africa. For all of Sub-Saharan Africa, the brain drain rate is approximately 27% for physicians and 12% for nurses. di = The number of health professionals that can be absorbed into the health care system for each country. Therefore if for all the 47 African countries modeled, the brain drain rate were 50% and the number of health workers that could be absorbed into the system were 100 then the total number of graduates that were needed, t would have 150. If this number were to be reduced by a, 25% and 50%, t would fall to 47 L di(l+ (1-a) bi), 138 and 125 graduates, respectively. i=l The annual cost of training all the graduates, u if they went to school in one cohort is as follows: \u00b7 Where ui\u00b7is a function of: g =Country's GDP/Capita x =relative cost of higher education measured by the public expenditures on higher education per student as a multiple of GDP/capita s = dummy variable representing whether or not there is an in-country medical school I= dummy variable representing the country's national language which determines the cost of training if a country does not have a medical school. For example, Botswana which does not have a medical school but is an Anglophone country will be applied with the costs of South Africa's medical schools for its graduates. y = the unit costs of medical and nursing education, which is estimated for countries where this data does not exist. To account for the drop out rate, r which is the percentage of students who drop out halfway through the program, the drop out rate is applied as follows to get the total costs of training doctors by 2015, w: W = (t * u + 0.5* t * u * (r/(1-r))) * y Y =#of years to train a health worker. For a doctor it is 6 years; 4 years for dentists and pharmacists; 3 years for nurses and midwives; 2 years for public health specialists; 1 year for community health and other health workers If the drop out rate is decreased by 'A then the resulting costs would be (t * u + 0.5* t * u *('A r/(1-/.., r))) * y. 38 ANNEX II. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Additional scenarios to understand the effect of changes to assumptions regarding expenditures, wages, and training costs were conducted. Two additional expenditure scenarios were conducted to understand the effect of external aid on the fiscal envelope for health. These scenarios looked at what would happen if 1) aid doubled and 2) aid fell by half while keeping other assumptions the same as under the projection of past trends scenario. The effect of a 50% aid decrease reduced the number of additional health workers that can be absorbed by 50,000 when compared to the projection of past trends. The effect of a 100% aid boost increased the number of additional health workers by 270,000. While important, the overall impact of aid in these scenarios was not as significant as changes in countries' political commitment and economic growth. An additional wage scenario assumption was made to see the effect of\u00b7increasing wages by 50% while keeping the skill mix the same. This assumption was made without regard to the influence that increasing wages in the health sector would have on other sectors. In reality, a sizeable increase in wages in one particular sector would have drastic effects on the rest of the economy. But increasing wages by 50% reduced! the number of health workers that could be trained by 150,000 when compared to the 25% wage increase and no skill mix change. These changes in the aid and wage scenarios also impact the training costs. An aid reduction or an increase in wages will reduce the number of potential health professionals that would require training and therefore the training costs. A 50% aid decrease would reduce the training by about $1 billion, when compared to the projection of past trends scenario with no wage or skill mix change. While an increase in the wage by 50% would reduce the training costs even more drastically by about $11 billion. Conversely an increase in aid scenario dedicated to increasing the absorption of health workers will increase the training cost requirements. A 50% aid increase would increase training costs by nearly $5 billion. Sensitivities were also tested for the training costs to see the effect of reducing the brain drain rate, the drop out rate and the unit costs of training by 25% and 50%. As a result, we found that if the brain drain rate were reduced by 25%, the costs of training would fall by 5%. If the brain drain rate were reduced by 50%, the costs of training would fall by 9%. If the drop out rate were reduced by 25%, the costs of training would fall by 6%. If the drop out rate were reduced by 50%, the costs of training would fall by 11%. If the efficiency o{existing training institutions increased causing the unit costs of training to fall by 25%, the total costs of training would fall by 12%. If the efficiency of existing training institutions increased causing the unit costs of training to fall by 50%, the total costs oftraining would fall by 23%. In an intermediate case, in which the effects of improving the brain drain rate and the drop out rate by 25% were combined, the costs would drop by 21%. In a best case, in which the effects of improving the brain drain rate and the drop out rate by 50% were combined, the costs would drop by 3 7%.

For the past three decades, internal and external investments in African education systems have been targeted to the primary and secondary levels of the education sector. As a result, the number of qualified secondary school graduates has increased, leading to a larger pool of potential higher education students. Tertiary education1 can be defined as education beyond the secondary level, or education at the college, university level and /or vocational training (Society 2000). Many of these students aspire to become physicians, health care administrators, or other tertiary-level health workers. To do so, they often desire to begin their studies in medicine at the university level. But the reality of higher education in Africa is often bleak. Under-funded and overenrolled, many of the tertiary level medical training programs in Africa are at risk of collapse. In most countries in the region, reform in needed. Whether it be a reinvestment in the administrative capacity of the institution, a revamping of the curriculum to align more with the country's burden of disease, or establishing new financing mechanisms to increase equitable access for students, many medical training J As the African ontinues, w,grow at over 6% a year, new opportunities arise to harness potential &ains in \u00b7, , '\u00b7 s'Our~~:~a~~iopment, especially the production of high-. level health workers (Bank 2 One ... way to accomplish this is to invest in and improve terti~ level medical training. ;~nt years, numerous investments in tertiary medical training have been implemented a;ound the world. Many can be seen as success stories, while others as lessons to be learned. Whether it is the expansion and privatization of higher education in countries throughout South and East Asia, innovations in funding mechanisms throughout Latin America, or experiments with student-centered learning in Southeastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has much to learn from these recent reforms. This paper will highlight key components of tertiary medical education systems, describe current global trends in tertiary medical education, and provide in a list of recommendations for investments higher medical education in Sub-Saharan Africa. 1 For this document, tertiary education and higher education will be used interchangeably. 4 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 1.2 Layout of the paper Global Trends in Tertiary Medical Education is divided into two parts. Part 1 of the paper provides an overview of various themes found in higher medical education, including a broad array of topics that highlight the current state of the field. Section 1 is the introduction to the paper. Section 2 describes the current global situation of human resources for health and highlights general strategies used for the training and education of health workers. The section will cover regional statistics of the production and density of health works, critical factors and regulatory frameworks for scaling-up the health workforce, general components of health professional education, and levels of medical training within a national education system. Section 3 provides an overview of national tertiary education systems, including major categories of higher education institutions, c:;lassification frameworks for levels of education, and several desired features of a sound higher education system. Section 4 provides an overview of geographical trends in tertiary medical education. Section 5 describes various components that make up a national te~iary medical education system. Areas of discussion include institutional governance arrangements, private sector provision of higher medical education, the political environment and policy cycles, and accreditation and quality assurance mechanisms for tertiary medical education.

Section 10 provides an overview of recent reforms in tertiary medical education, and the strategies used to implement them. Finally, Section 11 concludes Part 1 with a short list of policy recommendations for tertiary medical education reform in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting current struggles for the region, but also providing lessons learned from experiences from around the world. Part 2 of Global Trends in Tertiary Medical Education describes up-to-date regional trends in tertiary medical education, and includes a selection of representative countries from each region of the world. Regions include Latin American and Caribbean, South-East Asia, South 5 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Asia, Western Europe, Southeastern Europe, the United States, and sub-Saharan Africa. The countries selected are by no means meant to be an exhaustive list for each region, but more a sampling of noteworthy points that highlight trends in the area. 6 / A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 2.1 The global state of health and human resources Developing capable, motivated and supported health workers is essential for the attainment of national health goals. While the tertiary level of medical education is an important component to any national human resources for health training system, the sub-system's priority is to produce only the highest cadre. of health workers. National training programs must focus on the production of all levels of health workers, as different cadres respond to the diverse health needs of a country's population. This section desbribes the current state of human resources for health around the world, and the strategies used for the training and education of health workers. It will also cover regional statistics of the production and density of health works, critical factors and regulatory frameworks for scaling~up the health workforce, general components of health professional education, and levels of medical training within a national education system. Health care is a labor-intensive service industry, and at the heart of every health system, the workforce is essential to advancing health. There is ample evidence that health worker numbers are highly correlated with immunization coverage, outreach of primary care, and infant, child and mate~ival. The World Health Organization's 2006 World Health /i\\</' Report: Working;;\"'ff\u00a3Jgether # ... engaged in actions of maintaining and /orirnpro \u00b7Health, defines health workers as \"all people primarily intent of enhancing health.\" This definition aligns with \u00b7-:<;~ising of \"all activities with the primary goal alth\" (WHO 2006). ;;\"' In the 2006 report, the World HealtJi'Organization estimated there to be a total of59.2 million full-time paid health workers worldwide and among these, health service providers constitute about two-thirds .ef the. ~lob a! health workforce. The remaining third is composed of health management and support workers. The ratio of nurses to doctors varies worldwide, ranging from nearly 8:1 in the Africa Region to 1.5:1 in the Western Pacific Region. In Chile, Peru, El Salvador and Mexico, there are in fact fewer nurses than doctors. Typically, more than 70% of doctors are male and more than 70% of nurses are female, with about two-thirds \u00b7of workers employed in the public sector and one-third in the private sector. In 2006 WHO estimated that that there are 57 countries with critical shortages of health workers, equivalent to a global deficit of 2.4 million doctors, nurses and midwives. For the same year, the WHO 7 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education alerted the world to a total shortfall of 4.3 million trained health workers globally ((WHO 2006). There is a general consensus that without enough health workers, the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other population health targets will be difficult to achieve by 2015 (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). The proportional shortfalls are greatest in sub-Saharan Africa, and due to its population size, numerical deficits are also large in Southeast Asia. Almost all countries suffer from a problem of a maldistribution of health workers, characterized by urban concentrations and rural deficits. Regional disparities remain a problem too. The WHO region of the Americas, with 10% of the global burden of disease, has 37% of the world's health workers and spends more than 50% of the world's health financing. On the other hand, the Africa Region has 24% of the world's burden of disease, but only 3% of the world's workers, utilizing less than 1% ofthe world's health expenditure (WHO 21)06). Estimated shortages of doctors, nurses and midwives, by WHO region, 2006 In recent years, it has been recognized that a central roadblock to successful health sector interventions has been the lack of a capable and sufficient workforce for the provision of health services. As a result, there has been a push to develop sustainable strategies to scale up the human resources for health systems. The Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers within the Global Health Worliforce Alliance was established to address the current state of production of health workers. The Task Force's global vision is that by 2020, every county will have sufficient health workers to meet its essential health needs and address major health problems. The Task Force cites three critical factors for successful scale-ups, including (i) political commitment, (ii) appropriate worliforce planning, and (iii) an enabling environment for reform, including a melange of education strategies 8 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education aiming at both short and long-term goals (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). A central objective of workforce development is to produce sufficient numbers of skilled workers with technical competencies whose background, language and social attributes make them accessible and able to reach diverse clients and populations. The 2006 World Health Report notes that to accomplish this task, national human resources for health strategies require active planning and management of the health workforce production pipeline. Such strategies should focus on building strong training institutions, strengthening professional regulations, and revitalizing health worker recruitment strategies (WHO 2006). Critical Factors for Human Resource for Health Scale-ups The,World Health Or~nization identified a current need for an additional 1.5 million health '' .,.\u00b7. ' work~rs in the sub-Sahara Africa region in order to meet the minimum standard of health services~< under current financial trends, scale-up attempts have the potential to produce only 650,000 additional health workers, leaving a significant shortfall. In the Africa region, the average attrition rate, of students in the health professions is 30%, and within that the migration rate of high-level graduates such as doctors, pharmacists, nurses and public health workers is considered to be 19%. Given this reality, it would cost a projected $26.4 billion to educate and train the needed 1.5 million extra health workers that WHO estimates are needed (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). Given current trends in financing for human resource training, investments of such a caliber will difficult to attain in the coming years. 9 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 2.2 Regulatory frameworks for scaling-up Sound regulatory frameworks are a necessary component for the production of human resources for health. In OECD countries, supply constraints have been attributed to the influence of governmental or self-regulating professional bodies, in turn influencing the public allocation of capital towards medical school investments. In these countries, there exists a centralized process used to determine the number of slots available to medical students; medical schools are highly regulated by government or independent self-regulating bodies. These regulatory bodies can influence the supply of medical schools and health worker output through directly limiting the number of slots available in medical schools, increasing the pre-requisite admission standards and/or requiring certain accreditation standards for programs. In developing countries, the story is not so clear. Governments and self-regulating professional bodies provide some guidance over the supply of doctors, but the main constraints are the financial and human resources necessary for making proper health professional education investments (Preeker 2007). In the majority of countries, the Ministry of Health leads the development and implementation of plans on health workforce development. Yet both the health and education sectors maintain control over certain areas of health workforce production. In many countries, the Ministry of Education is responsible for producing physicians, pharmacists and dentists (high-level cadres), while the Ministry of Health is responsible for training mid-level (nurses, midwives and technicians) and lower level cadres (nurses aids, health assistants) of health workers. For successful outcomes, any plan to scale up education and training of health workers needs to support and align with the strategic plan developed by the Ministry of Health, as well as broader national health plans. The split in resources and the lack of sufficient communication between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education limits.the ability of the education sector to ensure an adequate supply of health workers to meet health care needs (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). 2.3.1 Training and Education for Human Resources for Health A country's human resources for health structure should appropriately address the changing health needs of the population it serves. Health professionals play a central and critical role in improving access and quality health care for the population. They provide essential 10 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education services that promote health, prevent diseases and deliver health care services to individuals, families and communities based on the primary health care approach. For this to occur, a nation's health education system should produce an appropriately skilled workforce to address its current health priorities. Globally, institutions training health workers are heavily tipped towards the production of physicians and nurses: 1691 and 5492, respectively, in contrast to 914 schools of pharmacy, 773 schools of dentistry, and 375 schools of public health, etc (WHO 2006). There is currently a range of estimates for training institutions globally. 1n sub-Saharan Africa, estimates for the number of medical schools ranges from 66 in 2006 (WHO estimates) to149 in 2008 (FAIMER estimates) (see table below). Health Worker Training Institutions, by WHO Regions, 2006 The World Health Organizatioril'i(a<l()6) 0defines health-training institutions as having six key ','?'><07 functions: Stewardship or institutional governance Provision of educational services Selection and employment of staff members Financing of training Development and maintenance of infrastructure and technology Generation of information and knowledge When looking at medical education on a global scale, using a general model of evaluation may assist in cross-regional and systematic comparisons. One evaluation framework is the 11 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education World Federation for\u00b7 Medical Education (WFME) standards, which Bossert (2007) highlights as a grounded starting point for identifying indicators of quality health professional education. WFME identifies 9 areas of quality assessment and potential improvement of health professional education: Mission and objectives Educational programs Assessment of students Students Academic staff Educational resources Program evaluation Governance and administration Continuous renewal 2.3.3 Levels of medical training within a national education system Although the focus of this literature review is on tertiary medical education, it should be noted that higher levelsofmedi<;al training are only one bracket of professional training that The Global Health Workforce Alliance divides a national midwifes, assistants; pharmacists, and medical doc;tors+i. Health Workers 2008). the community level, including community such as enrolled or auxiliary nurses and technicians, clinical officers and medical comprised of registered nurses/midwifes, Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for 12 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Three Levels of a National Health Workforce ]I HiJ!h-Level levels of health training tend towl'!rds 'closed' training systems, which often have homogenous sets of tn~inees, with controlled access to training opportunities through selection and standards for qualification. Trainees follow the same curriculum as previous or successive cohortS, with little or no flexibility in how trainees can learn or the pace of lt,!aming:(R{ibson 2005). Often, pre-service curricula for, health workers tends to overewPhf!size theoretical knowledge and practice in well-resourced tertiary hospitals, with less etnphasis on the competencies needed at the primary care level. As a result, graduates' ability to deal effectively with real-life health needs may be compromised\u00ad particularly where there are few'fesources and limited access to equipment and technology. The education system may also fail ,to ensure that competencies fulfill accepted intervention standards,. such as in the training of traditional birth attendants (Task Force for Scaiing Up Education atiu Training for Health Workers 2008). In developing countries, medical training programs tend to be wasteful, often including material that is not directly applicable or relevant to prevalent health problems in their respective countries. As a result, curriculum can be overly long and contain redundancies. Although the efficiency of medical training is improving throughout sub-Saharan Africa, in recent years wastage rates ranged from 10-40% annually in sub-Saharan countries (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). There remains a call for further streamlining of training programs, resulting in more focused curriculum and a 13 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education shortening of the overall duration-of pre-service education programs. At the same time, due to changes in the disease profile of African populations, such as an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases, streamlining of training programs should be adopted with caution, as there remains a newfound need to train health workers in chronic disease management. Mid-level Health Worker Training in Ghana In Ghana, the Ministry of Health, which controls the middle and lower level cadre, focused on scaling up mid-level health workers with the intention to make a long-term shift of resource allocation in health. This is seen to produce a double dividend for Ghana, as the approach has found to be both more cost-effective than previous strategies, as well as more effective, as mid-level agents are often more willing to work in rural areas than doctors. The system for general training for medical assistants takes about three years, with subsequent two-year specialist training offering a chance of career progression. The intention is to double the training output of mid-level workers in two years. Investment is also being made to expand training infrastructures and tutors. Accredited schools are being used for all health professions, under the supervision of regulatory bodies. New training sites are planned with the ultimate goal of all hospitals in the country taking on some training function, if accredited. (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). 2.3.4 Recruitment and Training of Human Resources for Health: The Education Funnel The education system helps to determine two key elements of the health workforce: (i) the number of graduates within a given skill set, and (ii) the quality of those human resources, including the knowledge and skill mix found within each category of profession. According to Bossert, et al. (2007), an education system's capacity to provide an adequately trained workforce and appropriate quantity of health workers can be viewed as an \"education funnel\": 14 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Figure 2: Education Funnel for Human Resources for Health Pool of Applicants Note: Student Acceptance Rate measures the number of admitted students who accept invitations to study at training institutions Bossert also notes that the pool of appl.is;artts and application\u00a5~te can be constrained by the levels and quality of the country's s66ondaty:education. In ;fontrast, the institutional acceptance rate can be regulated by the institutio,ns themselves (e.g. limiting the number of ~':.--:-\u00b7\u00b7 . ' ... medical school places), whil~ the drop-out rat~ has been shown to be affected by choice of pedagogical met,hod ~nd the quality of the students admitted. Students with weak science backgrounds often have. a higher first year drop-oW rate than those with a solid foundation in biological science~. While content selectroh.and the quality of teachers and teaching methods influ\u00a2ftce the kl{(J{\\rl~d~e, skills and aptitudes of students, trainees or residents, there has been a ~~tldwide trend in education .for the health professionals to emphasize academic know led~~ over the skill~.11eeded to work in clinical settings (I,:lQs~~:iQQ7t [Th_ere, e~~t~ ~ __ ~ need to maint~in a necessary balance between classroom teaching hours and practical, hands-, on training. A b~nchmatk for the division of didactic and practical training can be found '\u00b7i,O' within the tradition~! four-year medical school curriculum in the United States. The majority of medical schools follow the following framework: during the first two years, students complete 35 hours per week of classroom didactic teaching for first 2 years, followed by 60- 80 hours per week of clinical training during last 15 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 3.1 National tertiary education systems 3.1.1 An overview The following section provides an overview of national tertiary education systems, including major categories of higher education institutions, classification frameworks for levels of education, and several desired features of a sound higher education system. According to The Task Force, a national tertiary education system consists of three basic elements: (i) the individual higher education institutions (both public and private), (ii) the organizations that are directly involved in the financing, managing or operating higher education institutions, comprising a range of both public and private bodies, and (iii) the formal and informal rules that guide institutional and individual behavior and. interactions among various stakeholders (Society 2000). Basic Elements of National Tertiary Education Systems The TaskForce on Higher Education and Society (2000) cites four major types of Higher Education Institutiof\\s (HEis): (i) Research Universities, which tend to be public and usually not for profit. (ii) Provincial or Regional universities, which are institutions that predominantly on producing large numbers of graduates. They often emphasize teaching and the training of ''job-ready\" graduates, are found both in public and private sectors, and tend to be geographically dispersed so that they can collectively cater to the many students who do not leave home to attend school. 16 / A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Provincial or regional universities tend to produce the majority of the country's graduates and tend to lie at the heart of the system's expansion. (iii) Professional Schools, including freestanding professional schools and professional faculties within universities, provide training in fields such as law, medicine, business, and teaching. For-profit private institutions can be driven into this area by market forces, concentrating on training students who will enter fields with high private returns. (iv) Vocational Schools are schools that endeavor to impart the practical skills needed for specific jobs in areas such as nursing, auto-mechanics, bookkeeping, computers, etc. Vocational schools often play .an important role in satisfYing real labor market demands. The vocational t~aining institutions can be found both as public or private schools but in the last decades most of them are private when the rate of return to investment is high as i;\\be case ~~th computer, accounting and ':: ,, .. '\":\u00b7\" nursing training. (Society 2000). In US the Carnegie Classification has been th~)eading frameworkJor describing institutional diversity in Higher Education. The classification syst~m d~vides institutions into five main categories: (i) A.~sodate's conei~~. (v) Tribal coileges (Socl.)JP) .ii' Other sourCes have defined tertiary education as a tripatriate system composed of three tiers. Tier I includes\u00b7\u00b7 elite research and comprehensive universities, such as the Ivy League universities in tlie United States and the Russell Group in the United Kingdom. Tier 2 encompasses lower~status universities and degree-granting tertiary colleges and institutes, such as state universities in the United States. Tier 3 covers institutions that offer mostly short-cycle, sub-degree programs, such as community colleges and technical institutes (Mikhail 2008). 17 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Finally, UNESCO has developed the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED-97), which separates the education sector into six levels of education in three tiers: compulsory education, post-compulsory education, and tertiary or higher education (Mikhail 2008). There also exists as well what Makhail (2008) calls the \"Alternative Tertiary Education Sector,\" which encompasses tertiary education options that do not fit into the more formal, standardized higher education system. Examples of national models for the alternative tertiary education sectors include the U.S. Community College System, Canadian Community College System, The Further Education Colleges in pngland, France's Institutes Universitaires de Technologie, The German Dual System, T]1.e Junior Colleges in Korea, and the Universities of Technology in Mexico (Mikhail2008). University Sector of Tertiary Education (Mikhail 2008) ISCED prof(ram-based typo/of{]! of tertiary education Alternative Sector of Tertiary Desiredteatures of higher education systems Task Force on Higher Education and Society (2000) also puts forth a concise list of desired features of a higher education system. Ideal characteristics for a functioning system include: Higher education systems should be stratified in structure, so that one tier is oriented towards research and selectivity while the other is oriented to imparting knowledge to large numbers of students. 18 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Such systems should receive adequate and stable long-term funding, meaning that when governments finance public institutions, it should be done on a long-term basis, planning ahead for future endeavors. Such funding should be subject to good performance. Competition is another desired feature of a higher education system. More intense competition between similar institutions for faculty, students and resources will help improve standards by rewarding merit and performance. One:'cpmmon indicator of competition is faculty mobility between institutions, whis,h tends to promote a healthy academic environment through intellectual cross-fertili:;>;ation. ,',::.::_, Higher education systems should be flexible, being able to adaptquickly to changing enrollment levels, and the rise and fall of differeht fields of study. Well-defined standards are essential too, as international standards l1ave .. become more and more important in an increasingly glob~ized economy. Higher education systems should be immune from political manipulation. Higher education should have well defined links to other sectors. Specifically, \u00b7. tertiary education planning must pay atteption to seconqary education trends to prepare for fluctuations in incoming class sizes. Equally important is the orientation toward labor matket demands. Higher education systems should be supported by sound and stable legal and regulatory strucwres, vvitg system-wide resources available to facilitate the use of high quality management information systems, the establishment of standardized tests, and th~ sharin~ of. curriculum through \"knowledge banks\" (Society 2000). Such types of knowledge b~nks could include regional centers of information shared by local academic institutions. Resources could be contributed by participating schools, resulting iri: centralized libraries where students would be able to access paper and electronic resources. Colleges- universities-vocational _ 19 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 4.1 Global Numbers in Tertiary Medical Education The following section provides a global overview of numerical trends in tertiary medical education. For access to these statistics, there are various online databases that provide information on medical schools around the world. The World Health Organization annually publishes the World Directory of Medical Schools, now part of the Global Directories of Education Institutions for Health Professions, a partnership of WHO and the University of Copenhagen. There also exists databases compiled by the Institute for International Medical Education (liME), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER), who produces the International Medical Education Dictionary (IMED). International medical students who wish to pursue graduate medical education in the US must have their medical school listed in IMED to be considered for eligibility (Boulet 2007). According to Boulet, in 2007 there were 1935 medical schools in the world, with 1771 located outside of the US and Canada. The number continues to grow. As of October 8, 2008 there were 2,073 operating medical schools in 170 countries or territories listed in the International Medical Education Directory (IMED). All medical schools listed in IMED are recognized by the appropriate government agencies in the countries where the schools are located (FAIMER 2008). Of the 235 countries and dependencies worldwide, 169 have at least one medical school. Asia has the most medical schools (860) but with 60% of the world's population, the continent hosts only 44% of its medical schools, with one medical school for every 3.3 million people. 16% of the world's medical schools are in North America, where only 8% of the world's population lives. There are 218 medical schools in South America, with one medical school for every 1.7 million people. Europe has one medical school for every 1.9 million, with 3.4 physicians per 1000 population. There are 127 medical schools in Africa, hosting one medical school for every 6.9 million habitants and only 0.26 physicians per 1000 population (Boulet 2007). Globally, the minimum curriculum is 4 years, while the maximum length 8 years. From 1950-1999, the highest rates for medical school growth were in Latin America, but from 2000 to present the highest growth rate has been in Asia. The official language for medical schools is dominated by English and Spanish, comprising 22% and 21% of the medical schools official languages, respectively. 20 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Chinese is the official language for 12% of medical schools, with French, Portuguese, Japanese and Russian accounting for 8%, 8%, 7% and 6% respectively (Boulet 2007). Medical Schools by Region, 2008 (F AlMER 2008) Number of Medical Schools, by Country Proportion of tertiary education students enrolled in health and welfare programfi;, ~Y UNEscqxegion, 2006 21 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education As can be noted from the map and table, accessibility to accredited medical schools varies between regions and countries. In the United States and India, there are more than 150 accredited medical schools, while in Mexico, China, Russia and Brazil, 50-149 schools currently operate. Most of the countries with less than five medical schools are found in sub-\u00b7 Saharan Africa, including even a few countries where no accredited medical schools currently exist (Namibia, Botswana, Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Mauritania). Most of the countries with no medical schools have established training relationships with neighboring countries where medical schools can be found. Such is the case ofNamibia and Botswana, where medical students are sent for university training in South Africa, before returning home to serve as high-cadre health professionals. Sub-Saharan Africa also has the lowest percentage of tertiary students enrolled in health or welfare programs ( 6.1 %), a statistic that can be attributed to lower levels of accessibility totertiary medical training. 22 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 5.1 Components of Tertiary Medical Education Systems National governments approach governance of higher education institutions through a diverse array of frameworks. The term 'governance' refers to the 'processes of decision-making within an institution [which] ... enable an institution to set its policies and objectives, to achieve them, and to monitor its progress towards their achievement' (Oxford 2008). Section 5 maps the various components that national tertiary medical education systems are composed of. Highlighted themes include institutional governance arrangements, private sector provision of higher medical education, the political environment and policy cycles of higher education, accreditation, quality assurance, and licensing mechanisms for tertiary medical education. 5.2 Governance arrangements for higher education systems and their tutelary ministries Governance of public universities is significantly influenced by government policy, with a particular emphasis on efficiency. National governments play a central role in the management of higher education systems, with Vc~rying degrees of ownership across countries. Sometimes ownership can be too burdensome. Under systems of state control, governments often own, finance and operate higher education institutions. Politicians have the power to appoint vice-chancellors, while ministries dictate degree requirements and curricula. In Europe, the relationship has been based largely on a state supervision model, and recently with greater regional integration and interaction through the Bologna Process. In Latin America, governments have diluted the European model of state supervision, as a growing number of private institutions have begun to challenge the role of the state in providing higher education. While the region has moved away from ubiquitous provision of higher education by the state, the sate maintained the supervisory and regulatory role. This is an important component to ensure the provision of quality higher education. In South Asia, two examples of private institutions with good relationships and support from government are the Aga Khan University (AKU) and Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), both in Pakistan. Both were established through private philanthropy, but currently receive political support from central government (Society 2000). Strategies exist to prevent state control from being too burdensome. Specific mechanisms can be put in place to control for this, such as (i) councils of higher education that advise the government on the size, shape and funding of higher education; quality assurance; and accreditation, (ii) research councils 23 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education or agencies that fund and promote research, (iii) professional councils that focus on specific areas of higher education, and (iv) governing councils or board of trustees (Society 2000). 5.3 University Governance Models 5.3.1 University governance by the academic staff The most traditional model of university governance assumes that universities should principally be governed by their academic staff, which is sometimes identified with collegial governance. This usually occurs either by granting expansive governance powers to university senates or by significant faculty representation on boards of governors, or both. A primary reason for this model is that academic staff ordinarily is best equipped to understand the academic goals and aspirations of a university and how to achieve them. At concern is the issue that faculty governance will accord a disproportionately greater stress to respecting the university's independent academic mission, accompanied with less emphasis on improving its corporate capabilities through partnerships with government, commerce and industry. Faculty governance is also doubted on grounds that the academic staff may lack the requisite skill in financial management and accountability. Typifying such a governance model is the academic democracy asso iated with Cambridge University. Onder its statutes, the governing and college fel 2008). Regent Hous~ . consisting of over 3,000 university officers onsible for the governance of the university (Trackman valent today in universities Concentrating on the fiscal and managerial responsibility ofth~se charged with governance of the university, a corporate governance model is based on a business-case model for universities. Some public universities outside the United States have moved structurally closer to a corporate governance model, with a chair and smaller board of governors or trustees directing the governance of the university, ~ith a chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer serving the board as the senior management team. Supporters of the corporate governance model insist that universities should be governed by professionals who are trained and experienced in corporate policy and planning, and able to direct management efficiently (Trackman 2008). 24 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 5.3.3 Trustee Governance Trustee governance is not directly concerned with stakeholder representation in governance. Rather, it refers to the manner of governance, specifically governance through a 'trust' relationship between a trustee board that acts in trust for, and on behalf of trust beneficiaries (Trackman 2008) 5.3.4 Stakeholder Governance A stakeholder model of governance, identified variously with collegial and representative governance, occurs when governance is vested in a wide arriy bf',stakeholders including, among others, students, academic staff, alumni, corporate partners, g()vernment and the public at large At its most inclusive, stakeholder governance ;rovides for ~ide participation by internal and external stakeholders in decision-making beyond the appoiht(l1ent of representatives of a range of stakeholder groups (Trackman 2008). 5.3.5 Ministerial Governance In respect to the health sector the situatioJ1 is'jntricate due to the two authorities involved in the training of health professionals: the Mfnistry of Health and the Ministry of Education. The two ministries have differ\u00a2nt share\u00a7\u00b1 of the sector in different countries. As a general rule schools under the university are under the authority of the ministry of education while the rest of the schools can be either under the ministry of education or ministry of health depending on the country's historical system. For example in Sierra Leone, with the exception of the midwifery and lq~ level cadre training, all health training is carried out by the ministry of education. In Liberia and Ghana only schools under the universities are under the ministry of education, the rest of the .schools are under the ministry of health. In all three West African countries; the state owns the majority of the schools with the private sector represented mainly by faith based organizations. Here the state has the role of regulating, financing and providing training . Jn other systems through decentralization and sector reform, such as Nicaragua, the state now has a subsidiary role in production of health services and aims to strengthen its role as a regulator. As government control has relaxed, there is still only one private medical school, but it being highly successful (Robson 2005). 5.3.6 Governance arrangements for medical education: Experience from the United Kingdom, France and the United States 25 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Historical relationships between countries often play a role in the organization of national education systems, as can be seen when comparing education systems between formal European colonial powers and countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Today, many tertiary medical education institutions in the region mirror higher education structures used by Western European countries. France and the United Kingdom have adopted diverse governance systems for higher education institutions, both within their own borders, as well as by cross-sectional comparison. A description of governance structures adopted in these countries, as well as those instituted in the United States, is of considerable interest. The United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the UK General Medical Council plays a significan~'\u00a7~pervisory role and is responsible for deciding the knowledge, sl(i}ls and attitudes medical s~h~j graduates need. The publication Tomorrow's Doctors: Recommendations on Undergraduate Medical Education acts as a guideline for medical school curriculum design. The medical schools themseives, on the other hand, are responsible for student sele?tion, faculty supervision, and managerial aspects of the school itself. :!n England, in the case<o:fthe so-called pre-1992 higher education institutions, the constitution .a-nd I?'O.wers of the governing body are established by the 5.f:!.art~ atJ,d statutes of the institution. For the so-called post-1992 universities and csi@~~~' theY:~ laid down in the Education Reform Act 1988 (as amended by the Further\"~\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\"on Act 1992), together with the instruments and articles of s in the current higher education sector are diverse in origin; size and o are the following characteristics of being: bodies with charitable stat accoqntable through a governing body which carries ultimate responsibility for all aspects of the institution (HEFCE 2004). The governing body of these institutions is normally called the council and is the executive governing body of the university. It is responsible for the university's finances and investments, and for the management of the university estate and buildings. It has authority to make contracts on behalf of the university and to enter into loans and mortgage agreements. It is an important principle that the governing body has a lay majority (that is a majority of members who are external and independent). A governing body of no more than 25 members 26 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education is most common Governing meet normally not less than four times a year (HEFCE 2004). The senate is responsible for regulating and directing the academic work of the university. In some cases, the statutes state that power in academic matters (for example the awarding of degrees) rests with the senate; but even where the statutes do not explicitly state this, the senate is regarded as the authority on purely academic matters. The senate is chaired by the head of the institution. Unlike the governing body its membership is drawn from within the university, consisting of academic staff. Student representatives are also included. Senates vary in size from under 50 to well over 100 members. The senate's specific responsibilities normally include (HEFCE 2004): academic strategy promotion of research approval of content of curriculum and new programs academic standards procedures for the award of qualifications appointment of internal and external examiners policies and procedures on examinations criteria for admission student discipline In a number of institutions there is another statutory body, namely the court. It provides a public forum where members of court can raise any matters about the university. Its powers vary between institutions, but typically include the following: consideration of the annual report of the university receiving the annual accounts (in most, but not all, cases) appointing the chancellor There also exist officers of the university whom fulfill necessary management and leadership roles. The chancellor is formally the lay head ofthe university and the chair of the court, and is largely a ceremonial role. The pro-chancellor (or one of the pro-chancellors if there is more than one) will normally be the chair of the governing body. There also includes the treasurer, the Head of the Institution (the chief academic and administrative officer of the university), and the registrar. In some of the post-1992 institutions, there exists the academic board, which is responsible for academic affairs, including academic standards, research, 27 I . A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education scholarship, teaching and learning, and courses at the institution, and for considering the development of the academic activities of the institution, subject to the overall responsibilities of the governing body and the head of the institution (HEFCE 2004). France University Governance in the United Kingdom (England) Provides orientation of curriculum, quality assuranCe and inspection, provision of qualifying examinations In France, theEi:itopean Union imposes several regulations (such as length of study, means of accessing specialties) for the .purpose of standardizing the recognition of medical qualifications across Europe. In alLmatters outside the European context, the organization of medical education is managed at a national level by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of\u00b7 Health. Rules adopted at the national level apply to all medical schools, including those that relate to selection of students, content of the curriculum, and examinations. Faculties of medicine have a central role in defining the medical curriculum; however, the must conform to national rules regarding the content, which are promulgated jointly by the Ministries of Health and Higher Education. In France there are no guidelines that provide principles and frameworks for curriculum design or outcomes comparable with the UK General Medical Council's report Tomorrow's Doctors: Recommendations on Undergraduate Medical Education (Segouin 2007). 28 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education The United States The United States uses a relatively hierarchical (\"unitary\") style and gives great power to Presidents and other executives of universities. Various supervision relationships between state governmentS and public and private institutions exist, with varying degrees of autonomy for decision-making processes (Society 2000). The fifty United States exercise substantial freedom to do what they wish in matters concerning higher education; as a result, policy and practice in the U.S. are diverse. States with a large private sector tend to give less emphasis to statewide planning and policy. Exactly half of the states have a statewide governing board for most or all public institutions; five U.S. states also have a state coordinating board for a functions (such as student assistance or granting operating authority) which span both public and private institutions. The remaining states have a statewide coordinating board, a \"buffer body\" between higher education and the state (Lingenfelter 2006). Statewide coordinating boards do planning and budgeting for higher education and frequently have responsibilities for authorizing any new programs or reviewing existing academic programs. They generally have no or a very limited role in personnel and institutional operations. Statewide governing boards are responsible for personnel decisions, institutional operations, and corporate governance. Coordinating and Governing Boards most commonly are appointed by Governors, In several states, however, Governing Boards are elected directly by the people. The states, however, are the \"owner-operators\" of public institutions, which enroll abol1t75% of the students in the United States. State policy and state appointed or elected governing boards determine priorities and set the conditions for governing and managing public institutions (Lingenfelter 2006). In the United States, governing boards composed of individuals not involved in teaching or research have historically controlled colleges and universities. These non-resident governing bodies are most often called boards of trustees, but also designated boards of directors, boards of governors, or boards of regents. The purpose of governing boards is to represent the public interest; particularly with regard to expenditures. They differ widely in size, varying from four, five or six members at some institutions, to over 100 at others. The boards of private independent institutions average about 23 members, while the boards of public institutions tend to be somewhat smaller. The reason for this is that there is a tendency for 29 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education private universities to appoint additional people who might bring in more funds for the institution. The boards of public universities are often provided for by law. Board members usually hold office for one year, although some are appointed for life (Perlman 1972). 5.4 The Private Sector of Higher Education An important and growing phenomenon in higher education is the expansion of private sector tertiary education facilities, with varying rates of growth in different regions. Over 80% of school level students in OECD and partner countries were enrolled in public schools in 2004. Only in Belgium, Chile and the Netherlands, does the private sector account for more students than the public sector. Significant private sectors (30-40%) \u00b7can be found in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mali, Pakistan, the Gambia and Togo. At independence in 1945, Indonesia had only 1,000 tertiary level students. It now has 57 public universities and more than 1,200 private tertiary institutions, with more than 60% enrolled in private institutions (Society 2000). The private sector dominates the tertiary education level in Belgium, Brazil, Korea and the Philippines. In Africa, a large part of the private sector includes \"clandestine\" schools that are not lic~nsed to operate. Private higher education institutions outside the US are usually of narrow scope, focusing on market-oriented and information technology, and employ teaching staff from public . on a basis. A major reason for the expansion of the private sector is the infhility~ ~fpublic finances to keep pace with the growing demand for higher education, dissatisfaction with the quality of public education (large class sizes, teach absenteeism, lack of supplies existence of more modem and job relevant curricula in the private sector, the politicizatio lie education, and favorable policy changes that facilitate the growth of private hig\\}~ education (Society 2000). According to Fielden (2008), the expansion of the private education sector has the potential to provide many benefits to various stakeholders in a country's higher education system. First, the private education sector can supplement the limited capacity of government institutions to absorb growth in school and higher education enrollments. Private education also provides opportunities for government to support publicly funded students in private schools, often at a lower cost than in the public sector. Examples of such a strategy exist in . Pakistan, the Philippines, and Uganda. More schools leads to more competition, and competition introduced through the expansion of the private sector often results in an increase 30 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education in both the efficiency and quality of education delivery for both public and private sectors. Greater management flexibility exists in the private sector, making it more responsive to market changes by developing appropriate curricula for the evolving needs of the country (Fielden 2008). In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the number of medical and nursing graduates doubled from 2001-2003, largely due to the private sector-led increase in the training of health workers (WHO 2006). The IFC has estimated that, given the public sector's resource constraints, there is a private investment opportunity of $1.7 billion in medical education in Africa (Preeker 2007). Yet there exists a list of common regulatory barriers for development of higher education's private sector. Barriers include: confused/unclear national policies, cumbersome/complex higher education registration processes, outdated criteria for accreditation, prohibition Of foreign-owned private education institutions, limits of the private sector to set tuition fees at market rates and earn profit, restrictions on religion/political aspects of curriculum(Society 2000). Fielden (2008) provides specific recommendations for a healthy. development and expansion of the higher education PR;~te, sector. First, national governments should provide a sound policy framt:Work (brthe op;~~~n of private education sector. One example of sound policy exists in Cote d~lv~~~:\u00b7,here tl;recently enacted Loi 95-696 declares education as a public service, but that privat~ 1 .\u00b7\u00b7 s:'ri1~:Y be grty).ted to play a substantial role in providing that <<:<.;<' service. Second, clear, ob eamli~ed criteria for establishing private education hy and complex registration processes may reduce access by deterring new provid or increasing their costs to such a degree that these institutions become unaffotdable to their clientele. National governments can provide assistance in the form of guidebooks on the registration process for higher education institutions. Examples of such strategies exist, such as the Commission for Higher Education in China, the Ghanaian National Accreditation Board, and the Tanzanian Commission for Universities (Fielden 2008). 5.5.1 Policy environments and tertiary medical education 5.5.2 Decision-making mechanisms 31 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education The relationship between higher education institution and government can be seen as principal-agent model, as the government (principal) usually delegates part of the decision\u00ad making authority to the institutions (agents). As a result, information asymmetries between government and institutions can create agency problems, as institutions can exploit their information to pursue other goals (Thorn 2004). In Higher Education in Developing Countries: Peril and Promise (2000), the Task Force on Higher Education and Society provides specific recommendations regarding decision-making structures for higher education institutions. Regarding internal governance, the governance of universities requires professionals who understand how institutions can best perform their academic duties. Individuals with advanced academic training and experience are the best choice. The faculty, student administrators and others should have a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities. Externally, the roles of ministries of education and higher education institutions must be clearly defined by law and in national policy documents (Society 2000). Society, as the source of university funding, has the right to be informed on the quality of university's performance. In France, important decisions concerning health and medical education are made at governmental levels, . ofessional organizations do not play as significant role as they done in North Arne~~~ (A Medical Association, Association of American Medical Colleges) or th~;u~itedKingd~ (General Medical Council). In many countries in sub- ~/n~~ Saharan Africa, the go the power to\u00b7 appoint and dismiss the Vice-Chancellor, in which higher education se even deans of departments b~~ome\u00b7 state-run systems. There are countries where \u00b7 ted, and where heads of institutions change with changes in government. In China)he presidents of the two leading institutions (Beijing and Tsinghua) are appointed by the state council, and usually act upon recommendation by the Communist government. In the former Soviet Union countries, hiring processes are often ad hoc and personnel are under the influence of high administrative officials in the President's Office or the Ministry of Education. Between the early 1980s and 1996, the number of higher education institutions in El Salvador increased from 6 to 42, most of them being \"garage\" universities, resulting from poor external governance and a lack of checks and balances on curriculum development (Society 2000). The Task Force on Higher Education and Society provides a list \"Tools for Achieving Good Governance\" of tertiary institutions. These tools include: 32 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Faculty Councils or (Senates), Governing Councils (Boards of Trustees), Clear ad concise budget practices and financial management, Data improvements for decision-making by taking advantage in informational technology gains, Appointment of decision-making positions versus election (appointment often leads to potential lack of widespread support, but can quicken decision-making process, while election can lead to greater support, but the elected m~.X .be unqualified to govern institution); External review in faculty appointments and promotion decisions, security of employment, which allows faculty to have greater academic freedom, Sufficient faculty compensation and responsibilities (higher education faCulty have market-desired skills, and outside activities often detract from performance and weaken commitment to the institution -moving to a system of full-time employment may be useful, combined with clear limits on outside activity), Visiting Committees and accreditation (which promote institutional quality and provide focus for improving standards), and Institutional Charters and Handbooks (Society 2000); 5.5.3 Policy cycles for higher education Policy cycles for the management and reform of higher education sectors varies around the world; In Brazil, the government has a three-pronged strategy for improving higher education: (i) to change the legal framework of the sector, (ii) to change to a performance\u00ad based funding system, and (iii) to improve capacity to evaluate the quality of instruction and performance of the institutions. The reform began in 1996 with the government's Natir!nal Education Law, creating a new category of institutions, \"university centers.\" The law also allows universities to define their own personnel policies, to hire and fire staff directly, and to manage budgets according to their needs. It also makes room for the framework of a national evaluation system, through which the federal government can monitor and guarantee the quality of education. Funding changes have been made too. Federal institutions are now paid on block grants, on the basis of performance contracts. For the private system, it would provide loans targeted to students who could not afford to pay tuition. Students will be able to only use these loans at private institutions (Bank 2002). 33 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education In China, medical institutions appear to be governed by usual Western academic structure (Presidents, Deans, and Department Chairs). However, there are also Party officials appointed to each level of the university, who often hold more power than the academic administrators do. Recently, in all higher education institutions throughout the country, it has been decided that the administrative responsibility lies with the Presidents, who have to act under the leadership of the Communist Party Committees headed by the Party Secretaries, leading to a very complex decision-making mechanism (Schwarz~~ojtczak eta!. 2004). There are two levels of governance in China's tertiary education system. The first is the state administration. The State Council and the Ministry of Education prgyide macro\u00ad guidance to provincial governments and other ministries in terms of educati~~iiJ'principles, policies, education budget allocations, and develo!)ing plans?>:,,The second level is the provincial administration (including local governments and ministries), accountable for direct administration and management (OECD 2007). The goals of China's tertiary education system are decreed in the Higher Education Law (HEL) and the Vocational Education Law. The HEL states that \"higher education must implement the educational policy of the state, serve socialist modernization, integrate itself with social production, and cultivate the educated to be morally, intellectually, and physically sound builders and successors of the socialist cause.\" The tertiary education system is governed, regulated and financed by the Ministry of Education. The MOE is responsible for implementing relevant laws, regulations, principles and policies made by the state; setting specific educational policies and regulations; planning natjgnal educational development, coordinating the undertakings of the various government ageJ!Cies pertaining to education; mapping out and guiding the systematic : reform of ed:ugation. The State Council and local governments are also responsible fo[g9verning as per administrative hierarchy and a division of labor among them (Lam 2006). 34 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education University Governance in Uganda In Uganda, there exists the University and Other Institutions Act, which established a National Council for Higher Education to assure quality in all tertiary institutions, and delegating jurisdiction over tertiary education to the Higher Education Department within the Ministry of Education and Sciences. In public institutions, the governing body is comprised of the governing council (executive body) and an academic board (academic affairs). The principal of the institution is the secretary to the governing council and chairperson to the academic board. He/she is appointed by the Ministry of Education and Sports from a list of three forwarded by the council. While premier institutions enjoy some autonomy, most public institutions are micro-managed by the Ministry of Education and Sports. Financial autonomy is limited. Universities have more freedom in the management of their curriculum as compared to other tertiary institutions. The Ugandan government has not used any explicit mechanisms to promote private education. It doesn't provide any tax incentives for private institutions, nor does it channel any public funds to private institutions (Liang 2004). There was no overall framework to tertiary education until 200 1, when the government passed the Universities and other Tertiary Institutions Act The Act defined 'tertiary' and 'higher' to include both public and private universities and other tertiary institutions that provide post-secondary (post A-level) education. The Act's goal is to establish a system of governing institutions of higher education so that the same or similar courses offered by different institutions of higher education are made equal across the system, while respecting each institution's autonomy and academic freedom. Based on the Act, at the central level there are three bodies now supervising tertiary education, although there is little communication or collaboration among the departments. There is no functioning quality assurance mechanism (Liang 2004). 5.6 Accreditation systems for te~i~~'lriledica6 education According to the '\"'Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), accreditation is defirted as \"a voluntary process of evaluation and review based on published, standards and following a prescribed\u00b7 process,performed by a non-governmental agency of peers\" (ACGJV1ij2,Q08). It is a process for discerning and publicly recognizing good ~=~~~ ;~:::-~;~'\"~;:;!~4!':::::~~:::::~::;!~,~:~:! ::~::~ --\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7~a~'E:~ system and then you go down the road with the I leading to the M.D. degre.ein U.S. and Canadian medical schools. The LCME is sponsored l,;;,;~;~:~G~Don~~-\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7--~~\"L by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association. The usual full accteditation period lasts for eight years. U.S. medical residency programs are accredited by the h!\\:'Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education. In the United State.~, _the 1\\<::<::r~~i!a.tion _G_~uncil_f<;>r_Qr_ad11~t~ .M~di<::aJ g_d\\1<::1!tio_11_(i\\_G_Q~),_ . and the organization of certifying boards (the American Boards of Medical Specialists), have agreed on six areas in which all physicians should be competent, and that should be covered in Graduate Medical Education: (i) patient care, (ii) medical knowledge, (iii) practice-based learning and improvement, (iv) professionalism, (v) interpersonal skills and communication, 35 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education and (vi) systems-based practice (Batalden, Leach et a!. 2002). In the United States, residency programs must be ACGME accredited to receive government funding in support of GME and to enable their graduates to qualify for specialty certification. Increasingly, certification is a required qualification for employment as a physician. For several years, it had been noted that more of the graduate medical education process needed to occur in ambulatory settings. Graduate medical education is specifically focused on the progression of medical students through the \"Dryfus\" competency stages, which are: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. This is seen in the progression from a4variced beginners (medical school graduates) to fully competent physicians. Residency offers training to move from proficient to expert (Batalden, Leach et a!. 2002). 36 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education In Europe, a revolutionary . approach to accreditation of institutions and portability certification has been in development in recent years. The Bologna Process aims to create a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) by 2010, in which students can choose from a wide and transparent range of high quality courses and benefit from smooth recognition procedures (Linden 2008). The overarching aim of the EIIEA is to promote mobility, attract students and staff from Europe as well as from other parts of the world, and be internationally competitive. It aims to do this by facilitating greater comparability and compatibility between the diverse higher education systems and institutions across Europe, as well as \u00b7by enhancing their quality. Today, forty-six countries participate in the Bologna Process. Starting at a non-binding agreement at European level (the 1999 Bologna Declaration), the Bologna Process has initiated sweeping reforms in high~r education across Europe at system and institutional level (Bologna 2008). Today, higher education institutions in Europe are rethinking and fine-tuning elements of the many objectives and initiatives that were introduced during th~ past several years. To date, most progress has occurred in the areas of undergraduate access to the next educational cycle and in external quality assurance systems. Additionally, there are several policy areas where attention is currently ~S:;i, including improving information on the EHEA, enhancing '/iff:#t\"/i'fi(' ~:: '/ ' ' worldwide attractiveness an' higher education, strengthening /\"\" cooperation bas~'d ners 'ntensifying policy dialogue, and furthering .~.\"\"'~'\u00b7 . of qualifications. The \u00b7~l:llsion topis%'among Bologna member countries include how to emphasize the life-I \u00b7. in~ ~l~ment, and whether the EHEA should remain as a ,'Structure, or be put on a more formal basis. :r w The Bologna Process in the European Union The Bologna Process has an objective to structure higher education along three cycles (Bachelor\u00ad Master-PhD). In 2005, Ministers adopted an overarching Framework for Qualifications in the European Higher Education Area comprising three cycles, and they agreed to develop national qualifications frameworks that are compatible with the overarching framework. Access to the second cycle (Master) usually requires successful completion of first cycle studies (Bachelor), lasting a minimum of three years. The degree awarded after the first cycle should also be relevant to the labor market (Bologna 2008). The Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area adopted by Ministers in 2005 and commonly referred to as European Standards and Guidelines (ESG) provide guidance on quality assurance to agencies and institutions. The European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR) set up in 2008 is designed to list those agencies which operate in accordance with the ESG and the appropriate national legal provisions. Tools that facilitate the recognition of qualifications are the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and the Diploma Supplement. The ECTS balances a program's average workload with the learning outcomes and competencies to be achieved (Commission 2008). 37 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education As Southeastern European countries aim to enter the European Union, they must comply with Bologna Process protocol and requirements, leading to local quality assurance mechanisms that are often rigid and only focusing on evaluation and accreditation of institutions. Linden (2008) notes that both Tuzla University inBosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the University of Montenegro, have improved their performance by becoming legally integrated into the European Higher Education Area (Linden 2008). Elsewhere in Europe, when focusing on quality assurance, the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom and the Irish Medical Council in Ireland tend to focus less on program evaluation and more at the institutional level. Germany has been noted to be moving in the same direction, while its \"Berlin Communique\" stresses that higher education institutions bear the key responsibility for the quality of the education they provide. The \"Irish Model\" is one in which external quality assurance is largely self-organized by universities (Linden 2008) In India, accreditation of medical schools by the Medical Council of India (MCI) is compulsory, but the request information emphasizes documentation of infrastructure and students or patients measures the quality of medical education and outcomes. medical school administration. Information from faculty, e accreditation process (Supe A 2006). achievement of all graduating stu Re-accreditation Provao -National Exam of Courses tests the in the 13 most widely followed career courses (admin, law, engineering, medicine, etc.). Students are required to take the exam but are not judged on it. There also exists external institutional evaluation by SESU, the National Council for Education (Bank 2002). In Chile, institutions are accredited to one of four categories: full autonomy, accredited, examined or supervised. Full autonomy institutions have the freedom to plan and organize programs, designate personnel and administer the budget. There currently exist 25 traditional councils of the rector universities that have been granted full autonomy. Since 1999, provisionary national accreditation commissions have set standards and granted formal recognition to programs at the graduate and undergraduate level based on self-assessments and external peer-review processes (Thorn 2004). 38 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Accreditation in Indonesia In Indonesia, the National Accreditation Board was established in 1994 to provide objective information. The four most established universities were asked to submit a plan for autonomy, as a pilot project for university autonomy. Before, public universities were established as government service units under the Ministry of National Education, having limited autonomy and had to comply with all prevailing regulations applied for a government service unit. In 1999, the government made it possible for public universities to change their legal status by submitting a plan for autonomy. A set of criteria and procedure is defined by the Ministry of National Education. Once accepted, universities will go through a 5 year transition phase towards autonomy. Under the new decree, university internal governance will consist of the Board of Trustees, Academic Senate, Audit Board, Rector, and other institutional actors (Brodjonegoro 2001 ). Accreditation organizations have also begun to take shape in sub-Saharan Africa. In Sudan, the Sudan Medical Council and the Ministry of Higher Education are the two regulatory bodies of medical education. They have developed standards for medical education and accreditation systems for medical institutions and programs, as well as self-evaluation and quality assurance units in various medical schools. They have also adopted the World atin (WFME) Trilogy of Global Standards for quality improvement in (Fahal 2007). Other examples of national accreditation bodies include ~.a Medj~al and Dental Council, the Medical and Dental ,. . j!MJ''4\u00b7,, , Nigeria's National Univ.i 1,S'er~io~t;Je\u00b7fllealth Africa, the Medical Council of ,, . . the Tanzanian Commission for Universities. In the medical school accreditation system (F AlMER 2008). In West Africa; the West African Health Organization (WAHO) has established regional health colleges that act as accreditation agencies for undergraduate, graduate, and post\u00ad graduate training and education. These include the West Africa College of Physicians, the West African College of Surgeons, and the West African College of Nursing, Both the College of Physicians ~nd the College of Surgeons are part of the West African Post-graduate Medical College (WAPMC), which is the largest agency providing certification for medical specialization in the region. Licensed medical practitioners from W AHO member states are eligible for placement through fellowship examinations. (WAHO 2008). 39 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 5. 7 Quality assurance mechanisms The wave of new national certifying bodies that were developed during the 1990s in Latin America and are now currently emerging in sub-Saharan Africa are part of a trend of quality assurance, a term given to a systematic review process that determines whether a higher education institution meets standards of education, scholarship and infrastructure (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008)~ The goal of accreditation of higher education institutions is to ensure that education processprovided by institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality. It is also an essential mechanism for securing public trust. Countries have approached accreditation of tertiary education systems through various approaches and strategies. Conducted primarily by ministries of education or delegated councils, accreditation requires facilities fu ge,nerate evidence in support of performance objectives related to the training process. A recent survey of medical schools shows that accreditation programs are spread unevenly -the~ exist in three quarters of Mediterranean countries, just under half in the countries of Southeast Asia, and only about a third of African countries. Private schools are less likely than public ones to undergo accreditation procedures (WHO 2006). Quality assurance mechanisms may allow governments to develop a more effective public\u00ad private provider mix by licensing higher education institutions that meet acceptance standards. Such j)rograms may be run by government bodies, such as in El Salvador and Nepal, or by external third parties, as in the Philippines and Ghana. Regional accreditation bodies have begun to spring up, as in the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and Other Health Professions, established in 2003. Another example is the nursing school accreditation framework developed by the East, Central, and Southern Africa College of Nursing (Task F()rce for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). Stages of Quality Assurance for Tertiary Education Institutions 40 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education To ensure maintained standards of quality, the state may impose an external audit review. Failure of such reviews may lead to closure of institutions. 5.8 Certification and licensing In many countries, certification and licensing exams are required upon completion of tertiary medical training programs.. Certification involves a process to provide assurance to the public that a certified medical specialist has successfully completed an approved educational program and an evaluation, including an examination process designed to assess the knowledge, experience and skills requisite to the provision of high quality care in a particular specialty. In the United States, medical school students must pass three stages of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) for certification to practice medicine. Step 1 assesses whether students understand and can apply important concepts of the sciences basic to the practice of medicine, with special emphasis on principles and mechanisms underlying health, disease, and modes of therapy. Step 2 of the USMLE assesses the ability of examinees to apply medical knowledge, skills, and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision, and includes emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. Step 3 assesses whether examinees can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine, with emphasis on patient management in ambulatory settings. The USMLE is supervised and implemented by the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME). National licensing examinations also exist throughout Western Europe, and are usually taken upon completion of medical school curriculum. In France, until 2005 the university diploma awarded at the end of training functioned as the certification that authorizes clinical practice. Recent reforms have introduced a law making continuing to advanced training a requirement for practice, as well as a set of competences programs and practice evaluation procedures (Segouin 2007). Yet fewer than 60% of 41 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education developing countries require graduating medical students to pass national certification exams, and iri Africa and South East Asia, the figure drops below 40% (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). 42 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 6.1 Financial flows in Tertiary Medical Education There is clear evidence that most governments in developing countries retain control over health worker training, and one instrument of regulation is financial control of training institutes. Section 6 discusses financing methods for tertiary medical education. In 2001 African Heads of State committed themselves at a meeting in Abuja to devoting a minimum of 15% of government funds to the health sector in order to address the massive burden of ill\u00ad health facing countries in Africa, particularly within the context of a growing burden ofHIV, AIDS, TB and malaria. Documentation following progress on this commitment suggests that government funding for pre-service training has in fact been stagnant or falling over the last two decades, directly contributing to the anticipated failure to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Africa. In many ca~:>es, the training of a skilled workforce has been seen merely as recurrent expenditure in country, rather.than in terms of long-term capital investment (Robson 2005). 6.2 Allocation of resources In Innovations in Tertiary Education Financing: A Comparative Evaluation of Allocation (2006) present various forms of innovative financing It has been noted that there is a current evolution in public recurrent expenditures and capital investment, via the governments and public institutions, A few examples include: the creation of . ::~!:~ vouchers will be given to all students for institution operating subsidies; the implementation of performance based allocation mechanisms; , financing university-based research separate from instruction; the substantial expansion of financial aid for students with high level financial need; and the growth of student loans (Salmi 2006). In tertiary education, there exist two groups of funding: direct funding and indirect fU!nding. Direct funding includes funding for instruction, operation, and investments. It is usually allocated through negotiated or ad hoc budgets such as line-item budgets or block grants, but can also include categorical or earmarked funds (such as the US Title III for minority students). Funding formulas are often based on basic inputs, such as staff or students. In Poland, funding formulas are based on the number of students enrolled and the 43 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education number of full time teaching staff that hold PhDs. In the United States and England, formulas are often based on actual or normative costs per student. Tennessee uses a benchmarking system for funding allocation. Priority-based funding is another method of allocation that reflects national and regional based needs, such as critical labor force needs. Simple criteria systems exist in France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. In France, 50% of funding is based on the students enrolled, while Denmark uses the \"taximeter\" model, allocating 30% to 50% of funding based on the number of students who pass an exam. In the Netherlands, 50% of funding is based on output criteria, as it rewards student degree completion based on 2 year averages for higher education institutions (Salmi 2006). Another method of direct funding includes performance-based funding. Performance contracts exist in France, Finland, Colorado, Spain, while \"performance set asides\" are used in South Africa. Competitive funds have been introduced in many countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Chile, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, Mozambique, and Sri Lanka. Payments for results formulas have been developed in recent years. They have been implemented in England (number of students to complete 1 year of study), Denmark (the \"taximeter\" model), the Netherlands (number of degrees awarded), and South Africa (number the number of graduates). Results-based funding is defined JliLJ,,15,.,u, on achieved rather than promised results. The stit:ution:al performance presupposes credible and timely when they mirror the indicators. Indicators are most effectives the higher education sector. Indicator can l1,l\u00a3i'!Jl!'Uts (efficiency- maximizing the quantity of outputs in relation to inputs), and (iv) out~omes (effectiveness- maximizing outcomes in relation to outputs). The United Kingdom separates indicators for teaching and research, which may reduce complexity and allows evaluation criteria and follow-up processes to be closely tailored to each sub-system (Salmi 2006). Results-based contracts have been introduced in France and Finland. Since 1989, France's Ministry of Education has asked for universities to provide \"four-year plans\" in addition to simple input formula, resulting in four year contracts between the Ministry and universities. The process includes a public discussion on how public funding will be spent and tied to results, but agreements are usually between university presidents and the Ministry of Education. In 2000, 188 institutions (75% of tertiary enrollment) were involved in contract 44 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education funding. On average, results-based funding comprises one-third of total public subsidies for tertiary education. In Finland, performance contract funding is on average 3-5% of operational expenditure for tertiary institutions. At a national level, funding for higher education is divided between core funding, performance funding, and funding for specific initiatives. There exists an intensive budget dialogue involving lower management levels and regular reporting between universities and the Ministry of Education throughout the contract period. Universities send in proposals, including an activity and finance plan for a three year period. The Ministry of Education and universities then enter into a dialogue to identify targets and evaluation criteria. As can be noted in the Finland case> performance contracts place a high demand on the capacity of supervisory au~!10rities to engage in an evidence\u00ad based dialogue with institutions (Salmi 2006). Rewarding performance through performance-based funding can be challenging to administer. The main features of performance budgeting that distinguish it from traditional budgeting systems are: (i) the greater focus on the achievement of public program objectives and their alignment with government policies; and(ii) an emphasis on holding senior officials accountable for deliverables. This is often accompanied by a change in the nature of expenditure controls, a':Va;Y from detailed 'line item' input controls to one where managers are held accountable and the use of inputs. Such a system assumes a direct and tight relationsh ent agencies and higher education institutions, and rarely allows for discretionary ... in light of budget constraints or political necessities. Performance i ed bu~~eting offers a less rigid financing structure, yet still retaining considerable influence way in which governments can orient the functioning of tertiary education institutions ( ld Bank Public Sector and Governance Unit, 2008). In 2001, there was a total of37 US states with performance funding (19), performance informed budgeting (27), or both (9) (Salmi 2006). Multiple performance criteria are used in the United States, Argentina and South Africa. In Tennessee, 6% of the higher education budget is based on performance criteria. Universities compete against their own record, based on 4 standards and 10 indicators which are revised every 5 years. In Argentina, an objective budget is established to close gaps between real budget needs for ideal quality and efficiency, and actual budget allocation based on historical budgets. Schools are evaluated based on the number of effective students, pedagogically adequate teacher/student ratios, and teacher's salary scale. In South Africa, the 45 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Ministry of Education publishes an annual statement which determines how performance criteria will be calculated and weighted, looking specifically at teaching inputs, teaching outputs, research outputs, and institutional factors. The Ministry has also introduced an additional competitive fund for institutional development (Salmi 2006). A wards through results based or performance informed budgeting can be based on numerous indicators, including: each unit delivered, degree an institution reaches agreed targets, inter-institutional benchmarking. The first and second options install strong inc~ntives for performance that are easy to communicate, but they presuppose reliable and timely data collection, while the third possibility facilitates competition but does not allow fo~ institution specific indicators. Methods for initiating results based funding could involve: legislation mandating the system and specifying evaluation criteria, legislation mandating the system and establishing the framework for decision makers and institutional management to agree on indicators and reward mechanisms supervisory authorities in collaboration with institutional management voluntarily agree on and adopt a new results based funding system (Thorn 2004). There are various methods for indirect funding as well. Demand-side vouchers have been introduced, where students and/or families receive a coupon which represents a certain amount of money to be used exclusively for education related expenses. Demand-side vouchers have been introduced in both the Republic of Georgia and Brazil Government grants and scholarships are also used. France and francophone countries use administrative funds, where eligible students receive money directly from a specialized government agency, such as the CNOUS in France. Need-based grants and scholarship can be used, where students can become eligible for social scholarships based on student and family income. Tax benefits, such as tuition offsets and family allocations are another method. Other forms of indirect funding that have yet to be fully experimented with include a graduate tax for all 46 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education graduating students, as well as \"human capital contracts\" where the private sector invests in. the production of graduates with relevant skills to their field of work (Salmi 2006). Finally, student loans are yet another form of indirect funding, including repayment plans, such as mortgage-type repayments, graduated and extended repayment, and income contingent repayments Potential sources of funding for student loans include private sources such as commercial banks (Canada, Chile, China, South Korea, United States) and public sources (Canada, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, US). There exist internally-financed student loans, as well as deferred payment loans. Expenses covered by loans can include: (i) tuition fees only, (ii) loans primarily for living expenses only, and (iii) loanstO.pay for both tuition and living expenses (Salmi 2006). In recent years there has been much discussion about introducing student loan programs in sub-Saharan Africa. According to (Bollag 2004), the imposition of student fees should be accompanied by a program of means-tested grants, including a student contribution via a student loan program. Such student loan programs must be equipped with the legal authority to collect loan payments, technology to maintain accurate records, employ collectors who can track borrowers and verify financial conditions, and enlist the government's tax collecting authority and employers in the collection of repayments. Student loan programs should incorporate a genuine low earnings protection that follows an income contingent form of repayment obligation. It should be noted that several low income countries have introduced loan programs in recent years, and in most cases, few loans were ever repaid (Bollag 2004). 6.3 Financial control and monitoring There are considerable differences between the financial management required from the state in a system of centralized control and one where full financial autonomy to higher education institutions has been granted. A centralized control model requires more significant staffing in the Ministry of Education or other tutelary ministries. The table below illustrates what the varying positions might be as regards financial control, ranging from institutional autonomy at one end of the spectrum to central government control at the other (Fielden 2008). Different Approaches to Financial Control 47 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Expenditure Under-spending at the end of an accounting period \"Line item control\" so that institutions cannot switch expenditure between the agreed budget headings Surrender of all under-spent MOE/MOF External earnings Surrender to the MOF or MOE from non-government external earnings sources Fees cannot be charged or, if \u00b7 to Tuition fees for domestic \"local,\" domestic \"international\" and out students are, have to be set at a fixed rate aild then submitted to the MOF (Fielden 2008) Agreed by the Board (but possibly reported to MOE or the buffer Total spend as required within the overall total grant or budget awarded by the MOE Freedom to carry spending (and to absorb any overspending;; from futnre funds within limits) Fee levels can be set freely and the money retained without . affecting the budget allocation from the government 48 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education lh7.1 Socio-economic characteristics of the tertiary medical education sector To understand any higher medical education sector, it is important to understand the socio\u00ad economic characteristics of the faculty and staff of tertiary institutions, as well as the student body. Understanding the age, gender and economic composition of teacher and student bodies can provide insight into levels of equity in access to higher education, as well as social and cultural norms that orient who participates in the tertiary medic~t'training. Section 7 describes general socio-economic characteristics of student and tea,cher bodies participating in higher medical education. 7.2 Faculty, teachers, and trainer$ The social composition of faculty, teachers and trainers participating in tertiary medical education plays a large role in the quality of education produced. At the same time, governance arrangements and financing level.s for higher education often orient the number and type of trainers at higher education institutions: The following examples from around the world highlight various strategies used to recruit and train healtlteducation instructors. In Macedonia,tli~'~$,tJ.tdent-teacher ratio was 4.18 in 2005, compared to 2.72 in the Royal Free Hospital Medical School in London, 6.76 in Zagreb, Croatia, and 1.9 in Split, Croatia (Donev 2()04). At the Aga ~han University in Pakistan, medical teachers are trained as Community Health Doc.tors upon entering the program. Each physician attends a six-week \"mini-master's degreei~public health, acting as an orientation to community health practice. Following orientation, faculty members join a field team. While as instructors, they teach classroom ami field tutorials in the medical college (Bryant, Marsh et al. 1993). In India, national teacher training centers (NTTC) were established in 1974 at medical colleges \u00b7-.\u00b7\u00b7:\u00b7\"'\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7'\" throughout India. They were funded by the World Health Organization and the government of India until 1999, when funding authorization was not renewed, presumably because of national spending constraints (Supe A 2006). In public universities in Uganda, the Ministry of Public Service (MOPS) helps determine the number of established posts for each public university, which are then financed by the Ministry of Finance. However, once the number of government posts is established, 49 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education appointments and promotions are made by the university. There is no regulation to stop universities from hiring additional staff on their own budgets. For non-university public institutions, including technical and vocational institutes, the Education Service Commission (ESC) makes the appointments of both academic and non-academic staff. The MOES then makes the subsequent allocation of staff to individual institutions, with only limited involvement by the institution. In public universities, promotion criteria depend heavily on a candidate's publication output. This seems inappropriate when the majority of work by academic staff is related to teaching and not research. There is \u00b7strong pressure on all academic staff to seek a PhD, leading to staff taking more time off teaching, and leading the curriculum to become more theoretical and less practical. One third of the faculty who responded to the questionnaire were female. The average tertiary lecturer was 41 years old, ha~ taught for 9.6 years, and had stayed in the current institution for 8 years, indicating a low staff turnover. About 42% had a master's degree, 35% only a bachelor's, and tO% had a PhD. More than half have earned a teaching certificate. Many schools have very low student\u00ad teacher ratios (2-6 on average), while Makerere and Uganda Polytechnic Kyambogo have more reasonable ratios: 19 for the former and 18 for the latter. In the case of medicine, there are only 3 students per faculty, the lowest ratio in all faculties in Makerere (Liang 2004). In . the United S members betw departments. 60% of of professor or associate p'i a 13.25% increase in the number of full-time faculty 18% were in the basic sciences and 82% in clinical fac:U~:j'Ji;eJn!ber~\u00b7in basic science departments held the ranks mplire~ with 43% in clinical departments. In 2003 the racial/ethnic composition \u00b7 e faculty was 75% white, 12.8% Asian/pacific and Etzel2003). 7.3.1 Students The socio-economic makeup of students participating in tertiary medical education can highlight equity issues in accessibility to training. Governance arrangements and financing levels for higher education can also orient the number and type of students found at higher education institutions. The following examples from around the world highlight trends in student participation in higher education and tertiary medical training. 50 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education In recent decades, increased enrollment in secondary education, due to investments in primary education, has led to a larger body of potential tertiary students around the world. From 1965 to 1995, the secondary gross enrollment ratio increased from 16% to 47% in Brazil, 5% to 32% in Nigeria, and from 12% to 30% in Pakistan. Between 1965 and 1995, the female share of enrollment in higher education in developing countries grew from 32% to 45% (Society 2000). In ASEAN countries, there are more female than male medical students in 68% of the schools, but proportionally more male students in 16% of the schools (Zubair Amin 2005). Very little information from low and middle income countries is available about student attrition rates or the factors that contribute to attrition across institutions, but the limited evidence available points to as much as 20\u00b730% of the student body not completing courses because of poor academic performance, financial constraints and other personal circumstances including health .,~roblems and inadequate housing (WHO 2006). The profiles of students entering health professions rarely reflect national profiles of social, linguistic and ethnic diversity, as students are disproportionately admitted from higher social classes and dominant ethnic groups in society. Strategies to improve admission policies option, (ii) speci \u00b7 -<.!\u00b7; (iii) expanded sele who might not consider health professional training to be an for under-represented students in secondary schools, and riteridrlb offer admission to students with personal attributes that . s (WHO 2006). In 2008. the Participation Rate2 the LAC region was only16%, while in high-income countries the rate reached 24%. Rates were as high as 21% in Colombia and 19% in Mexico, while as low as 12% and 10% in Brazil and Peru, respectively. The education Attainment Rate (for population 25-3~ years) was as high as 26% in Anglophone countries and as low as 8% in the LAC region. Colombia has the highest attainment rate in LAC with 11%, while Peru has the lowest with 7% (Murakami 2008). 2 The Participation Rate is (defmed as the participation rate of the 4 year age group with the highest participation rate) 51 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education The Education Equity Index (EEI)3, which measures socio-demographic determinants of access tci education (which traditional indicators have difficulties capturing), evaluates the socio-economic status of students with access to tertiary education. In a recent World Bank Study (Murakami 2008), the LAC region had the lowest EEl scores in the study. BraZil and Mexico have the lowest EEl scores with scores of 12 and 17, while the Netherlands and the United Kingdom received the highest score, at 67 and 64, respectively. Why is there so much inequity in access to tertiary education in Latin America? Cited causes include: (i) the region's overall inequality, (ii) inequality in graduation rates o[secondary education, (iii) affordability of tertiary education, (iv) government and institutional p9licies favoring access to low-income students, (v) efficiency of the tertiary edupation system, (vi) composition of tertiary education supply, and (vii) the overall participation rate. Another. measurement of study body demographics is the Gender Parity Index4 (GPI).In the same study, the LAC region received a GPI score of 0.02, while high-income countries receiv:ed a average GPI score of 0.16. HICs have gender balances of 1.18-1.35, implying that females make up 55- 60% of student body (Murakami 2008). Gender Parity Index~ Gross Enrollment Ratio, Tertiary Year ~Brazil llChile Colombia 1m Cuba \u00aelMexico '&Peru 3 The EEl uses the parental education level as a measure of socio-economic status. Succinctly, the formula for EEl is the ratio of students' SES to the SES of the general population. Generating EEl requires two indicators: ( i) the percentage of students in tertiary education whose fathers' have a tertiary education degree. This measures theSES of the student population, and (ii) the percentage of men aged 45-64 who have a tertiary education degree, which measures the SES of the general population. The index is a ratio of the first indicator to the second indicator, and then multiplied by 100, which produces the EEl score. The higher the EEl score, the more theSES of the student population resembles that of the general population between the ages of 45 and 65. Hence access to tertiary education is deemed more equitable (Murakami, (2008). 4 The Gender Parity Index is which is defined as the ratio of the number of female students enrolled at a given level of education to the number of male student the same level 52 A Global Perspectite on Tertiary Medical Education Source: (UNESCO 2008) 7.3.3 Southeastern Europe The latest available gross tertiary enrollment rates in Southeastern Europe countries whom are not members of the EU show them to be 15% or more behind the countries in Central and Eastern Europe (Linden 2008). 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Higher Education enrollments (gross, percent of population aged 19-24), 2005 (Linden 2008) Enroll111ent rates ip . secondary and higher education provide a misleading picture of the supply of graduates to the labor market, however, due to high dropout rates and low graduation rates. While 70% of the relevant age cohort in Montenegro enters tertiary educati~~ less than 20% of students graduate on time in Serbia, and only 15-20 percent do in Croatia. 'Nb:il~. these co}!Jitries may be outliers for the region, the numbers still remain '-'~>\u00b7, \u00b7. ,:,:, shocking, as the ()ECD average dropout rate is much lower at only 30%. Countries in Southeastern Euro~~also face significant declines in the size of the age cohorts attending all phases of education, a trend that will likely further reduce the number of highly skilled graduates entering the labor market in the future. By 2025, the population of young people entering higher education for the first time is projected to decline (Linden 2008). In Macedonia, at one time, 400 students were enrolled per year, but the number has reduced to near 150. Although there is still a high number of unemployed doctors due to a continuous 53 J A Global Perspecfive on Tertiary Medical Education surplus of graduates, the interest for studying medicine is still strong. Many of the most prominent secondary students apply to medical school.

I\\.1()reover, females have less access to the more competi~ive programs, such as medicine, commerce, agriculture, etc. There is a significantly low\u00b7~fdportion of female educatori in the tertiary sector as well. This proportion is comparable to most develo~.ing countries in Asia and Africa, albeit lower than Botswana (47%) and South Africa (48~)and other industrialized countries. At Makerere, only 30% of medical students are female, having increased since 1989, when the proportion was only I:i%; Enrollment in technical colleges remains low, indicating that these institutions are operating below capacity, and/or that the programs are low quality or irrelevant. Ugandan females are least represented in technical colleges (4%). About two-thirds of total enrollment in universities ate pure private enrollment and fee paying students. In other non-university tertiary institution~,{i~cluding health worker training institutes), it is estimated that less than 25% of students are fee paying (Liang 2004). 54 j A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 1.40 1.20 1.00 0.60 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.00 (UNESCO 2008) Gender Parity Index -Gross Enrollment Rate, Tertiary Sub-Saharan Africa W.Burklna Faso \u00a7\u00a7Ghana lesotho WN!ger i:WN!gerla f.<' South Africa Tertiary Institutions enrollment in Uganda, by gender, Octob\u00a2r 2003 7.3.5 The United States In the United States, there was a 3.5% decline in applicants between 2001 and 2002, and a 21.8% decrease since 1997.

Regarding the enrolled population, during 2002~2903 49 .l% of the enrolled were women, where 11.6% were minority groups. 85.7% of the enrolled population completed their degree in 4 years or less. The average total educational debt of indebted was $103,855, up from $80,462 in 1997 (Barzansky and Etzel 2003). 55 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 8.1 Tertiary medical education and the labor market Recent literature has provided us with evidence that there exists a robust relationship between higher education and the labor market for graduates. The same holds true for tertiary medical education, as can be seen from recent trends around the world. This section provides an overview of the relationship between changes in tertiary education systems and trends and fluctuations in national and international labor markets. While some countries face the challenge of increasing numbers of health professionals emigrating to other countries for better working and living conditions, other countries face the paradox of having an adequate number of health workers while confronting severe difficulties in keeping those workers in the places they are most needed, particularly in remote and rural areas. Research conducted by the World Bank since the early 1990s shows that the development of higher education is correlated with economic development. The ability of a society to produce, select, adapt, com~ercialize, and use knowledge is critical for sustained economic growth and improved living standards. Human capital in general, and in particular tertiary education, has been shown to be crucial for supporting innovation and competitiveness. Market advocates argue that workforce allocation problems are solved more efficiently when to interact (Linden 2008). However, the th care is far fronra normal good and often leads to market ,llffiitP:lJ';:4ind demand, not needs. Demand for health workers tends to be driven lie sedt~~\u00b7budgets based on historical levels and political forces. When policy interventioft~are.implemented to increase the supply of labor and bring it closer to country needs, care has t~ be taken to ensure that new workers will encounter a job market that can effectively deploy them. This requires creating an appropriate fiscal space for employment and the finances to do so. Training alone, without the corresponding correctives on the demand side, is likely to have no effect or backfire. Mismatches between the education provided and the capabilities required in the job market contribute to high graduate unemployment rates in Africa, exceeding 20% in 9 of the 23 countries in which labor market data is available (Bank 2008). Recruitment from public training to the private sector may play a substantial role in the labor market. Losses to other sectors, including private for-profit health sector, run between 15%-40% per annum according to estimates from Ghana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique (Robson 2005). 56 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education A recent World Bank paper on Columbia's tertiary education system brought light to changes in labor demand that have been associated with market liberalization and increased integration of developing countries into the global economy. The literature documents an increased convexity of the earnings function. That is, the return to one additional year of schooling rises with the years of completed schooling. Or in other words, a skilled worker earns increasingly more than an unskilled worker. In recent years, the LAC region countries have experienced a shift in labor demand favoring highly skilled workers. In Colombia, there still exits a mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the demands of the economy, and is a prime\u00b7 force behind the high unemployment rate. Relative to LAC context, the quality of tertiary education in Colombia is average, but insufficient compared to industrialized countries (Bloom 2002). ~ )):\"-.::, In Colombia, a worker with a higher education degree \"earns US$403, 275% more than the average worker and 650% the wage of a worker with no education. From 1982-2000, tertiary .education graduates experienced a 28% increii~ein real wages, ~bileworkers with primary and secondary schooling experienced 11-12% decrease .and workers with no education increase in the supply 1990s; (iii)~ ~~cliriejn the a workers with secondazy educati echanisms for this incre~ing gap in wages include: (i) labor market, specifically diminished labor union power; changes in the education system, such as the significant condary education) during the 1980s and medium skilled labor (the labor market value of fallen relative to workers with tertiary education); (iv) increased openness in Colombia' onomy, such as a reduction in tariffs and elimination of most non-trui:ff barriers, h~ increased demand for skilled labor (this argument hinges on the assumption thatn~tional endowments of skilled labor exceed the world market's endowment, rarely the case for developing countries); (v) new technology has increased demand for skilled labor, such as gains in information and communication technologies (in 1998, Colombia was the most active country in LA region with regard to investments iri telecommunications sector) (Bloom 2002). In Latin America, workers with 17 years of education (university diploma) have a wage that exceeds 200% someone with no education (Society 2000). 57 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education In Southeasternn Europe, individuals with tertiary degrees have wages at least 50% higher than workers with only basic education (only 35% in Bosnia and Herzegovina) and at least 38% higher than workers with secondary education. The supply of highly skilled labor force with tertiary qualifications to meet this rising demand is weak in Southeastern Europe. Low levels of efficiency in higher education are reflected in high dropout rates and low university graduation rates. At the same time, the bachelor's degree has not been firmly established as a standalone degree in the labor market (Linden 2008). In China in 2004, 61% of voc~tional graduates, 84% of bachelors I!Jld.93% of masters were employed. Medical science was. above the national averages, with 86.92% of medical graduates employed in 2004, and 91.11% in 2003 (OECD 2007). In Ethiopia, the training of health education workel'S~is being combined with a simultaneous expansion of the primary health care infrastructure. Health posts are being built or upgraded to absorb new graduates, \u00b7and two health education worker jobs are being made available at each post. The cost of salaries, incentive packages and training for these workers is included in the program budget. In Kenya, the presence ofimemployed health workers is being used and deployment facilities on 3-year Health Workers 2008). In ncy Hiring Pl(;m, which is a fast-track hiring, upgrade training Ian is to redistribute 800 health workers to work in PH Ministry of Health leads the program, with involvement ,for Scaling Up Education and Training for additional year of tertiary education, earnings increase by 8%. This can be :dinto a high social return of 13% and private return of 24% for tertiary education. The .~hool of Hygiene Mbale has maintained a 5-year 100% employment record because almost all of its graduates go to work for government hospitals and health facilities, while Teachers' Colleges have employment rates as low as 20% (Liang 2004). 8.2 International Migration Finally, it is necessary to take note of forces within the global market for health workers, often resulting in international migration. Many countries, already struggling to educate and train sufficient numbers for an appropriate health workforce, simultaneously experience a loss of existing health workers to other countries. High-cadre health professionals often leave 58 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education their country of training and residence for external markets that they see as offering more attractive working and living conditions. A recent upsurge in nurse migration has worsened the situation as inflows from training schools are unable to maintain existing poor staffing levels. A WHO study in 2004 showed a general reduction in the availability of nurses with some countries having as much as a 12 percent decline over a 3-year period (Dovlo 2007). The situations is worst off in sub-Saharan Africa, and the numbers are quite striking: 114 ( 60%) of the 190 registered nurses left a tertiary hospital in Malawi benyeen 1999 and 2001 (Martineau 2004). For example, in 2000 more than 500 nurses)~ft Ghana to work in other industrialized countries: that is more than twice the number,pf'iie~ nurses who graduated from nursing programs in the country that year (Buchan and Sochalski 2004). To address this situation, the World Health Assembly recently adopted re~olution WHAS7~19 which called for the development of a Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel. The WHO has also requested Member States to put in place mechanisms which aim to improve the retention of health workers. Very recently, the Kampala Declaration called on governments to \"assure adequate incentives and an enabling and safe working environment for effective retention and equitable distribution ofthelwalth workforce\" (WHO 2008). 59 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 9.1 Curriculum content of tertiary medical education Section 9 describes recent trends in the curriculum content of medical education, including teaching strategies, core curricula, problem-based learning, primary care reform, training in medical ethics, strategies for medical students, and admission procedures to medical school. While the list is by no means exhaustive, the curriculum themes highlighted in this section can provide insight into different teaching approaches medical schools take in higher education. 9.2 Teaching strategies in tertiary medical education Curriculum content and approaches to medical training vary,\"~cross the globe. Typically, academic training centers have a three-part mission: teaching, research and service delivery. These three aspects should ideally receive equal attention and institutional resources, with staff being encouraged to contribute to each. In reality, incentives are often heavily weighted in favor of research and service delivery, to the detriment of teaching. The imperative to generate income to support overhead costs through service delivery or research leaves education and teaching lacking resources and attention. In Southeast Asia, the trend towards following money is steering teaching towards more lucrative fields within specialty medicine, potentially decreasing the capacity of the health workforce to respond to basic public health needs (Linden 2008). There are various approaches to teaching strategies found in tertiary medical institutions. Practice-based teaching aims to (i) bridge the gap between academia and practice, (ii) benefit students, schools, agencies and communities, (iii) involve and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, (iv) be interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and multidimensional, and (v) incorporate experimental education, including critical reflection, observation and learning by doing. Problem-based learning complements practice-based learning through (i) identifying problems, (ii) exploring pre-existing knowledge, (iii) generating hypotheses and possible mechanisms, (iv) identifying learning issues and objectives, and (v) self study and group learning. Patient-focused practice (i) integrates teaching and learning with clinical practice, (ii) shares experience of illness, disease and recovery with patients, (iii) understands varying needs for care, (iv) and observes and 60 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education participates in the ways in which different service providers work together to meet the needs of the patients (Linden 2008). 9.3 Core Curricula The core curriculum in medical education is part of a curriculum which is common to all students .. It can be defined at institutional, national or international levels. An example of one strategy used to define core curricula can be found at Ankara University Faculty of Medicine in Turkey. In 2004, the decision was made to replace the present traditional curriculum with an integrated, problem-based and student-centered one. The Department of Medical Education was in charge of developing the process by which the new curriculum would be developed. First the vision and mission of the medical school was determined, with the aims and objectives of undergraduate medical education being concretely established. The core curriculum was defined as the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will be common to all medical students whom will eventually enter the workforce. During the process, each department proposed topics and was requested to write down its aims and objectives for undergraduate medical education. Each topic was expected to fulfill three basic criteria (i) the topic should be in accordance with the aims and objectives of the relative department, (ii) the topic should be in accordance with the aims and objectives of the undergraduate education of the Faculty of Medicine, and (iii) the topics should prepare the student to function as a competent general practitioner, whose duties have been described by the Ministry of Health (Kemahli, Dokmeci et al. 2004). All clinical topics that fit these criteria were then examined according to secondary criteria: a) the topic is related to a common condition/problem in the country, b) the topic is among the responsibilities of a General Practitioner (GP), c) the life or quality of life of a patient will be at severe risk if a GP does not have the necessary knowledge and skills to cope with this condition, d) the topic will give the necessary knowledge to perform an emergency task, e) the topic is a condition that a GP is not expected to perform as emergency treatment but one that should be referred to an appropriate centre, f) the topic is an imp.ortant preventative medicine skill and/or attitude, g) the student is expected to acquire an important attitude for a good doctor-patient relationship to cope with this condition, 61 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education h) the topic will give skills to enable him/her to diagnose and treat a problem on outpatient basis, and i) the topic will give skills to enable him/her to diagnose and treat a problem on inpatient basis. Topics that fulfilled six of these criteria were included in the core curriculum. However topics defined by the Ministry of Health as among the duties of a GP were included in the core curriculum regardless of meeting criteria. All required topics were found to meet at least 6 criteria. All others that did not were considered to be included among electives. Three criteria were also established for basic science topics: (i) the topic is clearly linked to clinical science core curriculum topics, (ii) the topic constitutes a basis to understand or apply clinical sciences, and (iii) the oversight of this topic results in an important defect in general medical knowledge. Topics that fulfilled 2 out of 3 were included in the core curriculum. The medical schools in Turkey have decided to form a core curriculum on a national basis based on this approach. Almost the same criteria were accepted (Kemahli, Dokmeci eta!. 2004). In India, any significant reforms to the MBBS curricula must be approved by the Medical Council of India, each MBBS phase is comp in great detail, the rules for medical school curriculum t\"'\"'\"'\"'o has been established as a 3-phase framework of 2m\\)l;l.ths), preclinical or second MBBS (18 months), and clinical medical colleges of the parent sity. The Medical Council of India also regulates time allocation among disciplines. The~ regulations for medical school curricula were revised in 1997 in an attempt to promote small group learning, greater emphasis on health and community, PBL approaches, an horizontal and vertical integration. That being said, discipline based teaching remains the dominant mode of education. Medical internships have a mandated 3 month community medicine block (6 weeks urban, 6 weeks rural). Interns must also spend 2 months in each medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology; 1 month of casualty, and half a month in family planning wel(are. Only 29% of medical school graduates are able to enter postgraduate education positions in a clinical specialty, the rest enter directly into medical practice or emigrate (Supe A 2006). 62 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 9.4 Problem-Based Learning Problem-based learning (PBL) has become a common approach to medical education teaching. The approach is understood to mean an instructional strategy in which students identify issues raised by specific problems to help develop an understanding of underlying concepts and principles. Many PBL programs are based on the Maastrich Model of problem\u00ad based learning. Maastricht University in the Netherlands is well known for its adoption of problem-based learning as the educational approach in all its seven Faculties. Although problem-based learning is applied in different ways, it always adheres to the following principles: a) The student or learner is the focus of the edq:~ilonal program, not the teacher, the <''\"\" curriculum or the curriculum contents, ;)' b) The learner's self-responsibility is continu6'tlj)y enhanced, c) The development of his/her learning capacitie~'i~,emphasi~ed, d) The problems presented in the curriculum trigger the learner's abilities to analyze, to understand and to solve, leading to:~J:!ents being able to memorize better than by '<.>\u00b7\"\" rote learning, e) Cooperation wit1\"\\ .. others and the importance of communication is emphasized, \"' ,, i~:~ \" : f) g) Much 2006). \u00b7. Unary problems1or projects is part of any curriculum, and aid t6 .the development of practical skills (Y alcin, Karahan et al. In 2003-2004 Ond~~Uz Mayi~ 'Utli'Vers \u00b7 Medical School in Turkey adopted PBL according ' -: the the Maastricht Modef;The first ar curriculum consisted of 60 problem-based tutorials. PBL groups of 7-8 meet t;Wjce a week for 2-3 hour sessions to discuss a problem. Students had to investigate on their own the issues that emerge, synthesize the knowledge, and apply it to the problem discussed. When compared to a control program using traditional didactic teaching, the stud~nts from the problem-based learning group showed significant increase between post and pre test results in scientific thinking skills, improved problem solving skills (self-reported) and greater conflict resolution skills. Some studies suggest that PBL students have less preclinical knowledge than traditionally taught students, but Yalcin's study shows otherwise (Yalcin, Karahan et al. 2006). 63 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education In South Africa, the medical faculty at the University of Transkei (Unitra), now Walter Sisulu University, was established in 1985 with a program ofMCChBII. The Unitra Council formulated guidelines for the medical faculty and published as \"Council Guidelines\" in 1988, based mainly on community-based medical education and problem-based learning. By the first semester of 1989 (when PBL was introduced), there were obvious obstacles to the implementation of the curriculum. Insufficient preparation of the envisaged curriculum, academic and support staff, insufficient preparation of the learners, and insufficient preparation of local opinion and policy makers all led to problems by the end of the year. A lack of academic coordination existed between faculties. The medical faculty had relied on the Faculty of Science to provide pre-medical courses, yet it became clear that the science faculty was prepping the students for degrees in BSc I instead of MB ChB II. As a result, in 1991, students were admitted to MB ChB I, with the courses made for students with low science backgrounds. Semester 1 would be didactic, and semester 2 would be PBL. In 1992, a better-planned PBLICB:ME was introduced, and has remained successful. In 1996 the South African National Department of Health introduced compulsory community service after the 1-year internship, and as a result Unitra's program is directed at rural and underserved areas (Kwizera, lgumbor et al. 2005). At the Malawi CoU;~~ of Medicine, 25% of the curriculum is allotted to community health in all 5 years oi*f~\u00b7 s.e. T ' \"strict hospital in Mangochi, 190km from Blantyre on Lake Malawi, was adopted 1(,j:,gmmunity Health training because the lakeshore reflected the medical prob rural ,/environment. Community health remains a cornerstone of the curriculum. ;200 1 \u00b7there was a hope to introduce problem-based learning, but pragmatism has take precedence over academic ideology. The College has received several international prizes for its innovative undergraduate teaching program. Some students are drawn from neighboring countries that have no medical school of their own. A major obstacle for student recruitment is Malawi's low literacy rate (62.7% in 2008) (CIA 2008), as well as the limited opportunities for secondary and tertiary education, limiting the number of potentially eligible students (Muula and Broadhead 2001). Against the disadvantages of excessive demands on staff time, set-up and maintenance costs, and increased stress for both students and staff, advocates of problem-based learning claim that problem based learning has the advantages of promoting deep understanding of the matter, improving collaboration between disciplines, and increasing knowledge retention of 64 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education both students and staff. That being said, reviews of controlled evaluation studies determined limited evidence that PBL in continuing medical education increased participants' knowledge and performance and improved patients' health (Yalcin, Karahan et al. 2006). 9.5 Primary care reform In various academic surroundings, there are many different approaches to adopting a primary health care oriented curriculum. One example can be found in Alb.ania. The undergraduate medical program at the University of Tirana lasts six years and is divided in two cycles. The first cycle consists of 28 subjects covering basic and pre-clini~al sc:i~itces and lasts 3 years. Basic medical education is mostly hospital-oriented; primary health care elements are now only being systematically included in the program. The primary care reform began in 1994 and has been restructured through two European Union TEMUS projects in collaboration with the faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Padova, Italy, and the Lariboisiere Saint-Louis Faculty of Medicine, University of paris VII, France. During a 6-year period, 18 teachers per year were academically trained in Padova and Paris. Accordingly, the three year postgraduate training program .in Family Medicine began in 1997. The reform introduced a fourth cycle of medical education, where continuous medical education occurs through 6 month instructional courses in primary care taught in Glasgow, Scotland (Rrumbullaku, Theodorak:is et al. 2002). In Sudan, the Educational Development Center for medical and health professionals was established at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, in 1980, in response to the growing demand in both the Sudan and the region for qualified medical teachers. The center trained a target group of medical and health staff to support the implementation of Primary Health Care Programs with emphasis on Mother and Child Health Care and Family Planning. These training staff included nursing staff, health visitors, midwives and medical assistants. The EDC produces medical and health materials for education, training and health promotion, and in Khartoum it has developed a clinical skill laboratory where high fidelity simulation is used for teaching and learning clinical skills (Fahal 2007). Team based learning at Jimma University in Ethiopia has operated since 1990, where teams of 20-30 final year students in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, laboratory science and environmental health are posted to district health centers. They become familiar with other 65 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education member's fields and learn how to work in teams. The program is managed by a central office within the university. The Millennium Medical School, also in Ethiopia, tailors its education program to meet the country's health needs and reduce education and training time to 3.5-4 years from 6 years (41). In Nigeria, community-based education and service (COBES) was developed at the Ilorin University in the 1960s, and prepares students to address the priority needs of communities, as they progress gradually from basic health education activities to the provision of clinical health interventions (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). At the Aga Khan University in Pakistan, community health sCiences account for 20% of the curriculum. The five year teaching-learning sequence' f~ilows a problem \u00a7olying process know as the community health planning cycle: community assessment, problem identification and prioritization, vertical and then iritegrated planning, implementatio~, and evaluation. The curriculum is divided into pre-clinical and clinical phases, each accounting for two and a half years. Community health sciences ar~ lllught in the pre-clinical terms, while clinical skills are learnt at several field sites. The Aga Khan University School of Nursing designates 15% of its curriculum to community health. Since 1988 a 2-year postbac Bachelor of Science in Nursing has been introduced, and is currently the only university degree available for nursing in the country (Bryant, Marsh et al. 1993). Primary Health Care is also a priority in the LAC region. The Latin American Medical School in Cuba.offers a Comprehensive Health Program (CHP) that enrolls international stu\u00aents on a scholarship basis. Curriculum for the program includes (i) 6 months-1 year pre\u00ad med bridging course, with Spanish for those who need it, (ii) 2 years of basic science, and (iii) 4 years of clinical rotations, when students are dispersed to Cuban medical schools in all 14 provinces an~\"train alongside Cuba's future physicians. Graduates commitment to serve in underserved conmninities upon graduation, which is reinforced by a summer program devised by students themselves, in which they spend part of their vacations serving in their home communities under the supervision of Cuban professors (Frank 2005). In Mexico, the Xochimilco health sctences modular program at Mexico's Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana prepares students for work in primary care settings. It features a common intake year that focuses on general competencies before students opt for a specific focus on medicine, dentistry, nursing or nutrition. Post-secondary education programs are 66 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education usually longitudinal, but a modular approach can be more effective, enabling students to acquire increasingly complex competencies while gaining skills and experience providing services. At Xochimilco, links exist between course modules and field placements, so that placement reinforces the lessons of one module and introduces new issues to be explored in the next (Task Force for Scaling Up Education and Training for Health Workers 2008). 9.6 Medical ethics training In 1999, the World Medical Association \"strongly recommended\" to medical schools around the world that the teaching of ethics and human rights should be compulsory in their curricula. Formal training in medical ethics was introduced at the FacultyofHealth Sciences, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. In South Africa, medical students begin their undergraduate training immediately after high schooL On average, they are 18 years old in their first year. Clinical exposure to patient care in the hospital occurs after the first 18 months and escalates during the subsequent years. The focus on medical ethics begins during the 1st year and continues during the 5th. Human rights is introduced during the third year as part of family medicine. The concentration of medical ethics teaching in the fifth year of study has hence been motivated by space in the curriculum as well as clinical exposure of students (Moodley 2007). During the first year, four lectures are presented on medical ethics, including medical law, logic, critical thinking and scientific integrity. During the fifth year, students experience one and a half weeks on intensive teaching and learning in ethics, medical law and human rights. Topics relevant to South Africa were included, such as rural medicine and family medicine ethics, HIV I AIDS, infectious diseases, termination of pregnancy, and resource allocation. Students work in groups at the teaching hospital to conduct research, then present the findings to the entire class (Moodley 2007). 9. 7 Study strategies for medical students In Turkey, undergraduate medical education takes six years and each year nearly 5,000 high school graduates start medical schools. At Ege University Faculty of Medicine, school curriculum consists of both preclinical years for the first three years and clinical years for the last three. Preclinical curriculum consists of the body-function systems-based teaching blocks. Year one has three blocks as well as complementary longitudinal tracks such as community medicine, professional skills training, ethics and law. Clinical years are 67 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education comprised of clinical rotations during the fourth and fifth years, while the sixth year is occupied by a mandatory internship (Durak, Torun et al. 2006). However, many students experience frustration and failure because of their lack in the learning and studying strategies. The school implemented an effective learning and study skills course at the first and third blocks of the 2003-2004 curriculums. The course was part of the professional skills training track. The goals of the course were (i) to provide students with effective learning strategies in order to enhance their overall academic achievement, (ii) to help students personalize learning techniques and learning environments, and (iii) to provide background knowledge concerning applied cognitive, metacognitivie and affective learning strategies and study skills. Evaluation of student's homework and questionnaires shows that student's found the course to be of assistance in improving their study skills (Durak, Torun et al. 2006). 9.8 Admissions Demand for training places in tertiary medical education attains high levels in almost every country. The World Health Organization notes that admission quotas tend to be of historical seriously autonomy of current needs. Sometimes, health training institutes are institute directors do not normally have sufficient change their admission numbers or improve their In France, enrollment into Year ;t,!)Jf medical school is open to all graduates who have achieved the French B~calaureate, \"'th the curriculum the same for all fields of medicine. At the end of the first year, competitive written examinations are administered by each faculty of medicine. Candidates ,,who are unsuccessful may repeat the year.\u00b7 Success in passing the examinations is low (only 8.6% of the 2001-2002 cohort continued directly on to medical or dental studies), a total of30% of students are eventually accepted (Segouin 2007). In Chile, more than 30 years ago, Traditional Universities established the Academic Aptitude Test (PAA), designed and in accordance with international assessment standards (Thorn 68 ... A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 2004). In Uganda, where the tertiary gross enrollment ratio (GER)5 is 2-3%, the most important criteria for admitting students is the examination results of the Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (A-level exams). Most often, students who do well on the exams come from wealthy urban areas. In 2003, the highest income group, making up less than 1% of the total population, took 42% of places at Makerere University. Access to government scholarship is highly competitive and is solely based on A-level exams. Most scholarship . recipients come from well to do families. About one-third of students are sponsored by the government and the other two-thirds are private fee-paying (Liang 2004). In China, each year high school graduates take a National College Entrance Examination for university study, with the Ministry of Education assigniilg a number of positions for each class. Each university then selects among the applicants who.have listed the school as their top preference. Leading medical schools are open to students from all regions of China, others admit candidates from only their regions. ApplicarJ;!s for the 7 year program must have higher scores and additional criteria, such as high Enilj;'' Wojtczak et al. 2004). ~ AA,' In India, medical be linked to }1ospitals treatih~specified number of patients, with to private hospitals.

Individual from \"socially backward'\"' ~oups are admitted with a lower cut score on the admission (Supe A 2006). 5 Gross Enrollment Ratio: the number of pupils enrolled in a given level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the theoretical age group for the same level of education. For the tertiary level, the population used is the five-year age group following on from the secondary school leaving age (UNESCO. (2008). \"Beyond 20/20 WDS.\" from http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?Reportld=l36&IF _Language=eng&BR_Topic= 0. 69 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 10.1 Reform in tertiary medical ~d.uca~iool_ _________________ _ As countries face various forms of change, whether it is associated with the epidemiological transition, changes in government and policy orientation, \u00b7 or economies growing and emerging on the global market, reform in higher medical education often follows suit. Section I 0 provides an overview of recent reforms in tertiary medical education, and the strategies used to implement them. Reforming the financing structure of higher education is no easy task, with the goals of such initiatives often being grand in scope. First, through financing reforms in tertiary education, reformers should be attempting t~ Increase equity in access through raising the participation rate, reducing equity gaps, enhancing lifelong learning opportunities and expand private sector provision oftertiary education. A sec'Ond goal should be to increase the external efficiency of higher education institutions through impr<zyements in quality and relevance of curricula. Third, internal efficiency should be increased, potentially through cost containment and modernization, improving degree completion rates, ensuring sustainability, and using perfonnance-based allocatiOfl mechanisms to reinforce equity, efficiency, and effectiveness. Yet there .often remains resistance to change and reform, and reformers should take into consideration of the political feasibility of reform via a preliminary stakehol<;ler analysis before design and implementation. For example, a substantial increase in tuition fees usually leads to resistance, while moving from one type of budget to another may !~suit in a reduction of fund allocation for higher education (Salmi 2006). Student can responddrasticallytochanges in student fee systems, as can be seen with the current crisis.at}Jakerere University, where Kenyan students have rioted in the recent weet<s due to increases hi tuition fees for non-Ugandan students. -\u00b7-<~\u00b7:\" The emerging economies ()f Southeastern Europe are one example of such reforms. For example, a priltJary health care oriented reform of the medical services in Albania is now under way, callin~for an adequate revision in medical education. The reform started in 1994, and in January 1997, the Department of Family Medicine at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tirana, was established for the development of general practice and family medicine. According to the new reform, primary health care will be carried out by specialists in family medicine, whose training will correspond with that in the European Union (Rrumbullaku, Theodorakis et al. 2002). 70 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education In Croatia in 2001, medical education reform began at Skopje University Faculty of Medicine, as the Rectorate Administration newly introduced the credit system in the university education in Macedonia. As a result, in September 2003 the country became a participant of the Bologna Process. The status and mission of the Faculty of Medicine was regulated by special law in 1971, when the Faculty became an institution performing three main activities: education, scientific research, and health care. At the same time, institutes and clinics became basic organizations of associated labor within tht: faculty. In 1996, Parliament transformed the clinics from \"Basic Organization of Associated Labor\" into an independent public health organization named University Clinical Center. The Faculty of Medicine had successfully performed self and external evaluation, but as of 2004 attaining accreditation has remained unaccomplished. The election process of the teaching staff into higher education is regulated by the Law on Higher Education, and the Law on Science and Health Protection Law. There is no system for self-evaluation for lecturers, and most lecturers are not familiar enough with the Bologna Process ECTS credit system (Donev 2004). Tertiary Education Reform, Selected Countries 71 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education In Improving Tertiary Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: .. Things that Work (2003), the author provides concrete examples of reform processes of recent years throughout the continent. At the University of Dar Es Salaam (UDSM), Tanzania, recent reforms have reversed the institution's downward spiral of negative changes in the administrative and academic environment on campus. The university used to be a leading regional intellectual center for those committed to the continent's development along a path of African socialism. In the mid 1970s, students and scholars grew dissatisfied with the bureaucratic and non-consultative way that the university was being run by non-academics as senior administrators by the Tanzania's one-party government of the time. Between 1985 and 1992, funding dropped by 40%. As a result, many faculty members were forced to take second jobs (Bollag 2004 ). The Faculty of Engineering decided to take a new path, as it was loosing many faculty members to industry. The faculty began to reform the program;' first establishing a Bureau for Industrial Cooperation to promote consulting work and allow the faculty members and their departments to earn extra money. Curriculum followed. suit, as new degree programs were created, such as computer hardware and software, transportation engineering, and public health. The university also opened evening degree programs in business administration for fee-paying students. Classrooms were only being used 113 of the time, justifying a decision to expand enrollment. From 1995-2001, the student body grew from 3,300 to 11,000, albeit placing strains on the institution. To help subsidize enrollment of its own computer infrastructure, the University of DarEs Salaam established a wholly-owned private company, University Computing Center Ltd, to market internet service and training as well as software in Swahili (Bollag 2004). After the reforms, about 40% of the universities budget is now supported by foreign donor agencies, cmnpared to otily 20% before the reform. Non-academic services have been contracted out for private bidding, reducing political patronage and improving efficiency of the services, while the institution decided not to contract out several highly professional services, including printing, publishing and computer services. Instead they have turned them into limited liabilities wholly owned by the university. These services are both critical to the university, and are also not well developed in Tanzania's private sector (Bollag 2004). Another example of successful reform is at the University of Witwaterstrand, South Africa. The restructuring program was dubbed Wits2001, and lead to a downsizing of staff and 72 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education improvement in efficiency. The process started with a review of almost every university function, often with the help of external consultants. The reform pledged that the savings would be reinvested in (i) library and information services, (ii) student facilities and services and (iii) academic salaries ... The plan moved to merge the 1 00+ departments into 33 mostly interdisciplinary schools, promoting interaction among academics of different disciplines and the development of new degree programs such as urban studies and rural development. A small, dedicated reform team was formed, yet it was made sure that staff and students remained informed throughout the process, including an active Pf,~Ss campaign. Success of the reform can be attributed to (i) strong leadership, (ii) formaf mechanisms to coordinate, support and monitor the reform, and (iii) consultative mechanisms to keep stakeholders informed (Bollag 2004). In Lesotho, during the 1990s only 2% of the population was receiving a higher education. At the National University of Lesotho (NUL), there were over 40 departments, ranging from I 000 to 17 students. The reform merged all faculties and departments into three mega-units, reducing duplication of courses and cutting down on administrative and financial expenses as responsibilities were devolved. During the reform process, three key initiatives were put into place: (i) monthly management forums incorporating deans of traditional faculties, (ii) Interim Executive Deans were appointed to provide over the merging faculties parallel to the traditional deans with the formers' remit limited to transformational issues only, and (iii) space was made for active participation by faculty and staff. Managerial authority was streamlined by replacing the traditional collegial-style deans with executive deans who were given greater responsibility, appointed by and answerable to the senior management. Regarding curriculum reform, computer skills and Life Skills were introduced as mandatory courses for all students (Bollag 2004). In Mozambique, in January 2000, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology was created. With the goal of reforming the nation's higher education system, the newly appointed Minister organized 10 regional consultations in May and June 2000, holding sessions with people form each of the 10 provinces. During the sessions, each province prepared its own development plan, including training needs. A Strategic Plan for Higher Education in Mozambique 2000-2010 wasdeveloped by the Council of Ministers the following month. Its goals were six-fold: (i) an expanded and more diversified higher education system, (ii) a shortening of the basic university degree from six to three to four 73 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education years, (iii) curricula reform to make more programs more practical and oriented to the needs of the economy, (iv) developing a funding policy that would be tied to performance outcomes, (v) the creation of a Quality and Innovation Fund to provide grants on\u00b7 a competitive basis to institutions for training and research, and (vi) the establishment of Provincial Fellowship Programs. Mozambique benefited from a USD $60 million World Bank loan to help develop and implement this plan for reform in its higher education sector. Surprisingly enough, some resistance came from Mozambique's leading institution, Eduardo Mondlane University, having just implemented reforms in previm~os years (Bollag 2004). Setting Priorities in Niger In Niger, a country with less than half of all children receiving a primary education, and less than 10% of women are literate, a strong argument has be made against continuing to funnel large sums of money from the government into long, tuition-free university programs in the humanities. Voices are now petitioning in favor of redirecting part of these funds to developing shorter, less costly programs geared to local needs (Bollag 2004). Medical education reform in China lags behind economic reform in both depth and scope, and currently the standard of training in different districts is highly variable, due to uneven economic and educational development. Two major reforms were proposed in 1986, the first to make education less didactic, more problem-based, and more relevant to the community. The second reform was to address the uneven distribution of health workers (Lam 2006). In the late 199!):;, the 211 Project was introduced. The 211 Project is a tertiary education reform that has gen~~atecbpecjal roles and support to a select 211 universities. The reform involves merging medical universities with non-medical universities to create 'comprehensive universities.' All of the newly emerged universities, including 10 of the 11 previously under Ministry ofHealth, now report directly to Ministry of Education, with Peking Union Medical College as the ex,ception (Schwarz, Wojtczak eta!. 2004). 74 ... A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 11.1 Lessons Learned from International Experience: Policy Recommendations for Tertiary Medical Education in sub-Saharan Africa This section concludes Part 1 with a short list of policy recommendations for tertiary medical education reform in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting current struggles for the region, but also providing lessons learned from experiences from around the world. 11.2 Overview of successful components of tertiary medical training In recent years, there has been a shift from traditional te<t<;!Jer centered didactic, lecture based teaching which characterized most medical learning u~\"'to th~' first half of the 20th century, to a student centered, problem-oriented community-based medical training in the 21st century. Problem-based learning has gained worldwide populati,tYc. Efforts are being made to tailor modern educational methods to local needs. Two examples.6~such efforts are the success of Community-based medical education (CBME) and problem~ed learning used to train '. ~,>'5,.,,,,,, ~ ~-} doctors for rural South Africa, as well as schools in Nigeria wMhave significant CBME components in their medical curriculum. The use of education technologies like computers, vu:t!lfif''\u00b7'f~~U;Ig environments, have facilitated the process of learning, u\"\"!'<'-'\" of education. To attempt such a transformation within obstacle. There bas be a problem, basic infrastructure becomes a major fd~ards emphasizing communication skills, so that plly~icians Vl'il}'.~ <tble to l!~~n to the patients' view and be able to negotiate treatment plans and options, with the patie \u00b7 lowing clear explanation of pathology. Of particular concern for Africa are the widesp ad cultural and religious diversities and the positioning of the doctor within society. Next, in recent years it has been noted that the current practice of healthcare delivery is best delivered by teams of professionals, rather than individuals. Interprofessional l<J{!rning has become a strong component of the curriculum at many medical schools. Primary and secondary care teams can be very different in Sub-Saharan Africa, with varying roles and levels of responsibility, calling for more innovative interprofessional courses in undergraduate education in Africa (Gukas 2007). A local teacher development program, such as the F AlMER Regional Institutes, where over one hundred faculty have participated in programs in India and Brazil, may be best tailored to the specific needs of regional groups of faculty (Burdick 2007). Other areas of change include: a new 75 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education accent on behavioral medicine (comprised of prevention and rehabilitation); the development of more valid systems of assessment and performance standard setting; increased attention towards management of medical education and faculty education; and adhering to international standards in medical education (Gukas 2007). 11.3 Relevant policy recommendations for sub-Saharan Africa There still exist many concerns for the state of medical education in Africa. Many African schools still retain their old curriculum started in the pre-colonial era. This retention can be seen as one of the main causes of possible disparities in standards between Africa and the rest of the world. Africa must redefine its own goals for medical education and to clearly spell out the competencies needed to care targeted at the continent's needs. The region needs to set local and regional standards in line with local and regional competencies. It is after this that comparisons with global standards can be developed, as there is the current risk of Africa imbibing inappropriate standards. To deliver innovations in teaching, faculty should be more than just specialists in their fields, but educators who understand how people learn. In most of Africa, this is not the case. Medical schools are often managed and teaching delivered by specialists with little training in higher education practice. This should change in order to have a cohort of educa!~fil,who are well posedto train health workers in information relevant to the needs oftbe ~ontinent (bukas 2007). A recent paper examining the worldwide ,;;_(t\"W,' ' ',, ' eCce migration ofmedical\u00b7~fgf,shO\\yeijthat in some countries in Africa, over 50% of the qualified ,_.. '\\~('.-., medical staff have left, an4 placed under even greater pressure to leave due to stresses of work and king conditions. Africa hosts medical training programs that produce doctors whose qualiti~tiB'ns are internationally recognized, but often are not appropriate for their country. Perhaps it is time for countries in Africa to look at different models of medical education that is more reflective of the continents needs (Bundred and Gibbs 2007). A critical issue is accreditation of medical schools, which partly depends on the schools' abilty to access data about their own institutions and students. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of schools in Africa lack basic information on their students, including the number of graduates ~d the demographic data to enable follow-ups. An ongoing F AIMER survey in twelve African countries\u00b7 indicates that only seven of the twelve countries have a mandatory accreditation system (F AIMER 2008). Student selection and assessment is another serious 76 \"'. I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education challenge facing African health professional schools. Third, physical infrastructure is problematic throughout Africa. Electricity and piped water can be problematic in many schools, as well as inadequate lecture halls, seating, lighting, and sound amplification. In many universities, projectors and computers used to create visual aids are often lacking. Another important challenge for African medical schools is access to information resources. Universities need sufficient numbers of computers to provide Internet access for students and faculty as well as librarians with the skills to help them access online. resources. It should be noted that students in countries with a GDP per capita less than $1000 (half of countries in '~ ; Africa) qualify for free access through the Health InterNetwork Aceess to Research Initiative (RINARD, created by the World Health Organizations). Finally, data on teacher salaries is limited, but while there have been significant increases in the past decade, current average university salary is roughly equivalent to the annual student tuition fee charged in African state universities (Burdick 2007). African countries will have to devise a financing approach that plays to its economic strengths, its institutional capacities, and its. political possibilities. Since government expenditures on education and tertiary education may be difficult to increase above current levels, tuition and fees may have to be raise9,.jn public tertiary institutions, and enrollment may have to be regu)i\\ted \\Vithirf~~urrent capacities. Other options include earmarked taxes to ,f' <,~;,,~,, support public-private partnerships in '','',''\"'<:;::;.-, which local firms sponst>~; can benefit them, or contribute to a general development fund. Medicltl education institutions wiq}tinly thrive in higher education systems that develop core qualities. These include: (i) sufficient autonomy, with governments providing clear supervision, but avoiding day-to-day management, (ii) explicit stratification, allowing institutions to playto their strengths, while competing for funding, faculty and students, (iii) cooperation as well as competition within the system, (iv) increased openness with the business field and external actors. On its own, the market will not provide these qualities. Governments need to develop a new role as supervisors, rather than directors of higher education (Society 2000). 77 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 11.4 Conclusion The current state of medical education in Sub-Saharan Africa is bleak, As has been noted throughout this paper, many constraints exist to strengthening and improving the higher education sector. Yet the role of high-cadre health workers is in Africa cannot be understated. Although they play a more specialized role that low and mid-level health workers, tertiary level health workers are an influential and necessary component in human resource networks within health systems. During the past three decades, investments in primary and secondary education in Africa have led the quantity of terti!ll\"Y education candidates to increase, thus increasing the numbers of poterttial high\u00b7level health workers. ~' \"\"' Investments in higher education institutions will be a necessary response to such gains, as \u00b7..; \u00b7~\u00b7 ' developing countries must grasp their human resourcei'~~tential to its fulle~'i:ykssons can be learned from other regions of the world, as countries continue to respond to changes in the economic and social systems that guide their high~t'educatiori policies. In ways that are organic to their own region, governments, civil society, students and teachers have all continued to thrive and evolve within continually evolving environments. Countries in Sub\u00ad Saharan Africa must do the same, as the current situation in higher education presents opportunities for growth and success that have never been realized before. Tertiary medical training will hopefully take hold of these opportunities, and in return build and strengthen human resources networks across the continent. 78 PART2: Regional Case Studies 12.~ Regional Trends in Tertiary Medical Education I\u00b7---------------------------------------------------- ----------Part 2 of A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education describes up-to-date regional trends in tertiary medical education, and includes a selection of representative countries from each region of the world. While the selection of countries is by n?;theans inclusive of all higher medical education systems in each region, they are provid~d to highlight common trends or noteworthy initiatives found locally. Health worker-d~n~iti~s, for selected countries in each region are given, so as to provide the reader with information . on output of health worker training in each country. Regions of significance include Latin American and Caribbean, South-East Asia, South Asia, Western Europe, Southeastern Europe, the United States, and sub-Saharan Africa. I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 12.2 Sub-Saharan Africa Academic education in the health sciences in Africa tends to follow the models used in the countries that colonized Africa. Medical faculties, now often faculties of health sciences, provide training for medical and paramedical staff concerned with direct patient care. Field\u00ad level public health workers or lab personnel usually train at technical colleges or through in\u00ad service courses. Medical scientists and doctoral-level researchers are educated in only a few countries, usually through a combination of practice in research institutions and degree training in African and external universities (Bollag 2004). There are 137 medical schools on the African continent\" for a population 900 million. In comparison, there are 147 allopathic and osteopa!bic schools in the United States, with a population of 300 million (Burdick 2007). BetWeel:t 1990 and 2007, public universities in \u00b7,\u00b7,, ',: Africa doubled from roughly 100 to nearly 200, while the number of private tertiary institutions increased from two dozen to an estimated 468 (Bank 2008). At the time of independence, African leaders clearly recognized the important rgle of high quality tertiary education would play in building the new nations. As a result, ~~~\\;[the first sub-regional conferences organized after independence dealt with the development of higher education (Antananarivo, 1962). In 1960, only 18 of the 48 countries of SSA possessed a university or university college (Bollag 2004). The ne~ institutions were generally of good quality for two reasons. First, most were affiliated with universities in the former colonial countries. Second, enrollments were low ,and\u00b7 institutions remain~d relatively well funded by their governments. But during the late ' \u00b7'\u00b7' ~ , 1970s, f\\fj:jca began to slide into economic decline, and by the 1980s, governments began redirecting funding from higher to primary education, in part at the insistence of international lending institutions. Donors reduced funding to tertiary education, and the collapse of communism in the former Soviet bloc brought an end to scholarships that allowed many Africans to study in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and Cuba (Bollag 2004).

In 2004, the average rate for the region has increased three-fold, now only four times lower than the world average. schools have been drastically reduced. In past years, Ghana experienced wastage rates 1.1% in American medical schools (Rqbson 2005). In the past, public universities in Africa and Asia spent up tq.80%oftheir budget.(.)!l personnel and student maintenance costs, leaving little roolt1(9r infrastructure maintenti1lce~ libraries, equipment, or supplies, all key ingredients in mal~fuining a r~s\u00a2arch establishm~nt (Society 2000). . .. \u00b7. Higher Education in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Public Universities lost fmancialand managerial autonomy in 1972, leaving no room for competition or quality control. Acute shortages are evident in the sciences, technology and medicine, fields in which training is expensive to provide. Africa's current tertiary education system is often seen under a harsh light. Over the past two decades, tertiary enrollments have generally increased much faster than tertiary budgets. In fact, enrollments more than tripled between 1991 and 2005, expanding at one of the highest regional growth rates in the world ( 8. 7% ). At the same time, tertiary public financing, which averaged US$ 6,800 per student annually in 1980, dropped to just US$ 981 in 2005 for 33 low income countries in Africa (Bank 2008). In the academic year of 1995-1996, at the Public University of Kinshasa, nearly 2,500 freshmen packed a single classroom in biomedical sciences. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has 1 physician for every 14,000 people, providing evidence for the strong demand for students willing to enter medical school. Most universities, public and private, lack the necessary funds to provide basic educational infrastructure, such as classrooms, labs, equipped teaching hospitals, and so forth There is a critical shortage of faculty with graduate-level training, and it is rarely possible to study part-time, dissuading working people to continue lifelong education or mid-career development (Society 2000). For many tertiary institutions, relentlessly expanding enrollments, coupled with two decades of economic stagnation, have generated a sustained crisis in higher education. Poor pay and deplorable working conditions have led many of the continent's best minds to abandon their universities and often their countries. Mostly modeled after European higher education, African systems . are evolving rapidly from elite structures educating only a few highly\u00ad qualified students, into mass systems of lower quality (Bollag 2004). In many African 81 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education countries, medical curricula often reflect the health trends of industrialized countries, while neglecting to teach the knowledge, skills and attitudes vital for local health care (Bossert 2007). In southern Africa, some countries do not have medical schools. Distance learning for public health training in Africa is needed. South Africa reserves 5% of its medical training places for students from other countries, who are not charged international fees (Mokwena, Mokgatle-Nthabu eta!. 2007). In Africa, teaching methods are often outdated, rote learning is common, with instructors doing little more than writing notes on the blackboard for students to copy. Ill-conceived incentive structures make it difficult to improve the quality of faculty in developing countries. Pay is very low and is governed by bureaucratic personnel systems that reward long systems more than success in teaching or research. Students start tertiary education unprepared, which is mostly due to poor basic and secondary education, combined with a lack of selection in the education system. They are required to choose their area of specialty early on in their academic career, in some cases ahead of matriculation. Once the change is made, it is very difficult to change (Society 2000). In recent years, publ~c eXpenditure on tertiary education has slowly been replaced by the introduction oftui \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7and userf~.es for public institutions. In Uganda, Makerere University ,,\",_.,:,:fo introduced pan{Ii students alongside the traditional government 1992 and 2004, undergraduate enrollment increased from 3,361 to 22, 3-2004 academic year, the large majority being fee-paying students. One d5nse:\"Jue,nce of such an approach has been increasingly . <(.J,'}zF. overcrowded facilities, and has g~~fated a general fear that the state may lower its support by the same amount of money generated by the fees. In 1998, the University of Nairobi in Kenya introduced parallel sections for fee-paying (Module II) students. Since then, its regular students have periodically protested against the policy. Revenue from student fees now accounts for 33% of total revenue; the largest part goes to increasing the salaries of faculty members. Yet many Module J (non fee-paying) oppose this measure, as these students have lower scores but more money, and they sacrifice the quality of education (Bollag 2004). 82 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Public expenditure per pupil as % of GOP per capita, Tertiary Africa Faso lll!ll Ethiopia Niger %II South Africa Iii Swaziland In Malawi, in 1986 the Tripartite Commission endorsed the creation of a School of Medicine. Before, students could only pursue medicine at schools of Health Sciences (Lilongwe and Malamulo ). The commission resolved that it should be community-based and its curriculum should reflect the needs of Malawi. The British agreed to sp()nsor 100 medical students over 4 years, including basic medical science training followed by initial clinical year in UK, then to return to Malawi to complete training by 1990~ The British government withdrew its support in 1994 because tertiary education did not fit in o:n the new emphasis on \"program development\" and emphasis on Primary Health Care (Muula and Broadhead 2001 ). Ii:J. Nigeria, the regulatlCll:\"(()fmedical.education and medical practice is vested to the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria. The council has the responsibility for supervising the nature of the instructio~~ \u00b7~~:nd the examinations leading to the qualifications granted. At the same time, the National Universities Commission (NUC) is also vested with statutory responsibility of regulating the curricula and courses of instructions of all academic programs of Nigerian universities. The Government provides funding through the NUC for the establishment of university programs and departments. Thus the MDCN adopts the guidelines on minimum standards given by the NUC. The development of the curriculum of a school of medicine is the responsibility of the university Senate, although MDCN issues detailed guidelines on minimum requirements of anything from laboratory space to classroom size and student teacher ratio. Without exception, all Nigerian medical schools operate a traditional curriculum, with course delivery being mostly didactic lectures, tutorials, bedside demonstration and teaching. There is a sharp division between pre-clinical and clinical departments, with minimum, if any, integration. Most medical schools operate a curriculum 83 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education in which the preclinical training lasts 24 months ang the clinical training lasting 36 months. As is the trend in many developing countries, in recent years the medical curriculum in Nigeria has adopted an emphasis on Primary Health Care, with the training of doctors being more community based. All schools are required by the Medical Council to have a Primary Health Care practice area located in a rural area before they are given full accreditation. This is usually a 40 to 100 bed rural hospital, providing primary care and basic surgery to a rural population near the medical school. After accreditation, medical schools produce graduates based on internal standards (Ibrahim 2007). Some countries suffer significant looses among teaching and graduates through the impact of infectious diseases including AIDS. They include lost productivity due to staff illness, loss of staffing resources through death, loss of institutional expertise, the cost of recruiting replacement staff, the financial losses when student loans are not repaid due to illness or death, etc. Copperbelt University in Zambia reports losing 17-20 staff members per year. Kenyatta University in Kenya estimates that at least one ofitsstaff or students dies every month due to HIV/AIDS. The University ofNatal in South Africa states that one-third of the nurses it graduated three years ago are now dead. One university from Southern Africa reports spending 10% of its recurrent budget.on AIDS-related expenses such as funerals, death benefits, and .P:ealth care. Initiatives across the continent have incorporated HIV I AIDS responses into hi~lt~r education institutions through HIV/AIDS policy development, employee policies, peer counseling; and curriculum integration. The University of Cape Town)ntroduced an HIV/AIDS United that incorporates HIV/AIDS materials into the curricula. The Universif\u00a5;.ofNamibiah~s introduced a compulsory examinable module for all first year students. The module entitled \"Social Issues\" deals with gender, ethics and HIV/AIDS.; Kenyatta University offers a wide variety ofHIV/AIDS related courses, as well as a compulsory core unit for all students. Several African universities have actually implemented fo~al in~ii~tional policies on HIV/AIDS, including South Africa (Moodley 2007), Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, and Uganda (Saint 2004). In Africa, a category of health worker not being catered to is the public health professional, defined as those responsible for providing leadership and expert knowledge to health systems at district, provincial, national and international levels to manage the health of the public. In 1995 there was a brief attempt to network public health institutions to help standardize public health training with the formation of the Network of African Public Health Institutions in 84 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Uganda, but since has not been developed further. AfriHealth, a Rockefeller Foundation sponsored program that was .conceived of in April 2001, is currently setting out to map advanced public health education capacity in and for Africa students enrolled in Makerere for the 6-year MBChB curriculum, which both then and now consists of 3 months of inpatient rotations in internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, and surgery. After the founding of the first Kenyan medical school at the University of Nairobi (1968), post-internship education began there in the four major specialties in 1972. The first family medici~~ residency program in Kenya, among the first in Africa outside of Nigeria and South Africa;w<:ts launched in 2005. Three stakeholders are collaborating: Moi University of Health Scieri6i~; the Institute of Family Medicine, lnfaMed, a church hospital-based NGO aiming to introdt16e family medicine in Kenya, and the Ministry of Health.

It is a }-.y~~r-residency leading to the MMed (FH). In the British Commonwealth t~ldition, the master of medicine, which builds on the 5-6 year bachelor of - .... meclic~ne/surgery (MBCIU3), is viewed as a university postgraduate degree program, rather . tha~~:pr9!essional app~~ceship.The Ministry of Health gave scholarship money to the first clas~ofstudents (Pust,Dahlman et al. 2006). Tertiary-level Public Health Training in sub-Saharan Africa Reform for public health institutions in sub-Saharan Africa has also begun. The Afrihealth project suggests key areas for reform of higher education public health institutions in Africa. Priority interventions should include: (i) supporting existing centers and creating new ones, (ii) research and education with sufficient professional capability for multidisciplinary work, and (iii) innovation to develop Africa solutions to public health problems. Short term reforms should involve adjusting enrollment to be more flexible, by 85 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education allowing students to enroll from various faculties and universities, as well as more modular formats to facilitate training in different departments, universities or via distance learning. This would also assist in standardizing and benchmarking public health education. Afrihealth also recommends the development of an Association of Schools of Public Health for Africa, where funding and technical assistance would come from external sources to help boost interest in public health education at a tertiary level (WHO 2007). Various approaches to tertiary-level public health training exist throughout Africa. In 2007, 54.7% of countries offer no postgraduate training in public health, 20.7% had one program, and 20.7% have more than one program. In Lusophone countries, only 9% of the population has access to a public health program, while in Franco~l10ne countries 6~~'had access. In Burundi, the Ministry of Health is in a process ofestablishing a National Institute of Health in joint collaboration with the University of Burundi. In Cape Verde, health management training existed for Lusophone countries that it may restart, in collaboration with University Jean Piaget, to train nurses in advanced public health level. The University of Antannanarivo in Madagascar offers a postgraduate diploma in public health, andhas started a Master of Public Health program with WHO fellowship support. In Niger, nurses were trained nurses in public health at the university level jointly with the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Togo offers similar university training for nurses in public health (WHO 2007). Most graduate public health programs emerge from departments of Community Health or Community Medicine that in the Anglophone countries would tend to be in medical schools, therefore limiting the intake to medical practitioners. Over 80% of public health institutions in Afi:ica, have 20 or fe\\)ier staff, and distance learning is rare, as are on-the-job and on\u00ad campus prpgrams. Most notably, these are found in the former Public Health Schools Without Walls (PHSWOW) institutions (Ghana, Uganda, Zimbabwe) and in South Africa's schools of public health. Throughout the continent, student intake was just over 1300 in 2007 (WHO 2007). 86 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education The National School of Public Health in South Africa Starting in 1998, the Medical University of Southern Africa (MEDUNSA) established a Faculty of Public Health, which is called the National School of Public Health. The school produces the highest number of MPH graduates in southern Africa, and hosts the only Doctorate of Public Health program. The National School of Public Health is the first school in South Africa to offer all its programs and courses online. Students are required to complete four semesters over 2 years and take a total of 10 courses from all the disciplines of public health, seven of which are core and three track-specific. Compulsory classroom teaching takes place during four 2-week on-campus blocks, where students are introduced to the online system and general information about public health and the program. Online teaching forms 70% of the program. For each course offered, students are divided into groups of 10 and online interaction occurs within the group. Besides South Africa, graduates are from Botswana, Cameroon, DRC, Eritrea, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Uganda; Zambia and Zimbabwe. International students account for 40% of the class in 2007. Lecturers said that e-learning was better than traditional forms of instruction for several reasons: interaction between lecturers and students, and among students, information was constantly available, students had constant access to online tools such as libraries and journals, and flexibility. Challenges were lack of computer skills, time management, and the demand of the program on academic staff(WHO 2007). Density of Health Workers, per I 000 population, sub~~atlin Africa 87 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 12.3 Latin American and Caribbean Region 'In recent years, the Latin American and Caribbean Region has experienced dynamic reforms in higher education, due to elevated numbers of qualified secondary school students aspiring for continuation at the tertiary level. Yet the region is still plagued with major concerns in equitable access to higher education. While these trends have oriented tertiary medical education policy in the region, Cuba remains a significant voice through it's Integrated Health Program (PIS). Over the last two decades, Latin American governments have increased public investments in lower levels of education. One significant result is that this has led to improved graduate rates for primary and secondary education, resulting in an increased pool of qualified students and an intensified demand for tertiary education. Since 1985, enrollment in higher education increased annually by 2% throughout Latin America. That being said, in 2001 the average tertiary education gross enrollment rate6 was 56% in high-income countries, while only 23% in the Latin America and Caribbean {LAC) region. Why have the enrollment numbers remained lower in the LAC region than in high-income countries? According to a recent World Bank paper (Murakami 2008), depressed enrollment rates are a result of (i) affordability barriers?J!,~]cu:kpf financing for tertiary education, (ii) low equity, leading to '\" '~~\u00b7v'A ' 0 0 :?::;: insufficient and ' mil access i~ tertiary education, and (iii) low expectations of attending w incothe :families (Murakami 2008). The World Bank cites low itional maso!l;:for low enrollment rates. The LAC regional \u00b7:>/Mf&t\u00a5.fi@Y average share of tertiary edu pendi~r~ to total education expenditure was 21%, while the proportion is as high as 26\u00b0 tern Europe and 29% in East Asia. Finally, Latin America and Caribbean higher e. cation institutions remain unresponsive to changes in evolving labor markets. The region attained a score of 5.1 out of 10 for meeting the economy's need, while G7 countries scored an average of 5.3 (Holm-Nielsen 2003). Major concerns regarding equity in enrollment still exists throughout the LAC region. In Brazil, about 15% of the age cohort is enrolled in higher education. This is low compared to other LAC countries (Argentina 36%, Uruguay 30%, Venezuela 29%) as well as the OECD regional average of 52%. Cost per student is on par with OECD countries, while quality is 6 Gross enrollment rate is defined as the number of pupils enrolled in ISCED 5 and 6, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the five-year age group following on from the secondary school leaving age (UNESCO 2008) 88 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education not. The public system, which includes many, but not all the country's most recognized institutions, provides higher quality education than the private sector, charges no tuition, and limits the number of places. In Brazil, two-thirds of students in public higher education schools are from the highest income quintile, while only about 5% are from the lowest (Bank 2002). In Chile, the tertiary education is comprised of 3 types of institutions. Universities, which offer bachelor, master and doctoral degrees, are the only institutions authorized to award professional certificates in 17 professional fields (engineering, medicine, law, psychology, architecture, etc.). Professional institutes offer four year programs and are authorized to award professional certificates in any field, excluding tfi~ I7 fields found in the universities. There also exists Technical Training Centers (CFI), which are comprised of two year technical vocational programs which lead to a higher education certificate (Thorn 2004). Financing The Latin American and Caribbean region w.odel for financing tertiary education is unique. It combines low affordability of tertiary ;d~~'ationwith low education costs of public education and high co~~'~f private education. Student assistance is limited. This could be a result of past polit)i~l and''\u00a2ducation evolution, as the financing model is similar to continental Europe in th.e past, ~;hen the majority of tertiary education was publicly funded. In recent years, there .t ~wth in private institutions charging high \u00b7 d New Zealand. Public policies have not ' '' ' ,, \\ responded to chang~~ in the affbrdability of higher education, as there is still limited student assistance (Murakami 200~). 89 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education QuickTime rM and a decem pressor are needed to see this picture. A recent World Bank paper compared per capita costs of tertiary education beffileen the Latin American and Caribbean region and high~income countries. Throughm.ifthe LAC region, the direct cost of tertiary education has been found significantly higher than in high\u00ad income countries, reaching a regional average of 35% of GDR ~~r capita in LAC, while only 10% on average in high-income countries (HICs). The high proportion of spending per capita is affected by a lower regional average of GDP in the LAC region, relative to high-income country averages. Actual go\"'errmenti! $2000 per capita in o[ living for accommodation and food is a significant share of for 29%in LAC and 19% in high-income countries. in LAC tfiav: in high-income countries, reaching only capita in HICs. Student assistance lowers to 11% in high-income countries, resulting in greater inequities in access to''&ign~r e,~,pcation. Countries in the LAC region with a higher share of students in private unive s tend to have a higher education costs than countries with a higher share of students in public universities (Murakami 2008). Total costs (the sum of education and living costs) are also higher in the LAC region than in high-income countries, with total cost averages in the LAC region reaching as high as 64% of GDP per capita, compared to the HIC average of 30%. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States average total costs at around 40% of GDP per capita. Japan's total costs are as high as 51%, while Continental Europe and Northern Europe remain relatively low, at 23% and 22% respectively. In the LAC region, Brazil, Colombia and Peru have least affordable total costs (Murakami 2008). 90 j A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 45.00 40.00 35,00 30.00 t \"25.00 E 8 20.00 ~ 15.00 10.00 s.oo 0.00 Public expenditure per pupil as a % of GDP per capita, Tertiary LAC Region '2004-2006 Year (UNESCO 2008) ~~Argentina MBrazil Chile meolombla illl!iCub~ ~$Mexico WPeru :.venezuela There also exist relative disparities in financial support from governments to students through grants when comparing the two regions.

The me average is 5%, reaching as high as 11% in ~ustral,ia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and 7% in Northern Europe ((Murakami 2008). In Chile higher education expanded from 250,000 students in 1990 to 500,000 in 2003. Nearly all of the expansion was financed by private sources, a policy of cost-recovery and growth in private provision of tertiary education. Chile is of the countries that allocates the least public funding to higher education relative to GDP, but features the highest share of GDP allocated to higher education in the LAC region. This process was mainly done through scaling up support for student loan programs for access to tertiary level education (Thorn 2004). 91 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Cuba's International Cooperation in Medical Training Cuba is one example of a thriving medical education system in the LAC region. 24,950 Cuban health professionals serve in 68 countries, and 12,000 international students are . . enrolled on full scholarship in Cuban medical education institutions (Frank 2005). Cuba's doctor to patient ratio grew significantly in the latter half of the 20th century, from 0.9 doctors per 1000 inhabitants in 1958, to 5,8 per 1000 in 1999 (Sixto 2002). Since the early 1960s, almost 70,000 Cuban health workers have participated in structural cooperation programs in 37 Latin American countries, 33 African countries, and 24 Asian countries. The structural collaboration, known as the \"Integrated Health Program (PIS),\" is free for the receiving country and is primarily focused on the provision of first~line health services. The main objective of the program is to ensure the basic right to health care on a structural and durable basis to populations that have been excluded from free access to basic health care. Depending on local needs, the development of integrated health care at the primary level can be complemented withtechnical assistance to improve the performance of local hospital services, with training programs for local.human resources, or with essential drug programs. Most of the doctors working in this program are family doctors from all areas of Cuba, and usually serve for at least two years. As of 2004, more than 21,000 Cubans were working abroad, with the figures continuing to increase (De Vos, De Ceukelaire et al. 2007). Complementing theJntegrated Health Program, Cuba offers an important program of medical scholarships for foreign students in its medical faculties. The program began in 1961 with 15 Guiean students, and has since expanded to 17,700 students from 115 countries in 2004. Also part of the PIS program, the Latin American School for Medical Sciences (ELAM) opened in 1998, and is the most modern of Cuba's 15 schools. Board and lodging expenses are covered by th~:(Cuban state, as well as medical and dental care. The first six months involve preparatory or \"catch up\" studies, followed by two years of essential basic courses in medical education. The final four years of work and study are spent at other Cuban medical schools, where much of the time is spent learning from actual practice in neighborhood doctors' offices, clinics and hospitals. Registration of students is organized by Cuban diplomatic missions, and academic requirements for entrance are comparable to other medical schools in the LAC region (De Vos, De Ceukelaire et al. 2007). 92 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Density of Health Workers, per 1000 population, the Americas (WHO 2008) 93 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 12.4 South-East Asia The evolution and current state of tertiary medical education in East Asia have seen dramatic changes in the past two decades. Among the enabling conditions for education development include: (i) high rates of economic growth, (ii) the emphasis on \"shared growth\" in the countries' overall development strategy, (iii) a rapid demographic transition, and (iv) strong public institutions (Fredriksen 2008). China, Vietnam and Thailand provide examples of recent trends in the region. Curricula in Asia In Southeast Asia, very few schools have a fully integrated curriculum. Many more are working towards gradual integration, often with problem-based learning as an avenue. In a survey published in 2005, 50% of the schools reported problem-based learning as a component of their medical education, usually representing a hybrid curriculum and constitutes 20-40% of CJ.IITicular time. Early clinical exposure, as defined by direct patient contact before the end of year 2, is implemented in 40% of the schools. Nearly all schools provide clinical training beyond hospital settings. Multiple:-choice questions and oral examinations are the 2\u00b7,,~l,r;frequently used student assessment instruments. All medical ,', ;,.,'~''\u00bb4\\(::_~1 ' schools, except l,,.,have a designated person in charge of their curriculum. Medical schools in / ' '': '''/. several countrie'~(fud, ' . follow their national curriculum (Zubair Amin 2005). China In China, educators claim that\";~inal,;programs are overburdened with lecture sessions and an overemphasis on didactic teacht~~\u00b7~d examinations. There is also a lack of clearly stated educational objectives and poorly developed monitoring and assessment systems. The seven\u00ad year curriculum has five sections (leading to Bachelors and Masters): (i) General Education, (ii) Basic Medical Education, (iii) Clinical Medical Education, (iv) Elective Courses, and (v) Internship Training (Clerkship), and follows the following timeline: (i) year one is composed of natural and social sciences taught at university, (ii) years two and three include basic medical courses, (iii) years four-six include clinical courses and general clinical practice, and year seven involves a sub-internship and dissertation defense. Teaching methods include mostly lecture. Problem-based learning has been introduced but is minimal due to shortage of teaching resources including space, library facilities and trained teachers. Besides bedside teaching in clinical years, seminars or small-group discussions are used. Finally, the basic 94 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education method used to assess is the written examination, and a pre-graduation clinical examination is administered annually to final-year students (Schwarz, Wojtczak: eta!. 2004). In China, the Ministry of Education approves all tracks and strives for uniformity of programs. This supervisory role reflects the similar content of all 5 and 7 year programs of medical education. The China Medical Board (CMB), established by the Rockefeller Foundation in_1928, now supports 13 medical education institutions in China (Lam 2006). During the past 5 years, China's education system has gone through profound changes. Most importantly, albeit still a Communist government, China has diverged frorrLits historical links to the Soviet Union based model, where medical schools were set ,up as sepa~ate universities. Under the previous model, some medical schools were directly supervised by the,.Ministry of Health, while others by the Ministry of Education. Under the current system, there are 2 levels of medical training: the high school level and the university level. The high school level of vocational training includes Secondary Medical Sch()IJls (SMSs), which follow the three year program to produce medical personneHor rural areas. ;Y~t due to higher numbers of university trained graduates and a need for better-trained physicians, such institutions have largely ceased to exist. The university level ofmedical education of physicians follows either the 3-year certificate oriented program \"Certificate of Study\" or the degree oriented 5-7 year program (Lam 2006), China's medical education system contains another professional track that encompasses the teaching of Chinese Traditional Medicine at Traditional Chinese Medicine College~ ('l'CMCs}(Schwarz, Wojtczak: eta!. 2004). Even though critics often cite China's health system problems reflecting the growing disparities. between rural and urban health care, it is difficult to deny that there has been a constant overall improvement in the health status of China over the past twenty years. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 67.9 years in 1981 to 71.4 years in 2000 (Yuanli and Keqin 2006), and has reached the level of 80.97 years in affluent cities such as Shanghai. From 1992 to 2002, infant mortality rates have fallen from 47 per 1,000 live births to 29 per 1,000 live births, and maternal mortality has declined from 77 per 100,000 to 43 per 100,000, with it dropping as low as 1.4 per 100,000 in Shanghai (Control 2008). There are numerous reasons for such a decline, and the most noted factors include improv:ed living standards due to recent economic growth and improvements in the public health domain. Such 95 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education improvements include increased percentages of rural households with safe drinking water and women delivering their babies in hospitals, or with the assistance of skilled birth attendants. Vietnam Vietnam provides another key example of higher medical education in East Asia. In 1986, due to a recent national economic crisis, the Vietnamese Government planned for major national economic and social reform to move from a centralized planning system to a socialist-oriented market mechanism. A direct consequence of the initiative was reform in the education sector. For general education, the reform was centered on five key objectives, including: a) Curricula modification b) To achieve comprehensive academic quality c) To link general education with vocational education d) To continue to affirm the state's responsibilities e) To implement education socialization (Fredriksen 2008) For tertiary education, reform consisted of: a) Training for various~conomic components, designed to meet the diverse learning needs of s~i~ty .... /-' b) Instead of r state budget, all possible financial sources were to be mobilized c) -state reform targets alongside targets set by the state d) Increasing fl~xibility in\u00b7 ~uing programs, leading to diversified employment opportunities linked to the job market (Fredriksen 2008). The Vietnamese government applied various strategies to ensure success in the reform. The reformed aimed to revamp the training process in higher education through dividing tertiary education into two stages -replacing year-based courses with modular credit-based training. It aimed to improve testing procedures; to delegate authority for entrance exams to the higher education institutions; and allow a candidate to site for such exams in several institutions. The reform aimed to strengthen state management functions with laws and regulations; to decentralize and reduce professional activities undertaken by 'the Ministry of Education; and to increase autonomy of tertiary education institutions. The reform also required that higher 96 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education education institutions expand their student intakes, as well as facilitate establishing connections between research institutes. These institutions gradually stabilized and expanded their size, with their lecturers getting better income through their own professional activities. Within the higher education institution network, five major multi-disciplined universities were established in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Thai-Nguyen, Hue, and Danang. The number of tertiary education students increased from 760,000 to more than 1.3 million during the 1998-2004 period, with an average increase of 6.4 percent per year,~::::;, Enrollment growth during the 2001-{)2 to 2004-05 academic years alone, the number of college students increased by 29.7 percent; university students increased by 37.1 percent; and master's and doctoral degree students increased by 62.4 percent (Fredriks~~:2008). Currently, there are four levels of higher education: a) College-level training: two-to three-year courses is available for upper-. secondary or professional and vocational secondary graduates; or over one-to two-year courses for graduates in the same training area or discipline. b) Undergraduate-level training: four-to six-year courses is available for upper\u00ad secondary or professional and vocational secondary graduates; or over two-and-a\u00ad half-to four-year courses for graduates from the same training area or discipline at the secondary level; or even one-and-a-half- to two-year courses for graduates in the same training area or discipline at the college level. c) Master's-level training: courses of one to two years are available for university graduates. d) Doctorate-level training: over four years is available for university graduates; and over two to three years for master's degree holders (Fredriksen 2008). In 1990, the Vietnamese Government established a policy aimed at training medical doctors in a more community- oriented fashion (Decision 58/TTg of the Vietnam Government, dated 03/0211994). They planned that by the year 2000, medical doctors would be available in 40% of the more than 10 000 commune health centers (CHC) in provided technical and financial assistance to strengthen community-oriented teaching, including field training. This target was attained, as more than 45% of CHC had doctors at the end of 2000, A new target was set for 2010: 100% of the CHC in lowland and midland areas would have doctors, as well as 50% of the remaining CHC in mountainous and remote areas. Medical schools were asked to 97 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education increase their attention to both community needs and practice, by making classroom teaching more community oriented, and by improving the teaching in the communities (FT or community-based education, CBE) (Hoat LN 2008). However, at the same time the introduction of the market economy and private enterprise in Vietnam began to create barriers to the community accepting large numbers of students, especially if community members could see no benefit for themselves. The market economy and the rise of private practice also reduced the enthusiasm of teaching staff for spending time in rural areas with the students. These changes presented the schools with serious challenges in implementing FT. However, from 1999 the eight main medical schools received support from a Dutch project that provided technical and financial assistance to strengthen community-oriented teaching, including FT (Hoat LN 2008). Thailand Most Thai medical schools are government-funded and r~quire Thai citizenship for eligibility. Only one private medical school exists at the moment. Some Thais choose to attend the private medical school or attend a medical school in a foreign country due to relatively few positions in public institutions, as well as high college entrance examination scores required for enrollment in public medical schools (Wikipedia 2008). The Thai medical education is six years consisting of 3 pre-clinical and 3 clinical years. Upon graduation, all m~d,ical students must pass the national examination and a university-based comprehensive test. After medical school, Thai medical graduates are under contract to spend on.e year of internship and two years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for most residency positions. Otherthan general clinical practice and basic emergency procedures, all Thai doctors are required by the Thai Medical Council to be able to perform six surgical operations: appendectomy, caesarian section, circumcision, herniorrhaphy, tubal-ligation and vasectomy (Wikipedia 2008). Tertiary Medical Education Financing in South-east Asia In China, tertiary education institutions are directly funded through a central allocation system, where institutions under local government administration are financed locally, while the privately run institutions are funded primarily by sponsors (including student tuition and fees, and endowments). Tertiary education students pay tuition and fees, as higher education 98 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education belongs to the non-compulsory phase of education m China (OECD 2007). Current education spending is about 4.9% of GDP, with the public share at around 3% of GDP, less than half of what is required. The level is low, with China ranking 56th out of 60 economies in public education spending. It accounts for 22% of the world's population but only 2% of global education expenditures. Recent trends have seen changes, as between 1998 and 2003, the share of total public education spending for higher education increased from 18.9% to 24.1 %, while the share of spending devoted to primary education felL Non-governmental education spending reached 53.2% in 2003, equivalent to US in 1998 (Lou 2008). Share of Non-governmental education expenditure (percentage), 2002 In Chinese higher education; in 2003 tuition accounted for more than 30% of total investments, an inci'~~s.e.of mql:.fl than 17% over 1995.

In 2003, private institutions accounted for iLl% of total tertiary.~institutions and 7.3% of total tertiary students. In 2000, the Chinese cet\u00a2ral governme~t introduced the General-Commercial Student Loans Scheme, which applies tp'~ll pos1;Secondary students and their parents or guardians. The target group included students l~ and above in higher education institutions (both public and private). The same year, China also introduced the Government-Subsidized Student Loan Scheme, which holds only students responsible for paying back loans (Lou 2008). Density of Health Workers, per 1000 population, South-East Asia\u00b7 99 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 100 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 12.5 South Asia Tertiary medical education has also been evolving and expanding in South Asia. The region has seen a substantial increase \u00b7in the provision of medical training through private institutions. Both India and Pakistan provide examples of how the higher education in health has changed in recent years. India The Indian medical education sector has multiple systems of medicine, broadly classified into two: the modern system of medicine, including allopathic,.pon-Ind1an systems of medicine (NISM), as well as traditional Indian systems of medicine and homeopqth):'(ISMH). The undergraduate degree, referred to as MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery), provides basic training in clinical medicine during a curriculum of 5.5 years. Postgraduate training includes 3-year residency programs and diploma training programs. With the Indian system of traditional medicine, national curriculum takes 55 years to acquire a Bachelor's degree, followed by postgraduate training. By law, private sector medical education institutions must be organized as non-profit entities with admissi,ons and tuition fees kept within reasonable bounds. Permissions by the Ministry of Health and accreditations from the v ,: \"'< respective State Medical 'Gl()Uncil (SMC) and the Medical Council of India (MCI) are required to establi.shJiew institutions (Mahal and Mohanan 2006). There are 258 medical schools in India, producing a total ()f27,676 doctors a year, each associated with a university. Out the annual pool of graduates,'onethird of those doctors leave India each year for residency or practice abroad. Nationally there are 0.5 doctors per 1,000 people, compared with 2.3 per 1000 in the US (Mahal and Mohanan 2006). The number of public medical education institutions grew by only 36% (seats grew by 20%) in the period from 1970 to 2004. The private sector of medical education, in contrast, saw enrollment capacity and the number of institutions increase by roughly 900% during 1970- 2004. The share of the private sector in the total number of teaching institutions at the undergraduate level, about 10% in 1970, grew to 45% in 2004. Similar trends exist for traditional Indian medicine programs. Including both public and private tertiary institutions, postgraduate places more than doubled (3708-7631) between 1980 and 2000 (Mahal and Mohanan 2006). 101 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education The growth of private sector medical training has occurred mainly in the richer and healthier provinces. 88 of the 100 private sector Western medicine colleges are located in states that contain the richer half of the population. Public sector budgetary constraints in medical education offer one reason for private sector growth. A second factor is the climate of openness and increased privatization, starting in the mid 1980s, by way of relaxed regulations and permission for starting institutions. It has been noted that most states that witnessed private sector growth of medical education are economically more affluent than others. In tum, higher rates of physicians produced provide a larger market for local consumption of medical care services. New doctor registrations in medical councils of states indicate an inequity in access to health care. 75% of all new registrations in 2001 (up from 67% in 1988) were in the states with the richest 50% of the population and the bulk of medical colleges (Mahal and Mohanan 2006). Lack of effective government oversight of private medical education and the private health sector has led to problems, such as the inequitable distribution of resources that favors urban areas. There is an oversupply of doctors in the private health sector and has fostered \u00b7unhealthy competition, leading to unnecessary or excessive medication of otherwise healthy people (Supe A 2006). The Indian government has yet to interfere with the expansion of private medical education. Yet through the geographic In India, private medical school, as well of new schpols in rural locations, it may be able to reduce to medical education institutions. have a government-determined\u00b7 proportion -..... ., . ~ about $400 a year for the first 4 years of of \"payment\" students for which students pay substantially higher tuition Tuition levels are determined by the state and are based on education costs reported by the medical school (Supe A 2006). 102 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Percentage of public current expenditure on education, 25.00 20.00 15.00 10.00 5.00 0.00 (UNESCO 2008) Pakistan 2005 Year Dlndia 111m Iran Pakistan In Pakistan, medical schools are mostly affiliated with uniVersities as departments.

The graduates are then eligible to apply for a medical license from the PMDC (Bryant, Marsh et al. 1993). In 1983, the Aga Khan University became the first private university in Pakistan. The two main objectives of the Department of Community Health Sciences are: (i) to strengthen the development of health systems in Pakistan through education and research in collaboration with local and national authorities, and (ii) educate health personnel for leadership in dealing with health and development problems, particularly for those in deprived communities. Community health sciences account for 20% of the curriculum. The five year teaching\u00ad learning sequence follows a problem solving process know as the community health planning 103 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education cycle: community assessment, problem identification and prioritization, vertical and then integrated planning, implementation, and evaluation. The curriculum is divided into pre\u00ad clinical and clinical phases, 2.5 years for each. Community health sciences are taught in the pre-clinical terms, while clinical skills are learnt at several field sites. The Aga Khan University School of Nursing designates 15% of its curriculum to community health. Since 1988 a 2-year postbac bachelor of science in nursing has been introduced, it is the only university degree available for nursing in the country. Most graduates have opted for post\u00ad graduate studies in the US or UK (Bryant, Marsh eta!. 1993). Density of Health Workers, per 1000 population, South Asia 104 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 12.6 Western Europe In Western Europe, the most important reform in recent years is the adoption of the Bologna Process. The process aims to create a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) by 2010, in which students can choose from a wide and transparent range of high quality courses and benefit from smooth recognition procedures (Linden 2008). The overarching aim of the EiffiA is to promote mobility, attract students and staff from Europe as well as from other parts of the world, and be internationally competitive (Bologna 2008). Currently, medical faculties are under pressure to reform administrative structures and curriculum content, so as to harmonize with EHEA standards and guidelines by 2010. In the past, Western European countries differed in whether they plan entry to medical schools allow medical schools to determine the number of student places. A recent OECD study suggests that about 12 of the 19 countries listed are now operating some sort of numerus clausus. Numerus Clausus, a Latin term meaning a restricted number, refers to the practice of setting a quota for the number of persons who wilt be admitted to an educational institution, most often a university. Most of the remaining countries appear to leave entry to medical school to market forces (or, at least to decentralised mechanisms). Such institutional policies have the potential to dramatically affect the production and supply of health workers. In England, physician shortages can be observed in three-month vacancy rates of 4.7% of all specialist physician posts and 3.3% of all primarY, care physician posts in England in the year to March 2003. Inversly, there were claims of a physician over-supply in Belgium in 2000 (Simoens S 2006) . In 1997, in Belgium the Government began to fix the number of physicians who would have access to accreditation for practice. Limits were at 700 in 2004, 650 in 2005 and 600 in 2006. These numbers break down to 60% Flemish-speaking and 40% French-speaking students. Since 1971, France has employed a numerus clausus for admission in the second year of undergraduate medical school. Due to concerns over a surplus of physicians, the numerus clausus has been reduced progressively since 1980 to bottom out at 3,500 students in 1993. Since then, the numerus clausus has increased as a consequence of a projected shortage of physicians in 2010-2015. The numerus clausus has been set at 4,100 students in 2001 and 5,100 students in 2002. In Germany, the Government does not restrict the number of students admitted to medical school. Intake is determined by the number of places available at medical schools. In Greece, the Ministry of Education determines the number of 105 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education available places in each medical school on the basis of available financial resources rather than an attempt to match demand and supply. The number of new students entering medical school has been recently stabilised. In Ireland, there are a certain number of state-funded places, but Colleges have discretion to take in more students. The Higher Education Authority determines the number of places avaiiable through the process of financial allocation. In the United Kingdom in 1966, the Royal Commission for Medical Education recommended an increase in medical school intake to 4,230 students and the creation of new medical schools. Subsequent reports by the Todd Committee, the Advisory Committee for Medical Manpower Planning and the Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee recommended increases in the number of physicians to meet population need for medical services. The numerus clausus was fixed at 5,091 students in 1998 and 5,600 students in 1999. The NHS Plan 2000 made recommendations for 1,000 more medical school places (Simoens S 2006). Northern Europe's financing structure includes large student bodies, high attainment rates, and student bodies that are representative of the country's socio-economic status of the population. This is a result of no tuition or almost tuition free education, combined with extensive student assistance programs. The region's model relies on a large public investment into tertiary education financed by very high tax contributions of its citizens (Murakami 2008). In England, The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) was formed by the Further and Higher Education Act, 1992, to fund higher education in England. It superseded the PCFC and the Universities Funding Council. The role of the Funding Council is to distribute public funds made available through Government via the Department for Education arid Skills in England and to advise on the funding needs of higher education to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (HEFCE 2004).

This is rigf~\u00b7asJn many cases it is likely to reflect patterns of migration affecting the popu' \"n these countries. Immigration increases the flexibility and reduces the cost of physician y in the host country, although in some cases it may raise concerns about the quality and safety of health care services delivered by migrants. Immigration of doctors for training purposes can account for a substantial number of foreign\u00ad trained physicians in a country. Physicians from overseas who were attending postgraduate training in England made up 39.6% of all physicians from overseas in the National Health Service in 1995, 36.2% in 2000 and 37.3% in 2001 (Simoens S 2006). Density of Health Workers, per 1000 population, Western Europe 107 I A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 108 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education 12.7 Southeastern Europe Recent trends in Southeastern Europe often are centered upon a revision of medical education curriculum that mirrors health system reforms oriented towards primary care provision. As countries in the region strive to join the European Union and integrate their higher education systems with those in Western Europe, they must also reform their administrative frameworks to adhere to the Bologna Process standards and guidelines. Albania and Macedonia provide key case studies to highlight such trends. Albania A radical primary health care oriented reform of the medic~! s~rvices in Albania has recently been introduced, calling for adequate revision in medical education. During the pre-reform era, basic medical education was mostly hospital~ariented; primary health care elements are now only being systematically included in the progtittn;, The reform started in 1994, and in January 1997, the Department of Family Medicine at theFabulty of Medicine, University of Tirana, was established for the development of general Practice and family medicine. According to the new reform, primary health care will be carried out by specialists in family medicine, whose training will correspond with that in the EU. Undergraduate medical program lasts six y covering basic Macedonia divided in two cycles. First cycle consists of 28 subjects \u00b7ences and lasts 3 years. The second cycle lasts 3 years and racticed through .. a rotation system. Postgraduate training ing in duration from 2-4 years, according Medical education reform began at Skopje University Faculty of Medicine in 2001, as the Rectorate Adminjstration introduced the credit system in the university education in };':.;.;'\\ Macedonia. The country became part of the Bologna Process in September 2003, when the Macedonian Minister of Education and Science signed the declaration. The student-teacher ratio is 4.18, compared to 2.72 in the Royal Free Hospital Medical School in Lodon, 6.76 in Zagreb, Croatia, and 1.9 in Split, Croatia. In previous years, 400 students were enrolled per year (6 year program), but the number has reduced to about 150. Although there is still a high number of unemployed doctors and is increasing due to a continuous surplus of graduates, the interest for studying medicine is still high. The most prominent secondary 109 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education students apply. Most students are Macedonians (79.8%), although the quotas by national favor enrollment of minorities (Donev 2004). Undergraduate teaching is organized in 12 semesters, with 42 teaching subjects, with three curriculum parts: natural sciences (8 courses), fundamental preclinical medical sciences (9 courses), and clinical teaching (25 courses). The last, 12th semester, consists of practical work related to main clinical fiends of medicine, primary health care, and public health. Educational activities are performed in the traditional manner, based on lectures. There is unsatisfactory attendance to the theoretical lectures and inconsistent carrying out of practical training. Evaluation is summative, based on barrier exams at the end.of .each course, and rarely formative. To accord with EU standards, reform is occurring with the'development of a block-system in groups of no more than 25 students (Donev 2004). In Macedonia, the Faculty of Medicine receives basic resources for undergraduate studies by the Ministry of Education and Sports. Additional resources come from co-financing and self\u00ad financing in both undergraduate and postgraduate education, as we!l:!!S highly specialized and sub-specialized health care provided at the Teaching Hospital. Funds come from the national Health Insurance Fund, in accordance with contracts signed with the Institutions within the Faculty. There is also a small amount of funds generated through the financing of scientific projects. The Ministry of Health provides resources for the faculty, as well as assisting in the realization of specific programs for health care. Insufficient financing contributes to low salaries of other fucil.ities at the university (Donev 2004). Financing A simihir comparison of public expenditure on tertiary education was made between Southeastern Europe and other European countries, providing evidence that public expenditure on tertiary education as share of GDP is low in the region. Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, and Romania spent much less than 1% of GDP in 2005 while the EU-19 average was 1.1% for the same year. In the United States, public expenditure on tertiary education is also 1.1% (UNESCO 2008). In Southeastern Europe, public funding is allocated to universities on the basis of input indicators, such as numbers of students and professors. This system provides no incentive for institutions to improve efficiency and graduation rates, with fee-paying students at public universities paying high charges for tuition. In Croatia, 110 J A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education annual tuition fees at public universities range between 680 Euros and 1150 Euros. The public institution University of Montenegro chares 1000 Euros, while the private education sector charges E1300. Any revenues lost from public sources can be quickly made up by transferring students who reach the end of the public funding period to a tuition-paying basis. This creates incentives for keeping students in the system beyond the envisaged study period. Due to legal independence, institutions are not obligated to share private funds from wealthy departments (law and economics) with poor departments (Linden 2008).

Governance and financing structures vary from state to state, which as been previously described in Part I of the paper (see pg. ##)l_ <\";:l!q~nJly,_ !h_er~ \u00a5~ _1_4_4 _l!l~<!i~'!l_ schools in the United States. American medical curriculum in the first part of the 20th century was focused on basic sciences related to medicine and the core clinical disciplines. By the latter part of the 20th century, new disciplines and subject areas w1ere brought into the curriculum, such as biostatistics, medicine and law, and health economics. Only one new MD-granting medical school has been accredited in the past 20 years, Florida State University College of Medicine (Barzansky and Etzel200~}. Medical schools are all not-for\u00ad profit or public institutions, which may be du~ to U.S. accreditation standards that recommend that medical schools should be not-for~profit institutions (Pr,eeker 2007). The U.S. federal government does not impose any limitation on the number of medical school enrolments. However, due to the increasing prevalence of employer-based insurance, the Health Professions Education Assistance Act of 1963led to the federal government investing in medical education (Simoens S 2006) It is estimated to cost $100,000 a year to train a medical student in the Unftdd States (Preeker 2007). The first two years of training involve science courses, while the last two years are spent in clerkships (rotations). While college\u00ad level premedical courses are mandatory for acceptance to medical school, the first two years of biological sciences build upon this foundation with more specialized study. The fourth year is the major ybarwhen students can spend time in elective experiences. Tea12hing in clinical hospitals range , from university or medical school-owned hospitals, private, non\u00ad profit hospit~ls, private, ror-profit hospitals, state, county, or city hospitals, and Federal hospitals (Vet{!rans Affairs or DOD systems. 85% of medical schools require their students to take both the Step I and Step 2 United States Licensing Examination. Almost all schools used the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject tests to evaluate students' knowledge within courses or clerkships. The evaluation of clinical skills has traditionally been done by faculty members or residents. Many schools also use \"objective structured clinical examinations\" (OSCEs), which tests students clinical skills through the use of multiple stations, often including standardized patients trained to portray a clinical scenario in a standardized manner (Barzansky and Etzel2003). 112 A Global Perspective on Tertiary Medical Education Financing In the United States, the federal government and the states share the responsibility for financing higher education (roughly $70 billion each), although their roles are quite different. The federal government spends roughly $40 billion per year for student aid grants, tuition tax credits, and loan subsidies and about $27 billion per year for sponsored research in colleges and universities. The states provide about $6 billion for student grants and $65 billion for direct institutional subsidies, which principally support instruction, with smaller allocations for research and public service. The states bear nearly all the expense of constructing and renovating physical facilities. Institutions achieve eligibility for federal student financial assistance when they are accredited by a regional or national voluntary accreditation ,,'-'t;>\u00b7.,, association recognized by the federal Department of Education (Lingerfelter 2006).

The study aims to be a significant analytical piece that can begin to fill the gap in information and evidence on the role of the private sector in medical education in Africa. One of the main motives for the study is to inform country level policy advisory work being undertaken by . the Health in Africa Initiative in conjunction with Ministries of Health and other stakeholders in a selection of African countries, The expectation is that this study, as part of a series ofiFC-Wotld Bank studies lo.oking at the issue of human resources in health through a private sector lens, would help countries to develop a framework for thinking about how best they can leverage the private sector to alleviate the problem of human resource production. The target audience of the study is expected to include private sector investors, policy makers and donors. The study aspires to move these actors towards concrete actions that leverage the existing private sector better in order to address the human resources in health crisis facing Africa. Figure 1: Shortages in Health Workers Source: World Health Report (WHO, 2006) .. ml'! Countries with critical shormge c::J Cwntries without crltical shortage 2 0 0 0 0 0 .. 0 .. ! .~0 ' Background The human resources crisis is a key constraint in growing Africa's health systems to meet systemic needs. The critical nature of the lack of human resources in health (HRH) has been brought to the forefront of the health debate in the last few years. WHO's needs based estimates indicate that that an additional 1.5 million health workers are required to meet basic health care needs in Africa, at a cost of $2.6bn per annum in training. Demand based estimates indicate a lower but still acute shortage of 800,000 healthcare workers in \u00b7 31 African countries by 2015.1 The IFC's Business of Health in Africa Report underlined the human resources crisis as one of the five principal constraints affecting the private sector. A need exists for new paradigms that enable African nations to make greater use of the resources of this sector. Donors thus far have focused on public interventions to address the HRH Crisis. Numerous forums and initiatives have been set up to address the issue of the HRH crisis.z While many of these have examined the economy as a whole, both tradition and past history have caused the focus of these to be interventions by donors and governments. As a consequence, there has not been a vision as to how best to tap the potential of the private sector. For current purposes, this sector is defmed to include both small and large private businesses, non-governmental organizations, fmancial institutions that create markets and participate in medical institutions, foreign entities interested in establishing a presence in African countries, and the community of international investors. These entities have been largely untapped and poorly integrated into the framework of the discussion and the strategies for scaling up the resources devoted to the sector. Given the severity of the crisis, it is essential that the conferences designed to develop strategies recognize the depth and breadth of private resources available in Africa. There is a paucity of data on the private sector in medical education in Africa. At present there is a lack of data or rigorous analysis on the role of the private sector in medical education in Africa. In part, this is a reflection of the attention paid in the past to public solutions and, in part too, it reflects the paucity of reliable data and systematic analytical work on the private sector in general. Since systematic data collection does not occur, researchers and policy makers must rely on collection of survey data on an episodic basis. This limits the ability of policy makers, donors and private investors to make evidence based policies and investments. The poHcy community Jacks an analytical framework for thinking about the potential contribution of the private sector. Given the lack of data and in-depth analytical work in the area, the dialogue around the private sector in HRH still too often reverts to stereotyped interactions between private-public in medical education, e.g. where private sector is said to absorb workers from public sector and, at best, private sector is said to take up the excess demand for medical education. There is a clear need to understand the system more holistically, and understand both the potential contribution and the risks of the private sector. At a minimum, a need exists to identify the relevant private players in the provision of medical education and the markets in which they provide resources. Systematic identification and clarification of their role is an 1 Needs based estimates are taken from WHO (2008) Scaling Up Saving Lives. Demand based estimates are taken from Scheffler et al (2008), Forecasting the Global Shorlages of Pf?ysicians: An Economic and Needs-based Approach, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, June 2008. 2 These include, amongst others, the Global Health Workforce Alliance, The Capacity Project (USAID), The World Federation for Medical Education, The Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIJ\\IER). 3 important pre-requisite for developing strategies that lead to the expansion of the resources devoted to medical education by the private sector. There are untapped opportunities in knowledge transfer from other sectors. Many models for funding medical education exist within the world's health community. These emerge as a result of differences in resources available, in training methods, availability of skill sets within a country or region, the infrastructure base, different cultures and mores, types of illness treated, etc. There is a lack of transfer of knowledge and innovative models from (1) private non-medical education, and (2) private medical education outside Africa to the human resources crisis in Africa. This study can encourage the transfer of knowledge on how to address the human resources crisis by developing new models. Our study begins with a literature review that precedes more detailed ongoing qualitative interviews with select health education and government institutions within Africa. Related research will also examine associated topics in detail. These include 1) fmancial innovations in health education 2) the potential role of public private partnerships in health education 3) equity effects associated with private sector education and 4) governance questions related to developing and regulating private sector initiatives in health education. Taken together, these research efforts will identify key issues with respect to involvement of private sector institutions in health education, propose a range of policy options and develop and prioritize recommended courses of action. In order to consider which business models may work within the context of health education sector in Africa, this review will adopt a deductive approach proceeding from a general characterization of the potential market to more specific business or organizational models that have or may ideally contribute to improving production of human resources for health. As such the review has four sections (each with a goal) Section 1 adentify Market Frameworks and Private Sector Role): Broadly summarizes the conceptual approaches to first defme and then assess markets and the role the private sector plays as a participant within the marketplace. Section 2 (Characterization) : Characterize select health education market(s) based on available data and literature. Section 3 (Present Models and Issues):)dentify and characterize select business models for health education markets in Africa or propose important policy issues. Section 4 (Examine and Discuss Recommendations): Based on the theoretical or empirical literature, assess how policy makers may inhibit or promote the entry or emergence of private health education. 4 Section 1: Market Frameworks 1.1 Market Ijpes Economists agree that a market exists whenever buyers and sellers come together to engage in trade. This simple but robust definition can accommodate a wide range of market situations from the sale of fish in the Thai floating markets to the types of internet trading that exist one-bay, to the large global markets for currency. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies contribute to the way in researchers and practitioners define the boundaries for a market, and explore how homogeneous a market will be. Indeed, there are many different ways to do business within the confmes of a market (viz., high quality vs low cost product), and this can create disagreements among those who examine the market for health education services. Key to marketplace analysis is the realization that people will only trade when it is to their benefit to do so, that trades give rise to valuable information on both how price and quantity are decided by sellers and responded to, and that markets exist at many levels (e.g, local, regional, etc.), that the market for labor interacts with the market for goods and services, and that differences among markets in price and quantity will equalize when markets are allowed to operate freely (e.g,., the market for the Swedish krona in Bogota will adjust to changes in the exchange rate for the krona in Iceland). While this analysis will primarily relies on the the framework provided by economics, it is recognized that other important contributions stem from the sociology and even biologicai realms. These are not relevant in the current discussion but they have a bearing on the recommendations that are proposed. Variation exists in how efficiently markets operate and the role of private sector participants may differ depending on several key variables. Classic microeconomics which is concerned with the study of the theory of the fttm broadly characterizes markets as \"perfect competition\", \"monopolistic competition\", \"oligopoly\" and \"monopoly\" (as well as variants) on the basis of the number of fttms (and buyers), the level of differentiation of products or services across fttms, the degree to which market actors are fully informed and the barriers to entry (such as large fixed costs). Table 1 summarizes these market types.(Katz and Rosen 1994) As a first step in assessing the market for private tertiary health education institutions in Africa, we characterize the type of market which applies most appropriately (and why). It is likely that different markets exist within the African tertiary health education market (viz., nursing, lab technician, community worker) and these may reflect different market conditions (e.g, ease of entry and exit), creating diverse roles for the private sector to play 5 Table 1 Market Types and Characteristics Market Market Type Characteristics Perfect Monopolistic Oligopoly Monopoly Competition Competition Number of Firms Many fttms Many firms.

Within the field of business these disciplines include marketing, management and industrial organization. Each of these sub-disciplines has its own set of theoretical and/ or applied constructs that characterize markets and/ or the environment in which fttms or organizations operate. For example, in the management literature which examines theory explaining fttm or organizational success within a market, key constructs 6 include the \"Structure-Conduct-Performance\" approach (Porter 1980), the Resource-Based View (Rumelt Pisano et al. 1997).3 By its nature, the management literature tends to more explicitly examine characteristics of ftrms and organizations on the supply side of the market (although the effects of demand are more implicit, they are still recognized as vital). In contrast, the marketing literature has generally focused more on the demand side considerations when conceptualizing the market. (Adcock, Ross et al. 2001; Kotler, Armstrong et al. 2008) The industrial organization literature typically focuses on market structure and how changes in information, homogeneity of product, ease of entry artd exit, and number of players affect both the output and price of a good or service. (Schmalensee, Armstrong et al. 2007) This area of economics provides unique insights into monopoly, oligopoly, game theory, and the effects of regulation and the market conditions listed above create a framework for analyzing how effectively markets operate as compared to a perfectly competitive marketplace. There are a myriad of applications within each of these disciplines (and wide variability in how each of these may be implemented across industry). For example, within the marketing fteld the \"Four Ps\" (price, product, placement and promotion) create a popular customer-oriented framework which some researchers adopt to assess a market and determine how to optimally position an existing product/ service or develop a new product/ service. Instead of arguing for a particular mechanism to describe a market, we submit that, at their crux, these mechanisms should optimally attempt to evaluate some type of supply and demand determinants. 3 It is beyond the scope of the paper to examine these constructs in any detail, but the reader can review the references for additional detail. 7.

Looking across other health\u00ad related markets (e.g. pharmaceuticals, health insurance, health training, provider services) helps to demonstrate the type of role the private sector can play (as well as the attendant policy environment that may affect private decisions, e.g. patents). Market based approaches also provide guidance as to what causes market failure. Imperfect and/ or asymmetric markets, inadequate demand, continuously falling average costs, large externalities and other barriers to .the production of goods and services affect the operations of markets, as can expectations. Applications of market based approaches should take these into account in the planning process. Table 3 characterizes the key features (entry barriers, information environment, potential for strategic behavior, and product/service differentiation) on affecting supply and demand within particular Dranove Sloan 2000; Zweifel and Manning 2000) It also identifies the overall market characterization and the role of the private sector.

Section 2: Market Characterization -Health Education Extending our market analysis framework to health education markets will help to elucidate where private sector flrms are most likely to sustainably participate in the market and to increase social welfare. There is very limited information on the tertiary private health education market in Africa but lessons from private education markets, developing country education trends and health education in both developing and developed country settings help inform the understanding of important issues likely to affect health education private markets in Africa. Figure 2 Markets related the African Health Education Market Education Education eve loping Country Edtlcation (esp. Africa) The following sections examine important supply and demand issues across these market types. 2.1 Traditional Public Suppjy in Tertiary Education and Private Entry Government subsidization and provision of education, even tertiary education, is justified by the externalities (social beneflts which are not captured by the individual) which education produces.(Poterba 1995) This feature of education has long been recognized and health is no exception. However, given the large potential payoff for some individuals (particularly in high-skill cadres), it is important to consider the degree to which individuals should harbor fmancial burden for fmancing (while, hopefully, retaining some measure of equity). Presumably private sector models become more realistic to implement if the private beneflts are large in comparison to the cost of the education and there is less reliance on the state for both flnancing and provision. 13 It is important to understand that even in developed country education markets such as the US, the cost structure for education favors either a public or \"private subsidized\" model. The \"sticker price\" to the individual for tertiary education often is a fraction of the school's cost of providing it (even without any individual regiononal grants or scholarships)(Figure 3). This explains why private institutions in the US tertiary market typically are in the form of not-for-profit institutions and are heavily reliant on endowments or other private support (e.g. charities, limited state funding).(Winston 1998; Winston 1999) Figure 3 Select Components of Cost Structure in Education Markets Sources Price A Firm Price = Cost +Profit Source: Winston, Carbone, Lewis (1998) Profits Costs ( ~ I l A Colll'ge Sources Subsidy ---Sticker Price Price Price +Subsidy = Cost Despite this cost structure, a for-profit tertiary education sector is emerging rapidly. In the US, for-profits are now the fastest growing segment of the university market-with annual growth of over 9% per annum over the last 30 (1979-2009) years relative to 1.5% across all institutions. (Wilson 2010) The absolute share is still relatively small (7%), but for-profits account for over one million students and share is anticipated to grow at a robust pace. In addition, the type of education, traditionally very trade-oriented in the early years, has shifted. Over 90% of the students enrolled in for profits are associates, bachelors, masters and doctoral spread across a variety of disciplines (including health-related ones such as nursing). The average \"sticker price\" for these for-profits is higher than traditional education in public institutions in the US ($14,174 vs. $7,020 per year), but the virtual (online) and in person courses are designed to allow customers (students) the ability to continue to work while attending. Costs are limited by eliminating institutions such as tenure for faculty (instructors are usually hired and paid on a per course basis) and relying on internet (although not solely) for instruction. These institutions qualify for government educational grants and firms have 14 demonstrated significant profitability despite the higher default rates among students relative to traditional education (where students do not need to borrow as much given lower pricing). The largest firm, Apollo Group (University of Phoenix), has 200 campuses across US, Canada, Mexico, Netherlands and Puerto Rico.(OBHE 2009) Table 4 Select US For-Profit Tertiary Education Firms Institution Students Revenue (1,000s) ($ l\\fill) Apollo Group (Univ. Phoenix) 443 $3,141 Capella Education 29 $272 Devry 101 $1,091 Grand Canyon Education 34 $161 ITI Services 79 $1,015 Strayer Education 54 $396 Source(s): Chrorucle for Higher Education (2010), F1elden (2010) *Earnings 30 57 52 99 78 89 67 100 92 7 22 83 61 These \"borderless higher education\" organizations are expanding internationally into other developed, emerging and even developing country settings. Naturally entry occurs in those segments in which profits are anticipated. An important factor which may affect the viability of these models (in the health-related professions or otherwise) is the extent to which the degrees issued by a school/ country are accredited in other markets, particularly internationally. Regulation at the national, bilateral and international level likely affects the portability of a students degree and its quality. For example, a recent report notes: \"The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) administered by the World Trade Organization (WfO), has introduced a new set of rules and principles to govern the import and export of any service, including education, with the aim of further liberalizing trade in services. This framework is relevant to all aspects of provision -and providers -which operate commercially and could in the longer term have far\u00ad reaching consequences for other forms of regulation that have traditionally been applied to higher education. In the medium term, GATS negotiations are likely to affect the portability of professional qualifications. \"(Fielden 201 0) In fact, GATS pertains to multiple \"modes of supply\" for education which affect the viability of several of the private sector models discussed in subsequent sections. These include \"cross border supply\" (distance and virtual education models), \"consumption abroad\" (transnational student models), \"commercial presence\" within a country (branch campuses, twinning arrangements between universities, franchising) and \"movement of natural persons\" (faculty exchanges or travel). Opening up the educational market to borderless institutions is not, however, a simple issue for African countries who wish to ensure that they control the quality and equity dimensions of the private sector. One concern posits that unfettered entry by these institutions hampers state control with respect to national policy 15 and could result in low-quality \"credentialing shops\" for relatively wealthy clientele which add little real productive value while, potentially, straying from merit-based systems for educational and professional advancement. For example, in reference to the prospect of increased educational trade the South African l\\finister of Education noted \"(South Africa must) remain vigilant to ensure that increased trade of education does not undermine national efforts to transform higher education ... (and) erode the public good agenda for higher education\".(Kapur 2008) Of course, appropriate entry of novel institutions that can absorb additional students using low cost methods and produce effective graduates in important areas (such as health) would be very attractive. The goal is to build both the educational infrastructure in a country and contribute toward imJ?rovement of institutional capacity in both the health and other key commercial and government sectors. Noval sources of supply and new forms of production are important and these are discussed in d1e next section. The important feature to capture here is the recognition that private (both not-for-profit and for\u00ad profit) institutions have played a significant role in the development of the educational market in the developed world. If conditions allow, iliey may play a growing and important role in the future. At the moment medical education appears to be primarily offered by the state, although semi-elite or lower level institutions have emerged which accept less-qualified, but typically wealthier, students. According to the International Medical Education Directory4, most countries in Africa have a few accredited medical schools for physician training spread across the entire country. Census data on nursing and allied health schools is not as well documented. Figure 4 Medical Education Supply: Number of Accredited Medical Schools (by country) Source: [fis-9 I!IH 4 The International Medical Education Directory develops its census of institutions via a survey. Hence: those that do not return the survey may not be counted. The result is a potential downward bias for the total number of accredited institutions in each country. Moreover, some institutions (esp. private institutions) are not accredited and may not have received the survey at all. 16 2.2 Demand Growth Over the past 25 years, much effort has focused on improving education and expanding access at the primary and secondary level in developing world settings, including Africa.(Talik 2000) Historically, the focus on the lower levels of education was supported by research indicating that the social rate of return for investments at primary and secondary levels was higher than the returns from higher education.(Psacharopoulos, Tan et al. 1986; Kapur 2008) A recent analysis examining 98 countries over 37 year (1960-1997) estimated socials rate of return from primary schooling at 18.9% and tertiary education 10.8%.(Psacharopoulos 2002). However, there is an increasing recognition that A) the methodologies for evaluating rates of return likely did not capture the full benefit of tertiary education (as 11sually just wage effects for the individual were evaluated as the benefit) and B) as \"knowledge workers\" become more important in developing the institutional capacity of countries the benefits to a strong tertiary education system will likely grow even larger.(Birdsall1996; Kapur 2008) The success of basic education initiatives has resulted in an increasingly large share of the population that demand further education at the tertiary levels. Table 5 and Table 6 reflect the growth in the demand for tertiary education-including health education. (UNESCO 2009a) But limited government budgets and the traditional role of government financed and operated institutions as the primary source for funding and provision of education, particularly in health institutions limit the market's capacity to service demand. 17 Table 5 Growth in Secondary Education Participation in Select Sub-Saharan Mrican Nations (Secondary School Enrollment,% Gross) 1985* 1995 2005-8** 1985* 1995 2005-8** 5.9 11.8 28.3 Botswana 28.2 57.1 76.5 Mali 7.6 11.7 31.6 Burkina Faso 3.7 18.1 Mauritania 14.3 16.2 25.2 Burundi 3.3 6.4 15.2 Mauritius 48.6 61.7 Cameroon 21.3 25.0 25.2 Mozambique 7.1 7.3 18.3 Cape Verde 11.8 79.3 Namibia 37.4 57.7 59.0 Chad 6.0 7.9 18.8 Niger 5.2 6.5 10.6 Comoros 28.5 20.0 Nigeria 33.0 31.9 Congo, DR 22.0 24.7 33.4 Rwanda 6.5 18.1 Congo, Rep. 62.6 48.5 Sao T orne and Principe 46.3 Cote d'Ivoire 18.9 21.7 Senegal 12.2 14.9 26.3 Eritrea 13.7 29.2 Sierra Leone 19.3 31.6 Ethiopia 11.0 9.9 Gabon 38.5 23.2 48.6 Swaziland 36.5 46.9 54.4 Ghana 38.8 33.4 53.3 Tanzania 3.3 5.3 Guinea 13.7 12.1 37.6 Togo 18.3 21.4 39.3 Kenya 39.9 52.8 Uganda 9.8 11.1 22.5 Lesotho 21.5 30.4 37.0 Zambia 18.1 24.5 43.1 Madagascar 30.0 14.2 26.4 Zimbabwe 41.5 40.6 Source: World Bank (World Development Indicators) *Comoros, Namibia and South Africa figures from 1986 **Most recent report from 2005-2008 18 Table 6 Growth in Tertiary Education Participation in Select Sub-Saharan African Nations (Tertiary School Enrollment,% Gross) Angola Benin Botswana Burkina Paso Burundi Cameroon Central African Republic Congo, Dem.

During the expansion in demand for tertiary education in the US from 1955-1997, higher education supply grew both in the number of schools (suggesting more competition for students and expenditure on fixed costs) and in the average number of students using an institution (Figure 5).(Kwoka and Snyder 2004) Interestingly entry among new schools was most robust by public and two-year institutions and was strongest during periods of strong macroeconomic growth. 19 Figure 5: Tertiary Educational Supply in the US (1955-1997) 600~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~ Total Enrollment If Snyder (2004) 2.3.1 PublicS edor Expansion 1975 Year 1980 1985 1990 1995 One of the ways that developing countries have responded to demand expansion for tertiary education is by increasing the size of existing institutions. For example, in Mexico, Argentina and India; public institutions such as National University of Mexico have over 200,000 students.(I<:.apur 2008) Nevertheless, there is a natural upper bound for capacity. The public university in Kenya has 9,000 spots, although over 4-0,000 qualify for university admission.(Oketch 2003) Anecdotal reports indicate that faculty now work multiple shifts in universities in order to try to accommodate current demand.(Beciu 2009a; Beciu 2009b) Further expansion of the public sector schools is likely to require creative new ways of delivering tertiary education. Greater use of the internet might provide further expansion using redeployment of resources. 2.3.2 Private Sector Entry While macro-economic growth has been relatively strong in the region, public expansion of capacity is unlikely. To the degree that policy-makers wish to engage the private participation, improvement:; in regulation and use of lower-cost educational models may promote entry-perhaps even at higher cadre levels.(Sosale 2000) In the context of the African tertiary health education scenario, entrant institutional size has tended to occur in the form of small institutions which are still dwarfed by existing public providers. Entry of tertiary institutions is most robust at the lower cadre levels where flxed-costs and faculty scarcity may serve as less of a constraint.Gohnstone 2004;Johnstone 2009) 20 Some expansion and entry by private education institutions has occurred (within or outside health), but most African countries do not have substantial enrollment in private tertiary institutions. After several African nations passed legislation during the 1990s to allow for private tertiary education, increased entry occurred to the extent that about one-third of the 300 universities in Sub-Saharan Africa are private.(Materu 2006; Kapur 2008) There is room for building the market for tertiary private education either through collaboration with nonprofits or through social entrepreneurship in his area. Moreover, the barriers to entry for this type of education are low, although appropriate certification procedures could slow demand. To date, much of the entry has been in inexpensive, high-demand fields-rather than, say, engineering or medicine where graduates have a much more important potential influence on country institutions. A UNESCO Institute for Statistics survey from 2005 across 110 countries (13 from Sub-Saharan Africa) found the tertiary private share of enrollment was still generally low in most countries. (Table 7) Table 7 Private Sector Enrollment Share (Tertiary Education) Private Share of Countries Mrican Countries Enrollment (Total Sample) in Sample More than 50% n=30 Botswana, Cape Verde 25%-50% n=23 Angola, Burundi, Senegal Less than 10% n=32 Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda Source: Kapur (2008), UNESCO (UIS) Overall the role of the private sector in tertiary education is likely to remain low unless greater incentives exist to encourage delivery of health care education. Note that the enrollment share does not reflect the quality of the educational experience across different institutions. Generally, the existing public universities have greater prestige (and funding) and are more likely to attract higher quality faculty (although in some cases, private institutions rent both facilities and faculty) .. The market for private higher education in health within Africa exists, but it is likely that entry will be more viable in particular segments by different forms of private institutions (For profit vs. not-for-profit). 2.4 Health Edutation Industry Strudure Given the characteristics of supply and demand, it is possible to broadly characterize the education markets, albeit with the caveat that variation exists across country markets (Table 8). With the high level of regulation (at least for the production of higher level cadre workers) and heavy public provision, health education provision markets might best be characterized as regulated monopolies (in the case of single institutions) or oligopolies (which distribute supply rather than compete on price). Given the easier entry requirements (lower fixed costs and faculty inputs), the education markets for less technical health professions, particularly those whose graduates that can command higher wages, are more akin to \"monopolistic competition\" (particularly as there is variation in the quality across schools). 21 22 Table 8 Tertiary Health Education in Africa- Market Characteristics Health Market Supply Side Market Characteristics Demanil Side Market Characteristics Education Entry (Supply) Entry (Demand) \u00b7 Fixed costs for entry (capital expenditures) vary depending Larger pool of individuals with secondary education-demand for Overall on the type of school.

With regard to the former, any novel model will have to generate sufficient revenue and constrained costs (albeit to varying degrees depending on organizational form and external support). As such crucial revenue and cost related criteria include: 1) Which educational market niches will most likely yield sufficient revenues to attract students demaning education given the current market structure? How would government and other active financiers participate given the assumptions of the business model? 2) Expansion requires both adequate funding and a viable business model. How will entry and recurrent costs (capital costs, operating costs) be fmanced for for-profit or not-for-profit private entities? Will tertiary private organizations rely only on full-funding student fees andtuition, government educational grants, endowments, charitable contributions or on other funding mechanisms as well. 3) \\~at kind of marketing plan models are available to educational institutions to use to successfully market to students or other groups that may provide auxiliary sources of funding (e.g. corporations interested in research collaborations)? 4) \\i\\!hat alternative business models are available for reducing cost while preserving quality? Can existing institutions collaborate or merge in order to achieve economies of scale, higher quality teaching and other resources, and access to potential donors. 5) Can internet delivery reduce costs without lowering quality. ~at business models exist of online delivery of health services. 6) \\iii'hat models of successful regulation exist to guide countries that need to upgrade the quality of their training. Market Seledion: With regard to the first criteria, variation exists in the degree of competition, government intervention and entry barriers across various market segments. These segments may be characterized by type of graduate (physician, nurse, technician, pharmacist, community health worker); service type (provision of education, fmancing of education, support services for educational institutions) and geographiclocation (rural, urban). Organizational form may also play a role in the likelihood of success within each of these niches. For example, ecumenical NGOs have a history of servicing rural populations where government or for-profits do not have funding or desire to provide service. Finance: Financing, discussed in detail in a separate accompanying paper, is central to educational models since, as discussed earlier, the economics of higher education often require some form of auxiliary fmance to aid educational institutions in servicing the costs of the education. In the African context, the student tuition is also often covered by government programs. The degree to which individuals cover (either via out-of\u00ad pocket payments or loans) their expenses should depend on the anticipated private benefit associated with the higher degree. Generally, there is a sense that, especially for high-skill professions, the state's contributions may well deserve to be reduced (especially if individual income in subsequent years is taxable by the state to repay loans). 25 Marketing: Addressing uncertainty regarding the quality of new educational institutions via accreditation would help resolve information asymmetries and improve new entrants' ability to market their services to potential customers. The political will to institute these accreditation programs may be limited within governments if entrenched schools (typically public organizations) perceive the expansion of the education market to new suppliers as a threat to their long-standing dominant position. Given the potential for international organizations to enter the education market- regulatory and accreditation efforts are likely required at the local, national, bilateral and international level. Developing the administrative capacity to develop and enforce accreditation is a major institutional hurdle, but one which should be addressed if countries wish to seriously encourage private entry to both absorb additional demand and improve educational quality. With accreditation, the potential student pool will have better information of the quality of the institution\u00ad here is a case where regulation behooves private organizations by addressing the information asymmetries that consumers have. Private institutions (as well as public) may improve their ftnancing and quality via partnerships with industry. Leading institutions have already adopted this approach. For example, at Makerere University in Uganda approximately one-third of funding is from industry research collaborations. These relationships may be particularly fruitful in the health sector given the extensive (and increasing) clinical and medical health research that private and public partners may undertake in African settings. Inputs: On the cost side, one of the key constraints are the availability of faculty-a rare resource. Local scarcity may favor adoption of innovative models, such as international schools or franchise schools, which either import faculty into the country or virtually connect students to faculty in other locales. Higher end schools require physical spaces such as labs which further inhibit entry. Internet: Education over the Internet can bring scarce teachers into rural communities, provide the latest material and teaching methods, promote interaction, and reduce travel and teaching costs. It can :also require stable electric supply, purchase of equipment, teacher training costs, website maintence, and a resident specialist. Over time, Internet education will grow importance but the literature is not yet available on the effectiveness of this delivery model. Regulation: As discussed in the credentialing section, regulation can have a salubrious effect on the functioning of the private market by reducing uncertainty, standardizing the educational product and improving information among consumers. 3.2 Innovative Education Models (Provision) Several of the recent innovations in education delivery (typically, though not always implemented in the private sector) attempt to address some of the barriers that previously precluded educational entry. These include lowering ftxed costs, achieving greater customer focus and improving quality. One of the important over-arching trends is that of internationalization or, broadly deftned, the movement of faculty, students or curricula from one country to another. (Harden 2006) \\X'hile many novel forms of education are growing rapidly in developed economies, the prospect for increased adoption in developing countries is strong. Many of the models may have an international component, but certainly localized variants exist as well. While Africa has relatively few cross-border and international initiatives, there are numerous examples and cases to learn from and signiftcant potential for program expansion. 3.2.1 Virtual/ Distance Learning Virtual or distance educational models are evolving rapidly in both developed and developing world. According to the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education (OBHE), \"(Distance education is) generally deftned as a form of education in which the location of teacher and student are not in proximity. Higher 26 education by distance has evolved from the contexts of lifelong learning, professional and continuing education to one that now includes operational elements such as multi-campuses, inter-institutional partnerships, and dedicated, international online networks\". (Denman 2009) The predominant mode of learning typically relies on information technology such as the Internet and/ or DVDs/CDs, but often these modules are coupled with face-to-face sessions. Although high cadre forms of health education typically require at least some standard instruction, mixed models may allow for reductions in capital and recurrent costs while maintaining quality and improving access (especially for hard to reach rural areas). As indicated earlie,r there are several for-profit models in the US which include health-related degrees (such as nursing) and these have effectively trained medical personnel. Figure 6 International Distribution of Distance Education (n=572) 2% Source: Denman (2009) 3.2.1.a Regional Model.\u00b7 Senegal) ru North America w V\\r'estern Europe -Latin America & Carribean l\u00a3i Sub-Saharan Africa Middle East & North Africa South Asia & Indian Ocean Wli East Asia & Pacific Ocean ,> Aush'alia& New Zealand ' Eastern Europe & Central Asia The African Virtual University was established by the World Bank in 1997, but has subsequently transferred operation to Kenya (with a regional office in Dakar). It is the largest network of Open Distance and e\u00ad Learning institutions in Africa with over 50 partner institutions in 27 African countries. While the revenue model still relies on multilateral funding, the network seeks to increasingly rely on private sector sources by A) generating revenue via short courses, workshops and consulting engagements; B) developing a subscription and contribution model and C) charging project management fees.(A VU 2010) Although it focuses on language and computer science instruction, the novel contribution of this model is the regional level implementation focus. Small countries in the region may benefit from these models given the potential to limit initial fixed costs and support higher quality by encouraging learning from across the region (not just in one institution). A regional network of institutions for instruction may also build the capacity for research activities in the health sector. A multi-institution collaborative network across a region may more readily be able to service demand from potential private funding sources such as pharmaceutical firms or institutions seeking to conduct multicenter clinical trials for vaccines or pharmaceuticals. 3.2.1.bAMREF (Kel!Ja) Al'v.IREF is an NGO which provides distance education to 4,500 nurses through 127 schools and E-centers. Graduate; earn a registered nurse (R.N.) certificates by completing a combination of computer and clinic sessions.(IFC 2007) TheE-learning component grew rapidly from 2005-7 from 145 student (4 sites) to its 27 current size and now accounting for 20% of Kenya's nursing students. Scale-up occurred both in rural (70%) and urban settings (30%) while the annual operating budget is $0.5 mill (approximately $110 per student). The success of the program stemmed from effective partnerships with public and private institutions. The Nursing Council of Kenya offered support and certification for the program and Accenture assisted with development of the E-curriculum. Al\\1REF extensive history in medical provision in the region added credibility to the effort as well. 3.2.2 Branch Campuses / Franchise Models Institutions with established reputations in either developed or developing countries may expand locally, regionally or internationally with an additional (sometimes modest) campuses which serve to expand the educational and research options for faculty and students in the original campus or service educational markets in host countries/regions. A variant model, the franchise, seeks to establish multiple sites and expand into new markets where possible. Franchises are more likely to exist as for-profit models. In each case, both expect that the name recognition associated with the institution transmits credibility and addresses student/ customer uncertainty with respect to the quality of the educational experience. Figure 7 International Distribution of Branch Campuses (n=190) 2% Source: WesternEm\u00b7ope Latin America & Carribean Iii Sub-SaharanAfr\u00b7ica w. Middle East & Nor-th Africa ;m South Asia & Indian Ocean \"' East Asia & Pacific Ocem1 Wl Ausn\u00b7alia & New Zealand Eastern Europe & Cenn\u00b7al Asia Pakistan's Aga I<han University, part of the Aga I<han Development Network (NGO), opened a branch campus focused on nursing education in East Africa in 2002.(Altbach and Knight 2007) The Kenya program is tied to the Agal<han hospital in Nairobi which was founded in 1958, so the well-established record in health and institutional affiliation confers credibility. Anecdotal evidence from early interviews, however, stresses that the capacity to recruit local faculty for training is limited and poses a significant challenge to scaling up operations. 3.2.2.b Country-level response and branch campus Although additional entry from branch campuses potentially can contribute to alleviating the scarcity of human resources, organizations must be responsive to country policy with respect to external institutions. For example, South Africa's stricter regulatory and accreditation approach resulted in several educational institutions pulling out of the country due to accreditation issues.(Altbach and Knight 2007) As indicated 28 earlier, the political sensitivities surrounding issues of access and quality may trump desire to maximize output. 3.2.3 Twinning Arrangements and Exchanges Twinning arrangements are formal institutional affiliations between developing country educational/ service organizations and developed world counterparts. Typically the models allow for faculty exchange, research collaborations or other mutually beneficial linkages, but they may also include direct support for operations in developing countries.(Ivt:acDonagh,Jiddawi et al. 2002; SAMSS 2010) Twinning and\u00b7exchange programs ate more focused on improving the quality of medicine and research across universities rather than directly increasing the supply of physician, nurses or other medical workers. A large share of affiliations in these types of twinning or exchange programs occur in private institutions. 29 Table 9 Select Twinning Institutions in Africa Developing Institution( s) Developed Institution( s) Country.

Higher f1xed costs of entry likely result in participation only if there appears suff1ciently strong local demand for the education services provided to individuals. In order to cover a breadth of programs some may offset losses in specif1c programs with revenues from other departments (say, business school revenue covering health or science programs). 3.2.5.a Central Universi!J (Ghana) Central University (Accra) has used a cross-subsidization model in which the business school (in operation for 10 years) is assisting with the funding of the School of Applied Sciences (medical assistant, pharmacist and nursing school). The capital costs for a health-related school are estimated at $0.3 M-$2.0 M (US) for a modest size program. 3.2.5.b Hubert Kairuki Memorial Universi!J (Tanzania) Multi-disciplinary training institutions such as medical schools likely have set up costs ranging from $2-$10 M (US). Hubert Kairuki was established in Tanzania as a private institution with degree programs across a range of disciplines in medicine and nursing (MD, Master of Medicine, Bachelor of Nursing). Student tuition covers 90% of recurrent cost (~2007), but enrollment is growing well-increasing the probability that the school will be prof1table in the future. The justif1cation for start-up, in part, was based on the strong demand for medical professionals. The school is accredited and has a strong reputation. According to the list of priorities developed by the institution, many of the current top priorities are focused on marketing, f1nance and operations, with research and infrastructure less important. 31 Table 10 Priorities at Hubert Kairuki Memorial University Priority Priorities Level 1 Legal and Accreditation Improved Legal Framework (Organization and Governance ) Marketing Expansion of Enrollment Improved Marketing, Public Relations and Linkages Operations Enhanced Scope and Quality Assurance of Teaching and Learning Improved Information & Communication Technology (ICT) capacity and application Improved Human Resources Management (HRM) Improved Handling of Students Affairs Improved HN /AIDS Prevention, Care & Support for Staff and Students Finance Improved Financial Resource Mobilization and Management 2 Research Enhanced Research and Publications Capacity Improved Library Capacity and Services Equity Improved Gender Balance 3 Public/Private Services Improved Consultancy and Services to the Public Facilities Improved Infrastructure and Facilities Source: Hubert Kattuki Memonal University website 3.3 Assessment of Health Educational Models Given the novelty of these educational models in the developing world (and health sectors specifically), there is little current anecdotal or statistical evidence with regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the organizational models. Nevertheless, there are clear distinguishing feature and likely trade-offs with choice of organizational form. Moreover, depending on the market characterization within a particular country (monopoly, oligopoly, degree of government control), particular forms may make more sense to adopt, particularly in resource constrained environments such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Table 11 summarizes some of the likely relative benefits and drawbacks of distance/virtual, branch, twinning and traditional models with respect to cost, quality and access (similar to fmance, marketing and regulatory success factors identified in the beginning of the section). These should be viewed as provisional assessments, but the evidence base will likely expand over time to improve understanding of the benefits and costs of each model. 32 Table 11 Select Comparison of Educational Models - Model Characteristics Traditional Private Start-up Cost: High initial fixed capital costs (esp. for high-cadre health workers) limit entry. Funding from NGO, donor or government loan is often necessary unless sponsored by social entrepreneur .. Ongoing operational/recurrent costs also are significant Access: Market acceptance likely depends on prior reputation of affiliated organization. Fixed location limits the degree to which individuals can have access (esp. for rural areas) Quality: Quality is variable. A big question is the degree to which entrant can compete with entrentched state schools for faculty. Collaborative models do exist in which faculty are \"rented\" by private institutions. Virtual / Distance Learning Cost: Lower costs for operation and reduced initial fixed costs for infrastructure are large benefit, particularly in resource constrained environments Access: Access depends on the prevalence and quality of the technology medium. Low-tech solutions exist (e.g. correspondence programs), however. Given the lack of historical record in providing viable health education and producing good employment/producitivy outcomes, individuals (and regulators) may be weary to adopt. Quality: Quility of the modality, especially for high-cadre health profession may be legitimately questioned and, as a result, accreditation will hinge on proving the model. Most likely a \"mixed\" model will be more effective (and favorably viewed). States likely have limited regulatory capacity to evaluate some of these potentially new health educational forms. Branch Cost: High flxed costs for new campus (but perhaps less than pure new start-up). Access: Improves access to new populations. Reception by public may also be better than a traditional start-up or virtual approach if the reputation of the educational institution is already established on the basis of the main campus Quality: Interaction with other faculty from separate branches may aid quality of teaching and research Twinning Cost: A low-cost (but also low yield) strategy. These relationships may improve the skills of the existing students, but may not have an appreciable effect on the total output of physicians, nurses or health workers Access: Improves access of students to other settings (and different skills) Quality: Main effect is to improve the quality rather than quantity of graduates 33 3.4 Poliry Issues and Institutional Considerations As this work is aimed at both policy makers and private organizations (current or future), this sub-section examines the policy issues that government bodies should address and the strategic considerations that private educational organizations (both novel and traditional) may wish to examine. Regulation can enable the private market. In considering the degree to which the government wishes to invoke the private market to contribute to production of health workers, government policy can influence the entry, recognition, accreditation and quality assurance of existing private institutions and new entrants (either in traditional or novel forms). Regulation is actually a key enabling mechanism for the private market given the power that accreditation and formal recognition can have on consumer decisions to seek further education using private modalities-particularly in scenarios in which the state-run public health education institutions have dominated the production of health workers. The caveat is that some governments will go beyond accreditation and actively limit behavior, try to control content, or deliberately reduce expenditures. Differential recognition, accreditation and quality assurance mechanism may be warrantt:!d for different education markets. The viability of the private sector to \"self-regulate\" and effectively produce effective physicians, nurses and other health workers may differ depending on type of worker and availability. In competitive markets with high potential for entry, clear information and low-barriers of entry, a relatively unfettered private market may \"cull\" weak organizations. In less competitive market, the private sector may be more carefully managed and entry restricted. Naturally these markets will likely continue to behave in a manner more consistent with regulated oligopoly-these will produce fewer, but better quality, health workers. Accreditation and quality assurance strike a balance between quality and quantity of health workers. Government capacity to regulate (especially new potential private models) is in flux and may require modification. For example, with regard to branch campuses \"the legal status of an international branch campus as a foreign-owned entity may trigger additional regulatory burdens, including limits on tuition fees or enrollments, tax issues, and import/ export restrictions for hard currency.\"(Denman 2009) Changing these regulations may more readily invite institutions with broader experience to contribute to the market. Of course, some countries may wish to enforce these industrial policies. In some cases \"international branch campuses are registered, licensed or legally recognized in the host and home countries. Some host countries do not register and/ or evaluate the quality of foreign branchs as part of their national system, usually due to a lack of capacity or political will.\" (Denman 2009) Policy makers should establish a position with regard to the transferability of the degrees conferred by private institutions (or public for that matter) to other countries. A large share of physicians and nurses in Africa emigrat~e from host countries in Sub-Saharan Africa--28% of physicians and 11% of nurses according to Center for Global Development.(Clemens 2006) On the one hand, if efforts and funding to train health works only produce \"brain drain\" and deplete humah resources this can,y have negative consequences on the productivity of the educational system.(Gaynor 1994) However, these inducements also serve to motivate some entry into these professions by individuals who ultimately will remain in the country. Novel initiatives such as the, Brain Gain initiative linking Arab and African universities or programs which encourage temporary exchange of health workers across borders, are reshaping the debate on the value of transferability. (I<:apur 2008; UNESCO 2009) Public finance decisions can shape the extent of private entry into a market. As the state is frequently involved in both finance (grants/loans/loan guarantees) and provision of education, the degree to which these sources of finance can be applied to private health education institutions likely has an important affect on the viability of the market. Naturally, high-cost educational programs (physicians), all else equal, will be more influenced by more open forms of public flnance. 34 Section 4: Conclusions and Recommendations Given the limited literature examining private sector models in most Sub-Saharan African markets, Ol.J:! review and analysis facilitates understanding of market structure and the potential new forms of private organizations which may bolster the capacity of the region to produce health workers. More detailed understanding of the success (or failure) factors which existing private health education institutions exhibit will be gleaned during the qualitative institutional interviews associated with this project. Currently, private entrants in health education markets are generally (although not exclusively) viewed as secondary quality institutions aiming to enter high profit areas (in the case of for-profits) for a \"quick return\" as a \"credentialing shop\"-with some justification. But new entrants with different business models are not restricted to competing as low-quality, small-scale entrants. However, while novel forms of private education are rapidly emerging in the developed world market for higher education (including some health professions such as nursing or public health), there is less overall activity in Sub-Saharan Africa and only a share of that naturally occurs in health education markets. The potential of some models to reduce cost and increase output of health workers exists, although the level of technology adoption within country markets (say, internet access) may have important infrastructure effects on the viability and quality of the several modes for educating health workers. Nevertheless, government and institution decisions will play a crucial role in the extent of development of these models. Based on this initial literature review, we propose recommendations in four areas: Regulation 1) Improve regulatory capacity to develop accreditation and credible quality assurance mechanisms. This may take the form of public or private regulators. The informational value to consumers/ students will encourage greater adoption of potentially lower-cost training programs. The mechanisms should be periodi~ally review. 2) Characterize education markets at the health worker/ country level and develop regulations accordingly. The regulatory requirements for lower-cadre programs may differ from high-cadre sectors. Over-regulating a competitive market will reduce production and efficiency. It also wastes government resources. Not ensuring quality in more restricted markets may invite poor-quality production and entry. Modern accreditation and certification organizations can play a critical role in aligning personal, professional, and countrywide needs 3) Strongly consider adopting measures that allow for recognition of qualifications either regionally or internationally. Each country must consider A) the capacity for programs to train workers at international or regional standards and B) the degree to which the costs (potential for emigration) compare to benefits (more incentive to enter the profession, improved capacity to increase quality and future international collaboration) Modern technology makes test taking and assessment less costly than it has been in the past. 35 Inputs 4) Build teaching capacity. In addition the physical capital there is a dearth of qualified instructors, these two inputs important \"rate-limiting\" institution constraints on the production of health workers. Consideration should be given to limited incentives for outstanding teaching, student . placement, and course improvement. It may be possible to attain donor support for this type of . . activity. Models 5) Promote cross-subsidization models. Many universities in developed countries use profit generating educational units such as business school to subsidize the initial losses associated with capital costs for medical and health institutional development. Similarly, many medical schools subsidize their doctor training programs. Cross subsidization makes sense because there is some predictability of revenues and a degree of control over where they will come from anq how they will be used. Social entrepreneurship activities, such as subsidizing teacher salaries through stipends from the company can create much good at limited cost. 6) Don't start from scratch-support branch campuses. Models which leverage existing institutions (branch or even franchise models) may improve quality and also operate more efficiently (these organizations have long histories of operating successfully, albeit in different environments\u00ad some lessons are likely transferrable). Excellent examples of this may be found in eurQpean business schools opening branch campuses in China and using these to offset declining revenues at home. This benefit should be weighed against the costs of increasing regulatory oversight and developing institutional capacity. Finance 7) \"Level the Playing Field\" for financial resources to support both public and priva1te high\u00ad quality institutions. If private institutions can not compete for government funding fo:r education, the appeal of the market is naturally reduced. It is best to have a policy that all are welcome to apply and to use evaluative mechanisms in which the money \"follows the student\" or tracks results (eg. financing according to number ofstudents enrolled or even outcome measures such as graduates passing qualifying exams). Competition in this context can have desirable side effects. 8) Evaluate the degree to which individuals can finance their own education. The state is heavily involved in fmancing higher education for health on the basis that he~lth is an important public good. However, in many cases (not just high cadre jobs), the individual gains a substantial return on the training. Finding the appropriate level of subsidy is not easy but the education to education should bear at least some relation to the expected future private income benefits 9) Seek novel financing sources for both fixed capital costs and recurrent expenditures. Both private and non-profit organization should consider leveraging their capabilities to extract revenue from firms or organization in the health business. These may include developed country institutions (US National Institutes of Health) and private fttms (pharmaceuticals) seeking to conduct research and development in Africa. 36 Annex1 Virtual and/ or Distance Education Universities in Sub-Saharan Africa Coul!try Institutions Cameroon University of Dschang Ethiopia Addis Ababa University (AAU) Jimma University (JU) Mekelle University (MU) Ghana Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMP A) University of Cape Coast (DCC) University of Education Lesotho National University of Lesotho (NUL) Madagascar National Distance Learning Centre of Madagascar (CNTEMAD), Niger University Abdou Moumouni University Tafawa Balewa University Bello University Institute of Management and Technology (IM1) Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) University of Abuja (UNIBUJA) University of Calabar (UNICAL) University of Lagos Rwanda Kigali Institute of Education South Africa INTEC College University of South Africa University of the Free State Sudan Omdurman Ahlia University Swaziland University of Swaziland Tanzania Institute of Finance Management (IFM) The Open University ofTansania (OU1) Togo University of Lome Uganda Kyambogo University (KYU) Uganda Martyrs University (UMU) Zambia University of Zambia The.Afncan Vu:tual Uruverstty (AVU) 1s a consort:tum of centers across Afnca These institutions identified themselves as having virtual/ distance learning programs in the World Higher Education Database (\\:v'HED, 2007) from the International Association of Universities Source: Denman (2009) 37 Virtual University (Institution or Consortium) Distance Learning International Distance Education Programs Open University Mixed-Mode Blended Instruction Bridging and Twinning Programs Satellite or Extension (Branch) Campuses Correspondence- based Education Open Educational Resources (OER) Online Education Source: Denman (2009) Annex2 Select Definitions for Novel Educational Organizations A virtual university is dedicated to a teaching, learning and research environment in which it connects its teachers and students solely by electronic, technologica.l means. Virtual and distance universities are considered synonymous, but the latter may use other forms of technology to transmit knowledge (see correspondence-based) Some entities require a short term presence to take a test in each course. This term identifies any form of learning that is conducted when both teacher and student are at a distance. As Keegan states, \"Distance learning systems used technology to separate the learner from the teacher, and the learner from the learning group, while maintaining the integrity of the education process\" International distance education programs are degree-granting programs delivered by a home institution to other locations throughout the world by satellites, computers, correspondence or other technological means. They may also be delivered in face-to- face formats (e.g. via inter-institutional partnerships and branch campuses) \"Any university with an open admissions policy This term attempts to characterize a balanced pedagogical approach of face--to-face teaching with online instruction. Blended may include face-to-face and e-learning or an integration of other technologies (e.g. print) Bridging programs, also known as foundation courses, allow for prerequisit'e courses to be undertaken in preparation for a qualifying degree program. Twinning programs refer to agreements made between institutions in different countries to offer portions of their degree programs at both institutions (e.g.l +3 and 2+2 year models) Satellite campuses are physical entities established by a home institution that offer the same degree and/ or courses at a distance. This classification also includes overseas branch campuses that may not necessarily take on the same characteristics of the host culture in which they operate \"Correspondence education is defined as providing teaching via the written world by means of so-called self-instructional texts combined with communication in writing (i.e. correspondence between students and tutors)\" \"[OER] refers to the open provision of educational resources, enabled by information and communication technologies, for consultation, use and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes\". It usually takes the form of open source software, which is intended for the development and delivery of resources (content management systems, development tools, social software, and learning management systems); courseware and other materials published online for reference; and implementation sources (licensing tools, interoperability, and best practices). Online education refers to the provision of education and training utilizing the Internet and the WWW. Although synonymous to E-learning, online education generally includes the use of a learning management system that provides both structure and guidance 38 Bibliography Adcock, D., C. Ross, et al.

In their current form, public fmances alone cannot keep pace with the growing demand for the higher education needed to scale up the health workforce to meet health outcome goals in Africa. Augmentation of public fmance of health institutions with innovative private sector sources, novel public fmance approaches and unique mechanisms of fmance for health institutions may help bridge the gap between the demand for health workers in developing countries and the current capacity of the state to fund the production of human capital for health. This study will highlight key issues related to private or public sector fmance for tertiary health education institutions, examine potential novel sources of funding from various sectors (public, private for-profit, private not-for-profit) and evaluate the costs, benefits and feasibility of these potential fmancing solutions. One of the main motives for the study is to inform country level policy advisory work being undertaken by the Health in Africa Initiative in conjunction with Ministries of Health and other stakeholders in select African countries. The expectation is that this study, as part of a series ofiFC-World Bank studies looking at the issue of human resources in health through a private sector lens, would help countries to develop a framework for thinking about how they can best use public and private fmancial resources to alleviate the problem of weak human resource production. This study is intended for private sector investors, policy makers and donors. The study aspires to move these actors towards concrete actions to adopt useful fmancial practices and innovative mechanism from the public and private sector in order to address the human resources in health crisis facing Africa. 2-Background The human resources crisis is a key constraint in Africa,s health systems. The critical nature of the human resources in health (HRH) crisis has been brought to the forefront of the health debate in the last few years.Goint_Leaming_Initiative 2004; World_Bank 2004; Joint_Learning_Initiative 2006; WHO 2006) The WHO's needs based estimates indicate that that an additional 1.5 million health workers are required to meet basic healthcare needs in Africa and reach the health l'viDG, at a cost of $2.6bn per annum in training. Demand based estimates indicate a lower but still acute shortage of 800,000 healthcare workers in 31 African countries by 2015.(Scheffler, Liu et al. 2008; WHO 2008) In the context of the private sector in particular, The IFC's Business of Health in Africa Report emphasized the human resources crisis as one of the five principal constraints affecting the private sector. Financing the production of skiUed health workers is a vital ingredient in the strengthening of health systems. But it takes a considerable investment of time and resources to train them. Preliminary studies have indicated that changing the skill mix of health workers is an important first step toward improving the supply of health workers given a f1Xed resource envelop. Nevertheless, expanding financing and improving the efficiency of existing fmancial inputs are crucial for meeting the urgent need to increase the number of medical, nursing and allied health workers and train them to have relevant skills. 1 Figure 1: Shortages in Health Workers Source: World Health Report (WHO, 2006) .. fl\\i Cruntries with critical shortage l't J Cc~ntries without critical shortage \" 0 .. .. 0 0 .. \" 0 I .-... ' Africa has a large number of potential health workers. For the past three decades, internal and external investments in African education systems have been targeted to the primary and secondary levels of the education sector. As a result, the number of qualified secondary school graduates has increased, leading to a larger pool of potential higher education students. The expansion of education at lower levels has increased the marginal value of tertiary education, including health education.(Salmi 2006a) As the African economy continues to grow at over 5% a year, new opportunities arise to harness potential gains in human resource development, especially the production of health workers. One way to accomplish this is to invest in and improve tertiary level health training. There is a dearth of formal analyses of health education finance in Africa. Nevertheless, recent examinations of the role of the private sector and private finance in tertiary educational institutions across a range of developing country setting inform some of the opportunities and challenges associated with engaging private sector finance mechanisms to support expansion of health education within Africa.(Preker 2008; Patrinos 2009; Salmi 2009; Beciu 2009b) In addition, there are unique characteristics associated with health institutions which may allow these schools to access specific sources of finance (such as health research funds from industry or government sponsored research). This paper will try to address both the more general private and public funding sources (banks, etc.) as well as health-specific sources (e.g. R&D in clinical research). 2 3 -Objective The overarching goal of the study is to examine how innovative fmance approaches could bolster African country capacity to successfully scale up and strengthen the production of quality health workers. Specifically, the sub-objectives of the study include: 3.1 -Describe Current. Situation This study will evaluate research related to public and private fmancing mechanisms for public and private health education training institutions and students in Africa. As data is limited within the narrow niche comprised of fmancing tertiary health education in Africa, the review will primarily focus on other innovative public or private fmancing mechanism in related sectors or geographies-but draw lessons for the African health education context. Method: Specifically, the analysis will examine the literature to compare models and innovations in education fmance (especially tertiary education), developing country fmance (especially Africa) and health fmance (especially private health fmance) and, to the extent possible, examine sources which focus on intersections of these three areas. (Figure 2). To the extent that there is limited amount which specifically addresses tertiary education finance within health for developing countries in Africa-it will be covered-but the review of these related streams of research will yield useful insights regarding the fmancing options for tertiary health education in Africa and the role that the private sector may play. Specific country examples and context for key issues.

We will specifically highlight the potential role for the private sector to participate in either the ftnance or investment process for public, private or mixed (public private partnership--PPP) modes. The study will evaluate options with respect to efficiency, equity and f,~asibility of implementation. It will also provide detailed recommendations on the pre-requisites, including any policy changes, required to make the proposed improvements and innovative financing mechanisms a success. Ideally this framework will allow policy makers and investors to select the approaches which they deem most suitable. 4 -Current Situation There is a wide range of health training institutions in Africa with regard to output (MDs, Nurses, Midwives, Community Health Workers), experience, capabilities and ftnancial resources. In general, most African countries initially established public tertiary education facilities upon (or in some case prior to) independence and continue to rely on public-sector as the dominant form of provision on the basis that health is a \"public good\" and it is necessary to develop human resources to address health-related needs. Financing for students also was usually very generous and state-supported so as to ostensibly A) promote equity and B) encourage talented students to attain tertiary education. As sustainable funding became less viable during budget crises (particularly through the 1970s and 1980s), states restructured their tertiary care education programs to by reducing funding and incorporating user fees-leaving the student (or family) responsible for at least some of the direct and indirect educational costs. Concomitant loan programs were usually established to address equity concerns, although the amount of the loan and terms of payment varied considerably. In many cases, the loan programs relied on means-testing or restricted access to individuals that met a minimum level of performance on entrance exams (merit-based loans) or invoked both strategies to limit their funding exposure. Several loan schemes, usually organized by the state, have become insolvent due to the high default rate and have been restructured (or bailed out) by the governments. In short, outside of pockets in Anglophone Africa there are usually limited government resources for supporting tertiary health education and more attention has been focused on expanding the role of the private sector (in tertiary education generally) for both provision and ftnancing of education as a result. Currently, most health education institutions in the region typically operate on very limited budgets and struggle to ftnance recurrent costs such as faculty salaries and capital expenditures such as buildings and infrastructure development. (\\Vorld_Bank 2000; Preker 2008) In some cases (e.g. Ghana), the limited resources are concentrated on salaries and short run variable costs with little funding for long-term capital improvement or maintenance (<3% in some Ghanaian Medical Schools).(Beciu 2009a) A broader study of 55 low-income countries indicates that, on average, 74 percent of these recurrent expenditures are directed toward teacher salaries and benefits at the basic education level.(Bruns, Mingat et al. 2003; Glewwe, Kremer et al. 2006) Existing physical structures and infrastructure for health education is under strain as a result or poor upkeep and swelling student-demand for tertiary education (including health). The paucity of public funding is further complicated by principle-agent issues since often the l'vfinistry of Education (MoE) or Ministry of Finance (MoF) may serve as the primary financing contributor while the Ministry of Health (MoH) sets goals and expectations with respect the output from these educational 4 institutions, but plays a minority role in financing tertiary health education. For example, in Ghana, where the MoH covers a third of expenditures for health schools (primarily medical schools) but drives the agenda for expectations regarding the output of all health workers, there is a wide chasm between the short-run output goals of the MoH with respect the physicians, nurses, midwives and other health workers and the fea.sible output given resource constraints.(Beciu 2009a) This is a central issue. While this review did not identify countries which coordinate health policy objectives, targets, training and budgets; this deserves further attention in future qualitative and quantitative work to identify mechanisms that improve coordination across these objectives. In order to make up for the limited resources in the public sector, there are two basic ways that the private sector may contribute. Finance: First, the private sector can serve as a source of finance1. One example of private fmancing is student loans from private banks (in some cases guaranteed or subsidized by the state) to assist students with tuition or user fees (at either public or private schools). Innovative mechanism to involve private fmance either via direct support of tertiary education institutions or indirect support via student focused financing mechanisms, expand available resources while developing important capabilities for continued future growth.(Salmi 2006a). Financing may cover either recurrent or capital expenditures. F'rovision: Second, the private sector may also be involved in provision of education. Schools may be built, owned, operated and managed by private organizations (or may focus on a subset of these services). In the general tertiary education sector many private schools have recently been established (of varying degrees of quality) across many African countries. Table 1 summarizes the public and private roles with respect to finance and provision2. While this matrix is designed for primary and secondary education projects, it applies to tertiary health education in Africa as well. (Sosale 2000) 1 Private provision of education may also be enhanced by allowing public funding sources for individuals, such as public merit-based scholarships and needs-based grants to be directed toward private institutions. In most of francophone Sub-Saharan Africa this practice is uncommon (with the exception of, perhaps, Cote D'Ivoire) 2 Provision may encompass either ownership of the school, management of the school or both. 5 Public Provision Private Provision Table 1: Public and Private Provision and Financing Public Financing Traditional public school typically with ftnancing provided by the state (usually via taxes distributed to the Ministry of Health or Ministry of Education) User fees at public institutions may also be covered via state supported scholarships, grants and loans (often subsidized) Public financing .. or voud1ers (with individual choke) for use with privately .. delivered education Contracting out of n1anagement \u00b7 operational, facility, professionalor education sertices Private Financing Publi(; school v?hich charges tu:ition or user to students to: help fund recurrent ot capital expenditures.

Public school with financing from other private sources (foundations, privatefttrns,NGOs) NGO/Non~profttinstitutions (esp. in :rural areas for lower cadre health wo.rkers) A '' Important determinants of the extent of private sector fmance or provision in education markets include A) the regulatory controls related to education and fmance and B) the attractiveness of the market for private sector organizations. It should be noted that private sector institutions include both for-proftt and not-for\u00ad proftt models. While not-for~proftts may enter market niches that are not as attractive proftt centers (for example, ecumenical organizations providing health worker education in rural environments in Africa for the purposes of improving the human resources available for public health)-these organizations also are more likely to emerge and remain viable in environments which they do not suffer persistent fmanciallosses. Regulation can serve as a critical enabler for emergent private sector provision models. The frequent perception of private institutions in the health education tertiary market positions them as low-quality \"credentialing shops\" servicing residual demand for lower quality students with resources to pay for further education.(Kapur 2008) Clearly there are exceptions to this perception, but future entrants will beneftt from regulation, particularly accreditation and quality assurance mechanisms, which certify the quality of the institution to the public. Another important organizational form which have emerged to address education objectives are public private partnerships (PPPs).(Patrinos 2009) There is an emerging body of evidence from the general education literature in developing (including primary and secondary education) to indicate that these organizational forms can effectively address ftnancial, quality and access goals in more effective manner than the public sector alone. We will discuss the applicability of these results to the health sector late:r. There is essentially a very broad spectrum for the degree of private entry in both provisi<;>n and finance. The government, in some cases, plays a dominant role in both the provision and fmancing of education. While a 6 completely private solution to education is unlikely, increasingly government organizations are partnering with private entities in PPPs or encouraging independent efforts by private firms in the provision and delivery sectors. Figure 3 summarizes the range of approaches for educational policy.

Incentives and programs to encourage private participation may focus on addressing particular needs with respect f111ance, provision and spending. For example, as tertiary health schools in Africa struggle with capital expenditure, then if one assumes that the public sector is less efficient in undertaking capital projects and transaction costs are not prohibitive, then contracting out facility development, in which the government partners with the private sector to :lmprove efficiency of capital expenditures may be warranted.(Patrinos 2007) Such is an example of public finance with private provision for a specific spending category (capital). Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in education come in a myriad of forms, but they generally address at least one element from each category (finance, provision, spending) listed in Figure 4. 7 Figure 4 Finance: Potential Funding Sources Individual I Family Private (For-Profit) Private (Not-for-Profit) Public Student/ Family Wages, Student loans (Banks) Foundation grants (or loans) Taxes (general taxation, VAT, Income, Wealth Bonds Endowments industry specific taxes Alumni gifts .Microfinance initiatives (for Social microfinance (e.g .

(Jimenez 1986; Chapman, Hanushek et al. 2006) Absent this condition (if social benefit equals or is less than private benefit) individuals will rationally invest in education (assuming credit availability) up to the point where the marginal private costs equal the marginal private benefits. Although the externalities associated with education may differ across the different educational strata (primary, secondary, tertiary), the social externalities include additional health, education, social and labor benefits. Table 2 summarizes some of the benefits aside from direct labor market affects which accrue to the individual.(Wolfe and Zuvekas 1997;Jamison,Jamison et al. 2007; Patrinos 2009) Table 2: N onmarket and External Benefits of Education Benefit type Child education Child health Fertility Own health Spouse's health Job search efficiency Desired family size Technological change Social cohesion Crime Findings Parental education affects child's educational level & achievement Child's health positively related to parental education Mother's education lowers daughter's births More education increases life expectancy More schooling improves spouse's health & lowers mortality More schooling reduces cost of search, increases mobility More schooling improves contraceptive efficiency Schooling helps R&D, diffusion Schooling may increase voting & reduces alienation Education may reduce criminal activity Sources: Patrinos (2009) and Wolfe and Zuvekas (1997) While it is likely that several of the proposed benefits to primary and secondary education are not applicable to tertiary education, particularly health tertiary education-there are likely significant social benefits to training additional health workers which are not recognized or accounted for by the individual while making the decision to seek additional tertiary health education. These may include the social and economic benefits of improved health and productivity of future patients (particularly those in the workforce or who contribute to home production). These externalities support the subsidization of tertiary health education (either by fmance or provision), but the degree of subsidy should, in theory, depend on the magnitude of the externality relative to overall social benefit. 9 4.2 -Rationale for private sector financing or provision of tertiary education The existence of at least some private benefit suggests that there is a role for private sector provision and financing in tertiary health education. Of course the major internalized benefit is future wages (often quite high relative to educational costs among the upper cadres). Approximately 28% of Sub-Saharan physicians and 11% of nurses emigrate to large developed economies to practice. (Clemens 2006) In these cases, the . realized individual gains can increase by an order of magnitude (or more) relative to origination country wage levels. In addition, independent of emigration, the internalized benefits relative to externalities are likely to differ across cadre and even within profession (e.g. high skill vs. low skill nurses). Naturally, the mix of internalized and external net benefits (benefit- cost) is a strong motivation behind finance and delivery models in health which follow a public-private partnership model. In theory, the optimal solution should also account for the transaction costs associated with regulation imbedded in any financing solution either via public or private means. Another logical argument for emphasizing a private solution for. health education markets is the nature of credentialing in the labor market for these professions. One's educational status is measurable (I'viD, RN, ect.) and contestability from substitutes (say, from a traditional medicine healer) is limited in the market-particularly given advancements in technology and the informational advantages which health workers maintain relative to patients and payers.(Preker, Harding et al. 2000) These characteristics argue for a more private-oriented solution for the provision of education. Figure 4b offers a mnceptual characterization of how the relative net internalized and external benefits (relative to the costs of education) may shift as cadre level increases. In reality the ideal educational provision and financing models (public vs. private) should depend on the internalized vs. external net benefits relative to educational costs (e.g. a private solution could, in theory, be appropriate for certain community health workers) Figure 4b Internalized and External Net Benefits by Cadre-Implications for Education Delivery and Finance Future Net Benefit (Relative to educational costs) Community Health Worker Left of dotted line Favors more public\u00ad oriented solution for finance and delivery of education (Make) Medical Technician 10 RN Internalized Benefits External Benefits Right qfdotted lim Favors more private\u00ad oriented solution for finance and delivery of education (Buy) Pharmacist MD Cadre Leve Some of the benefits of private provision and financing as described by Fielden (2008) include: Supplementing the limited capacity of government institutions to absorb growth in higher education enrollments. Private resources can be (and often are) focused on providing additional inputs (e.g. textbooks, infrastructure, IT, training, and development) aimed at improving the quality of education delivered in government institutions. Opportunities for governments to support publicly funded students in private higher education institutions -often at a lower per-student cost than in the public sector. A mechanism to raise both the efficiency and quality of education delivery since studies indicate that private delivery of education can be more efficient than public delivery, when measured on a per-student basis.(IFC 2001) New skills and knowledge- pedagogic, technical and management- to all levels of education. The greater management flexibility enjoyed by the private sector means that it is much better placed than public schools to introduce curricular and program innovations, improved assessment methods, and modern teaching methods. Private organizations can also circumvent unnecessarily restrictive employment laws and outdated pay scales that limit the ability of public schools to hire appropriate staff and organize delivery in the most efficient and effective manner. , The competition from increased private delivery of education can generate improved performance among both public and private schools. A wider set of fmancing options, frequently less restricted by government bureaucracy. 4.3-The Extent of Private Financing and Provision in Tertiary Education in the Developing World andAfric:a There has been a recent expansion in the provision of private education, both within and outside the health sector in Africa, across various education levels. Enrollment in private primary education grew by 58 percent between 1991 and 2004--increasing absolute enrollment from 39 million to 62 million.3 Moreover, much of the growtl1 occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.(Patrinos 2009) In some cases these for-profit or not-for-profit schools are formally recognized and licensed by the state, but in some cases these are rdatively small, unlicensed operators which fulfill a specific market niche (usually within a particular geographic areas such as rural regions). These schools respond to market demand moreso than an explicit national policy effort to expand the private provision of schooling. The composition of tertiary education markets in Africa typically includes a few large, public institutions (often with high quality faculty and a significant history) and numerous, smaller private institutions which fill specific market geographic or worker\u00ad type segments. Private tertiary education institutions outnumber public institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa, but account for only approximately 20 percent of student enrollment.(World_Bank 2009a) Although the data with respect to public and private fmancing shares is limited, UNESCO data for a subset of African countries suggest that public finance plays the dominant role with respect to tertiary education (and education expenditure generally)-a result given the historical support of public tertiary institutions on the theoretical justification of large social externalities associated with education (which are also relevant for health education). Table 3 shows that the share of private expenditures in tertiary education markets is below 50% and, more commonly roughly one-third of total expenditures.(UNESCO 2009a) Evidence from 3 During the same period public enrollment also increased, but at a 10% rate. 11 international comparisons and country specific analyses also suggest the limited role for private sector provision in the health sector in Africa.(World_Bank 2000; Beciu 2009b) Table 3 Private Expenditure Share in Tertiary Education for Select African Countries4 Country Tertiary Education Tertiary Education Private Sector Share of Year Public Expenditure Private Expenditure Tertiary Education (% ofGDP) (% ofGDP) Expenditures Benin 0.52 0.27 0.24 0.11 2006 Rwanda 1.03 0.00. 0.0% 2008 Source: UNESCO Educational Database (2009) Undoubtedly, the expansion of primary and secondary education has resulted in a larger pool of individuals seeking to further their education with tertiary skills.5 In developed and developing countries, private provision tends to be more common at the tertiary level than at primary or secondary levels, but still is generally a minority share of overall expenditure and enrollment. (Fielden 2008) Table 4 reflects enrollment growth for tertiary education over a five year period (across both public and private institutions). Based on country level reports, similar growth patterns are present within the health tertiary education sector too. 4 Note in the case of Guinea, Niger and Rwanda private share was calculated by subtracting total expenditure from public expenditure within the database for the relevant statistics (these figures are italicized). s From a theoretical standpoint the relative private rate of return between tertiary vs. primary or secondary education increases as the supply of the primary and secondary graduates increases. There is greater competition for wages and increased value associated with seeking additional education to differentiate one's skills within a larger pool of job applicants with primary or secondary education. 12 Table 4 Enrollment in Tertiary Education (Full and Part Time)6 Country 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 % Growth 2003-2007 Database (2009) Schools and other educational institutions have struggled to keep pace with the significant growth in demand. In many cases, countries have simply increased class size and enrollment without increasing teacher recruitment and development or upgrading capital equipment and facilities to accommodate the increase in students. For example, in Ghana the tertiary student population doubled between 2003 and 2007, but the number of instructors at the tertiary level increased just nine percent over the same period. (UNESCO 2009a) Given the high technical knowledge in health and medical fields, the trend is most likely even more pronounced with respect to health tertiary education, especially for training of higher-cadre health workers. Country level analysis of Ghanian health education has borne this out.(Beciu 2009; Beciu 2009a; Beciu 2009b) 6 These totals include both public and private tertiary education institutions. Disaggregated totals are not available by public or private institution. 13 Private Share of Private Share of Higher Education Higher Education Region Country Enrollment (%) Institutions (%) Year* Sub-Saharan Botswana 28.6 86.0 2007 Africa Uganda 15.0 85.0 4.5 America 2003/5 Bolivia 77.6 92.8 2007/5 Columbia 49.6 70.6 2005/7 Costa Rica 54.6 47.1 2004 Dominican Republic 49.7 88.4 2005 Ecuador 28.7 58.7 2004 Guatemala .

Figure 5 reflects global trends in tertiary enrollment.(UNESCO 2009b) Figure 5 Tertiary gross enrolment ratios by region, 1970 to 2007 North Central Latin Central East Asia Arab South and Sub- World America and America Asia and the States West Asia Saharan and Eastern \u00b7 andthe Pacific Africa Western Europe Caribbean Europe While UNESCO does not report enrollment in the private sector at the tertiary level in the UNESCO online database, enrollment in primary and secondary levels, generally ranges from 0 to 30 percent-with a few outliers exceeding one-third of enrollment.(World_Bank 2000; UNESCO 2009a). Howev~r, examination of enrollment rates over a range of years, as exhibited in Table 4B, indicates that the enrollment shares in higher private education within Africa generally lag behind those in other developing economies in Asia and Latin America.(PROPHE 2010) Interestingly the institutional share is frequently quite large for nations in Sub\u00ad Saharan Africa. Combined with the relatively low enrollment shares, this finding reflects the fact that most private institutions participate at a much smaller scale than their public tertiary higher education counterparts. Across all sectors (not just tertiary), some of the increase in private sector enrollments over time reflects, in part, entry by low-cost private schools which target students who A) do not qualify (either on the basis of ability or means-testing) for tuition subsidization in high-quality government (or private) schools or B) cannot afford tuition at high-cost private schools. 4.4 Public Funding Mechanisms: Implications for the Private Sector A characterization of the basic options and mechanisms for public funding of public (or private) sector education demonstrate how public sector decisions may improve efficiency (and in some cases equity and access) and potentially motivate greater investment by the private sector in either provision or finance. Many 15 of these mechanisms and country examples are discussed in detailSalmi and Hauptman (2006). They can broadly be divided into two primary strategies-funding to assist institutions directly, or supply side funding, and funding for the demand side participants in the education market (students and their families). 16 5-Institutional (Supply Side) Funding Options While the traditional approach to funding public tertiary institutions operational/teaching or research capacity (including health education institutions) generally consist of a yearly budget renewal (perhaps with an inflation adjustment), more innovative mechanisms explicitly fund (or at least partially fund) on the basis of inputs, outputs, performance or combinations of the above. In principal, public fmances can be distributed to either public or private institutions (e.g. charter schools which rely on private management and public funding), but using mechanism such as performance criteria or priority targets may more appropriately allow for private schools to compete (especially if private institutions have greater flexibility in organizing their institution to reach the key targets). One key characteristic of funding mechanisms is the degree to which the university vs. government adminisll:rators decide how funding is allocated within public (or so~etime private) schools. Annual budget renewals may have very different effects depending on the incentives and governance characteristics of the funding process. If governments issue very discrete line item budgets and have limited knowledge about how funding affects incentives or functioning of the educational institution with respect to output or efficiency, then specific line item budgets with limited latitude for university-level allocation decisions may result in inefficient use of funding. However, if school management has weak incentives to innovate or improve schools and enjoys excessive freedom with respect to their budget allocation, say via a block grant, then \"too much\" freedom may result in poor use of funding. The choice over how budgets are spent should account \u00a3or the information available to both regulators and administrators and the types of incentives that each face. Recently Ecuador has shifted to a less regulated approach emphasizing the use of block grants while Australian education policy has migrated to a more stringent \"line-item\" budget in which the regulators restrict the ways that funding can be used by schools.(Salmi 2006a) In the African health education context the control of the budget and its effects on efficiency are also likely to depend on the relative strengths of the school management, regulator knowledge and the incentives/ capacity to innovate at the school level. Central to generating incentives at the school level are the mechanisms for deciding upon the magnitude (and conditions) of funding for specific educational institutions. Funding formulas or mechanisms that incorporate priority-based funding, performance \"set asides\" and pay on the basis of measurable results may more effectively engage the private sector to participate for several reasons. First, if public education institutions can increase their share of funding simply by increase student population (in cases where, say, budgets reflect an input such as student population), the public sector may monopolize funding simply by increasing student population --with little incentive to improve quality or, perhaps, even increase the number of graduates. Usurpation of resources by public institutions via traditional funding formulas may inhibit private entry or participation. Second, private institutions flexibility with respect to their inputs and management structure (e.g. limited extent of unions) may allow for greater capacity to meet goals of outcome-oriented payment mechanisms. The applicability of this differential flexibility between public and private institutions may vary based on the level of education or nature of the input mix. In the case of tertiary health education in Africa, there is likely a limited number of qualified professors that can teach in medical schools (and many of these may be tied to existing state institutions), but faculty for nursing schools and/ or community health workers may be in greater supply or more easily shifted between public and private sectors. Under this condition, it may be 17 more likely that performance-based funding could invoke competition between public and private schools for faculty and students. Nevertheless, even in the case where public medical institutions dominate enrollment share (such as, say, medical schools for physicians), performance-based incentives may still effectively encourage institutions to seek more private research funding if matching incentives are instituted. At the research level, competition for initial public funding to spur increased interactions with private sector to encourage future private sector funding for research (particularly in the case of medical schools) may be motivated by project-based funding and innovation funds.(Saint 2006) Supporting institutions which conduct research (perhaps more relevant for nursing or physician training institutions rather than health technician or lower-cadre health workers) can serve as a mechanism to benefit private schools-particularly if the organization which disperses the grants does not favor public affiliation over merit and private institutions have strengths in these areas relative to public education facilities (not always the case). To augment state or student revenue sources public (and private) tertiary education institutions in Africa have sought funding from non-traditional sources. These include partnerships with private organizations for research, use of facilities/ faculty for additional private education or instruction from which revenues assist with public sector financing (especially during night or weekend hours), alternative taxes, endowments, gifts and international aid. For example, in Nigeria public tertiary education is almost entirely financed by the government-in part these funds are generated by a 2% tax on profits of limited liability corporations (LLCs). These are complemented by private financing and donation supporting for professorships and prizes.(Ajayi and Alani 1996) Kenya has historically aimed to cover approximately 15% of overhead expenditures via external research partnerships. In South Africa, sale of auxiliary services, contracts and private gifts help fund the 15% of the institution budget which each institutions (rather than the state) is responsible for. a ohnstone 2009) 18 Table 5 Finance Allocation Mechanisms in Tertiary Education General Funding Funding Mechanism Mechanism Options Type of Target Funding Direct Instruction, Negotiated or Ad Hoc Line Item Institutional operations Budgets Block Grant Support and Categorical / Earmarked (Supply Side investment Funds Funding) components Funding Fonnulas Formulas based on: of institution Inputs (Staff, Students) Costs per student Priority Based Funding Perfonnance based fonnula Organization development Perfonnance-based Performance set asides Performance contracts Competitive funds Payment for results Research Joint funding (research and within instruction) institutions Project-based funding Matching Non-matching Block grants Institutional demonstrated capacity Centers of excellence .. *Mechanisms and options which more readily engage the pnvate sector provision or financing to a greater degree are in bold italics Source: Salmi and Hauptman (2006) 19 Table 5 (cont.)

These programs may allow for greater flexibility for students to choose which school most appropriately meets their needs. If students have the capacity to choose their institution, which is not always the case even at higher levels of education, then schools should respond to the demands of these students and teachers or risk obsolescence.7 In response to the increasing demand for tertiary education public and private institutions have imposed increased cost sharing.Gohnstone 2004; Johnstone 2009) Public institutions have increased (or adopted) tuition and additional fees or restricted the subsidies and stipends for living expenses. Of course, one of the key concerns associated with these fee increases is the degree to which the additional fmancial costs dissuade lower-income (or even middle-income) individuals from pursuing additional desired education-particularly under an environment of constrained credit availability in many African countries. The primary check to prevent educational sorting based on income or assets has been the adoption of student loans, grants or scholarships from both public and private sector organizations.(Salmi 2003) User fees and tuition increases have engaged the private sector financing both at an individual level (demanding greater fees from students/families) and corporate level (as public sector has encouraged banks to issue loans to individuals for tuition and fees by subsidizing or guaranteeing loans). To encourage entry by private banks (both in developing and developed countries), governments have subsidized or guaranteed loans to individuals in order to offset default risks-which has traditionally been quite high in cross-national studies of education fmance.(Mundial 1994; Chapman, Hanushek 2006; McPherson, Schapiro et al. 2006) This option focuses on increasing access to education by involving the private sector for fmance, but not necessarily encouraging private provision of education. Table 6 discusses how various tertiary education institutions (generally in the public sector) proceeded with imposition of user fees and cost\u00ad sharing in four African countries.Gohnstone 2009) 7 Some contend that the demand side strategies such as vouchers have not always promoted improved academic performance across the distributions of students. Some evidence suggests that the strongest effects are concentrated on top students and that parents do not always sort on the basis of school academic performance (Patrinos, 2009). 21 Table 6 Recent Cost Sharing Mechanisms for Tertiary Education in Africa Ethiopia In 2003, a cost sharing graduate tax required that student cover their full costs of food and lodging plus a minimum of 15 percent of the total instructional costs for their university program. All enrolled students have the option to contract with the government to plan their repayment schedule. Borrowers begin repayment after a one-year grace period (after higher education completion) and must complete repayment within 15 years. Students may also pay the calculated amount up-front at a 5 percent discount rate.(Yizengaw 2007) Ghana In 1997, the adoption of the 'Akosombo Accord' divided responsibility for university funding between the government (70 percent) and three sources (30 percent) including university internal revenue-generation, private donations and student tuition fees. Student academic and residential facility user fees were introduced 1998. Students who are living in university housing pay both, while students off campus pay the non-residential academic facility user fee and a small non-residential facility user fee. Kenya In theory cost sharing in tertiary institutions started in the early 1970s, but obligations were usually covered by grants from the Higher Education Loans Fund (HELP) until the 1990s when cost-sharing began in earnest due to declining state budget, increased intake of students and a high default rate (81% in 1987) on student loans.(Sanyal and Martin 1998) In 1995, the loan scheme was renamed the Higher Education Loan Board (HELB) and began using means testing to identify needy students, including those from \"disadvantaged regions\" (including Samburu, Turkana, West Pokot and other districts in Eastern and North Eastern provinces) and AIDS orphans. The interest rate is low (~4 percent per year) and loans cover 75% of annual higher education costs that must be borne by the student and family (and is limited to students in particular programs and in private universities). In 1995 maximum amount was KES. 42,000, but has increased toKES. 55,000 (US$ 733) in 2005/6 (with a minimum ofKES. 35,000). HELB pays KES 8,000 directly to the university towards the student's tuition costs. The remaining loan funds are paid directly to the student (for food and lodging costs and other living expenses). In addition to the loans, needy students in public institutions receive bursaries or additional grants via means testing, although these are capped at KES 8,000 (US$ 107).(Ngolovoi 2006) Other functions of the Loans Board include loan recovery, establishing a revolving fund, and seeking addltional funds from the private sector and donors(Otieno 2004). Uganda In 1992, the government report (Education Strategic Investment Plan-ESIP) recommended cost sharing, private sponsorship, evening and weekend programs, and entrepreneurship ventures to offset declining governmental funding.(Musini 2003) Currently, the basic approach segments students into three populations, high achievers who receive full scholarships to public university (with exception of some living expenses and books, approximately 6,000 students per annum). Merit-based scholarships for top performers (aside of the public university entrants) and students who pay for their education to private universities. Source: Hzgher Educatzon Fznance and Finance Project, Universiry if Buffalo (gse.buffalo.edu/ org/intHigherEdFinance/index.html) 22 An important precondition for effective engagement of the private sector is the inclusion of private institutions as valid organizations for voucher redemption, government scholarships or student loans. If voucher programs are too restrictive and institutions are not able to reimburse the vouchers with government payers than the incentive to participate in education markets is diminished among private organizations. Similarly, if education grants or scholarships are applicable only in public sector institutions (for example, when high achievers receive education solely in the public system) then the capacity of private institutions to compete for students is naturally limited. Many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa require that the students who qualify for maximum subsidies or grants on the basis of merit attend public programs.(J ohnstone 2009) Given the traditional strength of the public sector institutions, historic presence and uncertainty about quality of private schools (particularly if there is a regulatory vacuum with respect to public information), the expansion of vouchers, grants and loans will not necessarily motivate more entry or result in g-reater market share for private sector educational providers-but it is an important mechanism for demand-side finance which private institutions rely upon to justify entry. Extending the types of organizations that grants, vouchers and scholarship and student loans can be applied to is an important step in attracting private sector involvement in tertiary health education provision, but the future filllancial viability of these programs is also important. As indicated earlier, the default rates on student loans for tertiary education have typically been quite high (e.g. Kenya's default rate in the 1980s was 81 %).(Johnstone 2009) As a result the types of students that receive assistance have been increasingly restricted. Interestingly these limitations on demand side fmance may have some beneficial effects for private sector institutions. Those private sector institutions that compete on price with public sector (which now charge increasingly large fees) may become more attractive schooling options; \\Xlhile, on balance, limitations in fmancing for students reduce the viable market size, certain segments (particularly lower-cadre tertiary health schooling which is less expensive) could, in theory, see an increase in demand as government support dwindles, but the demand for some tertiary education remains (albeit at a lower quality or level of training). Reductions in finance from public sources for students may also represent an opportunity for private banks to participate in the fmancing of education, although they naturally will want to ensure that loans have a strong likelihood for repayment (perhaps via government guarantee). In the case of private fmance, the viability of financing mechanisms presumably depend on the expected earnings which the education confers (or family assets) and willingness to pay for the education. If individuals do not have access to credit or grants, then the ability to pay tuition or other costs (e.g. room and board) associated with education is restricted. The public sector may also wish to provide education for equity reasons as private sector finance may ftrst focus on the most lucrative (high income) market segments and, as a result, leave lower-income groups (which are often credit constrained as well) outside the educational system, particularly at higher levels.(Chapman, Hanushek et al. 2006)8 8 It should be noted, however, the numerous public-private partnerships which engage the private sector to provide management, operational, educational and facility services have frequently been implemented with specific contract targets to increase access to low-income or difficult to access (rural) groups. In many cases these programs have been quite successful in fulfilling these goals. (Patrinos et al., 2009) 23 7-Options and Evaluation There are five general options which countries may pursue to improve financing and involve the private sector in tertiary health education in Africa. These are: 1) Expand public finance with additional taxes or bond revenues (and use the marginal revenue to, in part, contract out to the private sector) 2) Augment public fmance with novel private sources of revenue 3) Rely on private sector institutions such as banks to direcdy fmance demand-side or supply-side educational funding 4) Rely on or partner with the private sector to both finance and/or provide education 7.1 -Expansion of Public Finance Resources In situations where the government wishes to retain a dominant role in fmancing care in order to ensure equity or guarantee subsidization of health education (either via public or private provision), novel mechanisms to expand the resources available for education are important to consider. Given that the capital financing and updating is frequendy a concern due to the expansion of student population and a liack of facility expansion or improvement-new mechanisms that can inject funding for maintenance and capital construction while existing funding covers recurrent costs (mainly teacher salaries) are an attractive option. In other areas of global health, notably vaccine purchasing, the use of bonds, guaranteed by future payments from international donors, has effectively enabled countries and regions to fund vaccine-purchases today which will have long run health benefits. The International Financing Facility for Immunization (IFFim) relies on future donations by developed countries to serve as the underlying asset for future bond coupon payments. Given the recognition in the international community that health systems, not just high priority diseases, are important to support in order to address health disparities and meet international objectives (MDGs), there may be the possibility that donors would fund a similar bond for the purposes of health education. However, alternatives sources to fmance the coupon payments are important to consider-particularly given the level of donor fatigue and the current fmancial crisis. One option discussed more broadly in development is the notion of \"diaspora bonds\" or bonds which are funded by contributions from emigrants.(lZetkar 2009) While naturally countries such as India and the Phillipines have a larger base of ex-country workers to fund the bond, in principal such a bond could be implemented by African countries as well. Given transaction costs it may be more viable to implement the bond on a regional basis (which may help subsidize fmancing costs of smaller countries). One of the key issues with this mechanism is the voluntary nature of the funding source. In principal \"mandated remittances\" from emigrants in developed countries with high earnings power via an additional tax (administered by the developed country) could ensure a higher level of funding\u00ad although governments may have to guarantee the level of funds in order to lock in a strong rating on the bond market. Preliminary analyses of a small (3%) additional income tax on physician and nurse emigrants during the first 10 years of (non-residency) medical service in developed countries suggest that the bond offering could raise $1-2 billion US at a Pan-African level given the extent of emigration by nurses and physicians (Clemens, 2008). This is just one potential mechanism for funding a bond issuance--a myriad of others are possible and may be more suitable depending on country characteristics and current financing for health education. New taxes levied within each country on either individuals and businesses (such as Nigeria's tax on profits of LLCs) are another potential option. However, these are administratively difficult to implement a.nd are likely to result in unfavorable economic distortions, 24 7.2-Augment Public Funding with Private Sources of Revenue As indicated earlier, several countries have tapped private funding sources as a means to support public provi~ion of education by renting facilities out to private institutions or conducting industry research in return for funding (or effectively taxing professors who receive private grants). Within the field of health the latter may be useful as industry relationships could increasingly offer opportunity for profitable research collaboration. Partners may include for-profit pharmaceutical firms or contract research organizations, not\u00ad for profit academic institutions in other countries and government institutions (such as US National Institutes for Health) which are increasingly active in developing therapies for \"developing country\" diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The expansion of funding for \"developing country\" diseases via the Global Fund, GAVI and other multinational organizations or foundations has motivated an increase in concomitant R&D activity. Recent policy such as the FDA priority review vouchers for approval of \"neglected disease\" approvals (US) and separate approval mechanisms for therapies aimed at developing country markets (EU) will motivate additional clinical work going forward.(Grabowski, others). Africa is still a relatively small segment of the overall pharmaceutical market, but the growth rate will be high. As several of these trials move into clinical phases which require patient populations, partnerships in developing country markets become increasingly valuable. Figure 6 and Figure 7 indicate that, currently, there are limited number of trials ongoing in Africa, and much of that occurs in the relatively developed infrastructure of South Africa. But the faculty capabilities with respect to medical research are improving across Africa and institutions such as the European and Developing Country Clinical Trial Partnership (EDCCTP) are increasing the potential for collaboration.(Matee et al.) Figure 6: Current Clinical Trial Sites By Continent, October 2009 ) Source : www.clinicaltrials.gov (October 2009) Figure 7: Current Clinical Trial Sites in Africa (October 2008) 25 Source: www.clinicaltrials.gov (October 2009) It is unlikely, however, that all health institutions would benefit from these relationships. The technical capacity requirements are high and most likely are available within medical schools with hospital linkages.(Santiago Rodriquez and Johnhatty) Nevertheless, motivating institutions to develop the capacity to house clinical research via challenge grants could potentially lead to a viable steam of additional income for schools in order to augment operational or capital expenses in the long run. 7.3-Additional Private Sector Finance for Demand Side or Supply Side Funding Several countries in Africa, as indicated earlier, rely on private banks to fund education via student loans. In principal, the scope of the private sector could expand (and perhaps include loans directly to educational institutions) but there are important considerations which affect the viability of these markets. These include: What is the likefy difault rate on loans? Is there a me!/hanism to assure pqyment on bad loans (Government assuram:e)? What segment rif the market will these loans !/over (low vs. high-cadre health workers, rural vs. urban, n:.rk level, type/ characteristic-s rif students) Is the bank ''at risk\" or simpfy a loan administrator? Are there regulatory restrictions such as repqyment S!/hedules or limits on repackaging/ securitization rif loans? As the government typically plays a dominant role in the financing of tertiary and health education, the \"residual\" market available to private sector may have very different risk features. For example, if governments heavily subsidize physicians in training then perhaps only the nurse or health worker market is a viable segment-and within that group the government may offer stipends or fmancing to high achievers (often the casein tertiary care). The resultant group has, perhaps a different capacity to pay back their loans and effectively are part of a different market. For example, health workers may only require limited fmance as the duration of education is shorter and the costs are lower, but so too is the income potential of 26 graduates. In order to prompt private entry into risky markets, governments have historically guaranteed loans (to an extent) which has the benefit of injecting private capital but the potential cost of moral hazard on the part of the bank if the terms of the guarantee are too generous. Private banks may also simply serve as an administrator ofloans, leaving f111ancial risk with the government, but leveraging banks ability to monitor and process payments in a manner that may exceed the government's capacity. Government policy also must balance the risk between the student and private banks so as to ensure reasonable repayment schedules and rates. Lastly, the ability of banks to package loans as securities may allow for greater investment in \"risky\" student populations, but given that future incomes in the health sector may be strongly correlated across health workers (perhaps due to the influence of government in reimbursement for the health system) bundling risk may not be viable. It is also not clear the extent to which banks in Africa package these types ofloans for resale (as organizations such as Fannie Mae does for real estate in the US). 7.4 -Private Sector Finance and Provision An alternative to simply engaging the private sector to offer finance for health workers is a \"bundled\" approach in which the government encourages private participation in fmance and/ or provision of educational services. Within this option, the government can either try to motivate the private sector to compete with public institutions directly or perhaps involve the private sector to focus on particular types of education, such as nurse or technician training, which have different entry requirements and, possibly, are less likely to warrant government subsidy. Lastly, the government may wish to involve private provision for particular functions (say capital development or management services) while retaining control of other core functions in a public private partnership. There are a myriad of forms which PPPs within tertiary education-many of which are all applicable to the health education context in Africa. As indicated in Table 7, the scope of services and responsibilities for private pa:tticipants can vary widely across inputs (human and physical capital), output (actual graduates) or processes (critical and auxiliary functions such as maintenance etc.). With respect to inputs, one of the key constraints currently burdening the system is the lack of physical capital infi:astructure for health education. These restrictions are likely more acute at institutions which have high physical capital and infrastructure requirements-namely medical schools. Table 8 summarizes some of the options for involving private development of new' infrastructure. Just as the viability of private finance likely differs for medical vs. nurse vs. other health worker institutions, the degree to which the private sector can and will provide these services (and the policy justification for their involvement) is variable. As the private sector becomes more involved in both fmance and operation of schools -the capacity of the state to manage risk and oversee contracts efficiently becomes more important. Interestingly, evidence from the primary and secondary education segment in developing countries suggests that the infrastructure projects which are turned over to state providers for operation in the future are somewhat difficult to manage effectively since the development risk (cost over runs in construction, ect.) require a large finance premium from government payers to offset the developer risk (particularly as the developer has no/limited ability to recoup any losses with operational revenue downstream).(Patrinos et al., 2009) 27 Table 7 Types of Contract in Education for Inputs, Outputs and Processes Level of General Type of Government Contracts Specific examples of what governments Production purchase Input Management, professional, support School management (financial services and human resources management) Support services (meals and transportation) Professional services (teacher training, curriculum design, textbook delivery, quality assurance, and supplemental services) Facility Availability Infrastructure and building maintenance Process Operational services The education of students, fmancial and human resources management, professional services, and building maintenance Output Education services (outputs) Student places in private schools (by contracting with schools to enroll specific students) Input and Facility availability and education services Infrastructure combined with Output services (operational and educational outputs) Source: Adapted from Patrmos et al.

A recent work on regulatory practices in developing country education cites the following eight tenants as central to enabling an efficient and well-performing private education sector (Fielden 2008). These include: 1) Provide a Sound Policy Framework for the Operation of the Private Education Sector 2) Introduce Clear, Objective, and Streamlined Criteria and Processes for Establishing and Regulating Private Education Institutions 3) Allow For-Profit Schools to Operate 4) Allow Private Schools to Set Their Own Tuition Fees 5) Provide Incentives and Support for Private Schools 6) Provide Parents and Students with Information to Help Them Select Quality Private Education 7) Establish Quality Assurance/Monitoring Processes 8) Develop the Capacity of Government to Implement Policy and Manage Private Providers These criteria underscore that regulation is a mechanism that can ensure quality via credentialing, an important benefit given the uncertainty about quality and asymmetric information that consumers (students) may have with respect to the quality of the education. Students and families sacrifice current time, income 29 and assets to purchase education-but with excessive uncertainty are less likely to do so. Ofcomse, extreme bureaucratic barriers increase the cost of entry and limit competition across institutions to provide good quality relative to price. The private sector may operate in a limited way, even in countries with strong preferences for delivery via public institutions, and there are clearly numerous unregistered or non-licensed tertiary education institutions which have emerged to meet perceived market demand. But these :;chools, usually small in size with limitations in faculty quality, are less likely to operate efficiently in a regulatory vacuum. In order to construct appropriate regulation for a particular country context, policy makers should identify the degree to which they wish to promote the private sector (Figure 3), the types of functions or markets that the private sector will participate in and the nature of the interaction with public sector entities (competitors vs. partners). This determination depends on the goals that the state has with respect to quality and number of health workers produced. 7.4.1.b- Market Criteria The decision to enter markets and market competitiveness for health educational provision depends on the relative current and future costs and revenues associatedwith entry. These may differ quite dramaticallY' across market segments in health education (as suggested in Table 9). Table 9 Relative Input Costs and Output Revenue Potential across Health Education Institutions Institution Type Physical Capital Human Resource Graduate Earnings Requirements I Requirements I Costs Faculty Costs Medical School (MDs) High High High Nursing School High / Medium High / Medium Medium Medical Technician School High / Medium Medium Medium Community Health Worker Medium /Low Medium Medium /Low 7 .4.1.c -Health Education Type and Market Entry The costs of entry into the medical school market are naturally much higher due to human resource and capital requirements (along with the need for heavy regulation and credentialing in the market). The capacity of individuals (or the state) to support these institutions hinges, in part, on the future income of graduates and/ or the willingness of government to subsidize education (in private sector as well) in return for the future social benefits of physician care. While physician incomes are high and private medical schools do exist, it is unlikely that entry for stand alone schools will occur to a large extent if state-run institutions have already captured the best students (and subsidize their tuition more generously) and the finite high-quality faculty are already employed in public institutions. What is more likely to improve quality and outcomes are private financing initiatives which outsource components of education (perhaps even management) to independent for-profit or not-for-profit entities. Nursing schools may vary in regard to quality and type of nurse production and, as such, differ with respect to input requirements and costs. The reduced revenue potential due to lower nurse salaries (relative to physicians), however, may be offset by the larger number of graduates that schools can produce per faculty member or capital overhead. Regulatory hurdles may also be less stringent and the requirements for faculty, at least for some courses, may be reduced relative to the case with medicine. Although tuition and graduate revenues are lower in lower-cadre institutions, the input costs may be significantly lower (with the exception 30 of capital equipment that medical technicians may use in training) and the duration of study is a fraction of higher-level health workers. 8-Summary This paper used existing literature to examine the extent of public and private flnatice and provision in tertiary education (generally and in health) and identifled key options and issues that both public and private education providers and flnancial institutions will face as the health education markets evolve in Sub-Saharan Africa as these markets attempt to meet the increased demand for education and requirements of health systems. Key insights include: 1) There is a theoretical and practical justification for the role of both public and private finance and provision of education. In most of Sub-Saharan Africa the public good aspects of health education supported state-based financing and provision of health education. The recent shift toward implementing user fees has shifted the balance in select cases, but few countries have a clear and deliberate policy and related fmancing arrangements to maximize production of health workers by strategically taking advantage of both public and private sector possibilities. 2) There is substantial private benefit for students to be trained as health workers (incomes are good, if not high, for all cadres relative to alternatives). The subsidy to health-related training need not be 100 percent and might be a much lower percent of total cost to account for the social benefit that exceeds the private benefit. Government policies and practices that hinder or obstruct private provision of training (such as subsidizing the best students, subsidizing the costs of government sdwols) do not have to be taken as immutable and could be changed to: (A) save on scarce government resources and (B) alleviate constraints on private provision. 3) An enabled regulatory environment (for both private finance and provision models) which addresses school quality and promotes entry / competition are central to a robust private sector. As stressed in the related market study on provision, Privately provided training looks to be more dynamic, flexible, and innovative than publicly provided training, but the former must be regulated to ensure quality. 4) Capital costs and recurrent expenditures differ significantly across different cadres in the health sector. The role that the private sector should ideally play (in both fmance and provision) should account for differences in educational costs relative to the public or private benefits conferred by the education. 5) Examination of public-private partnerships in health education is warranted. Health is a traditionally highly regulated sector, so naturally there tends to be a bias toward public provision in health education. The extent of variation with respect to how public sector and private sector providers and fmancial institutions can interact (both competitive and collaborative models) and the speciflc functions/markets should be explored in more detail. How do lessons from primary, secondary or non-health tertiary public-private partnerships inform how to develop these organizational forms in the tertiary health sector? 31 6) Both public and private financial resources can be expanded by exploring alternative sources of finance. Industry research collaborations, microcredit models and hospital affiliations are examples of potential means to extend the budgets of educational institutions. 7) The demand side (students) and supply-side (tertiary health-sector educational institutions) are both viable targets for novel finance models. These and other issues are important to examine in the detailed country level interviews with health and education ministries in Sub-Saharan Africa as the Health in Africa initiative progresses to the institution-level and market-level analytical work. 32 Bibliography Ajayi, T. and R.

Africa, with a population of about 1 ,033 million, has only 133 operating medical schools. continent Africa is noteworthy that medical education is not contemplated as a priority in the WHO global health agenda defined in the 11th General Programme of Work 2006-2015 and in the strategic orientation for WHO Action in the African Region for the period 2005-2009. The WHO Medium-Term Strategic Plan defines the strategic direction of the Organization for the period 2008-2013 and its objectives (out of a total of 13 objectives) that can be, by inference, associated to medical education are: improve health services through better governance, financing, staffing and management, informed by reliable and accessible evidence and research; provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda as set out in the Eleventh General Programme of Work; Nonetheless, WHO promises that along with its partners will \"contribute to responding to global difficulties related to health workforce. It will address specifically the need for adequate financing for health workers, expanding 1 http://www .xist. org/ earth/pop_ continent.aspx 2 capacities of education and training institutions, and strengthening advocacy at global and country levels to sustain effective development of the workforce.\"2 For a indicators of technical support provided by WHO to member countries facing severe health-workforce difficulties, see Appendix D, Table 2. The main objective of this study is to focus specifically on the conditions of equity in medical education in Africa. This study will examine the data, both qualitative and quantitative, as well as the literature available regarding medical education across Africa, to develop a picture of the state of the vertical equity issues in medical education, with regard to admission, persistence, and completion of medical education. It will also examine the horizontal elements of equity in medical education, including who attends which institutions and academic programs and the employment outcomes. The goal of this work will be to expose the current state of affairs regarding access and equity in both medical education and, by extension, the medical profession in Africa. In the end, this work should play a key role in informing policy makers about the areas that are most in need of examination and reform regarding medical school in Africa. In this work, I have attempted to capture cases with a focus on the following dimensions: Analysis of the scope of disparities in medical education (access and completion) along the dimensions of socio-economic groups, gender, regions, and ethnic groups and the evolution of these issues over time. Identification of the main determinants of these disparities (pre-tertiary, monetary barriers, non-monetary obstacles), including policies that may have cemented inequity into place What equity promotion policies have the government and individual institutions followed? What have been their main characteristics and how they relate to the main determinants of disparities? What has . worked well and what has worked less well? Have there been trade\u00ad offs equity I quality? 2 http://www.afro. who.int/en/tanzania/tanzania-publications/doc_ download/1921-mtsp-2008-20 13-strategic-objectives. html 3 DISPARITIES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION: ~ Chapter 1 ACCESS AND COMPLETION This section will provide an analysis of the scope of disparities in medical education pertaining to access and completion along the following \u00b7 dimensions: 1. Socio-economic groups 2. Gender 3. Regions, and 4. Ethnic groups We will also provide an evolution of these issues over time. 4 1. Socio-Economic Groups Mozambique: Low income leads to combining public sector practice with private medical work This paper describes the socio-economic profile of medical students in the 1998/99 academic year at the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) Medical Faculty in Maputo. It aims to identify their social and geographical origins in addition to their expectations and difficulties regarding their education and professional future. The data were collected through a questionnaire administered to all medical students at the faculty. Although most medical students were from outside Maputo City and Maputo Province, expectations of getting into medical school were already associated with a migration from the periphery to the capital city, even before entering medical education. This lays the basis for the concentration of physicians in the capital city once their term of compulsory rural employment as junior doctors is completed. The decision to become a doctor was taken at an early age. Close relatives, or family friends seem to have been an especially important variable in encouraging, reinforcing and promoting the desire to be a doctor. The academic performance of medical students was dismal. This seems to be related to several difficulties such as lack of library facilities, inadequate financial supporl, as well as poor high school preparation. Only one fifth of the students reported receiving financial support from the Mozambican government to subsidize their medical studies. Medical students seem to know that they will be needed in the public sector, and that this represents an opportunity to contribute to the public's welfare. Nevertheless, their expectations are, already as medical students, to combine their public sector practice with private medical work in order to improve their earnings. Sousa, F. Jr., Schwalbach, J., Adam,Y., Goncalves, L., & Ferrinho, P. (April 2007). The training and expectations of medical students in Mozambique. Human Resources for Health, 5>,11. South Africa: As previously disadvantaged group, black learners leg behind in enrolling in higher education immediately after completing high school. This has implications to first-year medical school enrolments of black students coming directly from high school, given their general history of disadvantage in accessing medical school. While South Africa is well into its second decade of democracy, higher education opportunities in the country remain different for different race groups. Black African learners are not represented in the first-year higher education enrolment profile (the intake of learners who proceed to higher education directly from school) in relation either to their representation in the general population or to their aspirations for entry into higher education... The key conclusion drawn from the juxtaposition of these two studies is that discrimination, while not overt, remains entrenched in South African educational pathways by virtue of the differential opportunities available to learners of different races, opportunities that are a function largely of socio-economic status (SES) and of the differential horizons for action which SES opens up for learners. Cosser, M. (2009) Race and opportunity in the transition from school to higher education in South Africa. Journal of Higher Education in Africa. 7(1&2):235w263. Socio-economic disparities are also manifest in the segregation of the healthcare system. While the example herein is that of South Africa, the reality resonates with most African countries. For instance, I can attest to the fact that in Mozambique, after liberalization of the economy a new high-cost branch was 5 opened adjacent to the central hospital (Hospital Central de Maputo). Patients who had the economic means to pay for the service provided in the neighboring wing of the hospital-purposely designated \"Ciinica Especial (Special Clinic)\"-enjoyed a first-class medical care than did the general popul1ation. Many of the goals of South Africa' new democracy depend on the production of professionals who have not only the knowledge and skills to make our country globally competitive, but also a commitment to working and living here. Despite numerous reforms, the South African health system, ten years into democracy, remains divided: first world private care that ranks with middle income countries internationally at the one end, and at the other extreme, in the rural public sector in particular, conditions that are superior only to the poorest of African countries. Much work has been done to change medical school curricula in line with the primary health-care focus of government policy, and international trends towards problem-based learning.

Gender Africa (general): Gender equity in medical education in Africa is still lacking. In South Africa, despite increase in enrollments of women in medical school, women are still the minority in the medical profession. This is a reflection that the profession is still male dominated. While women are increasingly accessing employment areas in traditionally male-dominated fields, equity in participation is still a barrier to be crossed. In my experience, when studying women's participation in computer science in the United States, I have learned that a traditionally male-dominated field is replete with visible and invisible barriers for women's participation. Such barriers manifest, among other ways, in the language used (which is directly or indirectly discriminatory towards women), the environment created (which is not conducive for women to excel), and the fact that women have to fight several misperceptions carried on by their professors and colleagues. The paper examines discrimination against women in the medical profession in the South African context. To measure the extent of the problem data was obtained from the records of one of the largest South African medical schools-the University of the Witwatersrand Medical School. This medical school is one of the most liberal in South Africa and does not discriminate against women in its admission policies and the number of women graduated as doctors has increased steadily. Despite this, women take a secondary place in the South African medical profession. Evidence for this was collected from official records and supplemented with guided interviews with 15 women doctors. Special attention is given to the serious under-representation of Black women doctors in South Africa. Unterbalter, B. (2001). Discrimination against women in the South African medical profession. Social Science & Medicine, 20, 12, 1253-1258. The student profile in medical schools is now not only more representative of the demographics of South Africa, but also reveals a significant increase in female students. Whether these students will stay in the country after graduating, and serve where they are needed most, remains to be seen. Breier, M. & Wildschut, A. (2006) Doctors in a divided society: the profession and education of medical practitioners in South Africa. Cape Town: HSRC Press. In South Africa, in the prestigious profession of medicine, women are still in the minority. Men continue to form nearly three quarters of the number of registered practitioners, although social \u00b7and institutional exclusionary structures have been abolished. It is important to investigate the reasons underlying this state of affairs, which exists despite equality in access to educational opportunities, training and advancement in the profession, and the drastically increased number of female medical student enrolments and graduations during the last decade. What is importantly emerging as a new area for research, especially in the South African case where such studies are lacking, is an investigation into the factors specifically influencing women doctors' participation and experiences during education and in the profession, in an effort to more comprehensively explain current gender trends. Wildschut, A.C. (2008) Motivating for a gendered analysis of trends within South African medical schools and the profession. South African Journal of Higher Education. 22(4):920\u00b7 932. 7 Women are increasingly accessing employment areas even in traditionally male-dominated fields like medicine, but they struggle to participate to the same extent as their male counterparts, constraining their potential for advancement. As an example of the constraints women \u00b7face within formal employment, there is clear evidence of gender differences in specialisation, when the literature on gender in the professions is examined. The traditiional view is that this is an expected outcome, based on gender preferences resulting from socialisation. I support the more recent assertions that it be seen as a structural constraint, often experienced when a profession is increasingly feminised, due to mechanisms such as; gender stereotyping, gender discrimination, internal segregation and exclusion. Wildschut, A. (2008) Engendering gender equality in professional employment: can policy rise to the occasion?. Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity. 78:93\u00b7104. Efforts toward, and the intricacies of, gender equity can be seen in the number of enrolments of women and their participation in medical education. Breier and Wildschut (2006) show how higher enrolments do not presuppose equity of participation in that there is a high number of women attending medical school, yet their participation has not yet reached satisfactory levels. Breier, M. & Wildschut, A. (2006) The feminisation of medical schools in South Africa. HSRC review. 4(4): 1 0\u00b712. In Figure 1 Brier and Wildschut (2006) provide further evidence that despite the fact that women outnumber males in medical schools and their enrolment numbers continue to increase; males not only continue to dominate the profession, but they also dominate specialization within the pmfession. Women medical students began to outnumber men in 2000 when they formed 51% of MBChB enrolments. By 2003 they had increased to nearly 55% and formed even greater proportions at some medical schools .... Only Medunsa (the Medical University of Southern Africa, now part of the University of Limpopo) had a smaller proportion of women than men (44%). At the other end of the spectrum, the University of Cape Town (UCT) had 63% women students ... The enrolments are not yet representative of the country as a whole, which, according to the 2001 Census, is roughly 79% African, 9% coloured, 2% Indian and 10% white ... But the figures need to be seen in relation to the numbers of matriculants who achieve the grades necessary to enter a medical school. For example, Department of Education (DoE) figures show that in 2003 only 19% of matriculants achieved Senior Certificate with endorsement (the basic requirement for entry to university) and only 10% passed physical science on the higher grade and 6% mathematics on the higher grade-both requirements for entry to a medical school ... Although the DoE no longer disaggregates its figures by race, given the legacy of apartheid education, it can be presumed that a high proportion of the successful students would have been white or Indian ... Whether the high numbers of female undergraduate medical students will translate into gender equity in postgraduate enrolments and in the profession remains to be seen. The numbers of doctors registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa rose 11% overall in the period 2002 to 2006. Male registrations increased by 6%, but females rose by 24%. The proportions of men are still high but dropping (70% in 2006 compared with 73% in 2002). Again, it is not possible to discern racial trends. An HSRC case study of the UCT medical school found that proportions of women students were far lower at postgraduate level than at undergraduate level, but their numbers were increasing 8 quite rapidly thanks to a concerted transformation programme. In 1999 women formed 28% of the total MMed enrolments ... There are some specialisations where women are in the majority. The most striking example is public health in 2004 and 2005. Here, women formed between 80% and 93% of the total enrolments respectively. Psychiatry is another discipline where women were in the majority in every one of the seven years analysed (51% to 68%), with the exception of 2000, when they formed only 47% of the total enrolments ... Low numbers of female surgical students are an international phenomenon and UCT is no exception. Women formed no more than 11% of enrolments in any of the seven years which we reviewed at that university, and some surgical disciplines had no women students at all ... Thereafter, total enrolments in these disciplines ranged from 88 to 93 students a year and numbers of females ranged from two to five. The trend at UCT has been confirmed at national level by the Association of Surgeons in South Africa (ASSA), which found that across the country female doctors amounted to only one-tenth of the number of male doctors specialising in general surgery and has reportedly attributed this to the 'chauvinistic image' of the profession.

Regions To investigate the career choices of medical graduates of rural origin in the South African context, and to determine what proportion of rural-origin graduates are currently practising in a rural area. This is a retrospective descriptive study. Doctors' addresses at the time of graduation were compared with their current addresses in terms of rural/urban classification, and a questionnaire survey was done. Sample A consisted of a cohort of doctors who graduated in 1991 and 1992. Sample B consisted of the 1994-1996 graduates of two medical schools. In sample A 14.4% were rural-origin students. When comparing addresses, it was found that 38.4% of rural-origin graduates are currently practising in rural areas, compared with 12.4% of urban-origin graduates (p < 0.001 ). The questionnaire data showed that 45.9% o the rural-origin respondents are in rural practice, compared with 13.3% of the urban-ori!Jin respondents (p 0.001). In sample B, 41.61% of the rural-origin graduates are in rural practice compared with 5.08% of urban-origin graduates (p < 0.001 ). The findings suggest that the South African situation is similar to that i other countries, with rural-origin medical students more likely to choose rural careers than urban-origin students. Rural-origin graduates are also more likely to choose general practice. It is recommended that tl selection criteria of the medical faculties be reviewed with regard to rural origin, and that the career aspirations of applicants to medical school be taken into account in selection, particularly with regard to primary care or general practice. De Vries, E & Reid, S .. \u00b7\u00b7(October 2003). Do South African medical students of rural origin return to ru practice? South African Medical Journal, 93(10):789-93. Migration of medical doctors has both internal and external dimensions. Doctors are trained in public\u00ad service hospitals and serve one year's community service in rural or in hospitable locations after qualifyin! but few remain there. Most migrate to private sector and many others leave the country. Here the rural public is dependent on foreign doctors. It is against this background that the profession of the medical practitioner in South Africa should be viewed. Do we have enough doctors? Where are they needed most and where are they working? What is the extent of emigration? What is the government doing to help and what more can be done? \u00b7 Breier, M. (2009) Doctors. In: Erasmus, J. & M. {eds); Skills shorlages in Africa: case stud, of key professions. Cape Town: HSRC Press. 113-131. The three prestigious medical schools (Addis Ababa, Gondar, Jimma) were established in 1964, 1978 an 1984, respectively. Since establishment till2006, about 3728 medical doctors were graduated with MD degree from the three medical schools. Addis Ababa university medical faculty alone graduated 1890 general practitioners (1964-2006) and 862 clinical specialists (1979-2006). In the 23 years period (1984- 2006), the highest and lowest physician to population ratios in the public sector were found to be in 1989 (1:28,000) and 2006 (1:118,000), respectively. In 2006, the physician to population ratio in Amhara, Ororr and SNNPR regional states was computed to be 1:280,000, 1:220,000, and 1:230,000, respectively. The physician deficit analysis in the last 23 years in relation to the WHO standard for developing countries (1 :10,000) revealed the lowest record at the national and regional states in the last 12-years. Average physician to hospital ratio in five regional states in December 2006 was 3.6 (Tigray), 4.3 (Amhara), 6.1 (Oromia) and 5.3 (SNNPR). As the December 2006 direct interview with 76 public hospitals outside Addi! 10 Ababa showed, there was no specialist in 36 hospitals and no doctor at all in 3 hospitals. Seven public hospitals located in big regional states' town took the lions share of medical doctors. In short, in December 2006, 80.3% of regional hospitals were equipped with 0-2 specialists of one kind, and in 48.7% there were 0-3 General practitioners. Highest medical doctors annual attrition rates (20%-54.3%) were found in 1991- 1992, 1998, 2002-2006... The number of postgraduate programme in Addis Ababa, Jimma and Gondar medical schools in December 2006 was 22, 12 and 3, respectively. The total number of fully employed academic staff of the medical schools in declining order was Addis Ababa 181, Gondar 118, Jimma 71, Hawassa 63 and Mekele 52: those second and above being 97.2%, 35.6%, 90.1%, 55.6% and 15.4%, respectively. Currently (2006), there are about416 clinical residents in 3 medical schools. High annual attrition rate, fast population growth, governmental and nongovernmental health institution expansion, low production and increased postgraduate enrollment in the last 3-4 years contributed for extremely low physician-to-population ratio in Ethiopia. Although the Ethiopian government and private sector worked and achieved much on health infrastructure construction and mid level health professionals training, it does not appear that medical doctors retention mechanisms are sorted out so far. As a result, even despite salary equivalent top up payments in some regions, more than 80% of public hospitals outside Addis Ababa were found ill-equipped with the most important human element--physicians. This implies that the push factors may not invariably correlate with remuneration. Berhan, Y. (January 2008). Medical doctors profile in Ethiopia: production, attrition and retention. In memory of 1 00-years Ethiopian modern medicine & the new Ethiopian millennium. Ethiopian Medical Journal, 46(1), 1-77. Tunde Fatunde reported in University World News that Nigerian medical schools are in crisis.3 According to Fatuncle, medical academics in Nigeria have expressed concern about falling standards in doctor training. They have complained about ineffective admission policies, inadequate facilities, low remuneration and the brain drain, among other ills -and recommended actions to tackle problems at the country's 33 medical schools and produce quality medical graduates ... Ben Ukwuoma, science correspondent of the Nigerian tabloid The Guardian, conducted a detailed investigation into medical school admission policies. The results were alarming. For example, the annual intake of students into the College of Medicine at the University of lbadan roseto about 600 at one stage, while the intake into the College of Medicine at the University of Lagos was said to have hit 700. Ukwuoma found the same trend at medical schools in llorin, lfe, Benin, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Shagamu and Zaria. Fatunde further reveals that, One consequence of poorly implemented admissions policy is over-crowding in student hostels, which degenerate into high-density slums. A new dimension to selection, particularly in private and state-owned universities, has been the ability of some medical students to secure a place thanks to substantial financial contributions made by wealthy parents. To address admission problems, the MDCN has 3 NIGERIA: Medical schools in crisis by Issue: 0037. Available: http://www. universityworldnews.corn!article.php ?story=200909112325 04 3 8 11 created a student indexing system to improve transparency. Medical schools am now expected to stick to their admission quotas and send lists of students to the MDCN, said Registrar Abdulmumuni Ibrahim. \"We open files for the students, and follow and monitor them to their final stage.\" Two graphic illustrations of decay in medical training are inadequate numbers of cadavers and lack of patients in teaching hospitals. Professor Oladapo Ashiru, a former head of anatomy at the University of Lagos College of Medicine, pointed out that in one medical school in southern Nigeria, 40 students are assigned to one cadaver. \"In our days as medical students, there were eight students to a cadaver; four students on each side. The student population was 80 to 100 students,\" he said. Patients in teaching hospitals used not to be charged fees, so as to attract adequate numbers of patients. This is no longer the case. As government subsidies to teaching hospitals have dwindled, patients have been made to pay and thei~ number has dropped. This has affected the quality of teaching because only wealthy people with uncomplicated diseases show up. Further, graduating students are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable places for compulsory internship. Professor Akin Oshibogun, Chief Medical Director at the Lagos University teaching hospital, has suggested that one solution to this problem would be for each state government to improve facilities in at least two general hospitals and employ some specialist consultants so that the facilities could be accredited for internship. A major problem at medical schools is lack of adequate infrastructure and the inability to replace obsolete equipment. According to recent statistics released by the Federal Ministry of Health, Nigerians annually spend about US$207 million on medical treatment abroad. If this huge amount of foreign exchange was ploughed into medi.cal infrastructure, deficiencies in medical schools could be corrected, critics have argued. To tackle the problem, 14 teaching hospitals are being renovated and rehabilitated with state-of-the-art equipment by the Australian company VAMED. This project will be completed in November and, said Federal Minister of Health Professor Babatunde Osotimehin, should instil confidence among Nigerians in the country's health facilities \"and thus reduce the number of wealthy Nigerians seeking medical attention abroad\". 12 \\4. Ethnic Groups 13 Main Determinants of Disparities in Medical Education ~ Chapter 2 This section identifies the main determinants of disparities in medical education found in the following factors: 1 . Pre-Tertiary 2. Monetary barriers 3. Non-monetary obstacles 4. Policies 14 11. Pre-Tertiary This paper investigates the relationship between Grade 12 learner preferences for study in higher education, student enrolment in higher education programmes, and student graduations in different programme areas, considering the match between these supply-' side indicators and a forecast of skills demand in South Africa as a first step towards ascertaining the extent to which the higher education system is meeting the demand for skills in the labour market. While learner preferences are predominantly for study in the field of Science, Engineering and Technology (SET), student graduations are predominantly in the Humanities. And since a large proportion of scarce-skills areas are SET-related, this creates a mismatch that has implications for the economic development of the country. Simultaneously, however, the demand for educators (school teachers and academics) is even greater: the strongest discrete demand is for educators, followed by . that for managers. The paper concludes by urging more concerted development of teachers and managers. Michael Gosser (January 201 0). The skills cline: higher education and the supply-demand coniplex irl.South Africa. Higher Education, 59, 1. Racial redress in pre-tertiary education Racial redress comprises notions of achieving economic, political and educational equality through changing the relative balance of privilege between black and white. These case studies of working class schools in former all white, Indian, coloured and African communities in urban Gauteng show that there has been signifi cant redress when interpreted as equality of opportunity and increased access by African learners to schools previously closed to them. But racial redress has not translated into economic redress. The schools on the whole do what they did before: prepare their students for the working class and unemployment. .. In this context, does it make sense to continue to use the formulations of 'formerly white, Indian and coloured schools'? These commonly-used, euphemistic descriptions suggest richer and better schools, but the terminology obscures the presence of poor African students in these schools and the fact that many of these schools have changed and are not what they were ... This raises questions about fixing racial identities to schools when privileged populations or people either no longer attend them, or do so in very limited numbers. It asks: is this redress? And whose interests does it serve to continue to refer to them in these terms? Chisholm, Linda (2008). The migrating meaning of race and redress in education in South Africa, 1994-2006.

Monetary Barriers There are currently 29655 medical practitioners employed in South Africa at a rate of 6!> physicians per 1 00 000 of the population. Approximately 60 per cent of physicians are employed in the private \u00b7 . health sector at a ratio of 255:100 000. The remainder work in the public health sector where they provide medical care to 84 per cent of the population at ratio of 29:100 000. Shortages are created by the misdistribution of skills across sectors and provinces, and are aggravated by the outflow of skills from South Africa to other countries .. Supply is restricted by limited resources, the limited availability of black candidates for higher education, high failure rates and poor working conditions and remuneration in the public health sector. The number of nurses in employment is estimated at 155 484, at a nurse/population ratio of 343:100 000, which compares favourably with the World Health Organisation's minimum norm of 200:100 000. The nurse/population ratio is expected to drop to 305:100 000 over the nest ten years with a total of 18 758 positions remaining unfilled. Hall, E. & Erasmus, J.

Data on higher education trends in South Africa indicate that 50% of students enroiiHd in higher education institutions drop out in their first three years with about 305 dropping out in their first year. This is despite the fact that some of these students will have passed their senior certificate with endorsement, merit or distinction. Many students also come from poverty-stricken families and are indebted to the National Student financial Aid Scheme, and other education funding agencies which support their studies. The drop out phenomenon does therefore not bode well for efforts to break the vicious cycle of poverty and is the major cause of the unacceptable low throughput rates in the higher education system. This chapter draws on the HSRC's Student Pathways Study (2005), which examined student dropout in South Africa's Higher education system, focusing on seven of the Higher Education institutions in particular. . .

The shortage of qualified health professionals is a major obstacle to achieving better health outcomes in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa. The role of health science universities in addressing this shortage is to provide quality education and continuing professional development opportunities for the healthcare workforce. Academic institutions in Africa, however, are also short of faculty and especially under\u00b7resourced. We describe the initial phase of an institutional partnership between the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) centred on promoting medical education at MUHAS. The challenges facing the development of the partnership include the need: ( 1) for new funding mechanisms to provide long-term support for institutional partnerships, and (2) for institutional change at UCSF and MUHAS to recognize and support faculty activities that are important to the partnership. The growing interest in global health worldwide offers opportunities to explore new academic partnerships. It is important that their development and implementation be documented and evaluated as well as for lessons to be shared. 16 Tache, S., Kaaya, E., Omer, S., Mkony, C.

Non-Monetary Obstacles Although neurology originated in Africa, there is little modern African contribution to the advancement of knowledge in this field. We present the African neurologic service and scientific productivi~y indices and suggest a development plan. We conducted PubMed and EMBASE searches for articles about neurologic services in Africa. To assess scientific productivity, we determined the number of publications of African origin in journals with high impact. The neurologist-population ratio in African countries varies from 1 per 162 885 persons to none in 11 countries, compared with 1 per 2~ 200 persons in the United States. There are few African publications in high-impact international journals of neurology. Africa faces a heavy burden of communicable diseases and increasing noncommunicable diseases, with few workers, poor equipment, and little research effort to bear it. There is a need for African neuroscientists to discover areas of research unique to the continent in order to advance the frontiers of knowledge for all neurologists. International collaboration and support are required to improve the number of workers, resources, and research productivity. Owolabi, M. 0., Bower, J. H., Ogunniyi, A. (2007). Mapping Africa's Way Into Prominence in the Field of Neurology. Archives of Neurology, 64( 12): 1696-1700. This article presents a model that has the potential to frame research and analysis across a range ofdifferent professional contexts. Professions and their professional education programmes are seen in relation to national and international professional labour markets and the multipile socio\u00ad economic, political and discursive conditions that constitute professional milieu. Viewed in this way the profession and education of medical practitioners poses a number of challenges that also have relevance for other professions. There have been concerted efforts by medical schools to change the demographics of their student populations and to introduce community -and problem-based curricula. However, the question remains: are they producing doctors which South Africa so desperately needs, doctors who have the competence to work anywhere in the world but the conscience to remain in this country and serve where needed most, which could be in the public or rural service? Breier, M. (2006} A model for the analysis of professions and professional education applied to medical doctors in South Africa. Perspectives in education. 24(3):25-35. This study aimed at ascertaining the status of students' performances and their perception of the learning of neurophysiology in a Nigerian medical school. The goal of the study was to determine ways of addressing identified negative perceptions for the purpose of improving upon the overall learning and use neurophysiology knowledge by structured curricular reform. We analyzed and compared the performances of students in three areas of physiology at the second professional examinations over a three-year period [n=300]. We also surveyed learning experience of a batch of graduating doctors in neurosciences [n=50] and surveyed the staff and students' perception of the teaching of neurophysiology. The students' performances in neurophysiology were comparatively poorer than in cardiovascular and endocrinology aspects of the subject over a three year period at 18 the second professional examinations. The reported students' perception of their neurophysiology !earning included uninteresting, abstract concepts, lack of real examples and conflicting facts with their prior basic knowledge. Over 50 % of the graduands (sic) rated their learning experiences as poor or very poor or below average for the neuroscience courses. The analyses of the curricular contents of neurophysiology in the preclinical departments indicted asynchrony and redundancy in topics that may reduce the learning and reduce teaching time efficiency of the neuroscience courses. It is suggested that learning experiences of medical students should be routinely monitored and structured to ensure that the graduate doctor is able to understand and transfer learned experiences into clinical studies and practice. A horizontally integrated curriculum may be one way of raising students' knowledge, attitude and skills in neuroscience courses as taught in the preclinical departments and is suggested.

(2009). \u00b7Students performance and perception of neurophysiology: feedback for innovative curricular reform in a Nigerian medical schooL Nigerian Journal of Physiological Sciences, 24(1), 63-66. Students adopt several learning approaches towards achieving the perceived goal of passing their prescribed examinations. This study was carried out to determine the study processes being used by medical students of the College of Medicine, University of lbadan on arrival at the Faculty of Clinical Sciences. One hundred and sixty five first year clinical students were studied using the modified 'Biggs' Study Process Questionnaire. Additional questions to identify local factors that would contribute to the learning were also included. There were 143 respondents (87% of the study population). The predominant study pattern among the students was the deep approach (63%). The achieving and superficial approaches were used by 8% and 29% o~ the students respectively. Additional analysis showed that 68%, 31% and 1% had 'good', 'average' and poor learning capacities respectively. Self interest was the principal reason why the students chose medicine as a career. Most students (76%) preferred lectures to tutorials, and only 30% found out extra information about topics taught frequently. Thirty-nine percent of the study cohort saw their teachers as role models, and 76% intended to travel abroad after graduation. Majority of 1st year clinical students of the College of Medicine, University of lbadan adopted a deep approach to learning and have a good capacity to learn. However, most do not employ self-directed learning strategies and do not see their teachers as role models. The majority intend to travel abroad upon graduation. Olapade-Oiaopa, E. 0., Otegbayo, J.

African Journal. of Medicine and Medical Sciences, 35(4}:431-5. Malawi has a critical human resources problem particularly in the health sector. There is a severe shortage of doctors; there are only few medical specialists. The College of Medicine (COM) is the only medical school and was founded in 1991. For senior staff it heavily depends on expatriates. In 2004 the COM started its own postgraduate training programme (Master of Medicine) in the clinical specialties ... Since the start of the COM 254 students have graduated with an average of 17 students per year. The College of Medicine in the Republic of Malawi: towards sustainable staff development. 19 This article discusses progress in medicallibrarianship in Africa since the 1960s. Considerable research has emerged, medical education has developed, and guidelines for medical libraries are being created. Several associations of medical librarians exist. Bibliographic control remains a serious problem. An adequate information base is needed, and international cooperation must be pursued within Africa to permit unification of education resources. Steps must be taken to enhance governmental awareness of meclical library needs. It is suggested that appropriate professional organizations prepare goal statements and define standards; those organizations could also centralize research efforts that require funding from non-African sources. The thrust of the paper is to emphasize the work that can be done by Africans themselves before they seek external assistance. Obaka, D. N. (Fall1991). The Challenge of Medical Librarianship in Africa. World Libraries, 2(1). Obaka argues that Africans are making significant advances (e.g., began efforts toward the creation of guidelines for medical libraries, establish several associations of medical librarians, African library schools are being importuned to structure programs for the education of medical librarians, progress in !the establishment of a fully implemented medical library profession is continuing), but wonders whether the \"pace of progress can match the burgeoning challenges.\" Obaka identifies the following challenges: Control of biomedical literature, which is growing exponentially. To maintain an adequate information base about medical education and medicallibrarianship in Africa. At present it is not possible to identify programs and personnel, or to determine what patterns exist in these areas. To find means of international educational cooperation within Africa, so that medical students and persons who would be medical librarians could undertake certain studies in countries other than their own; such arrangements would permit the unification of resources in a few centers. To deal with the position accorded to medical library and information services within national plans and within institutional structures. The sad truth is that libraries are usually ignored in governmental proposals and policies that concern medical programs. And in medical schools they are generally accorded subservient positions that deny them a voice in administration and force them to live with inadequate budgets. Of course this situation is a microcosm of the governmental neglect of librarianship that is so pervasive in most African nations. 20 14. PoHcies A Physician's Charter, \"Medical Professionalism in the New Millennium,\" was published by the Annals of Internal Medicine in February 2002. Fifth-year medical students of the University of Pretoria were challenged to comment on the applicability of this Charter's principles and responsibilities in the South African context. The majority of the students did not fully agree with the principles and responsibilities. A following cohort of fifth-year students was requested to define professionalism and describe attributes that could be included in an assessment tool. The students' perceptions of professionalism differed from that described in the Charter. The fact that the students value the humanistic part of [professionalism could possibly be ascribed to the following factors: Teaching of professionalism at the University of Pretoria focuses on the humanistic attributes, which form an important part of patient consultations and teamwork. Medical students are not actively involved in the social contract that is prominent in the Charter. They have very little influence regarding social justice, access to care, distribution of resources and conflict of interest. The Charter is considered and Introduction of more effective and standardized assessment methods for testing students' performance in Africa's medical institutions has been hampered by severe financial and personnel shortages. Nevertheless, some African institutions have recognized the problem and are now revising their medical curricula, and, therefore, their assessment methods. These institutions, and those yet to come, need guidance on selecting assessment methods so as to adopt models that can be sustained locally. The authors provide a model for selecting assessment methods for testing medical students' performance in African medical institutions. The model systematically evaluates factors that influence implementation of an assessment method. Six commonly used methods (the essay examinations, short-answer questions, multiple-choice questions, patient-based clinical examination, problem-based oral examination [POE], and objective structured clinical examination) are evaluated by scoring and weighting against performance, cost, suitability, and safety factors. In the model, the highest score identifies the most appropriate method. Selection of an assessment method is illustrated using two institutional models, one depicting an ideal situation in which the objective structured clinical examination was preferred, and a second depicting the typical African scenario in which the essay and short-answer-question examinations were best. The POE method mceived the highest score and could be recommended as the most appropriate for Africa's medical institutions, but POE assessments require changing the medical curricula to a problem-based learning approach. The authors' model is easy to understand and promotes in the medical curriculum and method of student assessment. 21 The HIV and AIDS epidemic will continue to impact medically, socially and financially on sub-Saharan Africa. It is therefore imperative that health science students in Africa experience the reality of the impact of this virus on communities. This article describes an HIV and AIDS education programme instituted at a South African medical school in parallel with the first year of a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum. In line with the PBL philosophy, the HIV and AIDS programme was largely experiential. Students interacted directly with HIV positive individuals, and through their educational workshops, with local communities. By means of small group sessions facilitated by trained community educators, students explored myths surrounding HIV and AIDS and engaged frankly wiith colleagues about sensitive issues such as having an HIV-infected family member. Although expensive in terms of human resources, the outcomes of this intervention exceeded the organisers' expectations, particularly in terms of students openly engaging with the reality of being HIV positive and the community organisation networks established. This type of experiential intervention with considerable community exposure has application to other health science curricula.

Postgraduate training, degrees and diplomas have been introduced and this should make a significant difference, in due course, to emergency care in the country. The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, like many universities in Australia, embarked upon a Graduate Entry Medical Programme. This implied significant curriculum change and gave opportunity for the development of formal emergency medicine training for students, for the first time. After considerable debate over the needs of the graduate in South Africa a new block was developed, called the Acute and Perioperative Care block. This encompasses forensic medicine, emergency medicine, trauma and anaesthetics. The training is integrated and progressive. No similar programme has been detected elsewhere. At the end of the first year there is considerable satisfaction on the part of both teachers and students and many of the students, finding the module exciting, have indicated a wish to become involved in emergency medicine in the future. The structure of the course is I aiel out and might be of relevance to colleagues with an interest in medical education.

What equity promotion policies have the government and individual institutions followed? 2. What have been their main characteristics and how they relate to the main determinants of disparities? 3. What has worked well and what has worked less well? 4. Have there been trade-offs equity I quality? 23 11. Policies and Locus of Implementation In Africa, in general, efforts have been made to develop health-related policy. The Regional Economic Communities (REGs) are the pillars of the African Union (AU), and have been recognized by the AU as the key vehicles for economic integration and cooperation in Africa. The 2003 Session of the AU Conference of African Ministers of Health (CAMH) considered and adopted, inter alia, recommendations on a proposal to establish Health and Social Affairs Desks within the REGs. The 2003 Maputo Session of the Assembly of AU Heads of State and Government duly endorsed the Report of the Ministers and their recommendations. This paper represents an attempt to assess the extent to which the 2003 decision of CAMH has been implemented. It also argues that regional integration and cooperation should not be geared solely towards economic, trade or political purposes (but to the social sector as well), and proposes a set of criteria as useful starting points for determining which social (i.e. health) activities can be undertaken at the regional and sub-regional levels. Finally, it also proposes various programmatic options to be considered in strengthening the roles of the REGs in regional integration and cooperation in the social sector (in the context of NEPAD), as Health Desks are established within the REGs.

African Journal of Health Sciences, 14(3- 4):104-113. In South Africa, Affirmative Action Policies have been developed that, directly or indirectly, influence access to, and participation in, medical education by previously underrepresented populations such as Blacks, Indians, and Coloreds [see South African Constitution, Section 9(2), and South African Bill of Rights].

A team of researchers from the University of Sussex (United Kingdom), University of DarEs Salaam (Tanzania), and the University of Cape Coast (Ghana) are currently engaged in a research project concerned with widening participation in higher education in Ghana and Tanzania and have generated a series of reports, based on these case studies, and publications on the issue (Morley, Leach, Lugg, Lihamba, Opare, Bhalalusesa, Ford, May 2007; Morley et. al.: August 2007; & Morley et. al.: August 2008). Other studies conducted by the team at the University of Sussex are Morley & Lugg (2008a); Morley & Lugg (2008b); Morley & Lugg (2009); and Morley, Leach, & Lugg (2009). The team claims that, The project aims to explore factors that facilitate or impede participation in higher education. This will involve examination of policy frameworks and codes of practice for widening participation of under\u00ad represented groups in higher education in Ghana and Tanzania. It will also include evaluating the success of widening participation initiatives via scrutiny of statistical data and interviews with key staff, policy-makers and community advocates and life-history narrative research with students from 'non\u00ad traditional' backgrounds. For instance, according to Morley et. al. (March 2007), the Government of Ghana has allocated quotas in order to widen participation to include 'non-traditional' students, i.e., mature students, people in full-time employment, the disabled, poor and female students, and students from rural and deprived schools. They report that 24 government policy regarding admissions aims at a 50-50 enrolment for males and females and that the \"Joint Admissions Board of the University of Cape Coast has directed that the percentage of female enrolment should not fall below 35 percent of total enrolment.\" Policies addressed in the Morley et. al. project include: The Musoma Resolution (1978): Another key process worth mentioning is the Musoma Resolution (1978) that in fact preceded the Women and Gender Development Policy as one of the first affirmative action policies that resulted in the increase of female enrolments in higher education. Through this resolution females were exempted from the two year compulsory work period that their male colleagues had to adhere to after secondary education in order to be able to enter the university directly from secondary schools. UDSM for the first time managed to enroll a large number of female students. Cost-Sharing in Higher Education Policy (1988): Up to 1988 education was free, except students were bonded to government services for five years and given government bursaries. Due to the government's inability to sustain the financing of free public higher education in addition to all of the other pressing public needs, cost-sharing in higher institutions of learning was introduced in 1988 and a directive subsequently made in 1992 to institute its operation (lshengoma, 2004). Education and Training Policy (ETP) (1995): The 1995 ETP Policy (currently under review) guides the provision of education in Tanzania mainland. The major thrust is in the areas of increasing enrolments, quality improvements, equitable access and expansion and optimum utilisation of available resources (URT, 1995). The ETP stresses liberalisation in education- i.e. opening up of education from public to private providers, and expansion of higher education, as well as cost-sharing and continued international cooperation. The policy also proposes greater financial contributions from parents (cost\u00ad sharing), students (loans) and institutions (sale of services) to curb over-reliance on state funding. Higher Education Policy of Tanzania (1999): A comprehensive Higher Education Policy (currently under neview) was developed in 1999 to guide the provision of higher education in the country. The policy addresses issues of expansion of student enrolment, increasing social demand for higher education and regulation, and accreditation of higher education institutions which are increasing as a result of liberalisation of the provision of higher education. The policy places considerable emphasis on cost effectiveness, efficiency, relevance of curricula, equity and access to education (URT, 1999). The Women and Gender Development Policy (2000): As a response to internal and external pressures for gender equality policies, the Tanzanian government formulated the Women in Development Policy in 1992, re-named the Women and Gender Development Policy in 2000. The policy calls for removal of barriers that hinder women's access to education and training to the limits of their abilities. This policy and its predecessor have been instrumental in influencing processes such as the following: (a) addressing gender mainstreaming in development, including the establishment of gender desks in ministries and organisations; (b) removing barriers to education and training; and, (c) introducing scholarships for higher education through the Ministry of Community Development, Gender and Children, specifically for women. The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) (2005): The latest strategy document is popularly known as 'MKUKUTA' the Kiswahili acronym from the translation of the NSGRP (URT, 2005a) ... in addition to outlining the government's strategies to ensure equitable access to quality primary and secondary education for boys and girls and universal literacy among women and 25 men, the strategy also stresses the expansion of higher, technical and vocational education. The national strategy has three broad clusters of targets. Cluster II focuses on the 'lmprovemenit of quality of life and social well-being' by enhancing the life situations of the poorest and most vulnerable groups in society. One of its aims is stipulated as reducing inequalities in education outcomes across geographic, income, age, gender and other groups (Goal 5.3.2.1 of NSGPR, 2005) (URT, 2005a: 42). 26 I 2. Characteristics and Relationship to Determinants of Disparities 27 3. Outcomes 28 14. Trade-Offs: Equity or Quality? In South Africa ... Women have outnumbered men in MBChB enrolments since 2000, figures ranging between 52% and 63% at seven of the eight medical schools in 2005. However, the rate of change in the medical profession lags behind and it will take more than two decades for female doctors to outnumber male doctors. A study of UCT postgraduate enrolments shows that females had increased to 42% of MMed enrolments in 2005. However, female postgraduate students were concentrated in disciplines such as paediatrics and psychiatry and comprised no more than 11% of enrolments in the surgical disciplines between 1999 and 2005. Conclusions. The study provides a basic quantitative overview of the changing profile of medical enrolments and raises questions about the career choices of women after they graduate and the social factors influencing these choices.

FAIMER seeks to contribute to the improvement of the health of communities through the improvement of health professions education. FAIMER concentrates its efforts in developing regions in South Asia, Africa, and Latin America and focuses on three specific strategies: faculty development, targeted research that informs health workforce policy and practice, and collecting and tracking of data that advances educational quality improvement decisions. FAIMER participates in the global dialogue on improving international medical education and actively seeks collaborations with a broad range of partners with whom it can learn and share experiences on how to best respond to the needs of the communities. Through this collective exploration and problem-solving, we strive for tangible results from the activities that we believe will lead to healthier communities. These activities are: Creating Educational Opportunities for Health Professions Educators that support the exchange of educational expertise; acquisition of new methodologies in teaching and assessment, development of leadership skills, and pursuit of advanced degrees in health professions education. Discovering Patterns and Disseminating Knowledge about the relationship between health professions education and health care, ahd the impact of physician workforce and migration issues on the functioning of health care systems. Developing Data Resources to provide accurate, publicly available information that promotes an understanding of the world's medical education systems today, and how they should look tomorrow. SOUTH AFRICAN PH.D. PROJECT5 This project provides a general outlook of the current status of Ph.D. programs that are useful to inform the medical education community. The South African Ph.D. Project is an initiative supporting a planned five-fold increase in the number of doctoral graduates by 2025. The present graduation rate is 27 Ph.Ds. per million of the population-far fewer than Brazil and a ninth that of Australia. South Africa urgently needs to expand its pool of highly-skilled doctorate holders to be !~lobally competitive. The country is seriously under-performing in Ph.D. output even for an emerging economy: its 27 Ph.Ds. per million people compares with 42 in Brazil, 172 in South KoPea, 240 in Australia and 259 in the UK. 4 This extract is taken from FAIMER's website: http://www.faimer.org/work.html 5 This is an adapted version of the report by Karen McGregor. Available: http:/ !www. universityworldnews. com/article.php ?story=20090 529112249793 30 to increase the annual number of Ph.D. graduates from a current 1,200 to 6,000 a year and, by so doing, said Dr. Carol Nonkwelo, manager of the Ph.D. Project, \"to increase diversity and strengthen the higher education, public and corporate sectors\". Too many doctoral students were taking longer than the average of four years to complete their degrees, or were dropping out, and students did not always know about the opportunities out there. The PhD Project provides a marketing, information and support service for postgraduate students.\" The average annual growth rate of students enrolling for doctoral studies was 7.3% between 2000 and 2005, according to a recent report for the Council on Higher Education, Postgraduate Studies in South Africa: A statistical profile. The report says the annual number of doctoral graduates increased from 882 to 1,176 in that period. While first enrolments for masters degrees -tomorrow's doctoral students -rose at an average annual rate of 4.4%, there had been significant declines since 2003, the report says. While total enrolments in South African higher education nearly doubled between 1990 and 2005, and the annual number of graduates more than doubled -from 56,7 44 to 120,385-the proportion of postgraduate students declined from 31% to 27%. The report says postgraduates were studying for longer, that the mean age of graduating had risen substantially -to an average of 34 years for masters and 40 years for doctoral students -and that the burden of supervision had increased across all fields of science, to 5.2 master's students and 2.2 doctoral students per supervisor. \"High international demand for South African graduates, together with the continuing brain drain, provides an urgent imperative to increase the production of postgraduate students in order for the c:ountry to remain competitive and to be able to generate knowledge that is responsive to a wide range of societal needs,\" the report concludes. The results reaffirmed \"the pressing need to prioritize the support and funding of greater numbers of postgraduate students and to ensure that there is a clear, easily-accessible and sought-after transition from undergraduate to postgraduate studies\". The project's mandate was to promote and secure foreign and local Ph.D. study opportunities, offer bursary packages to Ph.D. and post-doctoral students, promote Ph.D. education, expand the number of potential doctoral students, and establish partnerships with universities, funders and business. It was also building peer and mentor support networks. In many cases, doctoral scholarships did not cover the responsibilities of students who also had to provide for families: \"We would like to be able to offer more attractive funding,\" said Nonkwelo. A major problem in South Africa is supervisory capacity, the result of shortages of academics at universities and lack of qualified staff-only a third of teaching, research and technical staff at universities have a PhD. \"To reach the target numbers we have set, we cannot rely entirely on local academics,\" Nonkwelo explained. So the Ph.D. Project was encouraging 'sandwich' or 'split-site' studies in which doctoral students, though registered at a South Africa university and with a local supervisor, could also spend time at an institution abroad with an international supervisor. \"The project is still in its infancy,\" Nonkwelo said. \"We are developing systems and building an information database for postgraduates, training partnerships and sponsors. In future we will be a one-stop shop for postgraduate students.\" THE UNIVERSITY OF KWAZULU-NATAL, NELSON R. MANDELA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CENTER FOR RURAL HEALTH 31 Henk Rossouw, in the article \"In the Valley of a Thousand Hills: Doctors Needed\" relates the following abo medical education in South Africa: Rural hospitals face an extreme shortage of doctors: fewer than a quarter of all physicians practice medicine in the countryside, where almost half of all South Africans live. Much of the problem can be explained by the lack of resources in rural hospitals, making the demands of the job overwhelming. But hospital administrators and medical professors also say medical schools have historically done little to prepare, or inspire, their mostly middle-class students to work in rural areas. In 1998 the government tried to help rural hospitals recruit doctors by passing a law requiring all medical students to complete one year of community service, which is often in a rural setting, after they graduate. Once their year was over, however, fewer than 5 percent ended up staying on at the hospitals where they were assigned. After six years of study, a one-year internship in a teaching hospital, and a year of community service, most newly qualified doctors are averse to dedicating themselves to such a grueling job. Half of all South African medical students plan to practice medicine overseas, where salaries are far higher. While many eventually return home, a good percentage do not. Of those graduates who remain in South Africa, many plan to specialize, putting them out of reach of rural hospitals, where general practitioners are needed. The challenge for medical-school professors is to reconnect students with the altruistic ideals of their freshman year. One institution, the Nelson R. Mandala School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, in Durban, is leading this charge, thanks in large part to Stephen J. Reid, director of the university's Center for Rural Health. His research center focuses on helping the rural poor gain access to better health care. It does so, in part, by exposing all students to rural health care early in their training and working closely with the medical school's family-medicine department, which organizes brief internships lfor students at rural hospitals during their final year of school. (In South Africa, medical school lasts six years, beginning in a student's freshman year of college. Afterward graduates must complete a year-long internship at a major hospital before they can qualify as doctors.) Ten years after apartheid ended, most South African medical schools place a stronger emphasis on caring for the rural poor. A growing number of institutions in the country have set up centers like Dr. Reid's to focus on rural medicine, for example, and have introduced rural outreach programs into their curricula, where students spend a few weeks shadowing doctors in small hospitals. It is often the first time they encounter diseases specific to rural areas, such as kwashiorkor, a type of malnutrition in children that gives them swollen abdomens and reddish hair, and is caused by a diet heavy with cheap starch but light on protein. But students at many other medical schools are never required to travel more than a few miles beyond campus. At the University of Cape Town and the University of the Free State, for example, the only poor patients students see off the campus are those in small city hospitals or clinics, a short ambulance ride away from the costly diagnostic machines at the teaching hospital. In their sixth year of training, all students at KwaZulu-Natal's medical school are required to complete a short rural internship, and are sent to hospitals up to 220 miles away, where doctors have to rely on their experience and sometimes no more than an X-ray to diagnose patients. For medical students who grew up in the city, the idea of working in a rural hospital cari be intimidating. \"We've all heard horror stories of young doctors left alone, without supervision\" in understaffed rural hospitals, says Megishinee Naidoo, who is in her final year of medical school at 32 the University of KwaZulu-Natal. To ease their fears, Dr. Reid and his colleague, Andrew Ross, a lecturer in the department of family medicine, begin exposing students to rural health care soon after they start college. All freshman students, before they even know how to treat patients, spend time in the Valley of a Thousand Hills, a region known for both its beautiful scenery and its high rate of HIV infection, to ~earn more about rural life. During their fifth year, students return to the valley and learn how a rural clinic works. The rural program culminates in a two-and-a-half-week internship in a hospital during their final year of school. Students who go through these internships seem to like the challenges, and opportunities, that rural health care provides. Swasthi Singh, a forthright young woman who is thinking of becoming a pediatrician, recently completed her internship at Murchison's Hospital, a small red-brick institution 75 miles down the coast from KwaZulu-Natal. She says her initial concerns for her safety while working in such an isolated area have dissipated. Although few students are Willing to commit to a career in rural health care based solely on a two\u00ad week internship, a number of students who have been through KwaZulu-Natal's program say they felt they had warmer relationships with rural doctors, nurses, and patients. By contrast, at the King Edward VIII teaching hospital, says Ms. Singh, \"We process patients like meat. I want to take time to sit down with my patients.\" Understanding patients so they can be treated more effectively is one of the aims of a course in family medicine that Dr. Ross teaches final-year students. Visits to rural hospitals are part of the course. Students quickly learn that although most rural patients are poor, they have resources city dwellers don't. Students say they were impressed by how villagers trained by nurses would visit HIV-positive patients at their homes without being paid for it, bathe them, administer their drugs, and check for infections. The University of Transkei, Dr. Reid says, has even involved villagers in grading medical students, asking them to assess their relationships with their patients. Dr. Reid believes students should not be coerced. If students work in rural hospitals by choice, he says, they are more likely to stay. By forcing them, says Dr. Reid, the government is treating his students like children. Meanwhile, the government is trying to use money to encourage more medical-school graduates to consider a career in rural medicine. Soon, doctors at public rural hospitals will be paid more than their city counterparts. Yet higher pay may not be incentive enough. Many medical students want to specialize in a particular branch of medicine, pushing them out of reach of rural hospitals. Dr. Reid thinks medical education is structured to encourage such specialization. \"Train a person long enough in a big tertiary hospital, where their role models are super-duperspecialists, and see what happens,\" he says. With rural hospitals short of permanent staff, senior positions open quickly for doctors willing to commit to a long period. Dr. Kwinda completed his community service at Donald Fraser just last year. Today he is the hospital's most senior doctor, and earns double the salary of an entry-level physician. Dr. Reid's research shows that students admitted to medical school from rural areas are three times more likely to return and work in a rural hospital. Studies by other academics have drawn similar conclusions. At first glance, the solution to the shortage of dbctors in rural hospitals seems simple: With only 200 places each year at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's medical school, and 5,000 applicants, the more students with rural backgrounds that the university selects, the more doctors who will return to the countryside. 33 Some doctors worry this would just further South Africa's rural-urban divide, with city-born doctors serving only urban patients and rural-born doctors serving those in the country. Dr. Kwinda's impact at Donald Fraser Hospital is palpable. He has revamped staffing so that more doctors visit far-flung clinics, reducing the hospital's early-morning lines of patients, many of whom just need simple treatment for diabetes and hypertension. Patients who need general anesthesia can now be treated here instead of being sent to a bigger facility. Nothing else can be this rewarding, Dr. Kwinda says, not in the city. One of his proudest moments, he says, was when a patient came up to him holding her newborn baby. The woman probably would have died without the Caesarean he performed on her. \"This is your child,\" she said. Rossouw, Henk. \"In the Valley of a Thousand. Hills: Doctors Needed:\" The.

UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN: ETHICS AND HUMAN RIGHTS COURSE Setting Previous health policies in South Africa neglected the teaching of ethics and human rights to health professionals. In April1995, a pilot course was run at the University of Cape Town in which the ethical dimensions of human rights issues in South Africa were explored. Objectives\u00b7 To compare knowledge and attitudes of participating students with a group of control students. Design Retrospective cohort study Subjects -Seventeen fourth-year medical students who participated in the course and 13 control students from the same class, matched for gender. Interventions \u00b7 Students participated in a one-week module on ethics and human rights. Five months after the course had been run, students completed a semi-structured questionnaire exploring their knowledge and attitudes with regards to ethics and human rights issues. Main outcome measures \u00b7 Knowledge scores, attitude scores and various individual indicators of attitude. Results \u00b7 Clear benefits for overall knowledge score, for four out of five individual knowledge questions and for one of the attitude questions, were demonstrated. Participating students also appeared to be more convinced of the need for teaching on the ethical dimensions of human rights at postgraduate level and that such teaching should also be integrated in the curriculum. The low response rate amongst controls may have selected students who were more socially conscious, thereby leading to an underestimate of the true impact of the course, Conclusion \u00b7The evaluation indicates clear benefits of the course for undergraduate students, and supports arguments for the inclusion of such courses in the training of health professionals. This is particularly important given the challenges posed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the health professions to address past complicity in human rights abuses through reorientation of medical training in South Africa.

SAMA BENEVOLENT FUND To the Editor: I am the chairperson of the South African Medical Association's Benevolent Fund, which financially supports doctors and the immediate dependants of deceased doctors. The fund also financially supports a number of medical students from first to fourth year by way of an annual bursary. 34 The fund originally started as an initiative of doctors and was traditionally funded by donations from doctors who received free medical treatment from a colleague, and in return made a donation to the Benevolent Fund. With the introduction of medical insurance this gracious custom is disappearing, while there are still colleagues and immediate families of deceased colleagues in dire need of financial support. As a result the dwindling donations are threatening the long-term survival of the fund, and will ultimately leave such families financially destitute. Currently 29 families and 24 students receive financial support and bursaries respectively from the fund. This is a proud heritage that we would like to sustain. Should you be aware of a colleague in need, or the immediate dependants of a deceased colleague in urgent need of assistance, applications for support can be made through the local SAMA branches. A list of the branches can be obtained from http://www.samedical.org/page.asp?pageid=2 I would like to bring the activities of this fund to the attention of the doctors of South Africa, and make an appeal for their continued support of this worthy cause. More information on the Fund may be obtained from www.samedical.org or by contacting 012 481-2071.

Web. 9 Feb~2Ql0. 35 Conclusion and Recommendations Burdick (2007) states, The challenges facing health professions education in Africa focus on physical infrastructure, accreditation systems, student selection and faculty recruitment, retention, and development. Higher education in the health professions must be closely aligned with community health needs, and with the training and support of community health workers. A key ingredient in changing institutions in this way is implementation of effective strategies for strengthening the faculty. In addition, information systems, and their prerequisite stable electric power supply, must be supported by internal public resources combined with external aid. These infrastructure investments will facilitate better quality education, improved diffusion of information among schools, and more useful data for self study by institutions. Burdick, W (2007). Challenges and issues in health professions education in Africa. Medical Teacher, 29(9):882-886 B. Africans, with a focus on the South African situation, highlights the extreme resource constraints in which medical education in Sub-Saharan Africa exist. African summarizes this situation as follows:s Despite being the wealthiest country in sub-Saharan Africa, there are vast discrepancies between the gross national income (GNI) of South Africa and developed world countries, e.g. South Africa's GNI is only one third to one quarter that of countries such as the UK or the USA, respectively. Furthermore, there are huge discrepancies in the distribution of wealth within the country. Approximately 57% of the total population live below the poverty margin and more than 60% of white people live in the two wealthiest provinces. This is largely the persisting legacy of more than 40 years of enforced racial segregation policies. Within the constraints of this political legacy eight government-funded medical schools have been training doctors since 1900 when the University of Cape Town first admitted white medical students. There were no training facilities for black African medical students until1951 when three medical schools for black students were opened (1951, 1977, 1986). Historically White universities (HWU) started admitting black students in the 1980s, despite racial segregation policies still being in place. Restricted access to HWUs was only completely abolished after the first democratic election in 1994. Currently there are approximately 8 500 medical enrolments and 1 300 graduates nationally per year. Approximately 61% of graduates are derived from the HWUs. Until recently, South African medical schools followed the traditional British model of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. The process of radical political reform, particularly the transformation of health care and higher education, as well as international trends in medical education have, however, served as powerful catalysts for a process of major undergraduate curriculum reform. This has included: (1) implementation of problem-based learning methods, to a greater or lesser extent, in six schools, (2) a shift towards community based education in all schools, (3) shortening of six-year programmes to five-year programmes in three schools and (4) the introduction of a graduate-entry programme in one school. Postgraduate training programmes are also undergoing a process of reform, but lag behind undergraduate trends. One of the critical issues being targeted in postgraduate education, as a matter of national priority, is the review of high stakes assessment practices. 6B. Africans (n.d.). Overview of Medical Education in African. Available: http:/ /publishing.eur .nl/ir/repub/asset/ 1 0 152/Chapter2. pdf 36 While significant health care and educational reforms have been achieved in the past decade, a number of major challenges currently face clinician-educators wishing to maintain and further improve the quality of medical education, specifically assessment practices, in this developing country. These challenges include: (1) powerful political forces driving redress of previous racial inequalities that continue to hamper the training of black medical students, particularly black African students; (2) the restructuring of health care services, particularly better primary health services, so as to provide equitable, accessible health care for all; (3) achieving the desired outcomes articulated in the recently published national programme training and accreditation guidelines issued by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) -both documents address the priority assessment advances outlined in the literature review of this thesis; (4) the inability of the limited number of public service doctors to continue providing adequate health care services and function as clinician-educators for medical training programmes located in the public service; (5) the potential impact of the ongoing medical \"brain drain\" on the sustainability of good-quality medical training programmes; (6) the massive burden of disease, particularly the HIV /AIDS pandemic, threatening the future of both health care services and medical training programmes in South Africa. Each of these points is briefly summarised. The need to radically alter the ethnic profile of medical enrolments and graduates is a matter of national priority. Although more than 60% of enrolments in some HWU are now black, including up to 30% black African students at two of five institutions, further transformation is required. This includes admission of significant numbers of educationally disadvantaged black students to medical schools traditionally admitting academically outstanding candidates only. The financial and human resource implications of ensuring the academic success of these at-risk students are a major priority and challenge to all schools. Currently, at least 50% of graduates are black; up to 24% are black African at one HWU. The need to replicate these findings at other HWU is apparent. The redistribution of financial resources required to improve primary health care services in South Africa has severely impacted upon .academic training centre resources, particularly human resources and in-patient services. Between 1995 and 2000, the Western Cape province, home to two medical schools, closed 24% of its provincial tertiary service in-patient beds and terminated the services of 28% of health and support personnel. While the development of primary care services are clearly a priority, the \"knock-on\" effect on training institutions has not been fully appreciated until recently. The impact of major resource limitations is now being felt by training programmes, and innovative ways of dealing with the infrastructural and human nesource shortages are urgently being addressed. The per capita health expenditure in South Africa is less than 10% of that of developed world countries like the Netherlands. Furthermore, only 38% of national health expenditure funds service provision for approximately 85% of South Africans who do not have any form of private health care insurance. However, the situation is more serious than just an issue of inadequate funding. The public service platform is also seriously understaffed. Nationally the doctor per 10 000 population ratio is 7.7; in the public health sector it is currently 2 per 10 000 population, i.e. the WHO minimum for health service provision. This stands in stark contrast to the average of 20-30 doctors per 1 0 000 population in developed countries. In summary this means that less than 37% of medical doctors working in South Africa are responsible for providing health care for more than 40 million people funded by only 38% of the national health expenditure. The gross inequalities of this situation are apparent. This situation is, however, further aggravated by the training and supervision needs of medical trainees located within the public service sector. Up to 50% of training, supervision and assessment of medical students in developing countries are conducted by non-university staff, i.e. doctors working in the public sector. This added burden accounts for much of the tension between teaching, training and service delivery commonly expressed by doctors working in the public service. The situation is further complicated by increasing tension between the major stakeholders -the universities need significant teaching and training assistance from doctors employed by the national government to deliver clinical service. The extent of the medical \"brain drain\" from sub-Saharan Africa is increasingly well quantified. This world region has now been identified as the major donor' region of the world -more than one third of the top 20 37 donor countries in the world are located in this region. Specifically, Ghana, South Africa and Ni~1eria have been identified as the top three source countries in the world using an emigration factor calculation that mathematically expresses physician emigration as a function of the total workforce remaining in the donor country. Three of South Africa's HWUs head the top 10 \"export\" medical schools list in the world. Thus, South Africa's \"brain drain\" problem is amongst the worst in the world. Of greater concern, how1~ver, from an educational perspective, is the percentage of emigrating experienced clinician educators. This has not been quantified to date, but probably represents a bigger subset of the \"brain drain\" population than may be currently speculated. Data recently released by the HPCSA indicate that the number of doctors registered in South Africa has remained stable over the past three years. These figures are, however, of limited value. Data over the past decade are needed to establish migratory trends. The suggestion by the national government that medical graduate output needs to double, i.e. at least 2 400 graduates per annum as compared to 1 300 currently, suggests a recognition of service needs in keeping with the Millennium Development Goals prediction - Africa needs one million additional health workers to achieve these goals by 2015. Failing that, the current workforce is only likely to meet the goals by 2050. The overwhelming burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa is perhaps the single greatest threat to sustainable health care and medical education. Approximately 5% of the world's medical workforce is trying to deal with 25% of the global burden of disease located in sub-Saharan Africa. The HIV /AIDS pandemic serves as a good example. At least 25 million HIV-positive people reside in sub-Saharan Africa. National infection prevalence data are the worst in Southern African countries; 30% or more. This has effectively halved life expectancy in the worst affected countries, i.e. 37-51 years in high HIV prevalence African countries as compared to 71-81 years in developed world countries like the UK, the Netherlands and the USA. The health care implications of this pandemic are apparent. However, the impact thereof on the sustainability of medical teaching programmes, located within the already overcrowded public health care system responsible for dealing with this pandemic, has not been considered at all. The situation is considerable aggravated by the fact that HIV /AIDS is only one of a number of epidemics in Africa; other important killer diseases include tuberculosis, malaria and the emerging epidemic of lifestyle-related diseases, e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Taking these additional disease epidemics into consideration paints an even bleaker picture for medical education in sub-Saharan Africa. From an educational perspective it is critical to recognize that medical education in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa, is in trouble. The massive ongoing loss of trained health professionals, in excess of production capacity, and the overwhelming burden of disease are seriously threatening the sustainability of current medical training programmes in this world region~ Implementing educational advances, specifically those referred to in the literature review, and endorsed by the HPCSA national training and accreditation guidelines, seem almost impossible unless the advice of Schuwirth and van der Vleuten is heeded -\"Rather than adopting a method that has been successful in a certain situation, one should adopt the underlying concepts and translate them to fit the unique demands of the local situation.\" Indeed, adopting ithis approach to medical education, specifically in extremely resource-constrained environments typical of pulblic health care practice in Africa today, is the only way forward. This approach will need to be applied in an exponential fashion if African medical schools, including those in South Africa, are to keep abreast of medical education innovations and advances in resource-constrained settings that developed world countries do not even begin to comprehend. 38 Recommendations 1.

Institute for International Medical Education http:/ Africa The first session of the Southern Africa-FAIMER Regional Institute (SAFRI) took place in February 2008 in Cape Town, South Africa, marking the launch of FAIMER's first regional initiative on the continent of Africa. SAFRI is being shepherded by a new \"voluntary association\" made up of a collaboration of FAIMER Institute Fellows working at a number of different health professions education institutions in the1 region. They have devised an innovative program model that includes three residential sessions during the two\u00ad year program. Fellows participate in two residential sessions, approximately four months apart, during the first year of the program. Their third residential session takes place the following year, and overlaps with the first residential session of the incoming class of Fellows. The program is open to interested health professions educators from Africa. Sixteen Fellows are accepted each year. 64 Appendix B: Technical Support Provided to WHO Member States Table 2: Technical Support Provided to WHO Member States 10.9 .1 ~umber of cotmtlies facing severe health-workforce dift1culties that use evidence-based practices, tools workfot\"<Ce developmeut. iucluding migration Number of cotmtJ:ies reached by 2007. particularly among 57 countries facing severe 10.9.2 Number of countries facine: severe 1lealtl1\u00b7 workfol\u00b7ce difficulties that adopt t;pdated norms and standards related to the educatiou. training and p1\u00b7a~ti~e of diffen~ut ~ategot\u00b7ies of health occupations N\u00b7umber of countries reached by 2007, particularly among 57 cmmtlies facing sevex\u00b7e 10 more cmmtries; f..'l.c:ing o;even~ health\u00ad \\.\"l.lot\u00b7kfo:rce difficulties that more countries :fuciug: sevea\u00b7e health-workforce difficulties 65 Appendix C: Medical Schools by Country, Africa7 Note: The World Health Organization (WHO) received the information on medical schools from the governments of its Member States for the updates to the World directory of medical schools (base year 2000).
