In November 2017, t he NHS England Board agreed to consult on national guidance for CCGs to restrict the routine prescribing of OTC products for 33 minor and/or self-limiting conditions, plus vitamins/minerals and probiotics . It was estimated that restricting the routine prescription of these products could save the NHS up to \u00a3136m per year . NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners consulted publicly on these proposals between 20th December 2017 and 14th March 2018. This paper sets out the findings of the consultation and seeks the Board's agreement on proposed next steps. Recommendation: The Board is asked to : o Consider and note the findings of the public consultation ; o Approve the final recommendations ; and o Approve the publication and dissemination of final guidance to CCGs . OFFICIAL Page 2 of 14 Conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care: findings of consultation and next steps Background 1. In the year prior to June 2017, the NHS spent approximately \u00a3569 million on prescriptions for over the counter (OTC) items which could otherwise be purchased from a pharmacy and/or other outlets such as petrol stations or supermarkets. Some of these prescriptions include items for a condition: That is considered to be self -limiting and so does not need treatment , as it will heal or be cured of its own accord; or Which lends itself to self -care, i.e. the person suffering does not normally need to seek medical advice and can manage the condition by purchasing OTC items directly . These prescriptions also include other common items: That can be purchased over the counter, sometimes at a lower cost than that which would be incurred by the NHS; For which there is little evidence of clinical effectiveness. 2. By reducing spend on treating conditions that are self -limiting or which lend themselves to self -care, or on items for which there is little evidence of clinical effectiveness, NHS resources can be used for other higher priority areas that have a greater impact for patients, support improvements in services and /or deliver transformation that will ensure the long-term sustainability of the NHS. Consultation 3. CCGs asked for a nationally co -ordinated approach to producing commissioning guidance . NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners (NHSCC) therefore sought to provide a national framework for guidance, with the aim of supporting consistent local implementation decisions and agreed to consult joint ly on any proposals . 4. NHS England and NHSCC established a clinical working group, chaired by representatives of these two organisations and with membership including GPs and pharmacists, CCGs, the Royal College of General Practitioners , the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) , the OFFICIAL Page 3 of 14 Department of Health and Social Care , the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and others . 5. The clinical working group were consulted on several proposed approaches to limiting the prescription of OTC medicines . The number of OTC products (c. 3,200) and the frequency of product name changes over time makes it difficult to develop guidance based on product name or type. We therefore mapped OTC products to the conditions for which they are typically prescribed and refined the approach to develop restrictions based on type and severity of condition rather the products. 6. OTC products were classified into three condition categories: Products that are used to treat minor conditions : (including self- limiting conditions ). For self -limiting conditions medical advice is not usually necessary , so they can be promoted for self -care without need for NHS prescribing. Some drugs used for such conditions in this category may also have a limited evidence base for their use. Other conditions in this category are suitable for self -care, and treatments for them can be purchased over the counter. Products that can be used to treat both minor and non -minor conditions : Some drugs that are mainly for minor ailments may also be used for a chronic illness or in response to a side effect of another drug required for treatment of more complex disease. An example could be drugs used to treat constipation. Infrequent constipation due to lack of fibre in the diet can be considered minor and treated with an OTC product , but laxatives could also be prescribed to prevent constipation in patients with chronic pain who are taking opiate analgesics (morphine). Some patients may also be prescribed these drugs for inflammatory bowel disease. We expect around 20% of OTC prescribing for drugs in this category to be for minor conditions. We do not propose restrictions on OTC prescribing for non -minor conditions. Products that are used to treat non -minor conditions : OTC drugs in this category are being prescribed for non -minor conditions. An example would be nitrates (GTN Spray) which are prescribed for the symptomatic relief of angina. We do not propose restrictions on OTC prescribing for conditions in this category. 7. As a result of this exercise, 33 minor conditions were identified by the clinical working group for inclusion in the consultation. Vitamins /minerals and probiotics were also considered given the level of spend, although the OFFICIAL Page 4 of 14 working group felt the conditi ons-based approach was less relevant for these products as their use cannot be mapped to one single condition . 8. Having identified OTC products for minor conditions , the conditions they are prescribed for were then classified as either: A condition that i s self -limiting and does not require medical advice or treatment as it will clear up on its own; or A condition that is a minor ailment and is suitable for self -care and treatment with items that can easily be purchased over the counter from a pharmacy. 9. Vitamins/minerals and probiotics were considered to be items with limited clinical evidence of effectiveness . However, there are circumstances in which vitamins/minerals are appropriately prescribed and these circumstances are as specified in the guidance . 10. We then propose d that for each condition , we make one of the following recommendations to CCGs: Advise CCGs to that [item] should not be routinely prescribed in primary care due to limited evidence of clinical effectiveness Advise CCGs that a prescr iption for treatment of [condition] should not routinely be offered in primary care , as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of [condition] should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self-care 11. The Board agreed that NHS England should consult on these specific proposals , and approval was given to run a twelve week consultation , which ran from 20th December 2017 to 14th March 2018. 12. The consultation also sought views on general exceptions to the recommendations, as well as condition -specific exceptions. . 13. Expected savings have been estimated at around \u00a397m per year . The initial estimate had been a saving of up to \u00a3136m, based on the total estimated \u00a3136m spend on these items . This revised figure account s for some of the exceptions that could be applied to the guidance . However, this figure is based on several assumptions and as such will be subject to factors such as clinical judgement and the extent to which the exceptions apply in practice. OFFICIAL Page 5 of 14 Consultation Responses 14. We received a total of 2,638 responses through the online consultation survey, 65 written submissions by post or email , and a further 122 responses to the easy read version of the consultation . In addition , we held a series of webinars for stakeholders , and face -to-face public and patient stakeholder events including in London, Leeds and Birmingham. We also held individual meetings with parliamentarians and members of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, and held targeted focus groups with key stakeholde r group s including older people , individuals with learning disabilities , and Citizen' s Advice clients . 15. A full analysis and report on the consultation responses is attached at Annex A . 16. The c hart below indicates the number of responses broken down by respondent type . Chart 1: Number of responses by respondent type 17. Of the tot al number of respondents, 5 7% were either patients (33 % of the responden ts) or members of the public (24 % of the respondents). A further 1 7% of respondents were clinicians. 18. Overall there was broad support for the proposals, with over 60% of respondents agreeing that we should no longer routinely prescribe OTC OFFICIAL Page 6 of 14 products for the minor conditions identified in the consultation. In terms of the individual conditions, for every condition consulte d upon, in each case at least 58 % of respondents were in support of no longer routine ly prescribin g the OTC products used to treat them . 19. We refined the draft guidanc e in light of the consultation, as well as recommendations from the joint clinical working group which considered the feedback in detail. 20. Key stakeholder s who provided feedback on the specific conditions identified in the consultation include d (but we re not limited to): British Medical Association (BMA) College of Paramedics British Society for Cutaneous Allergy (BSCA) British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (BOMSS) The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) Dermatology Council for England (DCE) 21. Whilst overall the final guidance remain s largely unchanged from the draft guidance consulted on, in the light of consultation feedback there have been some important refinements and clarifications made , which are summarised below. General issues General Exceptions 22. Feedback from the consultation events and webinars indicated it would be helpful to include a duration of treatment period when considering the appropriateness of self -care for minor conditions i.e. if the condition didn't clear up in the time indicated , a prescription could then be considered. The clinical working group carefully considered this point, but on reflection felt that it would not be helpful to specify a time period, as this would vary by condition. They did , however , agree that the following general statement should be included: \" It is envisioned that in most cases (unless specified) these minor conditions will clear up with appropriate self -care. If symptoms are not improving or responding to treatment , then patients should be encouraged to s eek further advice \". 23. Feedback from the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society indicated that patients who have bariatric surgery should be included within the general exceptions. Having considered this, it was felt that these patients would alrea dy be included by the general exception for individual patients whose ability to self -manage is compromised . The OFFICIAL Page 7 of 14 clinical working group therefore did not propose to amend the general exceptions to specify patients who have bariatric surgery. 24. The clinical working group agreed that the general exceptions would not apply to items where there was no evidence of effectiveness, and to the self-limiting conditions. This issue has been updated in the guidance as below: To note that for vitamins, minerals, probio tics and those self -limiting conditions where there is limited evidence of clinical effectiveness for the treatments used (e.g. OTC items for cough, sore throat and infant colic), then the general exceptions do not apply. Specific exceptions are included (if applicable) under the relevant item and/or condition. This may need to be considered further when implementing the guidance locally. Vulnerability 25. One of the recurring themes from the consultation has been the potential impact of the proposals on pa tients that are financially vulnerable i.e. patients on low incomes, unemployed and /or in receipt of benefits. 26. The clinical working group also heard concerns from CCG and GP stakeholders about financial vulnerability; their concerns were around the fact that as the guidance reads GPs may be responsible for making prescribing decisions on OTC items based on a patien t's ability to pay for them. This issue was also raised by Healthwatch, who were additionally concerned that placing GPs in this situation could lead to inconsistencies for patients. 27. A specific exception relating to financial vulnerability has not been included in the guidance as the clinical working group thought it better to include an exception around 'social vulnerability' to cover any patients who could be adversely affected if reliant on self -care: Individual patients where the clinician considers that their ability to self - manage is compromised as a consequence of medical, mental health or significant social vulnerability to the extent that their health and/or wellbeing could be adversely affected i f reliant on self-care. To note that being exempt from paying a prescription charge does not automatically warrant an exception to the guidance. 28. Following feedback, for further clarity over the relationship with existing exemptions for prescription charge s, the clinical working group also agreed that the following sentence should be included in the guidance: OFFICIAL Page 8 of 14 The guidance applies to all patients unless they fall under the exceptions outlined; this includes those who would be exempt from paying prescriptio n charges. Signposting 29. Another recurring theme that has emerged from the engagement events is the need for better signposting for patients; often patients are not aware that they can visit a pharmacy and receive advice and information on how to manage mi nor conditions. The current Stay Well Pharmacy campaign will help , but the clinical working group acknowledged that further support will be required at a local level , and this has been clarified within the guidance document as follows : When implementing this guidance , CCGs will need to supply patients with better information on signposting so that they are able to access the right service. This guidance is not intended to discourage patients from going to the GP , when it is appropriate to do so. Access to Pharmacies 30. One concern that has been raised is the impact in rural areas where access to a pharmacy may be more limited. The clinical working group considered this issue and noted that, CCGs will need to consider this issue further at a local level. Th e following has therefore been included in the guidance document: CCGs will also need to take account of their latest local Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA) and consider the impact of this guidance on rural areas and access to a pharmacy and pharmacy medicines. Blacklisting 31. The consultation feedback included a request that products used for the treatment of infant colic should be formally placed on the 'blacklist'. 32. There was also f eedback request ing that probiotics should be considered for blacklisting . However, as they are approved for certain indications under the Advisory Committee for Borderline Substances (ACBS) th is would not be possible. 33. Blacklisting of products is not a matter for NHS England, but for the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State decide d to proceed with any such recommendations, there would be a further formal consultation on the proposals. Condition -specific issues OFFICIAL Page 9 of 14 Vitamins/Minerals 34. Of those wh o responded to this question, 72% agreed and 16 % disagreed that vitamins/minerals should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 35. Following feedback from the consultatio n, including from the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) , the clinical working group agreed that the exceptions should be amended to include all types of medically diagnosed deficiency including for those patients who may have a lifelong condition or have undergone surger y that results in malabsorption. This change was made to cover all types of deficiency rather than just specifying iron, calcium and vitamin D deficiencies. 36. To note several vitamin D manufacturers do not support the non -inclusion of vitamin D maintenance therapy as an exception. The guidance recommends that patients are given further information on how to maintain their vitamin D levels , including purchasing a product over the counter in a pharmacy if appropriate rather than on pres cription. 37. The clinical working group considered this carefully and agreed that only deficiency as opposed to maintenance should be included as an exc eption - this recommendation therefore remains unchanged . Cold Sores 38. Of those wh o responded to this q uestion, 78 % agreed and 12 % disagreed that OTC products for treatment of cold sores should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 39. Following feedback and advice from BAD that further clarification was needed , the clinical working group agreed that the description of this condition should be amend ed to clarify that this refers to infrequent cold sores of the lip. Cradle Cap 40. Of those who responded to this question, 72% agreed and 12 % disagreed that OTC prod ucts for treatment of cradle cap should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 41. Following feedback and advice from BAD, t he clinical working group agreed t his condition should be refined to include the exception \"If not improving and causing distress to the infant\". Contact Dermati tis OFFICIAL Page 10 of 14 42. Of those wh o responded to this question, 64% agreed and 22 % disagreed that OTC products for treatment of contact dermatitis should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 43. Feedback from the professional bodies indicated that they were reluctant for th is condition to be included ; however , if it was included they felt that the description should be more precise. 44. The clinical working group carefully considered this, but on balance agreed that the condition should remain on the list of items ineligible for routine prescription . They did , however , agree that the description of this condition should be amended to clarify that this refers to mild irritant dermatitis . Dandruff 45. Of those who responded to this question, 86% ag reed an d 7% disagreed that OTC products for treatment of dandruff should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 46. Following feedback and advice from BAD, t he clinical working group agreed that the rationale should be amended to define dandruff a s a \"mild scaling of the scalp without itching\", and to include the state ment ; \"Patients should be encouraged to manage mild dandruff with long term over the counter treatments. \" Diarrhoea (Adults) 47. Of those who responded to this question, 72% agreed and 1 4% disagreed that OTC products for treatment of diarrhoea in adults should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 48. Feedback from the BMA highlighted that acute diarrhoea can be a serious illness in frail patients and, particularly if accompanied by faecal incontinence, can lead to an unplanned hospital admission. However, the scenario applied to more complex frail patients , who would be excluded under the general exception s. Therefore , the clinical working group agreed that no changes should be made to the original recommendation. Dry Eyes/Sore Tired Eyes 49. Of those who responded to this question, 75% agreed and 1 4% disagreed that OTC products for treatment of dry eyes/sore tired eyes should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 50. Feedback from the BMA argued that dry eyes are not a minor condition and require long -term treatment . The clinical working group considered OFFICIAL Page 11 of 14 this carefully, along with feedback received including other stakeholders such as the RCOphth , but conclude d that n o changes to the origi nal recommendation were required . Head Lice 51. Of those who responded to this question, 78% agreed and 13 % disagreed that OTC products for treatment of head lice should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 52. Feedba ck from stakeholders including BAD indicated that chemical treatments should not be recommended as a first line treatment for head lice. Based on feedback received, t he clinical working group agreed that the rationale should be amended to clarify that head lice can be treated by wet combing in the first instance, and that c hemical treatment is only recommended in exceptional circumstances . In such cases over the counter medicines can be purchased from a pharmacy following a consultation with a pharmacist . Indigestion and Heartburn 53. Of those who responded to this question, 64% agreed and 20 % disagreed that OTC products for treatment of indigestion and heartburn should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 54. The BMA raised a view that n on-ulcer dysp epsia is not a minor condition and often requires long term medication. They argued that r estrictions on antacid prescribing might result in increased PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) or H2RA (H2 receptor antagonist) prescribing. 55. The clinical working group considered this but felt that the exceptions already proposed would apply for more severe patients . The group also discussed whether the description should be amended to clari fy that it refers to mild and infrequent heartburn, but on balance the group agreed that the recommendation should remain unchanged. Infrequent Constipation 56. Of those who responded to this question, 80% agreed and 10 % disagreed that OTC products for treatment of infrequent constipation should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 57. Following feedback received during the consultation, t he clinical working group agreed that further rationale was required and should now include the following additional information: OFFICIAL Page 12 of 14 Pharmacists can help if diet and lifestyle changes aren't helping. They can suggest an over the counter laxative. Most laxatives work within 3 days. They should be used for a short time only. Laxatives are not recommended for children unless they are pre scribed by a GP. This guidance applies to short term, infrequent constipation caused by changes in lifestyle or diet such as lack of water or movement or changes in diet. Mild Acne 58. Of those who responded to this question, 77% agreed and 11 % disagreed that OTC products for treatment of mild acne should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 59. We received feedback that the heading for 'mild acne' should be changed to 'teenage spots' . However others felt that calling it teenage spots trivialises t he condition. The clinical working group agreed with the latter assessment. They did , however , agree that additional information should be included to clarify that patients should be encouraged to manage this condition with long term use of OTC products. Mild Dry Skin/Sunburn 60. Of those who responded to this question, 85% agreed and 8 % disagreed that OTC products for treatment of mild dry skin/sunburn should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 61. BAD advis ed that m ild dry skin and sunburn should be considered as separate conditions , rather than being classified as a single condition. The clinical working group considered this and agreed that it would be helpful to separate this into 3 separate conditions mild dry skin , sunburn due to excessive s un exposure, and sun protection with the overall recommendation for each remaining the same. Minor conditions associated with pain, discomfort and fever 62. Of those who responded to this question, 74% agreed and 1 4% disagreed that OTC products for treatment of minor conditions associated with pain, discomfort and fever should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 63. The BMA raised a concern that if restrictions are placed on the prescribing of analgesics which are available over the count er, there may be a rise in prescribing of more powerful agents, including opiates , which have more adverse effects, and there is the potential for dependence. OFFICIAL Page 13 of 14 64. This concern was considered by the clinical working group, but as the restriction relates to condition rather than on individual medicines, the clinical working group did not feel that any changes were required to the recommendation. GPs remain responsible for their individual clinical prescribing decisions. Nappy Rash 65. Of those who responded to this question, 77% agreed and 1 2% disagreed that OTC products for treatment of nappy rash should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 66. Following feedback, t he clinical working group agreed that it would be helpful to indicate in the rationale that nappy rash is a short term condition that will normally clear up after about three to seven days , if recommended hygiene tips are followed. Ringworm/Athlete's Foot 67. Of those who responded to this question, 72% agreed and 1 5% disagreed that OTC products for treatment of ringworm/athlete's foot should no longer be routinely prescribed in primary care. 68. BAD identified that further exceptions should apply to this condition , as there are some patients who may need further medical advice in order to treat the above conditions . 69. The clinical working group considered this and on reflection agreed that Lymphoedema or history of lower limb cel lulitis should be included as exception s for this condition . Recommendations 70. Based on the con sultation response, we would recommend taking forward the proposals, with the changes set out in this paper. 71. The final proposed guidance for CCGs is attached at annex B for the Board's consideration and approval to publish . This is accompanied by an Equalities Impact Assessment, attached at annex C. 72. CCGs will be expected to take this guidance into account in formulating local polices, and prescribers should reflect these local policies in their prescribing practice. This guidance does not remove the clinical discretion of the prescriber in accordance with their professional duties. OFFICIAL Page 14 of 14 73. The Board is asked to : consider and note the findings of the public consultation ; approve the final recommendations ; and approve the publication and dissemination of final guidance to CCGs.

CCGs asked for a nationally coordinated , consistent approach to the development of commissioning guidance in this a rea to avoid unnecessary variation. The aim is to achieve a fairer decision -making process and to provide cle ar guidance on medicines. CCGs, however, will need to take individual decisions on implementation locally. In the year to June 2017, the NHS spent approximately \u00a356 9 million on prescriptions for medicines for minor c onditions, which could have been purchased over the counter (OTC) from a pharmacy and/or other outlets such as petrol stations or supermarkets. It is vital that the NHS achieves the greatest val ue from its finite resources . By reducing what we spend on treating conditions that are self -limiting or lend themselves to self -care, we will have more money to spend on high priority areas that have a greater impact for patients, to support improvements in services and to deliver transformation that will ensure the long -term sustainability of th e NHS. The cost to the NHS for many of the items used to treat minor conditions is often higher than the OTC price as there are hidden costs. For example, a pack of 12 anti -sickness tablets can be purchased for \u00a32.18 from a pharmacy whereas the cost to the NHS is over \u00a33.00 after including dispensing fees. T he actual total cost is more than \u00a335 when you include GP consultation and administration costs. The OTC public consultation, exploring 'conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely b e prescribed in primary care', ran between 20 De cember 2017 and 14 March 2018 . Responses were received through the online s urvey, webinars, public events, letters and emails. NHSE and NHSCC's joint working group will review the consultatio n findings and develop final comm issioning guidance. This will be published with the expectation that CCGs should 'have regard to' it in accordance with the Health and Social Care Act 20 06. Background - How the proposals were developed The clinical working group develope d proposed guidelines for 33 minor and/or self -limiting conditions . Vitamins/m inerals and probiotics have also been included as items with low clinical effectiveness but a high cost to the NHS. These were categorised under t hree headings: an item of low clinical effectiveness, where there is a lack of robust evidence for clinical effectiveness: probiotics, vitamins and minerals a condition that is self -limiting and does not require medical advice or treatment as it will clear up on its own : acute sore throat, cold sores, conjunctivitis, coughs and colds and nasal congestion, cradle cap (s eborrhoeic dermatitis - infants), hae morrho ids, infant colic, mild cystitis a condition that is a minor illness and is suitable for self -care and treatment with items that can easily be purchased over the counter from a pharmacy: contact dermatitis, dandruff, diarrh oea (adults), dry eyes/sore tired eyes, earwax, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), head lice, indigestion and heartburn, infrequent constipation, infrequent migraine, insect bites and stings, mild acne, mild dry skin/sunburn, mild to moderate hay fever/all ergic rhinitis, minor burns and scalds, minor conditions 6 associated with pain, discomfort and fever (such as aches and sprains, headache, period pain, back pain), mouth ulcers, nappy rash, oral thrush, prevention of dental caries, ringworm/athletes foot, t eething/mild toothache, threadworms, travel sickness, warts and verrucae. Report authors NHS England commissioned NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit (MLCSU) to collate and analyse all of the feedback from this consultation and produce this report. The report has been produced by the Communications and Engagement and the Medicines Management Optimisation teams at MLCSU. 2 Engagement methodology and feedback Engagement was structured around the following channels and feedback mechanisms: Breakdown of responses according to feedback method Feedback methods No. responses from feedback method Analysis and reporting information Online survey ( comprising 50 closed questions and 11 open questions) 2,638 Closed questions are tabulated by respondent type. Open questions are coded, key quotes are identified and tabulated by respondent type . In total 7,056 open responses were received and analysed. Patient and public correspondence (email and letters) 14 Each item was read and coded against the online survey coding frame. The data was then coded and a summary report was written Organisational correspondence (email, letters and formal correspondence) 51 Each item was read and coded against the online survey coding frame. The data was then coded and a summary report was written by a pharmacist Webinars (professional and industry) This includes 4 CCG webinars 7 Summaries have been written for each of the products mentioned in the discussion Webinars (patient and public) 3 Summaries have been written for each of the products mentioned in the discussion Engagement events and meetings (patient and public) This includes 3 focus groups with Citizens Advice clients and 2 with people with learning disabilities 9 Summaries have been written for each of the products mentioned in the discussion Events and meetings (professional and industry) 5 Summaries have been written for each of the products mentioned in the discussion Easy read survey 122 Key themes and messages from the easy read survey report incorporated into the report of findings Analysing feedback received The consultation survey included a combination of 'open text' questions where r espondents could write their views and opinions as well as closed questions where respondents 'ticked' a 7 response to a set of preset responses (for example, 't o what extent to do you agree with X' and the options are: agree, disagree, neither agree or disagree or unsure). The c losed questions were tabulated and responses shown by respondent type. The open questions were handled differently. A random sample of responses from each open question was read and the key themes (codes) that were discussed by respondents were listed. This was undertaken for every question. Some codes were replicable acr oss more than one response (such as 'NHS funds should not be used to pay for this') while others were specific to a single question . This means that every comment was coded because the l ist of themes/codes was not predetermined but instead emerged from the responses received. The coding frame was also use d to read, code and analyse corre spondence from patie nts and public so that all responses can be compared and analysed together. Suppor ting evidenc e, reports, academic papers and other documents which were submitted by organisations are being reviewed by NHS England separately. Responses from specific organisations were read and summa rised. These summaries are referred to in this report. 2.1 Survey r espondent types In total 2,638 individuals complet ed the survey , of those 2,616 indicated their respondent type.

Patients and members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients : Respondents listed a number of people who they feel this proposal adversely affects including: those who require considerable care and will make it harder for them to access treatments (e.g. disabled, elderly) , people from low income and lower socioeconomic background s; those with existing long term and/or chronic conditions requiring large quantities of OTC medicines and patients from BME groups (especially those susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. Specific emphasis on the ability of groups to pay and the affordability of OTC treatments, medications and dietary supplements for patients. The capability for personal self -care was also raised, and associated with this the concern that the p roposal is removing effective treatme nts and dietary supplements that are working for individuals therefore adversely affecting them . Others raised that conditions may be missed or they may worsen. There is a reduced understanding of the consequences of poor health and lifestyle choices. Need to consider the impact on carers who may not be able to buy items for those they care for or may not be allowed to administer OTC medication. Findings from the easy read survey show th at 92 of 107 respondents felt the restriction on prescriptions might affect some cohorts more than others. The groups participants felt would most likely to be affected include ; people on low income, disabled people (including those 9 with learning disabilities) a nd ill people, isolated people, those who are unable to access the right information and other groups such as; pregnant women, children, single parents and the elderly. A significant proportion of participants feel the changes will affect people with l earning disabilities negatively . However many people with learning disabilities also felt that with the right support from GPs, Pharmacists, other health professionals and carers alongside appropriate easy read information , they would be happy to self - care. CCGs: CCGs felt that this proposal adversely affects specific groups such as those who require considerable care (e.g. disabled, elderly) making it harder for this groups to access medication, people from low income and lower socioeconomic backgrounds as well as patients with long term and chronic conditions requirin g a large supply of prescribed OTC medication. Awareness that some from these groups have difficulty undertaking self -care and need to consider the impact on carers who may not be able to buy items for those they care for or may not be allowed to administe r OTC medication. Clinicians : Again there is concern about the impact of these proposals on specific groups including: those requiring considerable care (e.g. disabled, elderly) , with from a low income and lower socioeconomic background, people who cannot afford OTC medication or who don't pay of them currently (e.g. elderly, chronic illness ), patients from the BME community (who are more susceptible to vitamin D deficiency and have lower incomes) and those with long term conditions requiring a large supply of prescribed OTC medication. Concerns that this may impact individuals' ability to work and provide for their family. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Similar to other respondents key groups were identified who the proposal adversely affects including: those who require considerable care (e.g. disabled, elderly) , low income/ lower socioeconomic groups, those who may not want to pay/be able to afford the m (e.g. elderly, chronic illness), people with long term/ chronic conditions who require a large supply of prescribed over the counter medication and also travel lers, homeless and asylum seekers . Concern that the p roposal is r emoving effective treatments and dietary supplements t hat are working for individuals, that there will be affordability issues for those requiring treatments and dietary supplements and there will be a r educed understanding of the consequences of poor health and lifestyle choices and there is recognition again of the l ack of personal capability to self -care for some people. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : These cohorts also mentioned the groups outline d by the other respondent types . Concerns focused on groups who would be disadvantaged and personally affected. The difficulty of individuals to pay for treatments and the possible inability to properly care for themselves if these medications are no long er available on prescription. It was felt that t he proposals will introduce additional charges for those with long -term conditions who have already purchased a prescription prepayment certificate to help manage the costs of their prescriptions . This cohort also mentioned that the p roposal is removing effective treatments & dietary supplements that are working for individuals therefore adversely affecting them . Concern about the impact on key groups including: disabled and elderly, those who limited incomes and lower socioeconomic backgrounds, BME communities will be disproportionately affected by the proposals , patients with long term and chronic conditions and t ravel lers, homeless and asylum seekers should be added to groups disproportionately affected by these proposals . If the proposal s were to go ahead, healthcare professionals are likely to be less aware of patient s complying with treatment s. Additionally, the key themes to emerge following review of correspondence from industr y, regulatory bodies and p rofessional organisations are that they feel there is a potential impact 10 on groups with low levels of health literacy. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGPs) Health Literacy Report (2014 ) was referenced and this found that health information is currently too complex for more than 60% of working age adults in England to understand. It was also raised that c onsideration must be given to the impact on rural populations . It was felt that p eople who currently qualify for free NHS prescriptions on the basis of a protected characteristic - through age (under 18 or over 60), disability or pregnancy, or medically exempted (for example, people with cancer or diabetes) could be disproportionately affected by this policy. People with a learning disability qualify for free prescriptions but also their family carers and social care workers. It was also stated that these patient groups are more likely than others to suffer from some of the conditions listed, and to suffer a number of them simultaneously, incr easing the health inequalities. It was felt that t he proposals do not make it clear how prescribers will make a clinical and financial assessment of patients on low income households. The breadth of scope of the proposals could lead to variation in approac h and practice. A smaller range of conditions would limit the impact on low income households. This cohort also believed that there is a national issue when it comes to care homes that refuse to administer unlabelled medicine - that is, OTC products. Scho ol medicines policies and care home policies would need to be reviewed to implement this guidance. These organisations raised concerns about unintended consequences need to be considered and mitigated , particularly around access to GPs. Figure 3 Do you feel there is any further evidence we should consider in our proposals on the potential impact on health inequalities experienc ed by certain groups ? Percentage Yes 30% No 50% Unsure 20% Base: 2,555 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. There was broad agreement in the points raised by all of the respondent groups including: p atients , members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients , CCGs, Clinicians , Patient representative organisations voluntary charities and o ther NHS organisations / NHS provide r organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator : A set of themes focused on financial issues including: t he impact on those on low income/ lower socioeconomic background and their ability to purchase the medication they or their families need ; concerns some cohorts may not want to pay/be able to afford them (e.g. elderly, chronic illness) if they don't pay for them currently ; impact on those with low income - may lead to increase in shop lifting/ stealing OTC medications; Other themes were raised again about the impact on specific groups: those who require considerable care (e.g. disabled, elderly) ; patients with long term/ chronic conditions who require a large supply of prescrib ed over the counter medication; impact on h ealth inequalities experienced by certain groups ; 11 Access to medication was also raised: v olumes limited by retailers ; harder for some to access treatment (e.g. elderly, disabled, rural residents, and those with limited transport options) ; removal of effect ive treatments and dietary supplements that are w orking for individuals and adversely affecting them ; implications for patients following the removal of treatments which have limited alternatives ; patients with learning difficulties who won't understand th e restrictions being placed on their medication ; Comments in support of the proposal mentioned: p roposal ensures better use of limited NHS resource (e.g. budget) ; individuals need to take responsibility for their own health by leading more healthy lifesty les, appreciation that the proposal is a requirement to make cost savings to support the NHS . Concern over patients' health: la ck of personal capability to self -care; patients are not clinicians and cannot be expected to kno w if condition is self -limiting; suggestion to consider funding a nationally agreed minor ailments service led by pharmacies and include treating conditions which would o therwise require a prescription; c onsider the long -term implications on the NHS if patients stop taking their medicati on because they can't afford them . 4 Proposals for CCG commissioning guidance Findings from the consultation survey Figure 4 Do you agree with the three proposed categories for [items] or [conditions] as follows: Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base An item of low clinical effectiveness, where there is a lack of robust evidence for clinical effectiveness 81% 7% 8% 4% 2606 A condition that is self -limiting and does not require medical advice or treatment as it will clear up on its own 81% 6% 11% 3% 2600 A condition that is a minor illness and is suitable for self - care and treatment with items that can easily be purchased over the counter from a pharmacy 72% 6% 17% 5% 2603 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients and m embers of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients : Need to c onsider th e impact on those on low income and lower socio economic groups and ability to pay for medication, unintended consequences of n ot treating/ treati ng conditions inappropriately, agreement is dependent on the cost of treatment ; blanket appr oach may not be suitable for all; h ealthcare profe ssionals should provide advice and recommend appropriate over the counter medicines for the patients ; need to consider effectiveness of treatment by consulting all of the evidence not just clinical re search (speaking with patients and measuring patient outcomes) . Proposal ensures better use of limited NHS resource (e.g. budget) ; only treatments with evidence of effectiven ess should be prescribed and Agreement that minor illnesses/ self - limiting conditions do not require appointments/ prescriptions and can be purchased over the counter Disconnect between minor illnesses and self -care treatments (not all self -care conditions are minor illnesses - e.g. coeliac disease, Rheumatic Polymyalgia which are just 2 examples of complex conditions that are mainly treated/ managed by the patient through self -care) . 12 Findings from the easy read survey show the idea of prescriptions being s topped for 33 common illnesses was received with mixed views. Whilst some responded positively, many expressed their rejection clari fying that if implemented this should take into account the situatio n or individuals ' needs. CCGs: Concern that not treating or treating conditions inappropriately could res ult in unintended consequences and complications (e.g. spread of infection) ; consider impact on low income and lower socioeconomic backgrounds and the wider economic impacts on patients (e.g. time off sick from work) . Proposal ensures better use of limited NHS resource (e.g. budget) but these change s are against NHS Constitution and the aim to reduce health inequalities and care provided free at the point of care to all. Consider eff ectiveness of treatment by consulting all of the evidence not just clinical research (speaking with patients, measuring patient outcomes) . Greater impetus on pharmacies to provide clear guidance and instructions ; need for b etter referral paths to alternati ve treatments could be effective and decrease doctor consultations (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) ; should be h ealthcare professionals to provide advice and recommend approp riate OTC medications for the patients and need for p ublic education around purchasi ng treatments . Clinicians : Need to c onsider the impact on those on low income groups and ability to pay for medication, dependent on the cost of treatment , proposal ensures better use of limited NHS resource (e.g. budget) ; only treatments with evidence of effectiveness should be prescribed ; not treating or treating conditions inappropriately could result in unintended consequences and complica tions; c onsider impact on other vulnerable groups and their ability to access treatments . Public education around purchasing treatments ; healthcare prof essionals should provide advice and recomme nd appropriate OTC medicines for the patients ; queries and disagreement with language/ terminology used in the guidance and c onsider effectiveness of treatment by consulting a ll of the evid ence not just clinical research. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities : Consider the impact on low income groups, a blanket approach is not suitable for all, not treating or treating conditions inappropri ately could result in unintended con sequences and complications, c oncern for those with long standing issues who may require a constant supply of OTC medication, agreement dependent on the cost of treatment , only treatments with evidence of effectiveness s hould be prescribed , consider impact on other vulnerable groups (e.g. asylum seekers, children, homeless) , proposal ensures bet ter use of limited NHS resource, p ublic education around purchasing treatments . Consider effectiveness of treatment by consulting all of the evidence not just clinical research (speaking with patients, measuring patient outcomes) , self-medication without appropriate medical advice from a healthcare professional could be dangerous , early intervention key in treating conditions , healthcare professionals should provide advice/ recommend appropriate over the counter medicines for the patients . Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Proposal ensures better use of li mited NHS resource, need for public education around purchasing treatments , greater impetus on pharmacies to provide clear guidance and instructions , queries/ and disagreement with language/ terminology used in the guidance, c onsider wid er economic impacts on patients, p roposal will make it more difficult to obtain appropriate treatments to treat conditions , changes are against NHS Constitution . The Royal College of Physicians (RCP), Dermatology Council for England and the British Dermatological Nursing Gro up all endorse the response submitted by the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) which provided recommendations for the dermatology related conditions in the proposals . 13 A number of organisations raised concerns about the implications for the NHS Constitution and raised issues with NHS Act's aim to reduce health inequalities. Some industry bodies felt that i n some instances, the proposed restrictions appear to go against NICE Public Health Guideline s. Some c oncerns were raised that t he consult ation is inconsistent in advocating restrictions specifically on OTC treatments, while intending to focus on conditions not products. Where conditions are genuinely suitable for self -care and can be managed without a prescribed product, this should be true for any classification of medicine Additionally, concerns were raised about the implications for the GMS legislation. This issue was raised by the British Medical Association (BMA) . They felt that i ndividual GPs c ould be put under undue pressure, includin g the prospect of a complaint and possible financial redress as a result of these proposals. The RCGP agree d with the BMA that this can be mitigated by changes in the wording of the GMS contract. Suggested r ecommendations for implementation The scope of guidance could be narrowed to prioritis e conditions in order of largest spend, while excluding those with clinical concerns. Some practical issues that will arise when implementing this guidance may have already been addressed in some CCG area s, where similar prescribing policies have been implemented. NHS England and NHSCC should identify local learning which could inform the development of support for all CCGs implementing this national commissioning guidance. There should be a comprehensive implementation plan, adequately resourced and developed with the full involvement of community pharmacy. Community pharmacies must have adequate notice of changes to prescribing so that changes to stock medicines can be made . The guidance needs to recogni se that GPs are not the only prescribers in primary care and that prescribing policies are applied universally . NHS England needs to revisit the proposals where there are evidence -based, national guidelines in support of certain treatments . Consideration m ust be given to the level of knowledge that GPs have in relation to product licensing and the conditions of sale for certain items, and how this can be improved . A definitive list of medications that are not authorised would be imperative to support GPs in implementing what is being proposed. A 'blacklist' of medications would support GPs in respect of their contractual obligations and avoid challenges to their decisions from patients . NHS England and NHSCC should consult with the Advisory Committee for Bor derline Substances in determining exactly how the prescribing restrictions might apply in practice. GPs should be trusted and supported to work within the spirit of the guidance, rather than given detailed didactic prescriptive mandates from commissioners. It would be reasonable for a prompt to be displayed if a certain drug was entered into the prescribing system, however it would not be acceptable if this made it difficult or impossible to prescribe . The NHS needs to ensure that effective si gnposting is in place to support patients to find the cheapest price for over the counter medication . There needs to be a national self -care campaign that involves all health and social care providers and commissioners across the STP geography. Public education and communication are imperative to informing people which conditions are considered as minor ailments suitable for self -care. Self -care will be a cultural change for the majority of patients The National Pharmacy Association suggests that a Nati onally Advanced Minor Ailment Service (MAS), delivered through community pharmacy, could be set up to support . It was stated that evaluat ion of the effectiveness , particularly on how to monitor the impact on patients and workload for all healthcare profe ssionals. 14 It was suggested that t he guidance should also give clarity on how often guidance will be reviewed and by whom. It should also describe how patients and patient organisations will participate in this process. Given that new research is being pub lished, regular reviews of the exemption and ACBS list are recommended, involving a wide range of stakeholders. 5 General exceptions Figure 5 Do you agree with the general exceptions proposed?

Patients and m embers of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients : Clinician s should decide as they know the patient and their circumstance. Need to c onsider : the inclusion of other vulnerable groups and their ability to self -care; the impact on low income an d lower socioeconomic; g reater robustness in the guidance/ proposal to cover all aspects . Clearer definitions and guidance on assessment criteria as judgement can be subjective and can lead to inequity/ different interpret ations. People with long term cond itions should not be disadvantaged ; concern some cohorts may not want to pay or be able to afford them if they d on't pay for them currently; c learer definitions and guidance required on what consti tutes exceptional circumstances; p roposal places greater im petus on healthcare professionals to evaluate which patients fit into exceptio n criteria and which do not. CCGs: Need for clearer definitions and guidance on assessment criteria as judgement can be subj ective and can lead to inequity and different interpr etations. Consider inclus ion of other vulnerable groups. Consideration of those who cannot self -care and treatments should be based on the clinical need of the patient. Findings from the easy read survey show participants feel those who are most likely to be affected by this guidance should be exempt (gro ups have been outlined in the health inequalities section above Clinicians : Greater robustness in the guidance and proposal to cover all aspects. Agree with the general exceptions proposed. Clinician s shou ld decide as they know the pati ent and their 15 circumstances and treatments should be based on the clinical need of the patient. Indeed, some treatments are only available on prescription. There should be robust policies to ensure vulnerable patients have ad equate access. Need for c learer definitions and guidance on what constitute s exceptional circumstances . Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Clinician should decide as they know the patient and their circumstanc es. Need for clearer definitions and guidance on assessment criteria as judgement can be subjective and can lead to inequity and different interpretations. Treatments should be based on the clinical need of the patient . Need to ensure that if no medication is prescribed that patients are offered advice/ alternative opti ons to help treat the issue. People with long term conditions should not be disadvantaged as well as groups who cannot afford or want to pay or those with low incomes or from lower socioecono mic backgrounds. There should be r obust policies to ensure vulnerable patients have adequate access to treatment s. Need to c onsider inclusion of other vulnerable groups especially those unable to self-care. Potential for inconsistencies if healthcare profe ssionals take additional factors into consideration. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : People with long term conditions should not be disadvantaged (e.g. patients with eczema, b ack pain) as well as groups who cannot afford OTC medication (e.g. eld erly, chronic illness) and those on low income s and therefore need to consider impact on ot her vulnerable groups (e.g. elderly, care/residential home patients, low income families, child ren, mental capacity, homeless). Clearer definitions and clearer guidance required on what constitutes exceptional circumstances . Figure 6 should we include any other patient groups in the general exceptions? - Do you feel we should include any other patient groups in the general exceptions? Percentage Yes 24% No 45% Unsure 30% Base: 2574 For a breakdo wn of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Patients state a number of cohorts who should be exempt, including; t hose on l ow income/ lower socioeconomic background who may not be able to purchase the medication they, or their families need , those with long term or multiple conditions , elderly patients or those who qualify for a pension , patients with a disability , those with other illnesses (e.g. cancer, life limiting illnesses, degenerative condit ions, Parkinson's disease , etc. ), children under 18 years of age , those with mental health illnesses and those where access to treatment will prevent further complications . This cohort also feel s the decision around general exceptions should be left to the clinician. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: In response, this group feels a one size fits all approach won't necessarily work and suggest a more individuali sed approach and the decision s around exceptions should be le ft to the clinician. This cohort feel those on l ow income/ lower socioeconomic background who may not be able to purchase the medication they, or their families need , children under 18 years of age , those 16 with long term conditions , elderly patients or those who qualify for a pension and patient s with other illnesses. should also be included in the general exceptions. CCGs: Other groups to include in the general exceptions include; those on l ow income/ lower socioeconomic background who may not be able to purchase the medication they, or their families need , care/ nursing home patients , children under 18 years of age , those exemp t from paying for prescriptions or eligible for free prescriptions , those with long term conditions and t hose considered vulnerable patients/ groups . Clinicians: Other patient groups to include in the general exceptions mentioned by clinicians include; those on l ow income/ lower socioeconomic background who may not be able to purchase the medication they, or their families n eed, children under 18 years of age , patients who have had bariatric surgery/ gastric bypass , elderly patients or those who qualify for a pension , those considered vulnerable patients/ groups and patients with other illnesses such as cancer, life limiting conditions, degenerative conditions, Dementia, etc. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: This cohort suggest those on l ow income/ lower socioeconomic background who may not be able to purchase the medication they, or their families need , elderly patients/ those who qualify for a pension , patients with other illnesses / conditions) , those where access to treatment will prevent further complications , patients with a disability and all patients with learning disabilities should also be included in the general exception s. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : This cohort suggests a number of patient groups that should be included in the general exce ptions , such as ; those on l ow income/ lower socioeconomic background who may not be able to purchase the medication they, or their families need , those with long term conditions , patients with other some other illnesses , those considered vulnerable patient s/ groups , those exempt from paying for prescriptions/eligible for free prescriptions , elderly patients/ those who qualify for a pension , those where access to treatment will prevent further complications , those with multiple conditions or require monitoring for specific reasons and c arers . If not clearly defined, general exceptions could lead to patient complaints or deterioration in the doctor/patient relationship. Concerns that t here is a risk that the public may start buying all their OTC medic ines from a supermarket shelf unless specifically directed to a pharmacy, which could mean red flag symptoms are ignored until it is too late. This could lead to unsupported self -care and late diagnosis with catastrophic consequences for the individual and increased NHS costs. Other: This cohort also suggests those on l ow income/ lower socioeconomic background who may not be able to purchase the medication they, or their families need , elderly patients/ those who qualify for a pension and c hildren less than 18 years of age should be included in the general exceptions. 6 Drugs with limited evidence of clinical effectiveness 6.1 Key category -wide t hemes Overall, 826 written comments were received from the online survey on drugs with limited evidence of clinical effectiveness. The section below presents the themes raised in the online survey, correspondence, webinars and meetings around th is category. Patients: Assessments should be made on individual patient's needs. C oncern that some cohorts such as ; elderly and those with a chronic illness may not want ( or be able ) to pay if they don't currently. H ow is the effectiveness of treatments determined? Items are readily available and cheap as OTC medicines. Public must take responsibility for their health and not solely rely on NHS. Some agreed that benefits are negligible and they should not be prescribed on NHS. 17 Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Benefits negligible and items should not be prescribed on NHS. Advice s heets on healthy diet and healthcare professionals ' advice on which OTC treatments to use would be most beneficial. Assessments of individual patients' n eeds are required. I tems are cheaply obtained OTC and the impact on vulnerable groups (such as those on low income, high risk groups, BME, elderly) must be considered. CCGs: Need to consider the impact on vulnerable groups (e.g. low income, lower socio - economic background, high risk groups, BME, elderly). Patients could be offered advice sheets about getting what they nee d from a healthy diet and a HCP could provide advice/ suggestions on which OTC treatments would be most beneficial. Clinicians: Remove tr eatments from the list of medications that can be prescribed. Benefits are negligible and they should not be prescribed on NHS. Make a ssessme nts of the individual patient' s needs. Items are available and fairly cheap OTC. Must consider impact on vulnerable groups - especially those who may not want to pay or be able to pay. HCPs could provide advice/ suggestions. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Items are readily available and cheap OTC. B lacklist/remove treatments from list of medi cations prescribed by the NHS. C onsider impact on vulnerable groups and concern about their willing ness and ability to pay. H ow is the effectiveness of treatments determined? The benefits are negligible. The p ublic need to take responsibility for their own health and not expect the NHS to p rovide. HCPs should signpost patients and every patient should have the choice. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Public need to take responsibility for their own health and not expect the NHS to provide everything. Consider impact on vulnerable groups and cohorts who may not wa nt to pay/be able to afford it. Analysis of the correspondence shows several organisations have commented that, with respect to any licensed medicine, of any legal category, the clinical effectiveness (relative to safety) will already have been determined by the expert body responsible for such assessments, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The guidance should provide clarity on what constitutes 'low value' in relation to vitamin s, mineral s or probiotic s. The consultation document does not specify how much and what kind of evidence is necessary for a vitamin, mineral or probiotic to be deemed of value. Other: These t reatments should never be prescribed. R emove these treatments from the list of medications that can be p rescribed by the NHS as the benefits are negligible. I tems are readily an d fairly cheaply obtained O TC. C onsid er impact on vulnerable groups. E very patie nt should be given the choice. S ome cohorts may not want to pay/be able to pay. H ow is the effec tiveness of these treatments determined? P atients could be offered advice sheets about getting what they ne ed from a healthy diet. Restricting OTC medicines because of cost to NHS could be unfair on vulnerable groups . 6.2 Probiotics There were 2,579 responses to the closed question. The m ajority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations. Figure 7 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that probiotics should not be routinely prescribed in primary care due to limited evidence of clin ical effectiveness? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base 18 Percentage 82% 8% 7% 3% 2,579 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Probiotics should be available as a trial if all other measures have failed or if it is suggested by a specialist. E xceptions need to be observed for some vulnerab le/at risk patient groups. Probiotics are ver y beneficial for patients with irritable bowel s yndrome (IBS) , particularly after a flare up. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Probiotics should be available as a trial if all other measures have failed or if it is suggested by a specialist and the evidence of probiotic use in the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances ( ACBS ) should be considered. Support for the proposal that treatment should not be prescribed. CCGs: Just because a treatment can be prescribed, it doesn't mean it should be prescribed on the NHS. Howev er, probiotics are very beneficial for patients with IBS, particularly after a flare up. Clinicians: Just becaus e a treatment can be prescribed, it does not mean it should be available on the NHS. Probiotics are beneficial for patients with IBS, particularly after a flare up. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Autism often results in gut issues a nd probiotics can be valuable. P robiotics are beneficial for patien ts with IBS particularly after a flare up. Consider the evidence for probiotic use in ACBS. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional repres entative bodies / regulator / industry : Consider the evidence for probiotic use in ACBS . Analysis of correspondences from this cohort shows this should be dealt with by inclusion in the blacklist of drugs unavailable for NHS provision. Probiotics included in the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) should not be restricted. Other: Consider the evid ence in probiotic use in ACBS. J ust becaus e a treatment can be prescribed, it does not mean that it should be available on the NHS. E xceptions need to be observed for some vulnera ble/at risk patient groups (for example, following a course of antibiotics). 19 6.3 Vitamins and m inerals There were 2,590 responses to the closed question. The m ajority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations. Figure 8 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that vitamins and minerals should not be routinely prescribed in primary care due to limited evidence of clinical effectiveness? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 72% 7% 16% 4% 2,590 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Recommendations should not apply to v itamin C, vitamin D and iron due to effecti veness for some conditions (such as wound healing, o steoporosis) and some patients should be exempt (including alcoholics, bariatric pa tients and some pregnant women).T reatment should be prescribed where deficienc y is clinically proven. HCP input is required to ensure patients are not harmed and potentially cost the NHS mor e through later interventions. HCPs are required to ensure patient safety. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients : Vitamins and minerals should be p rescribed where deficien cy has been clinically proven. Recommendations should not apply to v itamins C, D, B12, iron or calcium replacement due to their effectiv eness for some conditions (such as wound healing, o steoporosi s, and post parathyroidectomy) a nd some groups should be exempt (bariatric patients, pregnant women, babies a nd young children, BME groups and alcoholics). A healthy diet alone does not provide all the vitamins and minerals needed by some p atients. HCP input is required to ensure patients are not harmed and potentially cost the NHS more through later interventions. CCGs: This should not apply to effec tive vitamins such as C and D. S ome gro ups should be excluded such as bariatric patients, pregnant women and alcoholics and treatments should be prescribed where deficiency has been clinically proven. Clinicians: Don't agree that this applies to Vitamins C, D and B12 due to their effe ctiveness for some conditi ons. So me patient groups should be exempt from r ecommendations. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: This s hould not apply to v itamins C and D due effectiveness and some groups should be excluded where deficiency has been clinically proven. HCPs should advise pati ents to ensure there are no contra indications between medicines. A healthy diet does not provide all the vitamins and minerals required by some patients and additional support to obtain nutrients is required. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organis ations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Exempt some groups (due to need) and some vitamins due to their effectiveness ( vitamins C, D, B12, iron and calcium ). Supplements should be prescribed where deficienc y has been clinically p roven. N o mention in \"exceptions\" for folic acid users . HCP input is needed to ensure patient safety. This group also state this should be dealt with by inclusion in the blacklist of drugs unavailable for NHS provision. It should be amended to include only oral medications. Suggested a dditional exceptions where prescribing should be allowed to include (based on scientific evidence, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and British Society of Gastroenterology [BSG] Guidelines) . 20 Other: Exempt some groups. Prescribe supplements where deficiency is clinically proven. Some vitamins should be excluded because of ef fectiveness. C onsider impact on BME people, where there may be a strong case fo r prescribing certain vitamins and minerals to maintain good health. OTC vitamins and minerals are less effective and/or strong. I nput fr om HCPs is required to ensure patients patient safety and avoid costs later on. 7 Conditions considered self-limiting that do not require medical advice or treatment 7.1 Key category -wide t hemes Overall, 822 written comments were received from the online survey on conditi ons considered self -limiting that do not require medical advice or treatment. The section below presents the themes raised in the online survey, correspondence, webinars and meetings around this category. Patients: The proposal may lead to serious conditions being overlooked and treatment delayed. Should restrict the prescription of tre atments for minor ailments , such ; as cold sores . A blanket approac h is inappropriat e for self -limiting conditions. Patients need advice from HCPs. A p ublic education campaign would be needed to explain the self -limiting conditions and how to treat them. R eferral must be made to app ropriate healthcare professionals if improvements don't happen in the expected timeframe. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: The proposal should restrict prescriptions for minor ailments. A ppropriate advice from HCPs is needed. HCPs should establish the severity of cond ition and length of treatment. The p roposal may lead to serious conditions being ove rlooked or delay in treatment. A public education campaign must explain the self -limiting con ditions and how to treat the m. C hildren should receive trea tment on prescription. Some groups may not want ( or be abl e) to pay (for example the elderly, people with chronic illness). CCGs: Restrict prescriptions for treatments for minor ailments except for c hildre n. A blanket approac h is inappropriate for self -limitin g conditions. The proposal will make c ost savings to support the NHS. OTC medications have some restrictions, for example, the patient's age/ the product licens e/ area to be treated . Clinicians: Restrict prescriptions for treatments for mino r ailments. HCPs should advise patients and establish severity of con dition and length of treatment. S ome groups may not want to pay or be able to. HCPs must provide appropriate advic e. A public education campaign should explain the self-limiting co nditions and how to treat them. CCGs should support pre scribers, not just advise them. P atients should be referred to appropriate HCPs for advice if conditions do not improve in expected timeframe. Patient representative organisations / vo luntary organisations or charities: Ensure patients have appropriate adv ice from HCPs. S ome cohorts may n ot want to pay/be able to pay. Prescriptions for some treatments should be restricted. S erious conditions could be overlooked and treatment delayed . HCPs should establish severity of condition and treatment timeframe , and provide advice if conditions don't improve as expected. There could be adverse effects on patients costing the NHS more in the long run. A blanket approach is inappropriate for self-limiting conditions. E nsure access to additional support service s/ healthcare professionals (including baby clinics, com munity nurses, and health visitors). The proposed changes are contrary to the NHS Constitution/ GPs ' duty of care/ NHS Act's aim to reduce health inequalities. N eed further evidence to ensure not treating these self -limitin g conditions will not lead to more serious health conditions. A public education campaign is needed to explain the self -limiting conditions and how to treat them . Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : HCPs should advise on severity of cond ition and length of 21 treatment. A blanket approach is not appropriate for self -limiting conditions. C hildren sho uld receive treatment on prescription. S elf-limiting conditions can be side effects of serious illnesses and their treatment. Also, patients should not be discouraged from seeking treatment and this criterion should be rephrased. Measures are needed to imp rove health literacy to boost patients' ability to self - care and reduce the numbers engaging with GPs and other NHS services for support. If the guidance only restricts prescribing of OTC treatments then there is concern that acute sore throat, cough, cold and nasal congestion can lead to more prescribing of antibiotics; it is therefore recommended that the specific classification of medicines be removed from the guidance. Other: Agree with restrictions of prescriptions for treatment of minor ailments. C onsider impact on lower income / socioeconomic background and their ability to pay for medication. Ensure patients are provided with appropriate ad vice by HCPs. The proposal may lead to serious conditions being ov erlooked or treatment delayed. T reatments for self-limiting conditions should only be prescribed if condition does not resolve within expected timeframe . Some conditions require treatment w ith medication unav ailable OTC. A p ublic education campaign should explain the self -limiting conditions and how to treat them . Remove some treatments from the list of medications that can be prescribed by the NHS 22 7.2 Acute sore t hroat There were 2,594 responses to the closed question. The m ajority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs a nd patient representative/ voluntary organisations. Figure 9 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of acute sore throat should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 76% 8% 13% 4% 2,594 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Some forms of acute sore throat require further investigation and /or prescribed medication (such as those due to bacterial infection requiring a ntibiotics). Serious conditions may be overlo oked or treatment delayed (for example strep throat, quinsy, throat cancer). Access is needed to advice from HCPs. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Some forms of acute sore throat require further investigation an d / or prescribed medication. S erious conditions may be overlooked or treatment delayed. P atients should have acc ess to appropriate advice from HCPs . Clinicians: Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatme nt delayed. S ome forms of acute sore throat require further investigation a nd / or prescribed medication. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organ isations or charities: No response provided regarding sore throat. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry: This should be dealt with by inclusion in the blacklist of drugs. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC) feels that this condition would be better placed in the suitable for self -care category. Other: Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatmen t delayed. S ome forms of acute sore throat require further investigation and / or prescribed medication. Appropriate advice is needed from HCPs when diagnosing and if the condition does not resolve within an expected timeframe. R emove these treatments from the list of medications that can be prescri bed by the NHS (for example, throat pastilles). 7.3 Cold sores There were 2,584 responses to the closed question . The m ajority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations. Figure 10 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of cold sores should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 78% 7% 12% 3% 2,584 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix 23 Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients and members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Cold sores require pr oper assessment and treatment. M ost effective treatments may only b e available on prescription ( such as Acyc lovir). Clinicians: Cold sores require pr oper assessment and treatment. The m ost effective treatments may only be available on prescr iption. A t risk patients may need t o be prescribed treatment (including those with reduced immune system/ pregn ant). Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Access to advice from HCP s is needed . Other NHS organisations / esentative bodies / regulator/ i ndustry : This is a loose term and does not equate to herpes simplex infection. Suggest it should be reworded Concerns that h erpes simplex can cause significant morbidity and psychological distress . A special case should be made for people with atopic eczema and oth er skin diseases with a skin barrier dysfunction, which may require oral therapy for treatment and prevention. Discouraging patients from consulting for advice may mean that eczema herpeticum, a medical emergency that can be fatal in infants, is missed or diagnosed late. Other: At risk patients may need prescribed t reatment. C old sores can be quite serious and require proper assessment and treatment. 7.4 Conjunctivitis There were 2,577 responses to the closed question . The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 11 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of conjunctivitis should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 61% 10% 24% 5% 2,577 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: This is a serious and contagious condition requiring proper assessment and treatm ent. S erious conditions may be overlooked or tr eatment delayed. C hildren may be excluded from schools or nurseries because conjunctivitis is contagious and conjunctivitis has age restr ictions for chloramphenicol use. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: This is a serious and contagious condition requiring pr oper assessment and treatment. S erious conditions may be overlooked or trea tment delayed. C hildre n require extra care and should be prescribed treatment. CCGs: Children may be excluded from schools or nurseries because conjunctivitis is contagious and conjunctivitis has age restrictions for chloramphenicol use. One CCG noted that over half of all cas es of conjunctivitis do not clear up on their own and require treatment and children under two cannot be gi ven OTC antibiotic drops. 24 Clinicians: A serious and contagious condition requiring proper assessment and treatment. Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatment delayed. C hildren attending schools or nurseries may be excluded as conjunctivitis is contagious. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Serious conditions may be overlooked or trea tment delayed . Referral must be made to appropriate HCPs if conditions do not improve in expected timeframe. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies/ r egulator / industry : A serious and contagious condition requiring pr oper assessment and treatment. S erious conditions may be overlooked or tre atment delayed. Children attending schools or nurseries may be excluded as conjunctivitis is contagious. Children require extra care and should be prescrib ed treatment. HCPs should signpost patients to useful information. C onjunctivitis has age restrictions for chloramphenicol use . There are concerns that schools/nurseries will not allow children to attend if treatment is not prescribed or administered, due to high risk of contagion. Other: A serious and contagious condition requiring proper assessment and treatment. Serious conditions may be overlooked or trea tment delayed. C hildren attending schools or nurseries may be excluded as co njunctivitis is contagious. A dverse effects on pa tients could cost the NHS more in the long run if not treated quickly. 7.5 Coughs, colds and n asal congestion There were 2,592 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 12 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of coughs, colds and nasal congestion should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 83% 6% 8% 2% 2,592 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients and m embers of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: The proposal may lead to serious conditions being ov erlooked or treatment delayed. A blanket approach is inappropriate for self -limiting conditions and depends on the cause of the condit ion. Access to a HCP is necessary to understand severity of condition and treatment timeframe. Clinicians: Ensure patients can access advice from healthcare professionals. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: The proposal may lead to serious conditions being overlooked or treatment delayed . Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies/ regulator / industry : Coughs and nasal congestion should be clarified to include only acute symptoms due to uncomplicated infection. The PSNC feels that nasal congestion should be a separate category as some treatments can relieve symptoms of sinus pain. Other: Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatment delayed . 7.6 Cradle cap (seborrhoeic d ermatitis) 25 There were 2,583 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 13 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of cradle cap should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for tr eatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 72% 10% 12% 6% 2,583 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Ensure access to add itional HCPs (including baby clinics, community nurses, and health visitors). Clinicians: This c an be a serious condition and requires proper assessment and treatment; cradle cap is often accompanied by infection flexural seborrheic eczema where whole body emollients are beneficial and can last several months. If neglected it tends to deteriorate. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Ensure access to HCPs (such as baby clinics, community nurses, health visitors). Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Cradle cap can be quite serious and require s proper assessment and t reatment. Suggested that i t should be reworded as 'mild cradle cap resolving within four weeks'. Both eczema and psoriasis in infants can present with scaling and erythema of the scalp and early treatment of this can prevent deterioration including secondary infection. With both an initial diagnosis and advice from their health visitor or pharmacist , patients who can afford to pay for such treatment could reasonably care for their baby themselves. However, if the condition persists for more than a month they ought to seek medical advice, and possible alternative treatment, from their GP Seborrhoeic dermatitis in infants can also affect other parts of the body, which require expert differential diagnosis Other: Ensure access to HCPs 7.7 Haemorrhoids There were 2,586 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 14 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to: advise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of haemorrhoids should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 63% 11% 20% 6% 2,586 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix 26 Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Serious conditions may be over looked or treatment delayed (for example, rectal bleeding, cancer, and chlamydia ). Most effective treatments may only be available on prescription. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatment delay ed. Patients must be provided with appropriate ad vice from HCPs and be able to obtain further advice if conditions do not imp rove within expected timeframe. Haemorrhoids can be serious and require proper assessment and treatment. Clinicia ns: Serious conditions may be over looked or treatment delayed. H aemorrhoids can be quite serious and require proper assessment and treatment. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatmen t delayed. Patients should be referred to healthcare professionals if conditions do not improve in expected timeframe. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : While it is acceptable for patients with an established diagnosis of uncomplicated haemorrhoids to purchase OTC products for symptomatic relief, undiagnosed patients benefit from a clinician review. Haemorrhoids can worsen with time, neglect and/or inappropriate trea tment. Some patients may need to have surgery (such as injections, banding, excision) so it is essential that they are allowed access to their prescriber for review and ongoing prescription. Other: Serious conditions may be overlooked or treat ment delayed. 7.8 Infant c olic There were 2,587 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 15 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescrip tion for treatment of infant colic should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 64% 11% 18% 7% 2,587 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Ensure access to and advi ce from HCPs (for example, baby clinics, community nurses, health visitors) . Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Ensure patients are provided with appropriate advi ce from HCPs. Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatment delayed. C hildren require extra care and should be prescribed treatment. Clinicians: Ensure patients are provided with appropriate advic e from HCPs. S erious conditions could be overlooked or treatment delay ed. C hildren require extra care and should be prescribed treatment. 27 Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Ensure patients are provided with appropriate advic e from HCPs. S erious condi tions could be overlooked or treatment delay ed. C hildren require extra care and should be prescribed treatment. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Children require extra care and should be prescribed treatment . It was suggested that t his should be dealt with by inclusion in the blacklist of drugs unavailable for NHS provision and that where nutritional products are required for infant feeding problems, alternative routes of supply should be provided that don't require a prescription and can be authorised by the recommending health care professional. 7.9 Mild c ystitis There were 2,591 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 16 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of mild cystitis should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 65% 13% 17% 6% 2,591 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Serious conditions may be overlo oked or treatment delayed (for example, cystitis can damage kidneys if not treated). Clearer definitions are required - what is mild cystitis and when d oes it change to moderate? C onditions may only be treated effectively with prescribed and not O TC medication. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients : Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatmen t delayed. Ensure patient access to advice from HCPs. Cystitis is more common in women than men. CCGs: Ensure patient access to advice by HCPs. Clinicians: Remove treatments from list s of medications that ca n be prescribed by the NHS (such as cystitis sachets) . Clearer definitions are required - what is mild cystitis and when does it become moderate? Referral to healthcare professionals for medical advice if condition does not improve in expected timeframe. HCPs should signpost pati ents to useful information. C ystitis is mor e common in women than men. C onditions may only be treated effecti vely with prescribed medication. Patient representati ve organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Serious conditions may be overl ooked or treatment delayed. C onditions may only be treated effectively with prescribed ( not OTC ) medication . Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / prof essional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Remove treatments from the list of medications that can be prescribe d by the NHS. Define mild cystitis clearly. Refe rral to HCPs for medical advice is needed if condition does not improve in the expecte d time frame. Serious conditions may be overlooked or treatment delayed. 28 BMA disagrees with the statement that the condition is always self-limiting and will clear up on its own . . The guidance should be clear that this refers to women only and should explicitly exclude the treatment of cystitis in men . This cohort also feel c learer definitions are required: what is mild cyst itis? S erious conditions may be overlooked or treatment delayed. 8 Conditions considered minor illnesses and suitable for self-care 8.1 Key category -wide t hemes Overall, 948 written comments were received from the online survey on conditions considered minor illnesses and suitable for self -care. The section below presents the themes raised in the online survey, correspondence, webinars an d meetings around this category. Patients: Treatments for minor ailments shouldn't be prescribed or only available when a condition hasn't reso lved within expected timeframe. I f no prescription, patients are offered advice/ alternative options to help treat condition. Some groups (such as those on low income/ lower socioeconomic background) may not be able to afford OTC medicines if they don't pay currently. Clear definitions and guidance are required on what const itutes severity of illness (such as min or, moderate, severe). The p roposal would ensure better use of limited NHS r esource. HCPs should see the patient and establish seriousness of the condition and length of treatment because self-diagnosed condition s can be a sy mptom of more serious illness. A public education campaign is necessary to explain the self -limiting con ditions and how to treat them. N ot treating or treating conditions inappropriately could result in unintended complications such as the spread of infection. A blanket approach is inappropriate for self -limiting conditions that can be quite serious and require proper assessment and treatment. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Some groups migh t not afford OTC medicatio n. Not treating or treating condi tions inappropriately could result in unintended comp lications. The p roposal adversely affects those who require considerable care (such as the disabled and the elderly). S elf-diagnosed condition s can be symptom s of more serious illness. Public education is needed to inform the public which conditions are considered as minor ail ments and how they should be treated C hildren should receive treatment on prescription . There must be a ccess to advice and/or alternative options to help treat the issue if no prescr iption. The p roposal ensures better use of limited NHS resources. T reatments for minor ailments sho uldn't be prescribed. CCGs: Prescriptions should only be provided for a minor ailment when the condition hasn't resol ved within expected timeframe. C onditions can be serious and require pr oper assessment and treatment. C onsider impa ct on demand for HCPs including pharmacists, pharmacy staff). The p roposal adversely affects children and we must be clear about what treatment is, and what symptom relief i s. Clinicians: Some cohorts may not want (or be able) to aff ord them if they don't pay for them currently. A p ublic education campaign should explain the self -limiting con ditions and how to treat them. C hildren should rece ive treatment on prescription. C learer definitions and guidance are required on what constitutes severity of illness . The public need signposting so they access the right service. I f there's no prescription patients must be offered advice and / or alternative option s to help treat the con dition. T he proposal ensures better u se of limited NHS resource. H ealthcare professionals should see the patient and establish seriousness of condition and length of treatment. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Ensure that , if no medication is prescribed , patients are offered advice and/or alternative o ptions to help treat the issue. Clear definitions and guidance are required on what constitutes severity of 29 illnes s. Some groups cannot afford OTC medication. Patients need access to HCPs to establish seriousness of cond ition and length of treatment. A s elf-diagnosed condition can be a symptom of more serious illness; not treating or treating conditions inappropriately could result in unintended consequences. A public education campaign is necessary to explain the self-limiting con ditions and how to treat them. C hildren should rec eive treatment on prescription. There must be adequate signposting for patients to access the right service (for example, a pharmacist) . The p roposal ensures bett er use of limited NHS resources. Prescriptions should only be offered for minor ai lments if the condition hasn't resol ved within expected timeframe. R emove treatments from the list of medications that can be prescribed by the NHS . Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Some groups may not be able to pay for OTC medicati on. Adequate signposting is needed to help the public access the right service . HCPs' advi ce is needed to establish seriousness of cond ition and length of treatment. A blanket approach is inappropriate for minor i llnesses suitable for self -care. Ensure that , if no medication is prescribed, patients are offered advice and/or alternative opt ions for treatment. A p ublic education campaign should explain the self -limiting c onditions and how to treat them. Children should rece ive treatment on prescription. C onside r the impact on the dem and for HCPs and queries and disagreement over terminology used in the guidance. From the correspondence, numerous responses support the self -care principles. However, conditions in which there is large interpatient variability, ones that can worsen or become chronic if left untreated, and ones that impact more vulnerable groups, should be removed. Other : Consider the impact on those on low income/ from lower socioeconomic background s and their ability to purchase the medication they, or their families , need . Ensure there is signposting to direct the public to the right service. S elf-diagnosed condition s can be symptom atic of more serious illness. I f no prescription is given patients should be offered advice and/or alternative options. The p roposal ensures better us e of limited NHS resources. Treatment s for minor ailments shouldn't be prescribed unless the condition hasn't resolved within its indicated time frame. R emove these treatments from the list of medic ations that can be prescribed. The p roposal adversely affects those who require considerable ca re (including the disabled and the elderly). C onsider funding a national minor ailments service to help treat conditions which would otherwise require a prescription . 8.2 Contact dermatitis There were 2,581responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 17 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatm ent of contact dermatitis should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self -care? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base Percentage 64% 9% 22% 5% 2,581 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients: Consider impact on patients who require s everal medications to control their condition (for example, the increased cost of medication) and those travelling patie nts needing to take medicine with them. OTC medication is too weak to relieve sym ptoms and deal with conditions. R eview restr ictions on OTC medications (for example, age/ license / area to be treated). There is a n eed for clearer definitions and guidance on severity of illness 30 (whether it is minor, moderate or severe). C ontact dermatitis can be serious and require medical assessment and treatment. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: OTC medication is too weak to relieve symp toms and deal with conditions. C onsider rest rictions on OTC medications (such as age/ license /area to be treated). Provide c learer d efinitions and guidance required on what co nstitutes severity of illness. A ll treatment options should be subject to the length of time patients have been experiencing symptoms. Clinicians: Only mild steroids are available OTC and stronger doses may be req uired. OTC medication is too weak to relieve symp toms and deal with conditions. C ontact dermatitis can be serious and require pro per assessment and treatment. The definition is too broad and needs to be more specific (for example irritant, contact allergy, eczema, psoriasis). The proposal ensures better use of limited NHS resource but it need s to consider restr ictions on OTC medications (such as age/ licens e/ area to be treated). Need for clearer definitions and guidance on what const itutes severity of illn ess. Treatment options should be subject to the length of time patients have been experiencing symptoms and need to consider impact (cost) on patients who require several medications to control condition. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisation s / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : OTC medication is too weak to relieve symptoms and deal with conditions. Again, contact dermatitis is too broad and the definition needs to be more specific. Cle arer definitions and guidance are required on what constitutes severity of illness. BAD advises this section be removed or changed to 'chapped hands' as the term is confusing. It could refer to allergic contact dermatitis or/and irritant contact dermatitis, which are common causes of wor k absenteeism with economic implications. Potential allergic contact dermatitis requires hospital referral for patch test investigation and if overlooked it has legal implications for patients, doctors and employers . Good management of dry skin -related con ditions demands frequent use of large quantities of emollient, as stated in 'cost effective prescribing of emollients' summary in the PrescQlPP bulletin. It also states that 'regular review of how the patient is getting along with their emollient would als o help improve patient compliance and ensure early detection of any issues or infections' These large quantities of emollients could be prohibitively expensive for those on low income . There is also confusion over the distinction between skin conditions. T he British Skin Foundation states that contact dermatitis and eczema are interchangeable terms . The ability of others (especially those unfamiliar or uncertain about their condition) to consult their GP and to receive appropriate treatment, irrespective of their ability to pay, should not be arbitrarily inhibited . Other: Mild steroids are available OTC and stronger doses need to be available. Need to consider restrictions on OTC medications and contact dermatitis is too broad a definition - it needs to be more specific. Must consider impact on patients who require several medications to control their condition s. 8.3 Dandruff There were 2,581 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations . Figure 18 Do you agr ee with the recommendation to a dvise CCGs to support prescribers in advising patients that a prescript ion for treatment of dandruff should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self -care? Agree Neither agree or disagree Disagree Unsure Base 31 Percentage 86% 5% 7% 2% 2,581 For a breakdown of the results by respondent type, please refer to the appendix Top themes by respondent type - below are the key themes raised in the online survey , correspondence, webinars and meetings. Patients and members of the public/ family members/ friends/ carers of patients : There is a need to differentiate between the different forms of the condition (e.g. minor, regular and chronic). CCGs , clinicians, patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations , Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : This cohort also mentions the ne ed to differentiate between the different forms of the condition (e.g. minor, regular and chronic). British Association of Dermatologists suggested the condition should be changed to 'mild scaling of the scalp without itching'. The term covers a broader range of treatable conditions. Most treatments for dandruff would not require a prescription. However, these prescriptions are also used for more serious skin cond itions that cause scalp scaling, such as seborrhei c dermatitis and scalp psoriasis. The ability of others (especially those unfamiliar or uncertain about their condition) to consult their GP and to receive appropriate treatment, irrespective of their abil ity to pay, should not be arbitrarily inhibited. 8.4 Diarrhoea (a dults) There were 2,577 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations .

Patients: Diarrhoea can be a symptom o f a more serious illness (such as b owel cancer, Crohn's disease, c olitis) and not treating or treating the condition inappropriately could result in unintended consequences (such as the spread of infection). Must co nsider impact of not treating on vulnerable groups (for example, the elderly) and on patients requiring a constant supply of OTC medication for longstanding conditions and issues. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Diarrhoea can be a symptom of more serious illness and not treating could lead to unintended consequences. People with longstanding issues may require OTC medication on a long -term basis. CCGs: Not treating or treating conditions inappropriately could result in unintended consequences and complicat ions. Clinicians: Diarrhoea can be a symptom of more serious illness and not treating it, or treating it inappropriately , could result in unintended complications such as sprea ding infection. 32 Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: More consideration is needed of the impact of not treating for vulnerable groups. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representativ e bodies / regulator / industry : Diarrhoea can be a sympt om of more serious illness such as bowel cancer, Crohn's disease or c olitis. BMA sta ted that acute diarrhoea can be a serious illness in frail patients and, particularly if accompanied by faecal incontinence, can lead to an unplanned hospital admission .. Also, the PSNC states that there should be reference to red flag symptoms which require onward referral to general practice. Other: Diarrhoea can be a symptom of more serious illness and not treating it, or treating it inappropriately, could result in unintended complications. They also raised concerns about the impact of not treating on vulnerable groups. 8.5 Dry eyes/ sore (tired) e yes There were 2,589 responses to the closed question.

Patients: Not treating or treating conditions ina ppropriately could result in unintended consequences/ complications (including ulcers and blindness). Dry eyes can be a sign o f more serious conditions (especially for g laucoma patients) and all treatment options should be subject to the length of time pat ients have been experiencing symptoms. There need s to be clearer definitions and guidance around what constitute s severity of illness (whether minor, moderate or severe). Conditions can be quite serious and require proper assessment and treatment. There is concern that the proposals will remove effective treatmen ts for patients , and that OTC treatm ents are expensive. Members of the public / family members / friend s / carers of patients: This group are concerned that not treating conditions, or treating them inappropriately could result in unintended complications such as ulcers or blindness. They also feel there should be an exception for all g laucoma patients. Clinicians: Conditions can be quite serious and require proper assessment and treatment. Not treating or treating conditions inappropriately could result in unintended consequences or complications. T here should be clearer definitions and guidance on the type s of illnesses. They are also concerned that treatments are expensive. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Dry eyes could be a sign of more serious conditions. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : BMA did not consider dry eyes are not considered a minor 33 condition. They require long -term treatment and can produce considerable distress and even ocular complications . Novartis UK state d thar dry eyes could be a common symptom of other condition s. Also, for long-term and moderate to severe dry eye conditions, clearly defined exceptions are necessary to ensure patients have access to the right treatment. Other: Not treating or treating conditions inappropriately could result in unintended consequences or complications and treatment options should be subject to the length of time patients have been experiencing symptoms. 8.6 Earwax There were 2,571 responses to the closed question.

Patients: Excessive earwax requires syringing. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Excessive earwax needs syringing and not treating, or treating conditions inappropriately, could result in unintended consequences or complications. Clinicians: Excessive earwax require s syringing and not treating, or treating conditions inappropriately, could result in unintended consequences or complications. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Where there is poor evidence of efficacy this should be dealt with by inclusion in the black list, and patients whose impacted earwax can be associated with infections require prompt, appropriate treatment. 8.7 Excessive s weating (hyperhidrosis) There were 2,583 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations .

Patients: Need to consider additional impact of this condition on patients (including embarrassme nt, anxiety ). OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the condition. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Symptoms can be a sign of a more severe condition (such as liver malfunction). Also consider the additional impact of this condition on patients ( for example, embarrassment ) and the fact that OTC treatment may not always be effe ctive. CCGs: OTC treatment may not always b e effective at treating this condition which is no t minor and can be a life -restricting condition. Clinicians: OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the condition which can have a considerable impact on patients. Other NHS organisations / N HS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Following review of correspondence received organisations state this condition can be severely disabling. It can have a huge impact on the wellbeing of the patient, affec ting their confidence, self -esteem and ab ility to maintain relationships. T he guidance should define this as 'mild axillary hyperhidrosis responsive to topical OTC treatments' . It is reported patients have often already tried self -management but continue to experience debilitating symptoms. It is also noted that aluminium chloride (available OTC) is ra rely used properly by patients. . Other: Excessive sweating is not considered a minor ailment. I t can be a life restricting condition. 8.8 Head l ice There were 2,576 responses to the closed question.

Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Head lice products are expensive and you have to treat the whole family which is potentially a public health risk if not addressed. Need to consider the additiona l impact of this condition on patients (such as bullying). CCGs: Potentially a publ ic health risk if not addressed. 35 Clinicians: NHS advice has been to treat only if live lice are seen yet the consultation document says all family members should be treated even if no lice are present. This is potentially a public health risk if not addressed and need to consider the ability of some groups to pay for the treatment they, or their families , need. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Head lice are p otentially a public health risk if not addressed . These organisations also state this should be 'mild head lice infestations without secondary inflammation or infection'. And, 'head lice can be easily treated and should therefore be removed. .Other: Head lice products are expensive as you have to treat the whole family. H istoric NHS advic e is to treat only if live lice are seen yet the c onsultation document says all should be treated even if no lice are present.

Patients: Symptoms can be a sign of more serious conditi ons. OTC treatment may not always be effect ive at treating the condition. T reatment should be subject to the length of time patients have been experiencing symptoms and need to differentiate between the different forms of the condition (for example, minor, regular, chronic).There is concern around patients being advised to purchase contraindicated or the wrong medication to treat the condition. Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patient s: Symptoms can be a sign of more serious conditions and OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the condition. Therefore there's a need to differentiate between the different forms of the condition. CCGs: Treatment should be subject to the length of time patients have been experiencing symptoms. Clinicians: Symptoms can be a sign of more serious conditions and OTC treatment may not always be an effective treatment. The treatment should be subject to the le ngth of time patients have been experiencing symptoms and therefore there is a need to differentiate between the different forms of the condition. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Symptoms can be a sign of more serious conditions. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : Concern around patients being advised to purchase 36 contraindicated or the wrong medication to treat the condition. BMA raised concerns that n on- ulcer dyspepsia is not a minor condition; it often requires long -term medication and can produce considerable distress. This condition is very common in pregnant women. Reflux in this patient group and infant reflux should be explicitly excluded. Indigestion symptoms could be signs of something more serious, such as a heart attack. There should be reference to red flag symptoms which require onward referral to general practice. Other: Symptoms can be a sign of more serious conditions . 8.10 Infrequent c onstipation There were 2,580 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations .

Need to consider socio economic impact on migraine sufferers. Concern that OTC treatment may not alw ays be effective at treating the condition and so there needs to be a greater impetus on healthcare staff to provide clear guidance and instructions. A blanket approach may not be suitable for all - need to consider each person on an individual basis. How will patients on a low income who have a chronic condition be able to afford a constant supply of OTC medicatio n? Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the condition and a one size fits all approach may not be suitable for all. Symptoms can be a sign of more serious conditions an d must consider socio economic impact on migraine sufferers. CCGs: OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the c ondition and there n eeds to be clearer d efinitions and guidance on the types of migraine. Clinicians: OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the condition and clearer definitions and guidance are required on the types of migraine. Th ere will be a greater need for healthcare staff to provide clear guidance and instructions. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the condition. Also BMA disagrees as infrequent migraine can be distressing and disabling when it occurs, and the most effective treatment should be provided. Not all of these are available without prescription . Other: A blanket approach may not be suitable for all; symptoms can be a sign of more serious conditions and there's a need to cons ider socio economic impact on migraine sufferers. 8.12 Insect bites and s tings There were 2,571 responses to the closed question.

There should be exceptions for severe bites and stings and there is concern that OTC treatment may not always be e ffective at treating the condition. Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Exceptions for severe bites and stings. Other: Not treating and/or treating conditions inappropriately could result in unintended consequences/ compli cations (as listed above ). 38 8.13 Mild a cne There were 2,575 responses to the closed question. The majority of respondents were patients, members of the public, clinicians, CCGs and patient representative/ voluntary organisations .

Patient representative organisations / voluntary organisations or charities: Consider additional impact of this condition on patients' confidence/ esteem/ mental health. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : The British Association of Dermatologists feel this section should be removed . Acne is a common cause of significant psychological and psychiatric morbidity in children and teenagers irrespective of severity, with proven long -term consequences. Many first -line treatments such as topical retinoid are not available OTC. Sudden onset ac ne in older adults requires prompt investigation. It was also suggested that t his could also be changed to 'very mild self -limiting acne' and make this clear in the explanatory text. Remove 'several creams, lotions and gels for treating acne are available at pharmacies' and replace with 'only topical benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be effective and is available at pharmacies'. There is a lack of evidence of benefit for other OTC drugs, and patients often only consult after repeated visits to pharmacies and failed trials of costly OTC treatments . Acne can be confused with other conditions, which require different treatment . Therefore, guidance should not discourage patients with acne from seeking advice and potentially avoiding lifelong scarring from wors ening/poorly treated acne . Other : Consider additional impact of this condition on patients' confidence/ esteem/ mental health and OTC treatment may not always be effective at treating the condition/ possible need for stronger medicine. Need for clearer definitions and guidance is required on what constitutes severity of illness. 8.14 Mild dry skin/ s unburn 39 There were 2,566 responses to the closed question.

Additionally, British Association of Dermatologists, University of Nottingham, and Centre of Evidence based Dermatology, British Medical Association , Dermal, Society for Academic Primary Care Dermatology research group and British Generic Manufacturers Association feel these conditions should beseparated . Some responses suggested that r estricting prescriptions for sunscreens would unduly risk the health and wellbeing of those with an increased risk from sunburn, including current skin cancer patients, people who have had non -melanoma skin cancer previously, people with compromised immune systems and people with pre -existing chronic skin conditions such as eczema, dermatitis and psoriasis. Sun exposure, and common treatments, may increase the risk of developing skin cancer. Additionally, skin sensitivity precludes many of these sufferers from purchasing sunscreens without input from a doctor . 8.15 Mild to moderate hay fever/ seasonal r hinitis There were 2,575 responses to the closed question .

Clinicians: Treating chronic hay fever/ rhinitis can be costly and need to consider the impact on patient quality of life. Healthcare professionals should see the patient and establish seriousness of the condition and length of treatment. Other NHS organisations / NHS provider organisations / professional representative bodies / regulator / industry : May be difficult to define 'mild/moderate' and symptoms can vary over time. Mild to moderate hay fever/seasonal rhinitis is included in the consultation under minor ailments suitable for self -care. Long -term hay fever would be excluded.

Members of the public / family members / friends / carers of patients: Consider the impact on carers who may not be able to buy items for those they care for or may not be allowed to administer OTC medication. Clear guidance is needed on when HCPs should refer patients to obtain medical advice. Clinicians: Clear guidance is required on when HCPs should refer patients to obtain medical advice. Other NHS organisations / NHS prover / regulator/ o thers: Suggested that this should be changed to 'mild nappy rash lasting less than seven days'. Failure t o improve may indicate that the parents are non - compliant with hygiene practices and use of barrier creams. This may raise child protection concerns or indicate a skin disease such as eczema, psoriasis or a fungal infection needing further treatment or ref erral. With an initial diagnosis from a health visitor or pharmacist patients who can afford to pay for such treatment could reasonably care for their baby themselves. But if the condition persists for more than a week they need their GP's advice.

This guidance is addressed to CCGs to support them to fulfil their duties around appropriate use of their resources. We expect CCGs to take the proposed guidance into account in formulating local polices, unless they can articulate a valid reason to do ot herwise, and for prescribers to reflect local policies in their prescribing practice. The guidance does not remove the clinical discretion of the prescriber in accordance with their professional duties. This guidance is issued as general guidance under s 14Z10 and S2 of the NHS Act 2006. The objective of this guidance is to support CCGs in their decision -making, to address unwarranted variation, and to provide clear national advice to make local prescribing practices more effective. The aim is that this w ill lead to a more equitable process for making decisions about CCG's policies on prescribing medicines; CCGs will need to take individual decisions on implementation locally, ensuring they take into account their legal duties to advance equality and have regard to reduce health inequalities. 1.2 Why have we developed this guidance ? In the year prior to June 2017, the NHS spen t approximately \u00a3569 million1 on prescriptions for medicines , which could otherwise be purchased over the counter (OTC) from a pharmacy and/or other outlets such as petrol stations or supermarkets . These prescriptions include items for a condition : That is considered to be self -limiting and so does not need treatment as it will heal or be cured of its own accord; Which lends itself to self -care i.e. the person suffering does not normally nee d to seek medical advice and can manage the condition by purchasing OTC items directly. These prescriptions also include other common items: That can be purchased over the c ounter, sometimes at a lower cost than that which would be incurred by the NHS; For which there is little evidence of clinical effectiveness . By reducing spend on treating conditions that are self -limiting or which lend themselves to self -care, or on items for which there is little evidence of clinical effectiveness, these resources can be used for other higher priority areas that have a greater impact for patients, support improvements in services an d/or deliver transformation that will ensure t he long-term sustainability of the NHS. 1 Refined BSA data to June 2017 OFFICIAL 6 The co sts to the NHS for many of the items used to treat minor condition s are often higher than the prices for which they can be purchased over the counter a s the re are hidden costs. For example, a pack of 12 anti-sickness tablets can be purchased for \u00a32.182 from a pharmacy whereas the cost to the NHS is over \u00a33 .003 after including dispensing fees. The actual total cost for the NHS is over \u00a335 when you include GP consultation and other administration costs . A wide range of information is avail able to the public on the subjects of health promotion and the management of minor self - treatable illnesses. Advice from organisations such as the Self Care Forum and NHS Choices is readily available on the internet. Many community pharmacies are also open extended hours including weekends and are ideally placed to offer advice on the management of minor condition s and li festyle interventions . The Royal Pharmaceutical Society offers advice on over the counter products that should be kep t in a medicine cabinet at home to help patients treat a range of self -treatable illness es. Research 4shows that in many cases, people can take care of their minor conditions if they are provided with the right information; thereby releasing health care professionals to focus on patients with more complex an d/or serious health concerns. Past experience with self -care builds confidence in patients, with 84 per cent choosing to self -care for new episodes. More cost -effective use of stretched NHS resources allows money to be spent where it is most needed, whilst improving patient outcomes. As an example , every \u00a31m saved on prescriptions for over the counter treatments could fund (approx.) 5: 39 more community nurses ; or 270 more hip replacements ; or 66 more drug treatment courses for breast cancer ; or 1000 more drug treatment courses for Alzheimer's ; or 1040 more cataract operations6. CCGs need to make increasingly difficult decisions about how to spend the NHS budget and this means prioritising those things that will give patients the best clinical outcomes. Any savings from implementing the proposals could be reinvested in improving patient care. 1.3 How has this guidance been developed? Clinical Commissioning Groups (C CGs) asked for a nationally co -ordinated approach to producing commissi oning guidance . NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners (NHSCC) therefore sought to provide a national framework for 2 Online pharmacy checked December 2017 3 Drug Tariff online 4 Self-care of minor ailments: A survey of consumer and healthcare professional beliefs and behaviour, Ian Banks, Self -Care Journal 5https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/national -tariff-1719/ 6 Drug Tariff online OFFICIAL 7 guidance, with the aim of supporting consistent local implementation decisions and agreed to consult jointly on any proposals NHS Engla nd and NHSCC established a joint clinical working group with prescriber and pharmacy representatives from relevant national stakeholders including the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the British Medical Association , the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) , the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the Department of Health and Social Care , PrescQIPP and CCG representatives . As a result of our work, NHS England and NHS CC identified conditions which may fall under one or more of the categories listed in section 1.2 . NHS England then consulted on items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care (21st July - 21st October 2017). That initial consultation sough t views generally on the principle of restricting the prescribing of medicines which are readily available over the counter. We set out an initial list of 26 minor or self -limiting conditions where prescribing restrictions could be considered. Feedback f rom this consultation showed that there was general support ( 65% agreed with our proposed criteria to assess items for potential restriction) . The clinical working group were consulted on several proposed approaches to limiting the prescription of OTC m edicines and, based on their guidance, we mapped OTC products to the conditions for which they are typically prescribed. We refined the approach to develop restrictions based on type and severity of condition rather the products. We estimated that restr icting prescribing for 'minor' c onditions may save up to \u00a3136m once all discounts and claw backs have been accounted for . As a result of this exercise , nine additional minor conditions were identified which we deemed appropriate for inclusion in this guidance . Vitamins and m inerals , and probiotics have been included as standalone categor ies given they have been identified as high cost in terms of OTC spend, although their use cannot be mapped to one single condition. We focused on developing guidance for the list of 33 condition s which would fall into one of the following categories : A condition that is self -limiting and does not require medical advice or treatment as it will clear up on its own ; and/or A condition that is a minor illness and is suitable for self -care and treatment with items that can easily be purchased over the counter from a pharmacy. And in the case of vitamins, minerals and probiotics, we classified these as: OFFICIAL 8 Items of limited clinical effectiveness, where there is a lack o f robust evidence for clinical effectiveness ; however there may be certain indications where they may continue to be prescribed and these are outlined within the exceptions under the relevant item. The group then assigned one of the following three recom mendations for each condition (or item) : Advise CCGs that [item] should not be routinely prescribed in primary care due to limited evidence of clinical effectiveness . Advise CCG s that a prescription for treatment of [condition] should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self-limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of [condition] should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self - care. In reaching its recommendations the joint clini cal working group considered evidence from the following organisations or groups: NICE CKS NHS Choices BNF NICE Clinical Guidelines Public Health England PrescQIPP CIC The group's recommendations on the items and conditions within this guidance were publicly consulted on for a period of 12 weeks , from 20th December 201 7 - 14th March 2018. During the consultation we heard from members of the public, patients and their representative groups, NHS staff, CCGs, Trusts, various Royal Colleges and the pharmaceutical industry, amongst others. Section 1 .4 details the main findings from the consultation and the changes that have been made as a result of what we have heard. A more detailed report on the consultation can be found in : Conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely be prescr ibed in primary care: consultation report of findings published alongside this guidance. The final recommendations set out in this guidance document reflect the outcome of the consultation. The potential equality impact of these recommendations has also be en considered and is outlined in the Equality and Health Inequalities Impact Assessment document published alongside this guidance. OFFICIAL 9 1.4 How have the recommendations in this guidance been developed following the results of the consultation? We listened to what our stakeholders told us through the consultation and refined our draft guid ance in light of the response and discussion s through webinars and engagement events, as well as recommendations from the joint clinical working group who considered the feed back in detail. Whilst overall the final guidance remains largely unchanged from the draft guidance published in December 2017, there have been some important refinements and clarifications made and these are detailed below: As a result of feedback rec eived for further clarity on the exceptions , the following statements were approved by the clinical working group and now have been included under the ' General Exceptions' heading: This guidance applies to all patients (unless they fall under the exceptions outlined); this includes those who would be exempt from paying prescription charges. When implementing this guidance, CCGs will need to supply patients with further information on signposting so that they are able to access the right service. This guidance is not intended to discourage patients from going to the GP when it is appropriate to do so. It is envisioned that in most cases (unless specified) these minor conditions will clear up with appropriate self -care. If symptoms are not improving or responding to treatment, then patients should be encouraged to seek further advice. CCGs will also need to take account of their latest local Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA) an d consider the impact of this guidance on rural areas and access to a pharmacy and pharmacy medicines. To note that for vitamins, minerals, probiotics and those self -limiting conditions where there is limited evidence of clinical effectiveness for the tr eatments used (e.g. OTC items for cough, sore throat and infant colic), then the general exceptions do not apply. Specific exceptions are included (if applicable) under the relevant item and/or condition. This may need to be considered further when imple menting the guidance locally . The clinical working group also further refined the final exception around vulnerability as follows, to clarify that it applies to individual patients and that being exempt from prescription charges does not indicate that yo u would automatically be exempt from this guidance. Individual patients where the clinician considers that their ability to self -manage is compromised as a consequence of medical, mental health or significant social OFFICIAL 10 vulnerability to the extent that their health and/or wellbeing could be adversely affected if reliant on self-care. To note that being exempt from paying a prescription charge does not automatically warrant an exception to the guidance. Vitamins and Minerals - during the consultation we heard that the list of exceptions should be amended to include all types of medically diagnosed vitamin or mineral deficiency , including for those patients who may have a lifelong condition or have undergone surgery that resul ts in malabsorption . This is in line with the current ACBS guidance for prescribers and was approved by the joint clinical working group. It was also noted that vitamin D analogues such as alfacalcidol are prescription only medicines and would continue to be prescribed. During the consultation we also heard from the pharmaceutical industry that maintenance treatment for vitamin D therapy should be an exception as it is included in PHE guidance. The working group considered this and agreed that whilst mainte nance therapy is recommended, there is no indication that this needs to be prescribed; vitamin D supplements can be bought cheaply and easily. The PHE guidance also does not distinguish between the general public and at risk patients. The clinical working group therefore agreed that vitamin D maintenance therapy would not be included as an exception. Cold Sores - During the consultation we heard that further clarity was required on the description for this condition. The clinical working group agreed th e description for this condition should be amended to clarify that this refers to infrequent cold sores of the lip. Cradle Cap - During the consultation we received feedback that a specific exception should apply to this condition. The clinical working group agreed to refine this to include the exception \" If not improving and causing distress to the infant\" Contact Dermatitis - Following feedback the clinical working group agreed that this condition should remain but that the description should be amend ed to mild irritant dermatitis. Dandruff - Following a request for clarification the clinical working group agreed the rationale should be amended to define dandruff as a \"mild scaling of the scalp without itching\", and to include the statement \"Patients should be encouraged to manage mild dandruff with long term over the counter treatments\". Head Lice - Following feedback from various organisations around the need to specify that wet combing should be first line treatment , the clinical working group agreed that the following sentence should be included: 'Head lice can be treated by wet combing; chemical treatment is only recommended in exceptional circumstances and in these cases over the counter medicines can be purchased from a pharmacy' Infrequent Co nstipation - During the consultation we heard that further information was needed within the rationale for this condition. The clinical working group agreed that the rationale should be amended to include the following additional information: OFFICIAL 11 Pharmacists can help if diet and lifestyle changes aren't helping. They can suggest an over the counter laxative. Most laxatives work within 3 days. They should be used for a short time only. Laxatives are not recommended for children unless they are prescribed by a GP. This guidance applies to short term, infrequent constipation caused by changes in lifestyle or diet such as lack of water or movement or changes in diet. Mild Acne -The clinical working group agreed that additional information should be added into the rationale to clarify that patients should be encouraged to manage this condition with long term use of over the counter products. Mild dry skin/sunburn/sun protection - The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) advised that mild dry skin and sunburn be separated out, rather than being classified as a single condition. The clinical working group agreed that it would be sens ible to separate this out into three separate conditions: mild dry skin, sunburn due to excessive sun exposure, and sun protection, with the overall recommendation for each remaining the same. This increases the number of conditions to 35. Nappy Rash - The clinical working group agreed that th e rationale should be refined to clarify that this condition usually clears up aft er about three to seven days if recommended hygiene tips are followed. Ring worm/Athletes Foot - following feedback the clinical working group agreed that lymphoedema or his tory of lower limb cellulitis should be included as an exception for this condition. As a result of what we heard, the joint clinical working group did not feel it necessary to amend the proposed recommendations for any remaining conditions or items. 1.5 General exceptions that apply to the recommendation to self - care This guidance is intended to encourage people to self -care for minor illnesses as the first stage of treatment. It is envisioned that in most cases (unless specified) these minor conditions will clear up with appropriate self -care. If symptoms are not improving or responding to treatment, then patients should be encouraged to seek further advice. When implementing this guidance, CCGs will need to supply patients with better information on signposting so that they are able to access the right service. This guidance is not intended to discoura ge patients from going to the GP when it is appropriate to do so . To note that for vitamins, minerals, probiotics and those self -limiting conditions where there is limited evidence of clinical effectiveness for the treatments used (e.g. OTC items for cough, sore throat and infant colic), then the general exceptions do no t OFFICIAL 12 apply. Specific exceptions are included (if applicable) under the relevant item and/or condition. This may need to be considered further when implementing the guidance locally. The guidance applies to all patients unless they fall under the exce ption s outlined ; this includes those who would be exempt from paying prescription charges. CCGs will need to ensure that community pharmacists are reminded of 'red flag' symptoms for patients presenting with symptoms related to the conditions covered by this c onsultation. GPs and/or pharmacists should refer patients to NHS Choices, the Self Care Forum or NHS 111 for further advice on when they should seek GP Care. CCGs will also need to take account of their latest local Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA) and consider the impact of this guidance on rural areas and dispensing doctors in particular. General Exceptions to the Guidance: There are however, certain scenarios where patients should continue to have their treatments prescribe d and these are outl ined below: Patients prescribed an OTC treatment for a long term condition (e.g. regular pain relief for chronic arthritis or treatments for inflammatory bowel disease ). For the treatment of more complex forms of minor illnesses (e.g. severe migraines that are unresponsive to over the counter medicines) For those patients that have symptoms that suggest the condition is not minor (i.e. those wi th red flag symptoms for exa mple indigestion with very bad pain. ) Treatment for complex patients (e.g. immunosuppressed patients). Patients on prescription only treatments . Patients prescribed OTC products to treat an adverse effect or symptom of a more complex illness and/or pre scription only medications should continue to have these products prescribed on the NHS. Circumstances w here the product licence doesn't allow the product to be sold over the counter to certain groups of patients. This may vary by medicine, but could inc lude babies, children and/or women who are pregnant or breast - feeding. Community Pharmacists will be aware of what these are and can advise accordingly. Patients with a minor condition suitable for self -care that has not responded sufficiently to treat ment with an OTC product. OFFICIAL 13 Patients where the clinician considers that the presenting symptom is due to a condition that would not be considered a minor condition . Circumstances where the prescriber believes that in their clinical judgement, exceptional circumstances exist that warrant deviation from the recommendation to self -care. Individual p atients where the clinician considers that their ability to self - manage is compromised as a consequence of medical , mental health or significant social vulnerability to the extent that their health and/or wellbeing could be adversely affected, if reliant on self-care. To note that being exempt from paying a prescription charge does not automatically warrant an exception to the guidance. Consideration shou ld also be given to safeguarding issues. 2 Definitions and scope 2.1 Glossary ACBS: The Advisory Committee for Borderline Substances is responsible for advising the NHS on the prescribing of foodstuffs and toiletries which are specially formulated for use by people with medical conditions. Borderline substances are mainly foodstuffs, such as enteral feeds and foods but also include some toiletries, such as sun blocks for use by people with conditions such as photodermatosis. Annual Spend: Unless otherwis e indicated this is the total value from NHS Prescription Services at the NHS Business Services Authority . This is an approximate spend to the nearest \u00a3100,000. The figure quoted is the net ingredient cost which refers to the cost of the drug before discounts and does not include any dispensing costs or fees. It does not include any adjustment for income obtained where a prescription charge is paid at the time the prescription is dispensed or where the patient has purchased a prepayment certificate. Item: An item is anything which can be prescrib ed on an NHS prescription. More information on what is prescribed on an NHS prescription is available in the Drug Tariff . MHRA: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. MHRA regulate s medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion in the UK. NHS Clinical Commissioners: NHSCC are the independent membership organisation for CCGs, providing their collective voice, facilitating shared learning and delivering networking opportunities for CCG members. NICE: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. NICE provide s the NHS with clinical guidance on how to improve healthcare. OFFICIAL 14 Over the counter (OTC) item: items which can be purchased from a pharmacy or in a supermarket or other convenience store without the need for a prescription. Such items may also be available at other outlets such as supermarkets, petrol stations or convenience stores. PHE: Public Health England. PHE protect s and improve s the nation's health and wellbeing, and reduce s health inequalities. PrescQIPP CIC: PrescQIPP CIC (Community Interest Company): PrescQIPP is an NHS funded not for -profit organisation that supports quality, optimised prescribing for patients. PrescQIPP produce s evidence -based resources and tools for primary care commissioners, and provide a platform to share innovation across the NHS . 2.2 Scope The following chapter sets out the process for how NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners will conduct the process to review and update the guidance to CCGs as appropriate. Chapter 4 sets out the guidance to CCGs on prescribing in 35 conditions that have been identified as being suitable for self -care and the 2 items based on the latest available evidence and the clinical consensus that has been reached by our joint clinical working group. OFFICIAL 15 3 How will the guidance be updated and reviewed? The NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners joint clinical working group will continue to meet during and after the consultation, and update the proposals as a result of th e consultation. In future , the joint clinical working group will review the guidance to identify potential conditions to be retained, retired or added to the current guidance. There will be three stages: Stage 1: Condition identification The o rganisations represented on the joint clinical working group will, taking into account p revious feedback, identify conditions and subsequent items prescribed from the wide range of items that can be prescribed on NHS prescription in primary care that they consider could fall with in the categories defined earlier. Stage 2: Condition prioritisation The joint clinical working group will prioritise the identified items based on the following criteria : Safety Issue Evidence of efficacy Degree of variation in prescribing Cost to the NHS Strong clinician or patient feedback A draft list of conditions will be made available online through the NHS England website usually for a four week period, when comments will be sou ght from interested parties. Feedback will be collated and then published on the NHS England website. Stage 3: Condition selection for inclusion or removal from the guidance The joint clinical working group will consider the feedback and produce a final l ist of recommendations for consideration by NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners to update the commissioning guidance Conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care . OFFICIAL 16 4 Recommendations Our final recommendations for the 35 minor conditions and two items of limited clinical effectiveness are listed below. 4.1 Items of limited clinical effectiveness 4.1.1 Probiotics Annual Spend c. \u00a31,100,000 Rationale for recommendation There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to support prescribing of probiotics within the NHS for the treatment or prevention of diarrhoea of any cause. Both the Public Health England C.difficile guidance and NICE CG 84 recommend that probiotics cannot be recommended currently and that \"Good quality randomised controlled trials should be cond ucted in the UK to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a specific probiotic using clearly defined treatment regimens and outcome measures before they are routinely prescribed.\" References: 1. Public Health England C.difficile guidance 2. NICE CG 84:Diarrhoea and vomiting caused by gastroenteritis in under 5s: diagnosis and management 3. PrescQIPP CIC: Probiotics Recommendation Advise CCGs that probiotics should not be routinely prescribed in primary care due to limited evidence of clinical effectiveness . Exceptions ACBS approve d indication or as per local policy. 4.1.2 Vitamins and minerals Annual Spend c. \u00a3 48,100, 000 Rationale for recommendation There is insufficient high quality evidence to demonstrate the clinical effecti veness of vitamins and minerals. Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients which most people can and should get from eating a healthy, varied and balanced diet. In most cases, dietary supplem entation is unnecessary. Many vitamin and mineral supplements are classified as foods and not medicines; they therefore do not have to go through the strict criteria laid down by the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) to confirm their quality, safety and efficacy before reaching the market. OFFICIAL 17 Any prescribing not in -line with listed exceptions should be discontinued. This guidance does not apply to prescription only v itamin D analogues such as alfacalcidol and these should continue to be prescribed.

A behind the Headlines Report , June 2011 3) NHS Choices: Do I need vitamin Supplements ? Accessed October 2017 4) Healthy Start Vitamins Recommendation Advise CCGs that vitamins and m inerals should not be routinely presc ribed in primary care due to limited evidence of clinical effectiveness. Exceptions Medically diagnosed deficiency, including for those patients who may have a lifelong or chronic condition or have undergone surgery that results in malabsorption. Continuing need should however be reviewed on a regular basis. NB maintenance or preventative treatment is not an exception. Calcium and v itamin D for osteoporosis . Malnutrition including alcoholism (see NICE guidance ) Patients suitable to receive Healthy start vitamins for pregnancy or children between the ages 6 months to their fourth birthday. (NB this is not on prescription but commissioned separately) OFFICIAL 18 4.2 Self-Limiting Conditions 4.2.1 Acute Sore Throat Annual Spend c. < \u00a3100,000 Rationale for recommendation A sore throat due to a viral or bacterial cause is a self -limiting condition. Symptoms resolve within 3 days in 40% of people, and within 1 week in 85% of people, irrespective of whether or not the sore throat is due to a streptococcal infection. There is little evidence to suggest that treatments such as lozenges or thr oat sprays help to treat the cause of sore throat and patients should be advised to take simple painkillers and implement some self -care measures such as gargling with warm salty water instead. References: 1. NHS Choices: Sore Throat - accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: Sore Throat - Acute accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment o f acute sore throat should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions 'Red Flag' symptoms 4.2.2 Infrequent cold sores of the lip Annual Spend c. < \u00a3100 ,000 Rationale for recommendation Cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. Antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription and i f used correctly, these can help ease symptoms and speed up the healing time. To be effective, these treatments should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect. References 1. NHS Choices: Cold sore (herpes simplex virus) accessed accessed Oc tober 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of cold sores should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self-limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions Immunocompromised patients. 'Red flag' symptoms OFFICIAL 19 4.2.3 Conjunctivitis Annual Spend c. \u00a3500,000 Rationale for recommendation Treatment isn 't usually needed for conjunctivitis as the symptoms usually clear within a week. There are several self -care measures that may help with symptoms. If treatment is needed, then trea tment is dependent on the cause: In severe bacterial cases, antibiotic eye drops and eye ointments can be used to clear the infection. Irritant conj unctivitis will clear up as soon as whatever is causing it is removed. Allergic conjunctivitis can usually be treated with anti - allergy medications such as antihistamines. The substance that caused the allergy should be avoided. Treatments for conjunctivitis can be purchased over the counter however almost half of all simple cases of conjunctivitis clear up within ten days without any treatment. Public Health England (PHE) advises that children with infective conjunctivitis do not need to be ex cluded from school, nursery or child minders, and it does not state any requirement for treatment with topical antibiotics. References 1. NHS Choices: Conjunctivitis accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: Conjunctivitis - Infective accessed October 2017 3. PHE Advice for schools : September 2017 4. NICE Medicines evidence commentary: conjunctivitis and inappropriate prescribing. Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of conjunctivitis should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self-limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions 'Red Flag ' symptoms 4.2.4 Coughs and colds and nasal congestion Annual Spend c. \u00a31,300,000 Rationale for recommendation Most colds start to improve in 7 to 10 days. Mo st coughs clear up within two to three weeks . Both conditions can cause nasal congestion. Neither condition requires any treatment. References: 1. NHS Choices: Common Cold accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: Common Cold accessed October 2017 OFFICIAL 20 3. PrescQIPP: Coughs and Colds. Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of coughs, colds and nasal congestion should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self -limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions 'Red F lag' symptoms 4.2.5 Cradle Cap (Seborrhoeic dermatitis - infants) Annual Spe nd c. \u00a34,500,000 Rationale for recommendation Cradle cap is harmless and doesn 't usually itch or cause discomfort. It usually appears in babies in the first two months of their lives , and clears up without treatment within weeks to a few months. References: 1. NHS Choices: Cradle Cap accessed October oeic dermatitis accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of cradle cap should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self-limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions If not improving and causing distress to the infant 4.2.6 Haemorrhoids Annual Spend c. \u00a3500,000 Rationale for recommendation In many cases, haemorrhoids don't cause symptoms and some people don't even realise they have them. Haemorrhoids often clear up by themselves after a few days. Making simple dietary changes and not straining on the toilet are often recommended first. However, there are many treatments (creams, ointments and suppositories) that can reduce itching and d iscomfort and these are available over the counter for purchase. References: 1. NHS Choices: Haemorrhoids accessed October 2017 Haemorrhoids accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of haemorrhoids should not routinely be offered in primary care as the conditio n is self-limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions 'Red F lag' symptoms 4.2.7 Infant Colic OFFICIAL 21 Annual Spend c.<\u00a3100,000 Rationale for recommendation As colic eventually improves on its own, medical treatment isn't usually recommended. There are some over -the-counter treatments available that could be tried however; there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of these treatments. References: 1. NHS Choices: Colic accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: Colic Infantile accessed October 2017 3. PrescQIPP: Infant Colic Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of infant colic should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self-limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions 'Red Flag' Symptoms 4.2.8 Mild Cystitis Annual Spend c. \u00a3300,000 Rationale for recommendation Mild cystitis is a common type of urinary tract inflammation , normally caused by an infection ; however it is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases can be defined as those that are responsive to symptomatic tr eatment but will also clear up on their own. If symptoms don't improve in 3 days , despite self -care measures, then the patient s hould be advised to see their GP . Symptomatic treatment using products that reduce the acidity of the urine to reduce symptoms are available, but there's a lack of evidence to suggest they're effective. References: 1. NHS Choices: Cystitis accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: Urin ary tract infection (lower) - women accessed October 2017. Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of mild cystitis should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is self-limiting and will clear up on its own without the need for treatment. Exceptions 'Red F lag' symptoms OFFICIAL 22 4.3 Minor Condition s Suitable for Self - Care 4.3.1 Mild Irritant Dermatitis Annual Spend c. \u00a314,500,000 Rationale for recommendation Irritant dermatitis is a type of eczema triggered by contact with a particular substance. Once treated most people can expect their symptoms to improve and /or clear up completely if the irritant or allergen can be identified and removed or avoided It is most commonly caused by irritants such as soaps, washing powde rs, detergents, solvents or regular contact with water. Treatment normally involves avoiding the allergen or irritant and treating symptoms with over the counter emollients and topical corticosteroids. References: 1. NHS October NICE CKS: Dermatitis - contact accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of contact dermatitis should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self -care. Exceptions No routine exceptions have been identified. See earlier for general exceptions . 4.3.2 Dandruff Annual Spend c. \u00a34,500,000 Rationale for recommendation Dandruff is a common skin condition . It can be defined as mild scaling of the scalp without itching. Dandruff isn't contagious or harmful and can be easily treated with over the counter anti- fungal shampoos. A GP appointment is unnecessary. Patients should be encouraged to manage mild dandruff with long term over the counter treatments. References 1. NHS Choices: Dandruff accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: dermatitis - scalp and beard accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment for dandruff should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self -care. Exceptions No routine exceptions have been identified. See earlier for general exceptions . 4.3.3 Diarrhoea (Adults) Annual Spend c. \u00a32,800,000 OFFICIAL 23 Rationale for recommendation Diarrhoea normally affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However it can take a few days to a week to clear up. Acute diarrhoea is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection and o ther causes include drugs, anx iety or a food allergy. OTC treatments can help replace lost fluids or reduce bowel motions. This recommendation does not apply to children. References 1. NHS Choices: Diarrhoea accessed October 2 017 2. NICE CKS: - adult's assessment accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment for acute diarrhoea will not routinely b e offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self -care. Exceptions No routine e xceptions have been identified. See earlier for general exceptions. 4.3.4 Dry Eyes /Sore tired Eyes Annual Spend c. \u00a314,800,000 Rationale for recommendation Dry eye syndrome, or dry eye disease, is a common condition that occurs when the eyes don 't make enough tears, or the tears evaporate too quickly. Most cases of sore tired eyes resolve themselves. Patients should be encouraged to manage both dry eyes a nd sore eyes by implementing some self -care measures such as good eyelid hygiene and avoidance of environmental factors alongside treatment Mild to moderate cases of dry eye syndrome or sore tired eyes can usually be treated using lubricant eye treatments that consist of a range of drops, gels and ointments that can be easily be purchased over the counter. References 1. NHS Choices: Dry eye syndrome accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: Dry eye syndrome accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for treatment of dry or sore eyes should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appro priate for self -care. Exceptions No routine exceptions have been identified. See earlier for general exceptions . OFFICIAL 24 4.3.5 Earwax Annual Spend c. \u00a3300,000 Rationale for recommendation Earwax is produced inside ears to keep them clean and free of germs. It usually passes out of the ears harmlessly, but sometimes too much can build up and block the ears. A build -up of earwax is a common problem that can often be treated us ing eardrops bought from a pharmacy. These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally. References: 1. NHS Choices: Earwax build -up accessed October 2017 2.

An antiperspirant containing aluminium c hloride is usual ly the first line of treatment and is sold in most pharmacies. References 1. NHS Choices: Hyperhidrosis accessed October 2017 2. NICE CKS: Hyperhidrosis accessed October 2017 Recommendation Advise CCGs that a prescription for high strength antiperspirants for the treatment of mild to moderate hyperhidrosis should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self -care. Exceptions No routine exceptions have been identified. See earlier for general exceptions . 4.3.7 Head Lice Annual Spend c. \u00a3600,000 Rationale for recommendation Head lice are a common problem, particularly in school children aged 4 -11. They're largely harmless, but can live in the hair for a long time if not treated and can be irritating and frustrating to deal with. OFFICIAL 25 Live h ead lice can be treated by wet combing ; chemical treatment is only recommended in exceptional circumstances and in these cases over the counter medicines can be purchased from a pharmacy. If appropriate e veryone in the household needs to be treated at the same time - even if they don't have symptoms .

Usually, it's not a sign of anything more serious and can be treated at home without the need for medical advice , as it's often mild and infrequent and specialist treatment isn't required. Most people are able to manage their indigestion by making simple diet and lifestyle changes, or taking medication such as antacids. Most people can ease symptoms by s imple changes to diet and lifestyle and avoiding foods that make indigestion worse. ( e.g. rich spicy or fatty foods, caffeinated drinks). References 1.

Exceptions No routine exceptions have been identified. See earlier for general exceptions . 4.3.9 Infrequent Constipation Annual Spend c. \u00a322,800,000 Rationale for recommendation Constipation can affect people of all ages and can be just for a short period of time. It can be effectively managed with a change in diet or lifestyle. OFFICIAL 26 Pharmacists can help if diet and lifestyle changes aren't helpi ng. They can suggest an over the coun ter laxative. Most laxatives work within 3 days. They shoul d only be used for a short time only. Laxatives are not recommended for children unless they are prescribed by a GP. This guidance applies to short term, infrequent constipation caused by changes in lifestyle or diet such as lack of water or movement or changes in diet. References 1.

Despite its name, ringworm doesn't have anything to do with worms. Athlete's foot is a rash caused by a fungus that usually appears between the toes. These fungal infections, medically known as \"tinea\", are not serious and are usually easily treated with over the counter treatments. However, they are contagious and easily spread so it is important to practice good foot hygiene. OFFICIAL 32 References: 1. NHS Choices : Athletes Foot accessed October 2017. 2.

Exceptions Lymphoedema or history of lower limb cellulitis. See earlier for general exceptions . 4.3.24 Teething/Mild toothache Annual Spend c. \u00a35,500,000 Rationale for recommendation Teething can be distressing for some babies, but there are ways to make it easier for them. Teething gels often contain a mild local anaesthetic , which helps to numb any pain or discomfort caused by teething and these can be purchased fr om a pharmacy. If baby is in pain or has a mild raised temperature (less than 38C) then paracetamol or ibuprofen suspension can be given. Toothache can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold. Mild toothache in adults can also be treated with over the counter painkillers whilst awaiting a dental appointment for further investigation. References: 1.

Title of project, programme or work: Conditions for which over the counter (OTC) items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care: Guidance for CCGs 2. What are the intended outcomes? To address unwarranted variation and to provide clear national advice to make local prescribing practices more effective. To support CCGs to use their prescribing resources effectively and deliver best patient outcomes from the medicines that their local population u ses. To support the NHS to achieve the greatest value from the money that it spends. 3. Who will be affected by this project, programme or work ? Please summarise in a few sentences which of the groups below are very likely to be affected by this work. Staff - primarily primary care prescribers who prescribe items. Other staff groups (e.g. community pharmacy staff ) will also be impacted and will have a role to support patients in changes to their therapies. Patients Partne r organisations (e.g. NICE, NHSCC ). We are using recommendations from partner organisations and they will have a role to play in implementation. 4. Which groups protected by the Equality Act 2010 and/ or groups that face health inequalities are very likely to be affected by this w ork? The aim is to develop guidance for CCGs which supports a reduction in unwarranted variation and provides a national framework to make local presc ribing practices more effective. T his national guidance for CCGs focuses on the prescribing of items which can also be purchased 'over the counter ' (OTC) for 35 conditions . Anyone in the population who uses such medicines for minor or self -limiting conditions could be affected by the guidance (unless covered by exceptions in the proposals) . Therefore a ll groups protected by the Equality Act 2010 and/ or groups that face health inequa lities are likely to be affected by this work. It should be noted that some patients obtaining free prescriptions may do so for more than one reason e.g. they are over 60 and in receipt of one or more state benefits. It is not possible to disaggregate the different reason s as , when claiming a free prescription, only one exemption category is normally selected. We have kept this in mind when car rying out this assessment. A 12 week consultation was undertaken from 20 Dec 2017 to 14 March 2018. This consultation provided an opportunity for views to be sought on the proposals. Appendix B includes an overview of key equality related themes from the consultation. Relevant themes and results have also been reflected throughout the remainder of this document. The analysis undertaken as part of this equality and health inequalities impact assessment was taken account of when considering the content of th e final OFFICIAL 5 CCG guidance. It should be noted that the themes highlighted in appendix B should be considered within the wider context of the consultation results and report (see Conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care consultation report, March 2018). To mitigate risk of inequality a number of changes were made to the exceptions in the guidance following the consultation to ensure that vulnerable groups were not at risk. PART B: Equalities Groups and Health Inequalities Groups 5. Impact of thi s work for the equality groups listed below . Focusing on each equality group listed below (sections 5.1. to 5.9) , please answer the following questions: a) Does the equality group face discrimination in this wor k area? b) Could the work tackle this discrimination and/or advance equality or good relations? c) Could the work assist or undermine compliance with the P ublic Sector Equality Duty (PSED) ? d) Does any action need to be taken to address any important adverse impa ct? If yes, what action should be taken? e) If you cannot answer these questions what action will be taken and when? 5.1. Age There is evidence that children under 16 (and those under 18 and in full time education) and adults aged over 60 will be particularly affected by the recommendations to restrict prescribing of OTC items for minor conditions. Table 2 (appendix A) shows prescriptions issued for children and those over 60 make up the largest groups of patients ex empt from prescription charges (18% and 50 % respectively) . Although patients in all age groups are issued prescriptions. During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there are any unintended consequences on this protecte d characterist ic, see appendix B for results. To mitigate risk of inequality a number of changes were made to the exceptions in the guidance following the consultation to ensure that those m ost vulnerable were not at risk. Although a proportion of older people and children may still fall outside of these exceptions, we do not have indication data to know what this proportion would be. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular d emographics of the population they serve. 5.2. Disability There is no routinely collected data on prescribing and disability so we cannot definitively assess the impact of our proposals fully at a national level. Although we do know that some people with a disability (as legally defined) will be entitled to a Medical Exemption Certificate and so be in receipt of free prescriptions. We note the Family Resources Survey 2011 to 2012 finding that a substantially higher proportion of individua ls who live in families with disabled members live in 'poverty ', OFFICIAL 6 compared to individuals who live in families where no -one is disabled . Therefore these patients may be impacted to a greater extent by the proposed guidance if they are not covered by other exceptions in the guidance . https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disability -facts -and-figures/disability -facts - and-figures Foundation also found that in 2013/14, 27 per cent of people in families where someone is disabled were in poverty, compared with 19 per cent of those in families where no one is disabled, using the standard after housing costs measure. https://www.jrf.org.uk/mpse -2015/disability -and-poverty The prevalence of disability rises with age. Around 6% of children are disabled, compared to 16% of working age adults and 45% of adults over State Pension age . During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there are any unintended consequences on this protecte d characteristic, see appendix B for results . To mitigate risk of inequality a number of changes were made to the exceptions in the guidance following the consultation to ensure that those most vulnerable were not at risk. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular demogra phics of the population they serve. 5.3. Gender reassignment The proposals will apply to all patients regardless of whether they have changed gender or are transgender. There is no evidence to suggest that the relevant items are prescribed d isproportiona tely to this group . During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there were likely unintended consequences on the protected characteristic , see appendix B for results. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular demographics of the population they serve. 5.4. Marriage and civil partnership The proposals will apply to all patients regardless of their marital or partn ership status, and there is no evidence to suggest that th e relevant items are prescribed disproportionately to this group. Therefore no patient will be disadvantaged on account of their marital or partnership status. During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there were likely unintended consequences on the protected characteri stic, see appendix B for results. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the parti cular demographics of the population they serve. 5.5. Pregnancy and maternity Such patients can apply for an exemption from prescription charges. However there is no routinely collected data on prescrib ing and pregnancy /maternity status in cases where an exemption is not applied for so we cannot definitively assess the impact fully at a national level . However where an exemption is applied for, Table 4 (appendix A) shows that 2 % of patients prescribe d an OTC item have been exempt from prescription charges due to pregnancy/ma ternity . OFFICIAL 7 For some products , the product licence doe s not allow sale of OTC medicines to certain groups of patients which can include women who a re pregnant or breast - feeding. This has been considered in the development of the proposals and factored into the proposed exce ptions. An individual may be exempt from the recommendation to self -care if he or she is not covered by the product license for a n OTC product. During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there were likely unintended consequences o n the protected characteristic , see appendix B for results. To mitigate risk of inequality there is an exception included in the gu idance which covers patients unable to purchase OTC items due to product license restrictions which would often include pregnancy . In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular demographics of the population they serve. 5.6. Race The p roposals will not discriminate against patients from different racial backgrounds, as any changes will apply to all patients regardless of their rac e. However evidence has shown that people from minority ethnic groups are statistically more likel y to be i n lower income brackets (http://www.poverty.org.uk/summary/uk.htm ) therefore these patients may be impacted to a greater extent by the proposed guidance if th ey are not covered by other exce ptions in the draft guidance . During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there were likely unintended consequences on the protected chara cteristic , see appendix B for results. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular demographics of the population they serve. 5.7. Religion or belief Proposals will not discriminate against patients with religions or beliefs, or with no religion . Any changes would apply to all patients regardless of their religion, or religious beliefs and there is no evidence to suggest that the relevant items are prescribed disproportionately to this group . During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there were likely unintended consequences on the protected characteristic , see appendix B for results. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular demographics of the population they serve. 5.8. Sex or gender Proposals would apply to all patients regardless of their sex. Figure 2 demonst rates that more women (64%) than men (36 %) get prescriptions for OTC items . Further sex specific trends by condition show that over 70% of prescriptions were for women for some conditions such as: mild migraine (80%) , head lice (73%) and cold sores (72%). Vitam ins and minerals were prescribed to women in 74% of cases. The only condition s where males showed a higher proportion of prescriptions than females was for items prescribed for the prevention of dental caries (58%) and for infant colic (51%) . OFFICIAL 8 During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there were likely unintended consequences on the protecte d characteristic , see appendix B for results. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular demographics of the population they serve. 5.9. Sexual orientation Patients of differing sexual orientation will not be affected any differently to other patient groups as any changes would apply to all patients regardless of their sexual orientation . There is no evidence to suggest that the relevant items are prescribed disproportionately to this group. During the consultation, responses were monitored to ascertain if there were likely unintended consequences on the protec ted characteristic , see appendix B for results. In implementing the guidance, CCGs will also be required to assess the impact on their population with regard to the particular demographics of the population they serve. 6.

You will only answer this question if you have identified additional groups facing important health inequalities. Response A consultation on items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care (2 July - 21October 2017) sought views on the principles of restricting the prescribing of medicines which are readily available OTC. This identified concerns as to the impact of our proposals on vulnerable groups if changes to the prescriptions of OTC items were implemented . In particular, the impact of the proposals on people with low incomes was flagged as a concern and specifically it was felt that our proposals had the potential to widen health inequalities for th is group . Additional groups identified as being at risk of increased health inequalities as a result of our proposals included: older age groups ; OFFICIAL 13 patients with disabilities ; patients in rural areas ; patients with capacity problems ; patients living in poverty or on a low income ; those patients needing hel p from carers ; and/or patients with long term or chronic illness . There are some proposed general and condition specific exemptions in the CCG guidance and we have been clear that we are not looking to propose restriction of OTC items used to treat patients suffering from long term or chronic illnesses. However, th ere could be still an impact on some of the groups identified above in that they would be encouraged to purchase an item for self -care rather than be given a prescription for it. As many patients in the above groups would receive an exemption from paying f or prescriptions , our proposals may require them to pay for an item they would have not previously paid for. People living in poverty or on low incomes can only be partially identified within the data available. There are several prescription exemption ca tegories relating to low income that can be used to identify these patients (see table 5, appendix A ). However, as a patient can only select one exemption category it is not known whether patients exempt for other reasons e.g. those aged over 60, are also on low income. It is also not known whether those under 16 years of age or in full time education are members of a household on low income. From table 4, it can be seen that those exempt from the prescription charge due to low income make up the third lar gest group, on average 15% of all patients . For some conditions (excessive sweating/hyperhidrosis and mild migraine ) they represent the largest group receiving prescriptions . The Self Care Nation report commissioned for Self Care Week 2016, explores the current attitudes of 5,011 UK adults towards self care and managing self -treatable conditions, without the need for a visit to the GP or A&E. The survey reported that 29% of people who qualified for free prescriptions would be willing to purchase an OTC medicine for a self -treatable condition, instead of visiting the GP for a prescription, if they knew if it would save the NHS money. Further analysis of this data by Proprietary Association for Great Britain (PAGB) calculated the average cost of an OTC medicine to be \u00a32.94. Although there is known to be a wide variation in prices with some costing more than \u00a325.00 and others costing 19p. PAGB, Self Care Nation report. Survey of 5,011 UK adults. Published November 2016 https://www.pagb.co.uk/latest -news/report -self-care-nation -self-care-attitudes - behaviours -uk/ It should also be noted that in absence of this guidance to CCGs, two c ircumstances may arise. Firstly that CCGs develop their own local policies on OTC items, resulting in unwarranted variation and inequality between regi ons and the people they serve. Secondly, that CCGs may choose to decommission other treatments that are shown to be evidence based and effective in order to achieve financial efficiencies. OFFICIAL 14 During the consultation on the proposals for the CCG guidance man y of the themes raised in the previous consultation were echoed. A number of these concerns are specifically accounted for under the exceptions in the guidance , so these groups of patients should continue to be issued an NHS prescription for included conditions . The guidance also includes wider exceptions that cover : exceptional circumstances that warrant deviation from the recommendation to self -care or individu al patients where the clinician considers that their ability to self -manage is compromised as a consequence of medical, mental health or significant social vulnerability to the extent that their health and/or wellbeing could be adversely affected, if relia nt on self -care. OFFICIAL 15 PART C: Promoting integrated services and working with partners Short explanatory notes: Integrated services and reducing health inequalities. Our detailed guidance explains the duties in relation to integrated services and reducing health inequalities. Please answer the questions listed below. 9. Opportunities to reduce health inequalities through integrated services. Does the work offer opportunities to encourage integrated services that could reduce health inequalities? If yes please also answer 10. Yes Go to section 10 No Go to section 11 Do not know 10. How can this work increase integrated services and reduce health inequalities? N/A PART D: Engagement and involvement 11. Engagement and involvement activities already undertaken. A consultation on items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care (21 July - 21October 2017) sought views on the principles of restricting the prescribing of medicines which are readily available OTC . This consultation i ncluded 5554 online responses, 195 written responses and 25 engagement events and meetings. A communication and engagement plan was developed to ensure that individuals, key groups, charities and local and national organisations were able to contribute tow ards the consultation. A further consultation on the proposals for Conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care : guidance for CCGs was undertaken from 20 Dec ember 2017 - 14 March 2018. This consultation included 2,638 online responses, 65 written responses and 21 engagement events and meetings. A communication and engagement plan was developed to ensure that individuals, key groups, charities and local and national organisations were abl e to contribute towards the consultation. A series of meetings with national patient groups including: Patient Association, National Voices and Healthwatch England further shaped the OTC proposals and communication and engagement plan prior to the start o f a further 12 week public consultation on draft CCG guidance for 'Conditions for which over the counter (OTC) items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care '. A webinar with the Health and Wellbeing Alliance (consisting of a number of national c harities) was also used to plan relevant consultation engagement. In developing the proposals and final guidance , we have taken account of all consultation results alongside advice from a clinical working group. Membership of the OFFICIAL 16 clinical working group include: NHS England , NHS Clinical Commissioners PrescQIPP CIC, NHS Business Services Authority , CCG representatives, Royal College of GPs , Royal Pharmaceutical Society , Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, GPC. 12. Which stakeholders and equalities and health inclusion groups were involved? See communications and engagement plan and final report of the consultation for full list of stakeholders involved in addition to those mentioned in section 11. 13. Key information from the engagement and involvement activities undertaken. Were key issues, concerns or questions expressed by stakeholders and if so what were these and how were they addressed? Were stakeholders broadly supportive of this work? There were mixed views from stakeholders. Broadly there is an acceptance of the objectives of this work and a number of CCGs have made changes reflecting the direction of this work. Stakeholders seem to broadly accept that the NHS needs to get the most value fr om its prescribing and wider budgets and that this requires change. There are some stakeholders that have specific concerns about how changes could impact on specific groups as outlined in section 8. A number of professional bodies contributed towards the consultation and provided views and insight on potential impact of restrictions of prescrip tions for minor conditions . A number of these organisations (Royal College of GPs, Royal Pharmaceutical Socie ty, and General Medical Council) expressed concerns about the impact of any restrictions widening health inequalities . Concerns on the impact on vulnerable groups, such as older age groups, patients with disabilities, patients in rural areas, patients with capacity problems, people living in poverty or those needing help from carers were also raised. RPS felt that principle 2 of the NHS Constitution clearly states that \"Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individual's ability to pay\" an d that restrictions could fundamentally alter the principle that care is free at the point of delivery. A number of national patient organisations also contributed towards the consultation and they reinforced the need to engage with patient groups who wou ld be potentially impacted, during further development of the proposals. Healthwatch England also ran a survey to gather people's views on NHS prescriptions which highlighted some concerns about how respondents felt they would be affected financially, if O TC items were no longer made available on NHS prescription. The Self -care F orum also contributed that they support the view that encouraging people to understand how to confidently treat their minor conditions is beneficial. Although they also raised conce rns that withdrawing prescriptions for products might adversely affect vulnerable groups, such as those on a low income including people out of work and the elderly. These concerns were considered during further development of the proposal s for the 12 week consultation undertaken December 2017 - March 2018. Again there were OFFICIAL 17 mixed views from stakeholders from this consultation including: The BMA shared concerns that the proposals will particularly disadvantage vulnerable patients, such as older age groups, patients with disabilities, rural patients, patients with capacity problems including dementia and learning difficulties, people living in poverty or those needing help from carers. They went on to say that a lthough the consultation recognises that arrangements would be made for continued provision of medications to some vulnerable patients, GPs would be placed in the unacceptable position of having to make value -judgements about the likelihood of patients being able to access the required medication if an FP10 is not provided, and errors of judgement, complaints, and missed -treatments would be inevitable. Healthwatch England raised concerns from the ir members that t hose from low income backgrounds are more likely to lose out. The Patients Association stated that they were concerned that these proposals have the potential to widen health inequalities for people who cannot afford to buy even cheap over the counter med icines, and who would be in receipt of free medicines under current arrangements. These comments should be considered in the context of the wider themes for the item (see consultation report, Mar ch 2018). Concerns are mitigated through the development of exceptions in the guidance , particularly for vulnerable groups . 14. Stakeholders were not broadly supportive but we need to go ahead. Stakeholders are broadly supportive. Whilst there is general support for consulting on this topic (65% agreed with our proposed criteria to assess items for potential restriction), feedback from patients and patient organisations has highlighted that considerations must be made for those wit h long -term conditions who require a large supply of over the counter medicine and that the de -prescription of these items could result in patient compliance and clinician monitoring issues. The more recent consultation also demonstrated that large propo rtions of online respondents were in agreeance with the proposals. Concerns raised by stakeholders are covered in section 13 and appendix B. All feedback has been considered during further development of the CCG guidance including the exceptions where many of the groups concerned are accounted for . 15. Further engagement and involvement activities planned. Are further engagement and involvement activities planned? If so what is planned, when and why? OFFICIAL 18 NHS England undertook a 12 week public consultation to allow other groups and individuals to comment on the proposals. This involve d a web survey plus further consultation activity designed to ensure that people ha d the opportunity to provide their views. This also involve d working with our current ly ident ified stakeholders, other charities and patient groups. PART E: Monitoring and Evaluation 16. In relation to equalities and reducing health inequalities, please summarise the most important monitoring and evaluation activities undertaken in relation to this work As part of the consultation we asked specific questions on if respondents felt th ere were any groups, protected by the Equality Act 2010, likely to be disproportionately affected by this work? . The results were considered during further develo pment of the guidance . Results of these consultation question s can be seen in appendix B. 17. Please identify the main data sets and sources that you have drawn on in relation to this work. Which key reports or data sets have you drawn on? BSA data sets on OTC prescriptions (June 2016 - May 2017) Items that should not be routinely prescribed in primary care consultation final report (Nov ember 2017) Items that should not be routinely prescribed in primary care communication plan Items that should not be routinely prescribed in primary care consultation engagement plan Conditions for which over th e counter items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care: A Consultation on guidance for CCGs Conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care consultation final report (March 2018) Conditions for which over the counter items should not routinely be prescribed in primary care consultation engagement plan 18. Important equalities or health inequalities data gaps or gaps in relation to evaluation. In relation to this work have you identified any: important equalities or health inequalities data gaps or gaps in relation to monitoring and evaluation? Yes No There is currently no nationally collected data for all of the protected characteristics and additional health improvement groups for the individual medications in this review. OFFICIAL 19 The OTC prescribing data includes some spend on OTC items for which no one specific condition can be assigned. However as all these items are available OTC and are likely prescribed for minor conditions that are suitable for self -care; these items and their associated spend has been included within our guidance and this report . 19. Planned action to address important equalities or health inequalities dat a gaps or gaps in relation to evaluation. If you have identified important gaps and you have identified action to be taken, what action are you planning to take, when and why? In having regard to our guidance and considering local implementation plans, CCGs will need to identify the appropriate local actions to address inequalities or data gaps. OFFICIAL 20 20. Contributing to the first PSED equality aim. Can this work contribute to eliminating discrimination, harassment or victimisation? Yes No Do not know If yes please explain how, in a few short sentences 21. Contributing to the second PSED equality aim. Can this policy or piece of work contribute to advancing equality of opportunity? Please circle as appropriate. Yes No Do not know Without this review and future implementation by CCGs, inequalities to the wider population are likely due to unnecessary variation in prescribing and use of NHS funding on medications which are shown to treat self -limiting conditions (those that heal on t heir own accord) and items with for which there is little evidence of clinical effectiveness. Funding used on these products may result in CCGs decommissioning other evidence based and cost effective treatments . Not undertaking this work could result in inequality for the wider population by not making most effective use of the NHS prescribing budget and NHS budgets more generally. 22. Contributing to the third PSED equality aim. Can this policy or piece of work contribute to fostering good relations between groups? Please circle as appropriate. Yes No Do not know The working group includes representatives from NHSCC, CCG medicines optimisation teams, NICE and others . We are also working with other stakeholders as described in section 12. The common aim is to ensure that the CCG guidance we have developed supports CCGs in effective medicines optimisation for the population they serve. Fostering of good relationships w ill also be enhanced through engagement with a number of other stakeholders including charities and patient groups. The consultation also provides an opportunity for organisations, health professionals, patients and the public to be considered in the devel opment of the CCG guidance. OFFICIAL 21 23. Contributing to reducing inequalities in access to health services. Can this policy or piece of work contribute to reducing inequalities in access to health services? Yes No Do not know Currently patients may see a GP to obtain an item for a minor condition. Restricting OTC items for minor conditions, and encouraging self -care should reduce GP time on administering prescriptions and should indirectly mean that more GP appointments are likely to become available to other patients for more serious conditions. By encouraging people to self -care, more people may also access community pharmacy which was highlighted by respondents as an under -utilised health service. 24. Contributing to reducing inequalities in health outcomes. Can this work contribute to reducing inequalities in health outcomes? Yes No Do not know It could reduce inequalities in health outcomes for the overall population (see section 21). Although it has also been suggested that the impact of the proposals on certain groups could lead to a widening in inequalities in health outcomes if patients in particular groups cannot access or afford items they are encouraged to purchase. It should however be noted that there are a number of exceptions that should cover this group of patients when required. 25. Contributing to the PSED and reducing health inequalities.

Key results for these questions are also r eported. 1. Do you feel there any groups, protected by the Equality Act 2010, likely to be disproportionately affected by this work? Table 6 - Responses to consultation question 'Do you feel there any groups, protected by the Equality Act 2010, likely to be disproportionately affected by this work? ' (n = 2594 ) Response Percentage Yes 37 % No 50 % Unsure 13 % Figure 4 - Responses to consultation question 'Which groups do you think will be affected' The relevant key themes reported from the further information for this question include: Long term/chronic conditions Elderly Concerns on affordability/those on a low income House bound Those with problems accessing a pharmacist e.g. rural areas , those with limited transport options Travellers, homeless people and asylum seekers BME communities and those with poor English Carers and those they care for People with a l ack of personal capability to self -care 2. Do you feel there is any further evidence we should consider in our proposals on the potential impact on health inequalities experience by certain groups e.g. people on low incomes; peop le from BME communities?

Other groups suggested to be included in the general exceptions (only those not already specified are listed here) Patients with other illnesses / conditions some of who currently do not get free prescriptions (e.g. diabetes, life limited conditions, cancer, MS, Parkinsons disease, degenerative conditions, etc.) Elder ly patients/ those who qualify for a pension Children under 18 years old Those exempt from paying for prescriptions/ eligible for free prescriptions OFFICIAL 37 4. The consultation also provided an opportunity for responders to say if they agreed or disagreed with th e proposals for each of the conditions. The following conditions specific themes relating to specific groups were raised: Limited evidence of clinical effectiveness Probiotics Beneficial in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Autism often results in gut issues where probiotics may be valuable Vitamins & minerals Consider those who are unable to access a healthy diet (e.g. low income, disabled, vegans) Consider excluding some cohorts from these recommendations (e.g. alcoholics) Rare disease s Patients with other long term conditions Vitamins are vital for pregnant women Babies and young Children should continue to receive their treatments (Vitamin D drops) BME groups , where there may be a strong case for prescribing certain vitamins & mineral s to maintain good health (e.g. Vitamin D) Self-limiting conditions Conjunctivitis Children require extra care and should be prescribed treatment Cradle cap Children's health issues can have an impact on the mental health of parents Infant colic Children require extra care and should be prescribed treatment Children's health issues can have an impact on the mental health of parents Mild cystitis Cystitis is more common in women, therefore it will affect them more acutely than males Minor Ailments Diarrhoea (adults) Consider impact of not treating on vulnerable groups (e.g. elderly) Head lice Consider the impact on those on low income/ lower socioeconomic background and their ability to purchase the medication they, or their families need OFFICIAL 38 Hayfever Consider the impact on those on low income/ lower socioeconomic background and their ability to purchase the medication they, or their families need Nappy rash Consider the impact on carers who may not be able to buy items for those they care for or may not be allowed to administer OTC medication. Oral thrush This proposal adversely affects babies/children Exception should be given for those with long -term conditions (e.g. diabetes) Exception should be given for those taking medications that cause or limit the treatment of oral thrush (e.g. antibiotics, warfarin) Prevention of dental caries This proposal adversely affects vulnerable groups (e.g. children) Threadworms Treatment should be available for vulnerable groups (e.g. children) Consider the impact on those on low income/ lower socioeconomic background and their ability to purchase the medication they, or their families need Although these themes relate to equalities and health inequalities, they should be considered in the conte xt of the wider themes for the it em (see consultation report, Mar 2018 ). Some organisations, associations and societies responded to the initial consultation raising concerns about some form of discrimination for some or all of the groups mentioned in the Equality Act 2010. They were the Patients Association, National Association of Patient Participation (NAPP), Friends, Families and Travellers (FF T), Age UK, UK Health Prevention Forum, Leukaemia Care, Humanists UK, Thyroid UK, Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, Middlesex Pharmaceutical Group of Local Pharmaceutical Committees, Dorset LPC, British Medical Association, National Pharmacy Association, Bayer, Pfizer UK, Dermal Laboratories Ltd, Company Chemists Association (CCA) and Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. NICE did not feel that any groups, protected by t he Equality Act 2010, were likely to be disproportionately affected by this work; nor does it feel that there is any further evidence NHS England should consider in their proposals on the potential impact on health inequalities experienced by certain group s.
