Hib conjugate vaccines confer protection by eliciting serum anticapsular antibody and priming for immunologic memory. Therefore, compelling proof of efficacy would be demonstration that a combination vaccine primes for memory and elicits antibody responses that are not inferior to those elicited by other US-licensed Hib conjugate vaccines, not necessarily the specific Hib component used in the combination. Vaccinated infants also can be considered protected if their serum anticapsular antibody concentrations are 0.15 m g/mL immediately before the booster dose given in the second year of life, when antibody concentrations are lowest. These alternative serologic approaches offer a strong scientific and regulatory rationale for licensure of effective DTaP-based Hib combination vaccines.
