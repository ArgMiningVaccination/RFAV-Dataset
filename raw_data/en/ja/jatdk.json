However, many people don't realize that a horse's back is not designed to carry a load. When a horse carries a rider or a load, it must use its muscles and balance in unnatural ways. While horses are highly adaptive animals, pain, injuries and reduced performance can often occur. Enter the equine chiropractor. What Does an Equine Chiropractor Do? An equine chiropractor (often called a horse chiropractor) practices spinal manipulation or other manual therapy on horses, similar to chiropractic treatments provided to humans. Equine chiropractors typically work in tandem with veterinarians to provide a holistic approach to equine health. Some equine chiropractic practitioners are also veterinarians. Equine chiropractic complements traditional veterinary medicine and offers a path to heal certain ailments and musculoskeletal irregularities without the use of drugs or chemicals. While traditional veterinary medicine focuses primarily on diagnosing and treating illnesses, diseases and acute injuries, equine chiropractors focus on restoring balance to the horse's body and assisting the body to heal naturally. Goals, treatments and desired outcomes in equine chiropractic are similar to those for humans. The patient is just a bit larger. Equine chiropractors are extremely effective in treating horses who exhibit health problems such as: - Difficulty bending or flexing - Obvious back or neck pain - Signs of resistance, such as bucking, rearing and tail swishing - Uneven gaits - Stiffness - Many other physical difficulties or changes in behavior Equine chiropractic therapies involve using manual force on various points on the horse's body to bring the underlying structures back into normal alignment. Ideally, this will restore the area of focus to normal function and range of motion. Some equine chiropractors may enhance their treatment with other therapies, such as infrared light, massage, myofascial release (relaxing contracted muscles), acupuncture or acupressure, therapeutic touch or stress-point therapy. Complementing Veterinary Care Traditional veterinary treatments sometimes fail to improve the health or wellness of a horse, especially when pain or physical ailments are somewhat vague. Equine chiropractic offers additional diagnoses and treatments for many equine musculoskeletal disorders. Equine chiropractors can often detect subclinical conditions (those not yet causing clinical signs) or abnormal mechanics that may progress to more significant issues. Equine chiropractic can also be called on to treat equine health conditions that are recurring or not responding to conventional veterinary treatment. This might include treatment following recovery from a significant injury or trauma. An equine chiropractor may also be able to help enhance the health and growth of horses in training, whose muscles and skeletal systems are being tested and pushed. Overall, the benefits of equine chiropractic are often greatest when used in conjunction with traditional veterinary care as a preventive approach to keeping a horse balanced and performing at its best. Read on if an equine career as an equine chiropractor might be right for you.
