Ayurveda, an ancient system of longevity from India, has a long-established practice of cleansing in the spring and fall. Unlike other \"one-size-fits-all\" cleanses that focus on the physical body, ayurveda holistic cleanses are precisely designed to match the needs of the individual; they aim to return your body, mind and consciousness to balance. WHY CLEANSE Stress, wrong diet, depleting lifestyle, repressed emotions, seasonal changes and environmental pollutants impact our state of balance. When we are imbalanced, our agni (digestive fire or metabolism) becomes impaired which can result in unprocessed food, thoughts or emotions. Unprocessed foods, thoughts and emotions create ama (physical and emotional toxins). Ama is a sticky glue-like substance that enters the blood stream and clogs channels as it accumulates throughout the body. If left unchecked, it eventually results in disease. Seasonal cleansing, can remove ama. Seasonal cleansing kindles agni and draws physical and emotional ama out of the deep tissues and into the GI tract for elimination. This restores balance to our body and mind allowing for natural cellular rejuvenation. The immediate benefits are a feeling of a calm mind and an energized body. BEST TIME TO CLEANSE Seasonal transitions - especially spring and fall - are the best times to cleanse. Spring cleansing will flush stagnant physical and emotional energy and ama accumulated during the winter months. It prepares you for new growth for the year ahead. Cleansing during the fall removes excess heat in the body accumulated during the summer and prepares the body for winter. Seasonal cleanses can set in motion the following actions: Elimination of toxins (physical and emotional) from your body Strengthening of the immune system (via kindling agni and resetting the internal clock) Removal of mental stress (restoring deep relaxation and mental clarity) Cellular regeneration (resulting in a youthful glow and vigor) TRADITIONAL CLEANSE ROUTINE An ayurveda cleanse is precisely tailored to the individual and supervised by an Ayurveda Practitioner. Each individual receives a specific cleanse program designed by the Ayurveda Practitioner. A complete cleanse consists of three phases: preparation, cleanse therapies and rejuvenation therapies. The preparation phase and rejuvenation phases are essential elements to the program and are the key to lasting positive change. A mono-diet of kitchari (a stew made of mung dal and basmati rice) is typically recommended during the cleanse. The kitchari recipe is modified depending on the season and the individual. Kitchari is light and easy to digest. It stokes the digestive fire, which, during a cleanse, is busy processing ama that has been pulled into the GI tract. Herbal tonics, teas and ample water throughout the day are also advised to facilitate the process. The ancients viewed foods, spices and herbs as medicine; these were strategically used in alignment with the season and individual's constitution to maximize cleanse results. The cleanse was done in a setting that cultivated internal peace and clarity. Unplugging from the daily routine and spending time walking in nature, meditating, journaling, doing [yogic breathing exercises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4BA2oQZBA) and restorative yoga helped to remove mental toxins and restore a sense of calm. By removing physical impurities and releasing destructive thought patterns and behaviors, the body, mind and spirit are rejuvenated. The beauty of this holistic approach is that by working in sync with the rhythms of nature, our body \"resets\". The body intuitively adapts to this restored state of balance. With a renewed sense of awareness, you will instinctively seek healthier diet and lifestyle choices creating lasting results.
