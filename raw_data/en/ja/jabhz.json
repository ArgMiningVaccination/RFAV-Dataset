Dear Sir In reply to John Stone: <<<<<<<<With all due deference to Hilary Butler is the problem lack of institutional memory or is it selective choice of evidence? In the chain of evidence those parents who report iatrogenic events simply - against all ethical or medically sound practice - have to be pushed out of the way, while official science takes place in a solipsistic vaccuum. Camille Clark may have excellent hearing but she is also very careful who she listens to. >>>>>>>> On the one hand, we have people at the cutting face, the parents and the teachers, and the communities, and the psychologists run off their feet, with, what is to them, a real, increasing, evolving problem. These people, faced with the realities of the changes in their roles as teachers, nurses, parents etc, are being asked to believe that really, they are kidding themselves? Perhaps their rampant relatives who went awol, or rampaged over mountain, or were \"eccentrics\" were really... autistic. Perhaps they were called something else, out of convenience. Obviously, teachers are stupid. And parents, who say none of their forebears were autistic, are liars. After all, Einstein's gonads weren't much good, and much of his family were \"queer\". I can understand this. After all, diphtheria, until the early 1900s, included all forms of croup. It was only in an effort to prove the efficacy of the diphtheria toxin-antitoxin, that a concerted effort was made to separate the croup from the diphtheria, because that then made the toxin-antitoxin look the best thing since sliced bread. The argument that Aspergers are often diagnosed as Autistic in order to avail them of benefits has its parallels in Polio. Those well versed in the medical literature can provide all the articles showing that in the 50's, doctors often diagnosed non-paralytic polio (that which would be non -paralytic by today's diagnosis) as paralytic, for two reasons. It justified quarantining the family (to fit the social psychohysteria of the time) , and allowed the family to have access to health funding to feed, clothe etc the family until such time as the \"family muzzle\" was removed. In my extensive polio archives I have many articles discussing the fact that 99% of paralytic polio cases would resolve within a week, with no residual damage, at that point, let alone at 60 days. So the medical profession has always suited themselves as to how they diagnose things. This happens, even now, in the country with regards people damaged or injured in the public health system. Whereas all hospital admissions and deaths are usually admitted to in the official yearly statistics, the figures for medical error, iatrogenic anything, and hospital infections are withheld. On the grounds, according to one newspaper article, that the Health Department doesn't want the public to \"misunderstand\" anything. So yes, if you use medical data, and especially, \"cooked\" medical history, then you have to accept that one sign of epidemiological times is that, indeed, data can be massaged, manipulated, skewed and jury-rigged to mean exactly what the data-constructor wishes it to say. The problem with that, is that most people assume that medical history is accurate, when it is not. So, when the medical profession says that X drug wiped out X disease, public believe that, when actually the situation is far more complex than that. Usually WHEN you have to look at that data in the historical sense, it doesn't make sense. Because if you know the truth you could then say: \"Well, the data on Diphtheria is nonsense, because it included all forms of croup, and sometimes other respiratory disorders, such as suppurative tonsillitis, and so, by dividing up the data later, that makes it look like Diphtheria took a plumetting, when, what actually happened, was that doctors became more accurate in diagnosis. So the EXTENT of the historical statistical decline is an artificial construct. It's not nearly as \"dramatic\" as the graphs show. Same with Polio. You could say that the American historical mountain of paralytic polio treated at home (as opposed to the well publicised cases in hospitals and on iron lungs) is also a constructed artefact. Had the diagnosticians been forced to adhere to today's standards, and only that data provided we would see that the current showing a steep decline (which is \"of course\" due to a vaccine), is actually a dubious, crafted manipulation. Which is perhaps why the United States Polio Surveillance Units data, from 1954 to 1963 are no longer in most medical libraries. They are... mysteriously.. absent. And which is why, in my opinion, most people have never had explained to them, why, after the Salk vaccine was dropped everyone had to have a full, new course, of the Sabin vaccine. At a point where polio had declined, 90 something percent, a couple of years before. But because people don't know the truth, then haven't the means to think it out for themselves. The same applies with the argument on Autism. Various groups, for whatever reason, are massaging data, and reconstructing history and explanations, to suit their viewpoints. I know what the US Polio Surveillance Units stats say, courtesy of a doctor who provided them. Were they available to all medical historians it would be interesting to sit back and watch the arguments as statisticians from the Health Department tried to justify the historical statements about polio vaccines. The problems with using ANY historical arguments to say that Autism has always been around at the rates that it is now, and using Einstein, and other anecdotes to back it up, is that they are unproveable, because we can't go back in time to check out why people \"constructed\" the data to suit themselves, or whether Einstein's \"schizophrenic\" child was actually schizophrenic. Camille tells us why they mash the data NOW, but who is there to tell us why or how, they did it then? Of what relevance is that to teachers at the coal-face? When we talk about \"data\", or \"choice of evidence\" in the medical sense, we are talking epidemiology and semantics. As the famous saying goes \"Epidemiology is like a bikini. What is revealed is interesting. What is concealed is crucial.\" Semantics is the 'art' of medicine. Just look at how any article is written. Doctors are the masters of multi-facetted words, and hedging bets. \"Seems to be\", \"could have been\" \"either\" \"or\". Rarely do you see anything definitive, except when it comes to public propaganda. That has ever been the case. Though it is changing. I've kept immunisation brochures from years back. My favourite is one that says \"Be wise, Immunise\" at the top, and at the bottom \"Immunisation means you won't get it.\" These days, while the first statement is still used, as its such a cute sound bite, they have realised its very stupid to use the second one. But they still come out with pearlers. Like a notice put onto an Auckland medical school's notice board addressed to General Mangers/Business Managers by the Occupational Health Service, about the flu vaccine which said: \"The vaccines are accepted as being effective, provided the great majority of staff are vaccinated.\" (Come now, it either \"works\" for the individual, or it doesn't!) I couldn't resist relieving the notice board of such a magnificent example to add to my collection. In terms of \"who\" one listens to, just as it is easy for epidemiologists to \"construct\" data or make statements, (like the above statement) it is also easy for certain \"groups\" of people to construct explanations which means that responsibility for their predicament, can be blamed on forebears gonad, \"jeans\" ~ anything, but ~ not ~ something ~ that might actually mean a person has to really look seriously at an issue. So long as everyone feels that it \"just happens\" then its and acceptable variant of \"norm\". I go back to my original argument. Talk to older teacher, who taught for their whole, long, careers. When you teach children, you are dealing intimately with a brain, and teaching a brain how to think, extrapolate, read \"hidden\" social messages, behave appropriately, compute accurately, act on stage, etc.... The brain of any autism spectrum child is so unique as to be unmistakeable. While Autistics have difficulty in understanding the difference between them, and non-autistic people, because they cannot experience what they have not got, the reverse isn't the case. To non-autistic people, any person with any autistic spectrum sticks out more than a mile, not only because their body language reading abilities, word interpretation, and behavioural responses are limited, but also because of that, you can't teach autistic children in the same way, as you teach non-autistic people. Teaching autistic spectrum children, either mild or major, is hugely difficult. Something I don't think autistic people appreciate. Therefore...... One of the groups who will know whether an increase is real, or not, is NOT the epidemiologist, who manipulates data to suit their own needs and end, nor the group itself, as they cannot see themselves as others do, and may have a need to justify their \"justifications\". One of the groups who will know whether an increase is real, or not, are the people charged with trying to teach and educate \"that\" group. They are the ones at the coal face, who couldn't give a toss whether than child is diagnosed as having weta-faced-protrusion, or crocodile-cantering -disorder. All teachers know is that they \"have\" to get a result, not go by any diagnosis. They don't give a toss about \"labels\", because one autistic cannot be taught like another. They are all different, as are non-autistic people all different. As far as teachers are concerned, the epidemic is real. No amount of data massaging, or politically paliative pandering is going to change what they face, every day, when they step into the classroom. \"Choice of evidence\" is irrevelant when trying to reveal to autistics those things that come easily to non-autistics. A job that is nigh on impossible. Right now, many have their backs to the wall, and some are ready to climb over it, and run like mad. All of us as individual have the problem that our \"hearing\" is affected by the circles in which we moves, and the limitations of our ability to fully perceive other groups around us. Doctors and statisticians have similar problems. To admit a real increase might force them to question certain practices and procedures, be they historical or current. Teachers don't have that luxury. They have to deal with what is, not what they would like to perceive it to be. And they deal in numbers, classroom sizes, not in individual patients. They have to \"do\" a job. The do not construct either data, or diagnoses. Were Camille, or doctors or epidemiologists, to talk to Camille's teachers from the 1960's and 1970's, then talk to long term teachers today, they might hear another view point. The question is, whether they want to. Sometimes people get stuck in ruts. And you know the definition of a rut. \"A grave without an end\". That's why so much of medical history, doesn't say what it should do. Because people chose to write, only from the mindset, or viewpoint of their own little grave. Which makes it all the harder to sort out the real wood, from the real trees, in so many issues, not just autism. Were that not the case, there would be a lot less \"argument\" within medicine, and we'd not be here today, arguing \"this\", or any other toss. Hilary Butler. Competing interests: None declared Competing interests: No competing interests I agree the concept of \"vaccinating the vaccinators\" is a reasonable one - after all why should we subject strangers to a potential problem that we are unwilling to risk ourselves? Why not take this a step further, however, and ask the \"vaccinators\" to target those whose lives and health they cherish above all else, such as their own flesh and blood, namely their children? (hmm..been there, done that...) Competing interests: None declared Competing interests: No competing interests Jamie Robertson asks:\"SOMETHING has made these children desperately ill. My question to MMR apologists is: if it wasn't the jab, what was it?. He no doubt is aware that there are plausible autism theories aplenty, some of which are supported by a sound scientific evidence base. The fact that autism predated MMR should tell him that MMR cannot possibly be the sole cause (and even if we accept that there may have been a real rise in the number of cases in recent years this tells us nothing about the other possible causes). So much attention has been grabbed by the MMR issue that it threatens to derail other attempts to find the answers to the perplexing question. Unfortunately researchers and epidemiologists have concentrated on the first part of Robertson's question by attempting to show it \"wasn't the jab\". They have responded to public and media concern by carrying out expensive studies in a largely futile attempt to restore faith in the vaccine. (I say futile, because no matter what the results are, these exercises will never reassure those who are convinced of MMR's role in autism).The second part of Robertson's question: \"then what is it?\" has been neglected by comparison. I wonder how many other autism studies might have been funded into, for example, the dysregulation of the UBE3A gene expression, or a systematic analysis of dipeptidyl peptidase IV deficiencies, or the role of u-opioid neural receptors if the funding did not all seem to end up in the exonerate-MMR pot? The point is that MMR (nor anything else for that matter) can never be absolved from blame; no-one can prove a negative association. There are sufficiently powerful anecdotal reports of autism onset post-MMR to suggest it is a factor, albeit in a small minority of cases. Let us assume that in a predisposed/genetically susceptible individual, a cascade of events is triggered that will result in neural damage that manifests as autism/PDD. One of these possible events may be MMR, but then it might equally well be single measles vaccine or natural infections that are responsible. Clearly more work is needed, but I am concerned that the research agenda is being hijacked by the perceived need to address the MMR issue in particular. The continual focus on MMR to the exclusion of other factors is potentially detrimental to the field of autism research in general. The reluctance to vaccinate with MMR (to avoid a fraction of the cases of \"autism\" which occurs at an overall rate of about 3 per 10 000 person years) will merely result in natural measles infection at some point. This has an attendant 500 per 10 000 risk of otitis or pneumonia, 50 per 10 000 risk of fits, 10 per 10 000 risk of encephalitis (5 per 10 000 with permanent neurological damage) and an overall 10-20 per 10 000 risk of death. Even higher morbidity and mortality rates occur in a third world setting. One doesn't need a maths degree to see why the \"vaccinators\" recommend vaccinations. One response to this might be that few of those who have not had MMR have yet succumbed to measles. These unvaccinated children are reliant upon the herd immunity of their vaccinated companions, who still exist in considerable numbers. But this state of affairs is likely to be short lived if measles/MMR immunisation trends continue to decline. Competing interests: None declared Competing interests: No competing interests After reading John Stone's response (26 January) concerning the Smeeth article on Biomedcentral (1) I wondered if we had been reading the same study. It seems as though we were, but I am struggling to find any part of it that refers to \"the inadequacies of the General Practitioners Research Database\" or an indication that \"there was quite probably a real rise in autism during the period following the introduction of MMR.\" These may be his own conclusions, but they seem to be quite different to those of the authors. For the record, this is what the authors state: \"Contributing practices must meet a range of data quality criteria before they are included in the GPRD. The quality of the information in the database, including the completeness of recording of diagnoses made in medical facilities outside the practice, has been validated in a number of independent studies and has been found to be high. There is excellent agreement between prescribing data from the GPRD and national data from the Prescription Pricing Authority.\" They also explain that inaccuracies of diagnostic descriptions of different PDDs within the GPRD reflect changes in the definition of PDD and changes in the coding systems used to classify cases (and not inaccuracies within the GPRD). and: \"Much of the increase [in autism and other PDDs] may be due to better ascertainment related to changes in diagnostic practice and improved recognition of the conditions.\" (Indeed most of the paper is taken up with an explanation as to exactly why the authors think this is the case). One should not confuse a study's caveats with its conclusions. I am also unclear as to why Stone feels this study \"negates\" the authors' previous study (2) which is based on the same data set. (1) Smeeth L et al. Rate of first recorded diagnosis of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders in United Kingdom general practice, 1988 to 2001.

Camille Clark may have excellent hearing but she is also very careful who she listens to. Competing interests: Parent of an autistic child Competing interests: No competing interests I completely understand and agree with most of Alan Challoner's arguments. Especially regarding the apparent vulnerability of the developing infant, toddler and child. And that some \"abnormalities\" may not be seen until that particular system is needed to mature and function. However, I don't buy that children which are walking, verbally and physically communicating, terror free, potty trained etc. \"grow into a deficit\" of complete dependence without some external variable. Which coincidentally and often seems temporally related to vaccination schedules. Isn't that odd. Are we suppossed to believe regression from \"growing into a deficit\" is some form of a broader system oriented apoptosis per say. \"Programmed regression\"? \"Programmed disorganization\"? Sounds like a cop-out to me; especially as a neurologic system would be rather mature to be able to walk, talk, understand short phrases, be potty trained, eat independently etc. I actually think the challenge could accomplish a great many things. Given the outline I proposed, which could be customized, we could do a great deal of investigation into the effects/affects vaccines and adjuvants can have on the body. Effects/affects at a physiologic/biologic/histologic/neurologic/biochemical etc. level. Not just looking for vaccine induced antibodies which may or may not mean a whole lot. A style of research akin to Wakefield and Singh, but prospective and taken to the next level. A multi-system, multi-organ level; both broad and at the cellular level and biochemical level. For one example, pre, peri and post-innoculation brain imaging such as CT, MRI, EEG or PET studies would certainly reveal brain function prior to, during and post-innoculation. These types of clinical/biologic studies have been done on animals (primarily pertussis related) and on a small number of humans prior to the work of Wakefield, Singh etc. And they didn't paint a pretty picture. During the same time these studies were being done, guess what, the officianodos relied on epidemiology. I can certainly provide further details and references if desired. I'm willing to be a guinea pig as long as the staunch proponents step up to the plate first. After all, I'm not the one mandating vaccines and widespread non-consented research on our children. But nevertheless, I am still willing if it will help future generations. Shouldn't we first test the \"mature\" \"stabilized\" adult to see if they can handle the ever increasing to thousands of \"innocuous\" jabs, according to Salisbury and Offit? Especially before experimenting on vulnerable children or making such bold sweeping statements. Anyone in medicine knows that chidrens responses are much less predictable than an adult. I've included a rather brief follow-up period to accomodate, what I'll dub, chronic \"growing into vaccine damage\" deficits. It could certainly be extended and should with what Alan Challoner says. But is still better than the utterly perplexing current follow up of 72 hrs. Something that is obviously more related to political and legal issues than medical reasoning. Let's take Wakefield's, Singh's and others research to the next level. Let's look at the children, with consent, that are already being experimented on. Or, we can inject millions of children and wait, watch, twiddle our thumbs and then look at subjective behavior or a bunch of numbers from seriously flawed, manipulated or subjective data banks such as provided by big pharma, the GPD or VAERS to \"reassure\" public confidence and save face simultaneously. Only to be left scratching our heads wondering what on earth is going on with these medically \"unexplained\" symptoms. Parents of vaccine damaged children can then be left to pick up all of Humpty Dumpty's pieces while the King's horses and King's men cry foul and blame the parents in a slew of ways. All topped off with public scorn for questioning vaccines and going against the \"greater good\". When in reality, such families should be saluted, awarded a purple heart for serving their country and then placed on a stretcher and exhaustively helped. Competing interests: None declared Competing interests: No competing interests My apologies to those who have responded to my post and perhaps mis-understood me. I side with the 'anti-MMR' people in as much as, no matter how many meta-analyses or epidemiological studies are done, the fact is that there are children out there (in increasing numbers, it would seem) who are becoming severely ill when they get their MMR vaccinations; not only that, but these children are showing up with similar problems (ie. autism/ neurologucal signs, gut disorders, measles viruses popping up in places where they really shouldn't be). Those who are apologetic for MMR have failed (as far as I can see) to provide an explanation for this that does not point the finger at the MMR jab. My point was not that there is no science to show that children are suffering as a result of MMR vaccination - there is, indeed, evidence that points that way. What has not been forthcoming, as far as I can see, is scientific evidence that exonerates the vaccine as the cause of thes problems. SOMETHING has made these children desperately ill. My question to MMR apologists is: if it wasn't the jab, what was it? Competing interests: None declared Competing interests: No competing interests I must congratulate Alan Challoner (above 'Re: Re: The problem is lack of institutional memory' 25 January 2005) for discovering this study and agree with him that it is interesting, particularly because of its recognition of the inadequacies of the General Practitioners Research Database, and its acknowledgement that there was quite probably a real rise in autism during the period following the introduction of MMR, thus further negating the authors' previously published Lancet paper [1] which arrived amid immense publicity two months earlier. By contrast with that paper which was first item on the BBC News on the morning of 10 September 2004 [2] the existence of this one seems to have been first spotted by an expert in the field some two and a half months after its publication on 9 November 2004 (apparently submitted on 16 February 2004 as the storm clouds were gathering round Dr Wakefield). Could there possibly be any reason why they did not wish this study to receive as much publicity as the other?

[2] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3640898.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3640898.stm) Competing interests: Parent of an autistic child Competing interests: No competing interests I can understand the idea of 'vaccinate the vaccinators' but unfortunately it may not be a productive exercise. Vaccinations are usually given to children when their immunity is in an early state of development as well as is their neurological system. At that time in their lives vaccinations can have a very different effect to those that are given in later childhood or adulthood. The parts of the brain that are affected in autism or autistic spectrum disorder are amongst those that mature at a comparatively later period in the child's life than do others. Margaret Kennard described what came to be known as the Kennard Principle. [1] Her principle suggests that it is, \"better to have your brain injuries early\". This refers to the fact that the infant's brain is very plastic and early damage can be repaired by dint of other pathways being established. However, in the case of autism and its associated damage (including damage causing autism because of its location) those parts of the brain are not being called upon at the time of damage by vaccination (or other causes). Thus there is no immediate reparation called for by the system. Since formulated, this principle can be seen to explain why autistic features do not develop at the time the damage is caused. Sometimes deficits can be delayed or re-emerge or result in anomalous behaviour later on, depending on timing and brain location. [2] If, for example, an insult (which can either be acquired or genetically targeted to unfold) is to a region that has not yet matured, one may see behavioural disturbances only then when the anatomic substrate becomes critical for some neuropsychological function. This is what is called \"growing into a deficit.\" The phenomenon of \"growing into a deficit\" has been suggested, for example, as one of a number of possible explanations for the regression in functioning sometimes seen in cases of autistic spectrum disorders in children at around age 19 to 22 months. It is reasoned that the functions specific to the maturation of the limbic system's amygdala and hippocampus, considered to be affected in autistic individuals, become developmentally important. At around this age, the normal developing child develops representational memory, flexible accommodation schemes, and the ability to learn in novel situations, functions in part attributable to the maturing amygdala and hippocampus. Things might start to fall apart, it has been speculated, at a time when these brain areas, found to be too small with too densely packed cells and with reduced complexity of dendritic arbors in autistic subjects, are supposed to mature and subserve age-appropriate functions. [3] [4] [5] Similar factors may also determine late onset of other neurologic conditions that may have their origin much earlier in the perinatal period. For example, temporal lobe epilepsy may sometimes result from high forceps delivery, although seizures do not emerge until early adolescence. REFERENCES [1] Kennard, M. A. (1942).
