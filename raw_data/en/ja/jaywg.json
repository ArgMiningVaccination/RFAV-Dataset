C o m p l e t e d b y D a t e R T O G 0 8 1 5 11.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and Rationale (12/10/10) Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is a we ll-recognized treatment for prostate cancer1,2 and has been shown, as an adjunct to radiotherapy (RT), in multiple prospective randomized trials, to improve clinical outcomes including biochemical, local, and distant disease control as well as disease-free and overall survival.3-9 The majority of studies in which these benefits have been demonstrated included patients with high-risk, locally advanced, or, in some cases, node-positive disease. The most significant findi ngs produced by these clinical tr ials for high-risk patients are as follows: (1) patients in this population receiv ing ADT have improved out comes over those not receiving ADT, and (2) long-term (2 -3 years) ADT is superior to short-term (4 months) ADT. The mechanism of benefit of ADT in these pa tients remains unclear, but several potential explanations exist. First, although ADT is not regarded as a curative modality by itself, it may have the potential to eradicate subclinical, micros copic distant disease. Second, there may exist a synergistic relationship between RT and concurrent administration of ADT such that the response of local-regional disease, particularly that in the pelvic lymph nodes that typically receive significantly lower doses than those received by the prostate, is enhanced.10 Finally, the benefits of ADT in these patients may simply be a manifestation of compensating for what, in a percentage of patients, would be su boptimal definitive local therapy in the form of \"standard-dose\" (65-70 Gy) RT. This current RTOG phase III, prospective, random ized trial is designed pr imarily to define the magnitude of benefit for adding ADT to dose-esca lated RT specifically in the treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The study will allow this to be accomplished on several levels. For purposes of eligibility for this particular study, 3 intermediate-risk features have been identified: T2b-T2c disease, PSA >10 but 20, and Gleason score of 7. One or more of these risk features associated with a newly diagnosed prosta te cancer connotes clinicopathologic eligibility for this study. Patients with all 3 of these risk factors who additionally present with 50% of their sampled biopsy cores positive are believed to be at high risk for systemic progression and are excluded from this study. This study population represents a heterogene ous group, albeit all intermediate-risk by conventional criteria, and bias will be minimized by stratifying patients according to whether they harbor a single vs. multiple intermediate risk factors. While it is acknowledged that potential sources of bias (e.g., Gleason 7, 3+4 vs 4+311-14) are not directly account ed for, this schema is the most optimal and practical method for pot entially identifying which patients from this heterogeneous group stand to benefit from the addition of short-term ADT. In addition, by stratifying according to the multiple forms of do se escalation permitted on this study (external beam radiotherapy [EBRT], low dose rate [LDR] brachytherapy boost, and high dose rate [HDR] brachytherapy boost), it is hoped that differences in terms of the interaction of ADT with various radiotherapeutic techniques may be better unders tood. That is, is the lack of benefit with ADT suggested in prior brachytherapy series15-17 a patient selection, biologic, or technical phenomenon? Is it simply a dose escalation phenomenon? By allowing both dose-escalated EBRT and brachytherapy in this study and st ratifying patients accordingly, a greater understanding of this interplay should be elicited. Finally, a stratification variable will be added to account for patients' pre-existing comorbidity. The Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 (ACE-27) 18-20 will be used to describe any such conditions at levels of none, minimal, moderate, or severe with corresponding grades of 0,1,2,3, or 4, respectively , at the time of study entry. Prior prospective data have suggested minimal or no benefit to the addition of ADT to RT for patients with greater than moderate comorbidity on this scale (grade 2).21 The role of ADT in the intermediate-risk populat ion is not well defined, with ADT administration based largely on old practice patterns, physici an bias, and extrapolation of data from studies examining patients with different disease c haracteristics treated with older radiotherapy modalities and lower total doses. No prospectiv e, randomized data exist examining the use of ADT exclusively in an intermediate-risk prostate cancer setting. Likewise, there are no prospective, randomized data to define the role of ADT in the setting of dose-escalated RT for any patient population. The data yielded by this pr ospective, randomized clinical trial should result in a better understanding of the benefits of ADT in the intermediate risk patient population treated R T O G 0 8 1 5 2with a range of contemporary radiotherapeutic opt ions. This will allow for physicians to make more informed, objective decisions regarding t he use of ADT in this patient population and spare the morbidity of such therapy to patient su bgroups in which a benefit is not observed. Several prospective series have now shown clear benefits in terms of biochemical, local, and distant disease control comparin g \"dose-escalated\" to \"standar d-dose\" RT, illustrating the point that RT techniques used in earlier randomized studi es demonstrating the benefits of ADT in these patients were suboptimal by current practice st andards. A randomized dose-escalation study from M.D. Anderson has demonstrated, at 8 years of follow-up, im provements in biochemical and clinical disease progression (including distant metastases) for patients treated to an isocenter dose of 78 Gy vs 70 Gy.22 Massachusetts General Hospital has published a randomized trial that has demonstrated the benefits of delivering doses of 79.2 Gy vs 70.2 Gy while using proton beam therapy as a boost,23 and a randomized trial from the Netherlands has demonstrated an improvement in freedom from failure for patients receiving 78 Gy vs 68 Gy.24 Prospective, nonrandomized dose-escalation data from Memo rial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has suggested similar benefits in biochemical and clinical control and, despite the fact that this study was not randomized, suggests an advantage in terms of reduction in the risk of distant failure irrespective of whether or not short-te rm androgen deprivation therapy was used.25 These advantages conferred by dose es calation have been a result of more sophisticated imaging and treatment planning techniq ues that have resulted in the abilit y to not only increase dose delivery to the prostate, but also to enhance bladder and re ctal sparing with a concomitant reduction in the risks of acute and chronic toxicity.26 While the benefits of dose escalation are becomi ng better defined in the setting of EBRT, this has been a relatively recent phenomenon that has yet to be significantly evaluated in the setting of concurrent or adjuvant ADT. Dose escalati on, however, has been implemented for a longer period of time using brachytherapy techniques. It is therefore the brachytherapy series that provide the longest available follow-up with resp ect to the use of ADT in the setting of dose escalation. These series have pr ovided, to this point, only retros pective experiences, but multiple large reviews from different institutions ha ve suggested an equivocal or, in some cases, detrimental effect from the use of adjuvant ADT with brachytherapy (either HDR or LDR).15-17 Nonetheless, concurrent long-term ADT with RT remains standard treatment for patients with high-risk disease, and, more recently, published results of a prospectiv e study that included intermediate-risk patients suggest a possible benef it to short-term ADT for this patient subgroup.7 That is, do patients with organ-confined prostate cancer harboring moderately aggressive features such as a Gl eason score of 7 or a pretreatm ent PSA value of 10-20 ng/mL stand to benefit from the addition of ADT to definitive RT? The trial by D'Amico et al. focused on the role of short-term (6-month) ADT in conjunction wi th EBRT and suggested benefits in terms of biochemical control, cause-spec ific survival, and even overall survival. Once again, however, ADT was not administered in the setting of dose-escalated RT, and the trial included both intermediate- and high-risk patient s, thereby leaving many questio ns unanswered with respect to the use of ADT in the setting of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The result of the integration of the above data into clinical practice is a situation in which there have evolved two distinct practice \"standards\" for patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer treated primarily with radiotherapy, and those stan dards are the two randomization arms of this study. There is currently evidence supporting treatment with ei ther approach, but the fact remains that ADT remains untested in the setting of dos e-escalated RT. The question of whether or not the potential implications of ADT with respec t to quality of life and potential exacerbation of medical comorbidities are outweighed by increased cure rates of prostate cancer will remain unanswered until this issue is addressed in prospective, randomized fashion. 1.2 The Influence of Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), Fatigue, and Quality-Adjusted Survival (QAS) in Patients With Intermediate- Risk Prostate Cancer Receiving Dose-Escalated Radiotherapy 1.2.1 Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Some of the side effects associated with RT and ADT negatively affect HRQOL, and others may contribute to increased risks for serious health concerns. Urinary, bowel, and erectile dysfunction are well-known side effects of pel vic RT. Sexual side effects are the most well recognized adverse effects from ADT and include loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and hot R T O G 0 8 1 5 3flashes. Loss of libido is distressing to m any men, and they may not pursue treatments for erectile dysfunction that they may have otherwise pursued after radical prostatectomy or RT. The incidence of hot flashes, which may not abate over the course of ADT, is close to 80%. Physiologic effects, including gynecomastia, changes in body composition (weight gain, reduced muscle mass, increase in body fat) , and changes in lipids, are less commonly recognized as side effects of ADT. These effect s may lead to an exacerbation of potentially more serious conditions, such as hypertens ion, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.27 Loss of bone mineral density, anemia, and hair cha nges also may occur. Additionally, both the diagnosis of prostate cancer and the hormonal therapy can cause psychological distress. These side effects need more systematic study in clinical trials. Such studies would provide well-defined side effect profiles for better informing physicians of the far-reaching consequences of ADT and improve the awareness that they should incorporate into routine practice strategies for preventing and managing toxicities.28 ADT has been shown to have a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with asymptomatic lymph node positi ve prostatic carcinoma. One study showed significantly worse sexual, emotional, and physical function, with more hot flashes and worse overall HRQOL (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G] scale) in those patients, compared with patients receiving no therapy.29 To address HRQOL, RTOG 0815 will compare the treatment arms for differences in prostate cancer HRQOL outcomes (as measured by change over time in the Expanded Pr ostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC]) in a subset of patients in each treatment arm. Th e EPIC is a prostate cancer HRQOL instrument that measures a broad spectrum of urinary, bo wel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms related to RT and ADT.29 1.2.2 Fatigue Fatigue has been described as the most frequent and distressing symptom related to cancer and its treatment.30 RT-associated fatigue is a common early side effect reported by 80% of patients during treatment.31 There is evidence that cancer -related fatigue (CRF) has profound effects on ability to function in usual roles and activities and can linger for months or years after treatment completion.32-35 The high prevalence of this symptom in persons treated with RT, as well as its association with poor quality of life, mark it as a significant problem that requires further scientific study. The etiology of fatigue, its correlates, and pr evalence in the context of prostate cancer treatment are poorly understood. Past research suggests that irradiation of larger volumes was associated with more fatigue.34,36,37 Likewise, ADT has been associated with increased fatigue.38,39 Only a few studies have exami ned predictors or correlates of fatigue. In a sample of 28 men receiving EBRT and ADT, Truong35 found that age, Gleason score, PSA, T-stage, ADT duration, and RT dose and fraction did not pr edict severity of fatigue at the completion of treatment. In contrast, other investigators37 found that post-treatment fatigue was associated with baseline fatigue, role limitations, treatme nt type, and treatment location. Other fatigue correlates have been proposed: depression, poor sleep quality, and lack of regular physical activity.31,40,41 Thus, we plan to address such confounding factors with brief and focused questions. Of importance, no studies have compared the severity and correlates of fatigue in men receiving RT \u00b1 ADT. Also many of the prev ious studies were secondary analyses or had small subject samples. Because fatigue is a major problem associated with both RT and ADT, it would be informative to examine this common symptom in the context of a large clinical trial. The large sample would allow for the examination of pr edictors (demographic and treatment) of fatigue severity as well as the effect of fatigue on quality of life. Seco ndary hypotheses are that higher fatigue severity will be associated with poorer overall quality of life and that higher baseline fatigue, poorer performance status, and older age will predict hi gher fatigue severity during, at the end of, and following treatment. In order to minimize the potential impact of various confounding factors on fatigue, a secondary endpoint of this study, the following key inform ation regarding potential confounds will also be collected at the time of the PROMIS-fatigue short form (using limited questions to minimize patient burden): R T O G 0 8 1 5 4 Anxiety/depression item in EQ5D Muscle weakness question (scale of 1-5, from none to very much) Overall Sleep Quality: Item from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index:42 Level of physical activity (per GLTEQ) Sleep quality will be measured by 1 item (Q3) of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a self-rated questionnaire which measures sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-week or 1- month time period.42 The sum of the 19 items yields a global score which has been demonstrated to discriminate good and poor sleepers; also, it has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.83), stability (test-retest reliability=.85, P<.001) and discriminant validity. It has been used in patients with cancer and demonstrated sleep problems as expected. 42 Participants' level of physical activity will be assessed using t he Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ),43,44 which measures time spent per week in each of light, moderate, and vigorous activities. A score can be computed for each level of exercise. A total score is computed by summing the three levels weight ed by their respective metabolic (MET) equivalents of 3, 5, and 9. The GLTEQ ha s good test-retest reliability and has shown convergent validity with both objective and other self-report measures of physical activity.43,44 1.2.3 Quality-Adjusted Survival and Failure Free Survival In this study, the addition of short term ADT is hypothesized to improve overall survival (OS), while having a negative impact on HRQOL. As thes e are potentially competing advantages and disadvantages of ADT, it is useful to combi ne these factors into one equation, quality-adjusted life year (QALY). QALYs will be used to determine whether the potential benefits of the ADT, in terms of OS, outweigh the potentia l disadvantages of this strategy , in terms of a negative effect on HRQOL, compared to the RT only arm. Such a quality adjusted survival (or failure free survival) analysis can be invaluable to future patients faced with these treatment options. Quality-adjusted survival and freedom from prog ression can be defined by the weighted sum of different time episodes added up to a total QALY or failure free survival-year [U= sum of quality (qi) of health states K times the duration (s i) spent in each health state.45 ==K 1iiisq U The EQ-5D has been used across numerous disease sites. For example, the EQ-5D mean score for 95 patients with NSCLC (93% male, mean age 62 years) was 0.58 (SD 0.32) [on a scale of \"0\" death or worst possible health to \"1\" best possible health].46 The EQ-5D has been used to assess QALYs and the economic value of prostate cancer screening,47 and treatment of pain related to prostate cancer metastasis.48 Further, the EQ-5D was used in a recent study to estimate the economic value of the welfare loss due to prostate cancer pain by estimating the extent to which pain affect s HRQOL among patients with prostate cancer. Health status and economic outcomes were modeled among a well-defined population of 200,000 Swedish prostate cancer patients. Health utility ratings (u sing the EQ-5D) were obtained from a subset of 1,156 of the prostate cancer patients. A descripti ve model showed that optimal treatment that would reduce pain to zero during the whole ep isode of disease would add on average 0.85 QALYs to every man with prostate cancer. 49 1.3 Correlation of Circulating Proinflammatory Cytokines to Fatigue in Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer (12/10/10) As described above, fatigue is a major problem fo r patients treated with RT and ADT. A better understanding of biologic events correlated with fatigue in patients receiving RT and ADT may provide insight into the mechanisms of fatigue in these patients and as a result may provide possible avenues for intervention. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been found to play a role in cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and fatigue from other chronic illnesses.50 In this study, we will test the hypothesis that alterations in the circulating levels of the proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-1ra, IL-6 and the marker of inflammation C-reactive protein during RT for prostate cancer predict the likelihood of de veloping fatigue as measured by the PROMIS instrument. R T O G 0 8 1 5 5 Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been studied as possible markers of CRF. The most commonly implicated cytokines are IL-1, IL-6, TNF alpha, and IFN alpha.51 The mechanism by which these cytokines may cause fatigue or be correlated with fatigue is complex; however, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF alpha are known to stimulate the hypothalamic pituitary axis, which is also implicated in CRF. TNF alpha also plays a role in modulat ing central neurotransmission, another potential central mechanism of CRF. 52 Because many of the therapies used to treat canc ers can induce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it is possible that the cytokine rele ase caused by these therapies also correlate with the occurrence of CRF. Several small studies have addressed the issue of cytokine levels and their correlation with fatigue in patients receivin g RT. Ahlberg et al. evaluated 15 patients treated with pelvic RT to a dose of 46 Gy in 2 Gy fractions after hysterectomy.53 Fatigue was assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). Cytokine levels were assessed before starting RT, after 30 Gy, and within one week of RT. Fatigue scores were elevated at 30 Gy and at completion of RT. IL-1 remained undetectable at all time points. TNF alpha and IL-6 were increased in several patients at the time points du ring and at the completion of RT. IL-6 elevated in nearly half of patients, and levels decreased through RT in the remainder with a resultant negative correlation between serum IL-6 and fatigue in this small population. Unfortunately this is a small series of patients in whom surgical th erapy was the primary therapy, which is known to alter cytokine levels such as IL-6, CRP, and TNF alpha postoperatively. Geitnez et al. evaluated cytokine levels in 41 breast cancer patients t hat had undergone breast conserving therapy. Patients rated fatigue with the Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire and a visual analog scale of fatigue intensity before, during, and 2 months after RT; and at long term follow up. 54,55 Serum IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha were also measured at these time points. Fatigue was elevated on the visual analogue scale during RT; however, no change was noted on the Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire. IL-1bet a, IL-6, and TNF alpha did not change during therapy and did not correlate with fatigue. While several of the series that drew negat ive conclusions above found no increase in inflammatory cytokine levels with RT, several seri es have found striking elevations. For example, Akmansu et al. found significant elevations in serum IL-6 and TNF alpha after five weeks of RT compared to pretreatment levels in 34 pati ents receiving RT for head and neck cancer.56 Greenberg et al. found significant elevations in IL-1 in the early weeks of RT for prostate cancer in 15 patients which correlated with an increase in fatigue.57 Fatigue was assessed daily on a visual analogue scale. Patients were screened for depression during this study to rule out depression as a confounding factor. In contrast, the effect of ADT on inflammatory markers is less well known. Small studies have shown altered cytokine expression by prostate tumors after ADT,58 but levels of systemic cytokines after hormonal therapy for prostate ca ncer are not well described. Fatigue is a well- known complication of ADT for prostate cancer.59 The combination of RT and ADT for prostate cancer may result in a more persistent and prolonged fatigue compared to the series evaluating fatigue after RT alone, with as many as 32% of patients experiencing fatigue at the completion of RT and a substantial number experiencing fatigue as late as 6.5 weeks after completion of RT.35 Correlation of inflammatory cytokines to fatigue may provide mechanistic information regarding the causes of fatigue in these patients and may prov ide a target for intervention in future studies. Blood collection is mandatory for patients consenti ng to the QOL portion of this study and optional for other participants. It will be strongly recomm ended that patients consent to having a tissue block sent for storage to the RTOG Biospecim en Resource. Paraffin-em bedded tissue blocks of diagnostic prostate biopsies will be obtained from participating institutions and banked in the RTOG Biospecimen Resource for future translational analyses. Plasma and whole blood may be collected from patients enrolled on this protocol before and du ring protocol therapy and banked for future translational research analyses. Specif ically, plasma will be collected at baseline and during the last week of RT treat ments. Whole blood will be collect ed at baseline only. The tissue specimens will be collected and processed a ccording to the RTOG specimen processing guidelines and must be clearly labeled with the patient's case number. Anticipated analyses include correlation of whole genome single nucleot ide polymorphisms to incidence and severity of R T O G 0 8 1 5 6toxicity from therapy, and evaluation of circulatin g markers that may correl ate to patient reported outcomes. An example of one anticipated analysis is the evaluation of plasma cytokines for correlation to fatigue as measured by the PROMIS instrument in patients enrolled on this trial. Examples of cytokines that may be tested include CRP, TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-1ra, and IL-6. 2.0 OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary To demonstrate an overall survival (OS) advantage fo r the addition of short-term (6 months) ADT to dose-escalated RT for patients with intermed iate-risk prostate cancer. The events for OS will be defined as death due to any cause. 2.2 Secondary (12/10/10) 2.2.1 Determine whether the addition of ADT to dose-es calated RT improves clinical failures (local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant metast asis), biochemical failure by the \"nadir + 2\" (Phoenix) definition60, freedom from failure (the first occurren ce of clinical failure or biochemical failure by the Phoenix definition), rate of salv age ADT, and prostate cancer-specific mortality without resulting in increased non-prostate canc er-specific mortality over dose-escalated RT alone 2.2.2 Estimate the magnitude of benefit of ADT with re spect to OS for patients treated with different RT modalities (i.e., EBRT alone vs. LDR brachy therapy boost vs. HDR brachytherapy boost) 2.2.3 Compare acute and late treatment adverse events for patients re ceiving vs. not receiving ADT and correlate this with the presence or absence of pre-existing comorbidity as documented by the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 (ACE-27) assessment.18-20 2.2.4 Determine whether HRQOL as measured by the EPIC significantly worsens as a function of treatment assignment (i.e., ADT + RT compared to RT alone) 2.2.5 Demonstrate that the addition of ADT to dose-es calated RT is associated with higher fatigue severity than dose-escalated RT alone by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue domain 2.2.6 Demonstrate an incremental gain in OS with more aggressive therapy that outweighs the detriments in the primary generic domains of HRQO L (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depr ession), reported as QALY. 2.2.7 Determine whether the PROMIS score change is correlated with plasma cytokine change 2.2.8 Collect paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, plasma, and whole blood for future translational research analyses 3.0 PATIENT SELECTION NOTE: PER NCI GUIDELINES, EXCEPTIONS TO ELIGIBILITY ARE NOT PERMITTED 3.1 Conditions for Patient Eligibility (12/10/10) 3.1.1 Pathologically (histologically) proven diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma, at intermediate risk for recurrence, within 6 months prior to r egistration as determined by having one or more of the following intermediate-risk features: Gleason Score T2c. 3.1.1.1 Patients previously diagnosed with low risk (Gleason score < 6, clinical stage < T2a, and PSA < 10) prostate cancer under going active surveillance who are re-biopsied and found to have intermediate risk disease according to the protocol criteria are eligible for enrollment within 6 months of the repeat biopsy procedure. 3.1.2 Clinically negative lymph nodes as established by imaging (pelvic +/- abdominal CT or MRI), nodal sampling, or dissection within 60 days prior to registration, except as noted immediately below: 3.1.2.1 Patients with a single intermediate risk factor only do not require abdominopelvic imaging, but these studies may be obtained at the discre tion of the treating physician. Patients with 2 or 3 risk factors are required to undergo pelvic +/- abdominal CT or MRI. 3.1.2.2 Patients with lymph nodes equivocal or questionabl e by imaging are eligible without biopsy if the nodes are 1.5 cm; any node larger than this on imaging will require negative biopsy for eligibility. 3.1.3 No evidence of bone metastases (M0) on bone scan within 60 days prior to registration. 3.1.3.1 Bone scan is not required for patients enrolled wi th a single intermediate risk factor only, but this scan may be obtained at the discretion of t he treating physician. Patients with 2 or 3 risk factors will require a negative bone scan for eligibility. R T O G 0 8 1 5 73.1.3.2 Equivocal bone scan findings are allowed if pl ain film x-rays are negative for metastasis. 3.1.4 History/physical examination (to include, at a minimum, digita l rectal examination of the prostate and examination of the skeletal system and abdomen, and formal comorbidity assessment via the ACE-27 instrument) within 60 days prior to registration. Note : The ACE-27 is posted on the RTOG website, next to the pr otocol. Institutions may access a web-based Comorbidity PSA value perfor med with an FDA-approved assay (e.g., Abbott, Hybritech) within 60 days prior to registration 3.1.7.1 Study entry PSA must not be obtained during the following time frames: (1) 10-day period following prostate biopsy; (2) following initiation of ADT; (3) within 30 days after discontinuation of finasteride; or (4) within 90 days after discontinu ation of dutasteride. 3.1.8 For patients undergoing brachyther apy only: CBC/differential obtained within 60 days prior to registration, with adequate bone marrow function defined as follows: 3.1.8.1 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1,800 cells/mm3 3.1.8.2 Platelets 100,000 cells/mm3 3.1.8.3 Hemoglobin 8.0 g/dl (Note : The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb 8.0 g/dl is acceptable.) 3.1.9 Patient must be able to provide study-specifi c informed consent prior to study entry. 3.2 Conditions for Patient Ineligibility (12/10/10) 3.2.1 Patients with Gleason Score 8; PSA > 20; OR Clinical Stage T3 are ineligible for this trial. 3.2.1.1 Should findings of extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion be noted on prostate MRI, this study, if used, will not render patients ineligible for ac crual to this protocol. Primary tumor staging for eligibility purposes is to be based on palpable or core biopsy evidence only with respect to extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle involvement. 3.2.2 Patients with all three intermediate risk factors who also have 50% of the number of their biopsy cores positive for cancer are ineligible for this trial. 3.2.3 Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomat ous skin cancer) or hematological (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma) ma lignancy unless disease free for a minimum of 5 years (prior diagnoses of carcinoma in situ are permitted) 3.2.4 Prior radical surgery (prostatectomy), high-inte nsity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or cryosurgery for prostate cancer 3.2.5 Prior hormonal therapy, antiandrogens bilateral orchiectomy 3.2.6 Use of finasteride within 30 days prior to registration 3.2.7 Use of dutasteride within 90 days prior to registration 3.2.8 Prior or concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy fo r prostate cancer; prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is permitted. 3.2.9 Prior RT, including brachytherapy, to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of RT fields 3.2.8.1 Any patient undergoing brachytherapy must have transrectal ultrasound confirmation of prostate volume <60 cc, AUA score 15 within 60 days of registration, and no history of prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP ); prior TURP is permitted for patients who receive EBRT only) 3.2.9 Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows: 3.2.9.1 Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months 3.2.9.2 Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months 3.2.9.3 Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intr avenous antibiotics at the time of registration 3.2.9.4 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbat ion or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study ther apy within 30 days before registration 3.2.9.5 Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical j aundice and/or coagulation defects; note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation parameters are not required for entry into this protocol. 3.2.9.6 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for ent ry into this protocol. While the treatment R T O G 0 8 1 5 8employed in this study is not significantly imm unosuppressive, it is felt that a diagnosis of AIDS associated with prostate cancer is likely to impact this study's primary endpoint of overall survival. Patients who are HIV seropositi ve but do not meet criteria for diagnosis of AIDS are eligible for study participation. 3.2.10 Men who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception (e.g ., surgical, barrier, medicinal) during protocol treatment and during the first 3 months after cess ation of protocol treatment; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in th is study may be significantly teratogenic. 4.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATIONS/MANAGEMENT Note: This section lists baseline evaluations needed befo re the initiation of protocol treatment that do not affect eligibility. 4.1 Required Evaluations/Management (12/10/10) 4.1.1 AST or ALT <2 x the upper limit of nor mal within 60 days prior to registration 4.1.2 Alkaline phosphatase within 60 days prior to registration 4.1.3 Serum total testosterone within 60 days prior to registration 4.1.4 Any patient undergoing brachytherapy must hav e transrectal ultrasound confirmation of prostatic volume <60 cc and American Urologi c Association (AUA) symptom index composite score 15 within 60 days of registration. This may be performed before or after study enrollment. If a patient is thought to be a poo r brachytherapy candidate based on anatomy at the time of ultrasound, he may still participat e in the study but must receive EBRT only per protocol guidelines. If a patient is deemed an inadequate brachytherapy candidate after he has already been enrolled on the protocol, he will no longer be eligible for study participation. 5.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES Institutions that have been previously credentialed for prostate 3DCRT or IMRT on prior RTOG protocols and that have successfully irradiated a phantom and been approved by the RPC need not perform additional credentialing for RTOG 0815. However, res pective institutions may only administer treatment for which they have been previously credentialed (i.e., an institution credentialed for 3DCRT only may not administer IMRT on this study without completing the IMRT credentialing process). Credentialing requirements for IMRT and 3DCRT are spec ified in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 below. 5.1 Pre-Registration Requirements for IMRT Treatment Approach (12/10/10) 5.1.1 In order to utilize IMRT on this study, the institution must have met specific technology requirements and have provided baseline physics info rmation. Instructions for completing these requirements or determining if they already have been met ar e available on the Radiological Physics Center (RPC) web site. Visit http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc and select \"Credentialing\" and \"Credentialing Status Inquiry\". An IMRT phantom study with the RPC must be su ccessfully completed (if the institution has not previously met this IMRT credentialing requirem ent). Instructions for requesting and irradiating the phantom are available on the RPC web site at http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc/ ; select \"Credentialing\" and \"RTOG\". Upon review and successful completion of the phantom irradiation, the RPC will notify both the registering institution and RTOG Headquarters that the institution has completed this requirement. S ubsequently, RTOG Headqu arters will notify the institution that the site can enroll patients on the study. 5.1.2 The institution or investigator must either modi fy their existing Facility Questionnaire on file at RTOG or complete a new IMRT Fa cility Questionnaire, and submit it to RTOG for review prior to entering any cases, and set up an SFTP ac count for digital data submission. The Facility Questionnaire and SFTP account are available from the Image-Guided Therapy Center (ITC) via the ATC web site at http://atc.wustl.edu . Upon review and successful completion of the \"Dry- Run\" QA test, the ITC will notify both the regi stering institution and RTOG Headquarters that the institution has successfully completed this requirement. RTOG Headquarters will notify the institution when all requirements have been met and the institution is eligible to enter patients onto this study. 5.2 Pre-Registration Requirements for 3DCRT Treatment Approach (12/10/10) R T O G 0 8 1 5 95.2.1 Only institutions that have met the technol ogy requirements and that have provided the baseline physics information that are described in 3DCRT Quality Assurance Guidelines may enter patients onto this study. 5.2.2 The new Facility Questionnaire (one per inst itution, available on the ATC website at http://atc.wustl.edu ) or a modification to your existing Facility Questionnaire on file is to be sent to RTOG for review prior to entering any cases. Upon review and successful completion of a \"Dry-Run\" QA test, the ITC will notify both t he registering institution and RTOG Headquarters that the institution has succe ssfully completed this requirem ent. RTOG Headquarters will notify the institution when all requirements have been me t and the institution is eligible to enter patients onto this study. Institutio ns that have previously enrolle d patients on 3DCRT trials of this same disease site may enroll patients on this study without further credentialing. 5.3 Pre-Registration Requirements for Brachytherapy Treatment Approach Note: To be used on this protocol, low-dose rate brachytherapy sources must be listed on the joint RPC/AAPM source registry at http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc . Select \"Brachy Sources/Source Registry\". 5.3.1 Institutions must be pre-credentialed by t he Radiological Physics Center (RPC) prior to registering any cases to this study. The credentialing materials may be found on the RPC website at http://rpc.mdanderson.org under the \"Credentialing\" tab. 5.3.1.1 If an institution was credentialed for a RTOG prostate brachytherapy trial (98-05, P-0019, 0232, or 0526), not have to be re-credentialed for RTOG 0815 if the radiation oncologist and physicist are the same as on the approved credentialing request, and the institution is using the same seed model and planning system as on the approved credentialing request. A change of physician will require submission of the Knowledge Assessment Form and Clinical Test Case. A change in physicist will require submission of the Knowledge Assessment Form and the Reference Cases. A change in either the treatment planning computer or brachytherapy source model will require resubmission of only the Reference Cases. 5.3.2 LDR Brachytherapy Credentialing In order to use brachytherapy on this study, the institution must have met specific technology requirements and have provided baseline physics info rmation. Instructions for completing these requirements, or determining if they have already been met, are available at the RPC web site, http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc/ by selecting \"Credentialing\" and \"RTOG\". Brachytherapy institutions that have co mpleted the Knowledge Assessm ent Questionnaire, the Facility Inventory, and the Benchmark Ca ses, as described in the RTOG HDR Prostate Implant Quality Assurance Guidelines (see RPC web site http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc ) may enter patients onto this study. The sample clinical case wi th complete post implant data form and other materials are to be sent to the RPC. Upon review and successful completion, the RPC will notify both the registering in stitution and RTOG Headquarters that the institution has successfully completed this requirement. The RTOG RT Quality Assurance Department will then notify the institution that all requirements hav e been met and the institution is eligible to enter subsequent patients onto this study. Inst itutions previously credentialed for RTOG 0321 do not have to be re-credentialed for RTOG 0815. The first five cases from any newly-credential ed institution will be reviewed by the study co- chair for each respective RT modality to ensure protocol compliance with respect to target coverage, heterogeneity, and normal critical stru cture dose constraints. On ce an institution has demonstrated protocol compliance, future cases will be selected randomly for review. 5.4 Regulatory Pre-Registration Requirements 5.4.1 U.S. and Canadian institutions must fax copies of the documentation below to the CTSU Regulatory Office (215-569-0206), along with the completed CTSU-IRB/REB Certification Form, http://www.rtog.org/pdf_file2.html?pdf _document=CTSU-IRBCertifForm.pdf , prior to IRB/REB approval letter; (English language versions*) *Note : Institutions must provide certific ation of consent translation to RTOG Headquarters R T O G 0 8 1 5 10\u0083 IRB/REB assurance number 5.4.2 Pre-Registration Requirements FOR CANADIAN INSTITUTIONS 5.4.2.1 Prior to clinical trial commencement, Canadian institutions must complete and fax to the CTSU Regulatory Office (215-569-0206) Health Canada's Therapeutic Products Directorates' Clinical Trial Site Information Form, Qualified Investigator Undertaking Form, and Research Ethics Board Attestation Form. 5.4.3 Pre-Registration Requirements FOR NON-CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 5.4.3.1 For institutions that do not have an approved LOI for this protocol: International sites must receive written approval of submitted LOI forms from RTOG Headquarters prior to submitting documents to their local ethics committee for approval. See http://www.rtog.org/pdf_forms.html?members/forms=Intl_LOI_Form.doc 5.4.3.2 For institutions that have an approved LOI for this protocol: All requirements indicated in your LOI Approval Notification must be fulfilled prior to enrolling patients to this study. 5.5 Registration 5.5.1 Online Registration Patients can be registered only after eligibility criteria are met. Each individual user must have an RTOG user name and password to register patients on the RTOG web site. To get a user name and password: \u0083 The investigator and research staff must have completed Human Subjects Training and been issued a certific ate (Training is available via http://phrp.nihtraining.com/users/login.php ). \u0083 A representative from the institution must complete the Password Authorization Form at www.rtog.org/members/webreg.html (bottom right corner of the screen), and fax it to 215-923-1737. RTOG Headquar ters requires 3-4 days to process requests and issue user names/p asswords to institutions. An institution can register the patie nt by logging onto the RTOG web site ( http://www.rtog.org ), going to \"Data Center Login\" and selecting the lin k for new patient registrations. The system triggers a program to verify that all regulat ory requirements (OHRP assurance, IRB approval) have been met by the institution. The registration screens begin by asking for the date on which the eligibility checklist was completed, the i dentification of the person who completed the checklist, whether the patient was found to be eligible on the basis of the checklist, and the date the study-specific informed consent form was signed. Once the system has verified that the patient is eligible and that the institution has met regulatory requirements, it assigns a patient-spe cific case number. The system then moves to a screen that confirms that t he patient has been successfully enrolled. This screen can be printed so that the registering site will have a c opy of the registration fo r the patient's record. Two e-mails are generated and sent to the regist ering site: the Confirmation of Eligibility and the patient-specific calendar. The system creates a case file in the study's database at the DMC (Data Management Center) and generates a data submission calendar listing all data forms, images, and reports and the dates on which they are due. If the patient is ineligible or the instituti on has not met regulatory requirements, the system switches to a screen that includes a brief explanat ion for the failure to register the patient. This screen can be printed. Institutions can contact RTOG web supp ort for assistance with web registration: websupport@acr.org or 800-227-5463 ext. 4189 or 215-574-3189. In the event that the RTOG w eb registration site is not accessible, participating sites can register a patient by calling RTOG Headquarters, at (215) 574-3191, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET. The registrar will as k for the site's user name and password. This information is required to assure that mechani sms usually triggered by web registration (e.g., drug shipment, confirmation of registrati on, and patient-specific calendar) will occur. R T O G 0 8 1 5 116.0 RADIATION THERAPY Protocol treatment must begin within 4 weeks af ter randomization (administration of either RT alone [Arm 1] or RT + ADT [Arm 2]). Patients randomized to receive short-term ADT should begin RT 8 weeks after the first LHRH agonist injection. Note : As this protocol allows for treatment with exclusively EBRT or EBRT + brachytherapy (at the discretion of the treating physician) this must be sp ecified at the time of study enrollment. Should a patient who was originally intended to receive brachytherapy be found, post-enrollment, to be a poor brachytherapy candidate based on transrectal ultrasound examination, he will no longer be eligible for participation in this study. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to obtain ultrasound assessment of prospective brachytherapy patients before enrollment on this study. 6.1 Dose Specifications: 3D Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) or IMRT (12/10/10) 6.1.1 Dose will be th at exactly 98% of the PTV rece ives the prescription dose and will be scored as per protocol. The maximum a llowable dose within the PTV is 107% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03 cc. The minimum allowable dose within the PTV is >95% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03cc. 6.1.2 Patients treated entirely via EBRT shall receive prescription doses to the PTV (with the above constraints) of 79.2 Gy delivered in 1.8 Gy fracti ons. All attempts should be made to deliver the PTV dose with the above heterogeneity constraint s with adherence to the critical structure parameters listed below in Table 1. The PTV pr escription dose may be reduced by as many as two fractions (total prescription dose of 75.6 or 77.4 Gy) at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist only if felt that critical structure dose constraints cannot be met for that particular case at a prescription dose of 79.2 Gy . See Section 6.5 below for specifics regarding when to implement a dose reduction. The final prescription dose will be r eported specifically to the study coordinator and recorded on a patient-by-patient basis. Table 1. Critical Structure Dose Constraints Normal organ limit No more than 15% volume receives dose that exceeds No more than 25% volume receives dose that exceeds No more than 35% volume receives dose that exceeds No more than 50% volume receives dose that exceeds Bladder Constraint 80 Gy 75 Gy 70 Gy 65 Gy 60 Gy Penile Bulb Mean dose less than or equal to 52.5 Gy (See Section 6.5) Normal organ limit refers to the volume of t hat organ that should not exceed the dose limit. 6.2 Technical Factors 6.2.1 RT will be delivered with megavoltage equipment at energies 6 MV. 6.2.2 Patients who receive brachytherapy as a component of their RT will undergo EBRT implementing either 3DCRT or IMRT as described. The prostate and seminal vesicles will be treated to a dose of 45 Gy in 1.8 Gy frac tions prescribed to a PTV as above. 6.3 EBRT Localization, Simu lation, and Immobilization Simulation will be CT-based in all cases. The use of urethral contrast at the time of simulation is recommended but not requi red. Patients will be positioned supine on a flat tabletop with a customized thermoplastic immobilization cast or a molded foam cradle for stabilization and setup reproducibility. The degree of bladder fullnes s should be made to duplicate that which is anticipated for daily treatment, i.e., if the pati ent is instructed to maintain a full bladder for treatment, he should be simulated as such (especially for cases in which image guidance or adaptive treatments are not implemented). CT images should be acquired at a slice thickness of 3 mm from the top of the iliac crests superiorly to the perineum inferiorly. Target volumes (Section 6.4.1) and normal critical structures (Section 6.4.1.5) w ill be defined in the slices in which they are visualized. The 3DCRT cases must utiliz e \"beam's eye view\" representations to define final beam aperture. R T O G 0 8 1 5 126.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes 6.4.1 The definition of volumes will be in accor dance with the ICRU Report #50: Prescribing, Recording, and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy. 6.4.1.1 The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined by the physician as all known disease as defined by the planning CT, urethrogram, and clinical info rmation. If a urethrogram is used, the GTV will encompass a volume inferiorly 5 mm superior to the tip of the dye and no less than the entire prostate. Prostate dimensions should be defined as visualized on CT scan. 6.4.1.2 The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is the GTV plus areas considered to contain microscopic disease, delineated by the treating physician, and is defined as follows: CTV is the GTV (prostate) plus areas at risk for microscopic disease extension plus the proximal bilateral seminal vesicles. Only the proximal 1.0 cm of seminal vesicle tissue adjacent to the prostate shall be included in the clinical target volume.61 This 1.0 cm of seminal vesicles refers to both radial (in plane) and superior (out of plane) extent. If both prostate and seminal vesicle are visualized in the same CT slice, this seminal vesicle tissue will contribute to the 1.0 cm of tissue. 6.4.1.3 The Planning Target Volume (PTV) will provide a margin around the CTV to compensate for the variability of treatment set up and internal organ motion. A range of 5-10 mm around the CTV is required to define each respective PTV. Superior and inferior margins (capping) should be 5-10 mm depending on the thickness and spacing of the planning CT scan. Careful consideration should be made when defining the 5-10 mm margin in 3 dimensions. 6.4.1.4 The ICRU Reference Points are to be located in the central part of the PTV and, secondly, on or near the central axis of the beams. Ty pically these points should be located on the beam axes or at the intersection of the beam axes. 6.4.1.5 Normal Critical Structures to be defined on the treatment planning CT scan will include the following: bladder, rectum (from its origin at t he rectosigmoid flexure superiorly or the bottom of the SI joints, whichever is more inferior to the inferior-most extent of the ischial tuberosities), bilateral femora (to the level of ischial tuberosity), penile bulb, and skin. Any small bowel within the primary beam aperture should be defined as well. All structures will be contoured in their entirety as so lid organs. See the ITC web site ( http://atc.wustl.edu ) to view examples of target and normal tissue contours. The following table summarizes the naming of ta rgets and critical structures for submission of data to the ITC. Standard Name Description GTV Gross Target Volume CTV Clinical Target Volume PTV Planning Target Volume BLADDER Bladder FEMUR_LT Left 6.4.1.6 The PTV forms the entire target as described. No extension of fields to specifically treat regional lymph nodes is permitted. 3D confor mal beams will be shaped to include the entire PTV and minimize dose to surrounding critical structures as described. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using inverse planning is permitted with constraints placed to adhere to critical structure dose limitations as defined above. 6.5 Critical Structures (12/10/10) Critical structure dose constraints shall remain consistent with those represented in prior RTOG 3DCRT/IMRT prostate protocols (see Table 1 above) . While every effort should be made to deliver prescription doses to the PTV as specified while adhering to these constraints, it is R T O G 0 8 1 5 13recognized that certain anatomic al factors may prevent this. As mentioned in Section 6.1, a prescription dose reduction to a level of 77.4 Gy or 75.6 Gy is permitted if constraints cannot be met at a prescription dose of 79.2 Gy. For purpos es of compliance, up to a 5% absolute increase in the volume of critical structure receiving greater than the specified dose will be considered \"variation acceptable,\" e.g. up to 20% of the re ctum may receive a dose of > 75.6 Gy without a protocol deviation. Any increase in critical stru cture volume greater than 5% receiving more than the specified dose will be consider ed a \"deviation unacceptable.\" It is at this point that a dose reduction to 77.4 Gy or 75.6 Gy should be impl emented. The prescription dose should be the maximum deliverable up to 79.2 Gy while respecting the critical normal stru cture constraints. Of note, the penile bulb constraint is to be regarded as a guideline, and adherence to this should not, in any way, result in a reduction of the prescr iption dose or compromised dose coverage of the target volume. 6.6 Treatment Verification 6.6.1 First day port films or portal images of each fiel d along with orthogonal isocenter verification films (or images) must be obtained. If modifications are made in field shaping or design, a port film of each modified field along with orthogonal isocenter ve rification films (or images) is required on the first day's treatment of that field. Thereafter, we ekly verification films or images of orthogonal isocenter views (anterior to posterior and lateral projection) are required. For IMRT the intensity profiles of each beam must be independently verified and compared to the planned field intensity. Portal films are not requir ed for IMRT but orthogonal verification films are required, just as for 3DCRT. These images are to be archived by the institution for later review if requested by the study chair. 6.6.2 Daily on-line target localization (kV or MV imagi ng with fiducials, trans-abdominal ultrasound, or other) or off-line adaptive appro aches to account for interfraction organ motion and setup variability are permitted on this study but not requ ired. The use of image guidance or daily target localization including the specific type impl emented must be documented by the treating physician and submitted to RTOG headquarters usi ng the appropriate sections of the Facility Questionnaire. 6.6.3 Management of Radiation Dose to the Patient from Daily Localization According to the literature, the estimates of pat ient dose per imaging study for various imaging systems vary considerably. The doses are in the range of 0.1 cGy BrainLab's ExacTrac planar kV-systems and can be considered negligible compared with doses from MV portal imaging and kV and MV CT. The doses from helical MV CT scans on a Tomotherapy unit are estimated to be in range from 1 to 3 cGy, similar to doses reported for kV cone beam CT on Elekta Synergy machine. The doses for MV cone beam CT vary from 1 cGy to 10 cGy depending on the field size. Thus, the doses for 3D imaging systems used one time each day are in the range of 0.1 to 10 cGy and can contribute from 0.06 to 6% to a daily dose of 1.8 Gy. As a technique of controlling patient dose, it is recommended that a QA procedure be established at each institution to verify the accuracy of the image registration software on a daily basis. This QA check should be performed by the therapists operating a particular treatment device and is aimed at reducing the use of repeat imaging to check that the regi stration software has functioned properly when a shift of patient position is carried out. Additionally, it is not recommended that an institution use a daily imaging technique that deliver y greater than 3 cGy/dy to the pati ent. This limit dictates that repeat imaging on a particular day is held to a minimum when systems that deliver up to 3 cGy per study are used. 6.7 Quality Assurance 6.7.1 Documentation Requirements The institution will archive treatm ent prescription and verification images for later review by the study chair if requested. At leas t one port film or pretreatment a lignment film per field along with the digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs ) from the treatment planning program or, alternatively, a simulation verification radiogr aph shall be acquired and kept for evaluation if requested except where geometrically impractical. 6.7.2 Compliance Criteria Cases which meet criteria as stated in Section 6.1.1 will be scored as per protocol. The minimum allowable dose within the PTV is >95% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03cc. Cases in which this small volume of at least 0.03cc receives a minimum dose that R T O G 0 8 1 5 14is <95% but >93% or a maximum dose that is >107% and <110% of the prescribed dose will be scored as a variation acceptable. Cases in which such a small volume receives less than 93% or >110% of the prescribed dose will be scored as a deviation unacceptable. 6.7.2.1 Acceptable dose heterogeneity will be as follows: This maximum dose volume of the PTV must not be shared by a normal critical structure. (Section 6.4.1.5). The maximum point dose to normal critical structures outside t he PTV including the unspecified tissue should not exceed the prescription dose. The treating physi cian must carefully consider the tolerance dose/volume to each critical normal structure and unspecified tissue. 6.8 Dose Specifications/Technical Considerations: LDR Brachytherapy Boost (12/10/10) Note : As this protocol allows for treatment with exclusively EBRT or EBRT + brachytherapy (at the discretion of the treating physician) this must be specified at the time of study enrollment. Should a patient who was originally intended to receive brachytherapy be found, post-enrollment, to be a poor brachytherapy candidate based on transrectal ultrasound examination, he will no longer be eligible for participation in this study. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to obtain ultrasound assessment of prospective brachytherapy patients before enrollment on this study. 6.8.1 LDR, permanent seed, br achytherapy boost is permitted at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist in conjunction with EBRT as described in Section 6.2.2. Implants will only be offered to patients with a prostate volume documented to be <60 cc by transrectal ultrasound examination, an AUA score 15, and no prior history of TURP (Section 3.2.8.1). The implant may be performed under either general or spinal anesthesia and will be performed following the EBRT portion of treatment no more than 2 weeks following its completion. 6.8.2 Preplanning This will be carried out prior to the procedure or intraoperativ ely via transrectal ultrasound examination. The prostate will be defined from base to apex in the axial plane at 5 mm slice intervals. The treatment length and prostate vo lume will be recorded. The CTV will consist of the prostate only. The PTV may be the same as the CTV or a 2-3 mm margin may be added anteriorly and laterally and up to 5 mm craniocaudally at the discretion of the treating physician. 6.8.3 Isotope Selection Iodine-125 or Palladium-103 seed s may be used. The sources will be received and inventoried in accordance with state and federal regulations . If nonsterile loose sources or cartridges are used, at least 10% of the sources will be assayed in such a manner that direct traceability to either the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or an Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Lab (ADCL) is maintained. NIST 1999 standards will be used. If sterile source assemblies or strands are used, alternatively non stranded loose seeds equal to 5% of the total, or five seeds, whichever is fewer, may be ordered and assayed. Agreement of the average measured source strength shall agree with that i ndicated in the vendor's calibration certificate to within 5%. No measured source strengths sh ould fall outside 10% of that indicated in the vendor's calibration certificate. 6.8.3.1 For I-125, the allowable source strength for ea ch seed is 0.277 U to .650 U (NIST 99 or later). For Pd-103 sources, this range is 1.29 U to 2.61 U (NIST 99 or later). 6.8.3.2 The vendor's stated source strength shall be us ed in all dosimetry calculations. Calculations will be performed in accordance with NIST 1999 calibration standards, the point source formalism described in the report generate d by AAPM Task Group 43 and subsequent published AAPM Subcommittee Re ports. The AAPM's recomm endations for Pd-103 dose specifications and prescription are being followed. 6.8.4 Prescription Doses The prescription dose for permanent seed interstitial boost will be 110 Gy for I-125 and 100 Gy for Pd-103 . Doses will be prescribed as minimal peripheral dose to the PTV. 6.8.5 Postimplant Imaging A pelvic x-ray with seed count verification will be obtained immediately postimplant. If the seed count does not match the number of seeds implanted, PA and lateral chest x-rays will be obtained to rule out pulmonary seed migration. CT scan for postimplant dosimetric analysis will be obtained following implant completion. Use of a Foley catheter for this test is encouraged for accurate urethral dosimetry but not required. This may be obtained immediately postoperative on the day of the implant if desired but no later than 5 weeks postimplant. The use of intravesical contrast is encouraged. CT slices should be acquired at 3 mm thickness and R T O G 0 8 1 5 15should encompass the pelvis from , at minimum, the bottom of the sacroiliac joints superiorly to 2 cm caudal to the prostatic apex. 6.8.5.1 Structures defined will include the prostate, bl adder, and rectum. The rectum will be defined from the bottom of the sacroiliac joints to t he ischial tuberosity and will extend to the outer surface of the visualized rectal wall. The posti mplant, CT-defined prostate will be defined as the \"evaluated target volume\" (ETV) and w ill form the basis for dosimetric analysis. 6.8.6 Dosimetry Postimplant evaluation will be performed on equipm ent capable of provid ing structural and volume-based dosimetric assessment on both t he target and critical structures. Volume acquisition will be based on contiguous axial CT slices as described above. Both target volume and critical structures will be contoured on each applicable axial slice. Isodose line displays and dose-volume histograms for all structures will be generated. 6.8.6.1 The calculation grid should be set no larger than (2 mm x 2 mm x axial slice width). 6.8.6.2 The planning system shall be capable of transmitting data via DICOM RT to the ITC electronically. 6.8.6.3 Guidelines established by the American Brachytherapy Society62 are to be followed. DVH- based analysis must be used in the postplan evaluation. The following values shall be reported. Vn is the percentage of the ETV that re ceived at least n% of the prescription dose. Dm is the minimum dose received by m% of the ETV. 6.8.6.4 Target coverage will be documented in terms of V100, V90, V80, D90. 6.8.6.5 Dose uniformity will be expressed in terms of V150. 6.8.6.6 The rectum will be defined from the bottom of t he SI joints to the is chial tuberosity. The maximum rectal dose as well as the volume and percentage of rectum receiving >100% of the prescription dose will be recorded. 6.8.7 Compliance Criteria 6.8.7.1 Per protocol: D90 for the ETV is greater than 90% of the prescription dose but less than 130% of the prescription dose. 6.8.7.2 Variation acceptable: D90 for the ETV is greater than 80% of the prescription dose, but less than 90% of the prescription dose, or gr eater than 130% of the prescription dose. 6.8.7.3 Deviation unacceptable: D90 for the ETV is less than 80% of the prescription dose. 6.8.8 Dosimetric Data to be Submitted to the ITC 6.8.8.1 Copies of preimplant TRUS images with CTV and PTV annotated 6.8.8.2 A copy of the implant record generated during the procedure 6.8.8.3 A copy of the image taken after the procedure a nd a copy of the image or scout taken during the post implant CT 6.8.8.4 A copy of the postimplant CT scan, ETV and bladder and rectum delineation and dosimetry calculations (must be submitted electronically) 6.8.8.5 A copy of the postimplant dosimetry report that contains the information required in Section 6.8.6 above. 6.8.9 Quality Assurance Individual case review will be performed by Dr. Morton, the LDR brachytherapy study co- chair overseeing this subgroup of patients enro lled on this protocol, as specified below in Section 6.9 Dose Specifications/Technical Considerations: HDR Brachytherapy Boost (12/10/10) Note: this treatment wi th exclusively EBRT or EBRT + brachytherapy (at the discretion of the treating physician) this must be specified at the time of study enrollment. Should a patient who was originally intended to receive brachytherapy be found, post-enrollment, to be a poor brachytherapy candidate based on transrectal ultrasound examination, he will no longer be eligible for participation in this study. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to obtain ultrasound assessment of prospective brachytherapy patients before enrollment on this study. 6.9.1 HDR brachytherapy boost is permi tted at the discretion of the tr eating radiation oncologist in conjunction with EBRT as described in Section 6.2. 2. Implants will only be offered to patients with a prostate volume documented to be <60 cc by transrectal ultrasound examination, AUA symptom index 15, and no prior history of TURP (Sec tion 3.2.8.1). The implant may be performed during the EBRT portion of the treatment or within 1 week prior to its initiation or following its completion. For patients receiving HDR brachytherapy boost who are randomized to Arm 2, RT should begin, as for other modalities, 8 weeks following the first LHRH administration. R T O G 0 8 1 5 16The date of HDR brachytherapy impl ant will constitute the start of RT for those patients receiving implants prior to EBRT. 6.9.2 All implants will be performed under transrectal ul trasound guidance. Ep idural, spinal, or general anesthesia be used. Epidural analgesia may be used for interfraction pain control. 6.9.3 At least 14 treatment catheters should be used to ensure adequate target coverage with acceptable dose heterogeneity. 6.9.4 Fiducial markers identifying the prostatic base and apex should be placed at the time of the implant procedure unless previously placed for guidance of EBRT. 6.9.5 The use of intraoperative cyst oscopy is encouraged to ensure the absence of treatment catheters within the urethra or bladder. The cy stoscope should be retroflexed within the bladder for visualization of the bladder neck. Light pres sure on the treatment catheters should result in mucosal tenting confirming adequate coverage at the prostatic base. 6.9.6 All patients will be treated with a single implant. Two treatment fractions will be delivered prior to its removal. A minimum interval of 6 hours will be allotted between fractions and must be delivered within a single 24-hour period. 6.9.7 Implant Dosimetry (CT or Ultrasound-Based) 6.9.7.1 The treatment planning CT scan must be performed with the patient in the supine position with the Foley catheter in place. Metallic obt urators or non-CT compatible dummy ribbons must be removed prior to the CT scan. The scan must include all of the CTV with at least 9 mm superior and inferior margin, and the scan must include the tips of all the implanted catheters. The scan thickness must be 0.3 cm and the slices must be contiguous. The brachytherapy target volume (Section 6.9.8) a nd normal critical structures (Section 6.9.9) must be outlined on all CT slices including the prostate, seminal vesicles, urethra, bladder, and rectum. 6.9.7.2 Real-time, transrectal ultrasound-based pla nning is acceptable. The prostate must be defined from base to apex in axial slices with a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm. A Foley catheter must be in place fo r definition of the urethra. 6.9.7.3 Dwell times in positions located outside of the PTV should be turned down or off to minimize normal tissue irradiated. A dwell time optimiza tion program based on implant geometry or an inverse planning algorithm may be used. Manual optimization is also accepted. 6.9.8 The CTV is the prostate gland plus any visualized tumor. The PTV is equivalent to the CTV. 6.9.9 Critical structures to be defined using CT plan ning include the bladder, rectum, urethra, and penile bulb within the volume of interest defined in Section 6.9.7.1. The outermost extent of the bladder/rectal wall will define those structures. Th e urethra is defined by the outer surface of the Foley catheter. 6.9.9.1 The volume of bladder and rectum receiving 75% of the prescription dose must be kept to less than 1 cc (V75 <1 cc) and the volume of uret hra receiving 125% of the prescription dose must be kept to less than 1 cc (V125 <1 cc). Urethral V150 should be 0%. If the dose to normal critical structures c annot be kept below the specified level, we recommend readjusting the implant or repeating the implant procedure until a more optimal implant is obtained. 6.9.10 Ultrasound-Based Planning For ultrasound-based planning, the urethra will be defined by the Foley catheter in slices extending from the base to the prostate apex. T he anterior rectal wall must be defined along the length of the prostate. 6.9.10.1 Attempts should be made to limit the volume of urethra receiving 115% of the prescription dose to 5%. Up to 10% will be considered variat ion acceptable. Dose to > 1 cc of the anterior rectal wall should not exceed 75% of the prescription dose. 6.9.11 Compliance Criteria A prescription dose of 21 Gy will be delivered to the PTV in two equal fractions of 10.5 Gy. Ninety-five percent coverage of the PTV with the prescription dose is considered per protocol, 90% but <95% is considered variation acc eptable, and <90% coverage is considered deviation unacceptable. The first fraction of 10.5 Gy will be delivered as soon as possible following completion of the implant procedure and treatment planning. Both fractions must be delivered within a single 24-hour period and se parated by a minimum of 6 hours. Overnight hospital stay is permitted betw een fractions if necessary. 6.9.12 Catheter Position Verification Visual inspection of the catheters prior to deliver y of each treatment is required. Fluoroscopy or CT may be also used to verify the position of the catheters in relation to the Foley catheter R T O G 0 8 1 5 17balloon and fiducial markers. The physician may adjus t the catheters if catheter displacement is identified prior to the treatment. If the catheter s cannot be satisfactorily repositioned and the PTV (Section 6.9.11) and normal critical stru cture (Section 6.9.9.1) DVH parameters are not met with a new plan, then the treatment shoul d be postponed until a satisfactory implant is done. If the planning process is repeated, then a second set of data should be submitted. 6.9.13 Catheter Removal After completion of the treatment all catheters will be removed. 6.9.14 Data Submission All data will be digitally submitted to ITC and includ e CT data, normal critical structures, all PTV contours, and digital DVH data for all normal cr itical structures, and the PTV for dose plan. 6.9.14.1 Contours and Isodose Distributions For CT-planned cases contours of the PTV and normal critic al structures with at least 9 mm in the cephalad and caudal directions must be su bmitted digitally to ITC. Electronic data transmission will be used after the institution has succe ssfully completed a practice run with the ITC. Institutions previous ly credentialed for previous prostate brachytherapy protocols need not complete a practice run. For ultrasound-planned cases , at least 3 axial slices with the above overlying isodose curves w ill be submitted. These must include the base plane, apex, and widest axial dimension. 6.9.15 Quality Assurance Individual case review will be overseen by Dr. Hsu, the HDR brachy therapy study co-chair overseeing this subgroup of patients enrolled on th is protocol, as specified in Section 6.10. 6.10 Radiation Quality Assurance Reviews (12/10/10) The study co-chairs for the respective RT modalit ies offered in this tr ial will oversee quality assurance reviews for patients treated in those re spective fashions. RT quality assurance reviews will be ongoing and performed remotely. RT quality assurance reviews will be facilitated by RTOG RTQA. 6.11 Radiation Adverse Events 6.11.1 All patients will be seen weekly by their treating radiation oncologi st while undergoing therapy. Any observations with respect to the followi ng symptoms/side effects will be recorded: 6.11.1.1 Urinary incontinence 6.11.1.3 Radiation dermatitis 6.11.2 Clinical discretion may be used in managing radiotherapy-related side effects. Diarrhea/rectal frequency/urgency may be managed with diphenoxylate or loperamide. Bladder irritation may be mitigated with phenazopyridine. Urinary frequency/urgency can be managed with anticholinergic agents or alpha-blockers such as tamsulosin. Erectile dysfunction can be managed with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as sildenafil. 6.12 Radiation Adverse Event Reporting See Section 7.5 for additional Adverse Events in formation and 7.6 for Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines. 7.0 DRUG THERAPY Institutional participation in chemotherapy st udies must be in accordance with the Medical Oncology Quality Control guidelines stat ed in the RTOG Procedures Manual. Patients randomized to receive short-term androgen deprivation therapy must begin this treatment within 4 weeks after ra ndomization. Androgen de privation therapy will consist of LHRH agonist and anti-androgen (either Casodex or Eulexin) for a duration of 6 months. 7.1 Anti-Androgen Therapy: Casodex (Bicalutamide) For further information, consult the package insert. 7.1.1 Timing : Oral anti-androgen therapy will begin within (before, same day as, or after) 10 days of the date of the first administration of LHRH agonist for patients randomized to Arm 2 and continued for a total duration of 6 months. Th e total duration of administered anti-androgen therapy must be documented and submitted to RTOG headquarters. R T O G 0 8 1 5 187.1.2 Description : Bicalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, which has no androgenic or progestational properties. is propanamide, is a racemic mixture with the antiandrogen activity residing exclusively in the (-) or R-enantiomer. Bicalutamide has a long half-life compatible with once-daily dosing. Bicalutamide is well tolerated and has good response rates in phase II trials. 63,64 7.1.3 Supply : Commercially available. 7.1.4 Storage : Bicalutamide should be stored in a dry place at room temperature between 68\u00b0-77\u00b0F. 7.1.5 Administration : Bicalutamide is administered orally at a dose of one 50 mg tablet per day. Bicalutamide will begin within (before, same day as , or after) 10 days of the date of the first LHRH agonist administration, and continue for a total duration of 6 months (i.e. the total duration of planned androgen deprivation). Administ ration will be suspended only if there is an apparent or suspected reaction to the drug. During RT interruptions, bicalutamide will be continued. Any treatment interruptions or failure of the patient to comply with the prescribed medication schedule must be documented and reported to RTOG headquarters. 7.1.6 Toxicity : Consult the package insert for comprehensive toxicity information. In animal experiments, birth defects (abnormal genitalia, hypospadias) were found in male offspring from female animals dosed with bicalutamide during pregnancy. Although offspring from male animals dosed with bicalutamide did not show any birth defects, patients enrolled in this trial are advised not to cause pregnancy nor donate sperm while receiving protocol therapy or during the first 3 months after cessation of th erapy. The use of barrier contraceptives is advised. The most frequent adverse events repo rted among subjects receiving bicalutamide therapy are breast tenderness, breast swelling, and hot flashes. When bicalutamide 50 mg was given in combination with an LHRH analog, the LHRH analog adverse event profile predominated with a high incidence of hot flashes (53%) and relatively low incidences of gynecomastia (4.7%) and breast pain (3.2%). Other side effects include impotence and loss of libido, fatigue, and rarely, photosensitivity and diarrhea. 7.1.7 Dose Modifications : AST and ALT will be measured pretreatment and then monthly during antiandrogen therapy. If the AST or ALT rises to 2x the institutional upper limit of normal, bicalutamide must be discontinued. Elevated AST/A LT values to < 2x the institutional upper limit of normal are subject to dose modificati ons or discontinuation of anti-androgen at the discretion of the treating physician. 7.2 Anti-Androgen Therapy: Eulexin (Flutamide) For further information, consult the package insert. 7.2.1 Timing : See Section 7.1.1. 7.2.2 Description : Flutamide is a substituted anilide. It is a fine, light, yellow powder, insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents such as aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons. Its concentration in plasma can be determi ned by gas chromatography. Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen that is metabolized into a hydroxylated derivative, which effectively competes with the hydrotestosterone for androgen receptor sites. 7.2.3 Supply : Commercially available. 7.2.4 Storage : Flutamide should be stored at temperat ures ranging from 20-30\u00b0C (68-86\u00b0F) and protected from excessive moisture. 7.2.5 Administration : Flutamide is administered orally at a dose of 250 mg (two 125-mg capsules) three times a day for a total daily dose of 750 mg. Flutamide will begin within (before, same day as, or after) 10 days of with the date of the firs t LHRH agonist administration (and continue for a total duration of 6 months. Administration will be suspended only if ther e is an apparent or suspected reaction to the drug (S ee Section 7.1.5). During RT in terruptions, flutamide will be continued. Any treatment interruptions or failure of the patient to comply with the prescribed medication schedule must be documented and reported to RTOG headquarters. 7.2.6 Toxicity : Consult the package insert for comprehensiv e toxicity information. The reported side effects of treatment include diarrhea and anem ia. A high percentage of patients treated with flutamide alone developed gynecomastia with in 2 to 8 months. There have been post- marketing reports of hospitalization, and, rare ly, death due to liver failure in patients taking flutamide. Evidence of hepatic injury inclu ded elevated serum transaminase jaundice, hepatic and death related to acute hepatic failure. The hepatic injury was reversible after prompt discontinuation of therapy in some patients. Approximately half of the R T O G 0 8 1 5 19reported cases occurred within the initial 3 mont hs of treatment with flutamide. Other side effects include impotence and loss of libi do, fatigue, and rarely, photosensitivity. 7.2.7 Dose Modifications : If gastrointestinal disturbances (cramps, diarrhea) occur prior to initiation of radiotherapy, flutamide will be withheld until t he side effects subside; the drug will then be reintroduced at a dose of 250 mg/day and increase d (at 3-day intervals) to 500 mg/day and then to 750 mg/day as tolerated. If gastrointest inal disturbances occur after administration of radiotherapy, it might be difficult to identify their cause. However, if severity of diarrhea exceeds the level commonly observed during prostate i rradiation, the toxicity will be ascribed to flutamide and the drug will be permanently discontinued. AST and ALT will be measured pretreatment, then monthly during oral anti androgen therapy. If AST or ALT increase 2x the institutional upper limit of normal, flutamide mu st be discontinued. Elevated AST/ALT values to < 2x the institutional upper limit of normal are subject to dose mo difications or discontinuation of anti-androgen at the discreti on of the treating physician. 7.3 LHRH Agonist Therapy (leuprolid e, goserelin, buserelin, triptorelin) For additional information, c onsult the package inserts. 7.3.1 Timing : For patients randomized to ADT (Arm 2) , the first LHRH administration will occur together with the start of anti-androgen treatment (s ee Sections 7.1.5 or 7.2.5) 8 weeks prior to the start of RT. The total duration of LHRH therapy will be 6 months. The total administered duration as well as the specific agent used must be documented and submitted to RTOG headquarters. 7.3.2 Description : LHRH agonists are long-acting analogs of the are effective at reducing serum testosterone. Anal ogs approved by the FDA (or by Health Canada for Canadian institutions) can be used in this study. 7.3.3 Supply : Commercially available. (Note : Buserelin is not commercially available in the United States. It is commercially available fo r use in Canada and other countries.) 7.3.4 Storage : LHRH analogs should be stored as directed by the commercial supplier. 7.3.5 Administration : LHRH analogs are administered with a variety of techniques, including subcutaneous insertion of a solid plug in the abdominal wall (Zoladex), intramuscular injection (Lupron), subcutaneous injection (Eligard), or insertion slowly releases the agent (Viadur). The manufact urer's instructions should be followed. 7.3.6 Toxicity : Consult the package insert for comprehensive toxicity information. Class-related toxicity is generally a manifestation of the me chanism of action and related to low testosterone levels. In the majority of patients testosterone levels increase above normal in the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. The most common side effect of LHRH analogs is vasomotor hot flashes; edema, gynecomastia, and gastrointestinal disturbances have occurred. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinar y obstruction or hematuria which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems such as temporary weakness and/or paresthesia of the lower limbs or worsening of urinary symptoms. Other side effects include impotence and loss of libido, weight gain, depression, dizziness, lo ss of bone density, anemia , increased thirst and urination, unusual taste in the mouth, skin red ness or hives, pain at injection site, and muscle mass and strength loss, hair changes, penile length and testicular volume loss, increased cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes exacerbat ion, emotional lability, nausea, vomiting, and rarely, allergic generalized rash and difficulty breathing. 7.4 Modality Review All records of ADT administration for patients ra ndomized to Arm 2 should be submitted to RTOG headquarters. Protocol compliance will be assessed at the RTOG semi-annual meetings by the study chair/co-chairs. The reco mmended ADT duration is six mont hs and will be measured from the day of initial LHRH agonist injection until the final day of activity (e.g. 90-day depot injection preparations given on day 1 and 91 equal 6 months of ADT). Likewise, submitted records of anti- androgen therapy should reflect their total duration of administration, which should mirror the duration of LHRH agonist treatment. The review pr ocess is contingent on timely submission of hormone therapy treatment data as specified in Section 12.1. The scoring mechanism is: Per Protocol/Acceptable Variation, Not Per Protocol, and Not Evaluable. A report is sent to each institution once per year to notify the institution about compliance for each case reviewed in that year. R T O G 0 8 1 5 20 7.5 Adverse Events (8/17/10) (12/10/10) Beginning October 1, 2010, this study will utilize the Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 for grading of all adv erse events. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). The CTEP home page also can be accessed from the RTOG web page at http://www.rtog.org/regulatory/regs.html . All appropriate treatment areas sh ould have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. All AE reporting on the study case report forms will continue to use CTCAE version 3.0. All adverse events (AEs) as defined in the tabl es below will be reported via the AdEERS (Adverse Event Expedited Reporting Sy stem) application accessed via the CTEP web site (https://webapps.ctep.nci.nih.gov/op enapps/plsql/gadeer s_main$.startup ). Serious adverse events (SAEs) as defined in th e tables below will be reported via AdEERS. Sites also can access the RTOG web site ( http://www.rtog.org/members/toxicity/main.html ) for this information. In order to ensure consistent data capture, serious adverse events reported on AdEERS reports also must be reported on an RTOG case report form (CRF). In addition, sites must submit CRFs in a timely manner after AdEERS submissions. 7.5.1 Adverse Events (AEs) Definition of an AE : Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, pr obable, or definite). [CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements. January 2005; http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html ] The following guidelines for reporting adverse events (AEs) apply to all NCI/RTOG research protocols. AEs, as defined above, experienced by patients accrued to this protocol should be reported on the AE section of the appropriate case report form (see Section 12.1). Note: AEs indicated in the AdEERS Expedited Reporti ng Requirements in text and/or table in Section 7.6 also must be reported via AdEERS. NOTE: If the event is a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [see next section], further reporting will be required. Reporting AEs only fulfills Data Management reporting requirements. 7.5.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) \u2014 All SAEs that fit any one of the criteria in the SAE definition below must be reported via Ad EERS. Contact the AdEERS Help Desk if assistance is required. Certain SAEs as outlined below will require t he use of the 24 Hour AdEERS Notification: Phase II & III Studies : All unexpected potentially related SAEs Phase I Studies : All unexpected hospitalizations and all grade 4 and 5 SAEs regardless of relationship Definition of an SAE : Any adverse experience occurring duri ng any part of protocol treatment and 30 days after that results in any of the following outcomes: \u0083 Death; \u0083 or significant disability/incapacity; \u0083 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE, w hen, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. Any pregnancy occurring on study must be reported via AdEERS as a medically significant event. R T O G 0 8 1 5 21Pharmaceutically supported studies will require additional reporting over and above that which is required by CTEP. SAEs (more than 30 days after last treatment) a ttributed to the protocol treatment (possible, probable, or definite) should be reported via AdEERS. All supporting source documentation indicated as being provided in the Additional Information Section of the AdEERS Report must be properly labeled with the study/case numbers and the date of the event and must be faxed to the RTOG dedicated SAE FAX, 215-717-0990, before the five or ten-calendar-day deadline to allow RTOG to comply with the reporting requirements of the pharmaceutical company/companies supporting the RTOG trial. The RTOG Case Number without any leading zeros should be used as the Patient ID when reporting via AdEERS. Non-RTOG intergroup study and case numbers must also be included, when applicable. Submi tted AdEERS Reports are forwarded to RTOG electronically via the AdEERS system. Use the pati ent's case number as the patient ID when reporting via AdEERS. SAE reporting is safety related and separate and in addition to the Data Management reporting requirements as outlined in the previous AE reporting section. Any event that meets the above outlined criteria for an SAE but is assessed by the AdEERS System as \"expedited reporting NOT required\" must still be reported for safety reasons and to fulfill the obligations of RTOG to the pharmaceutical company/companies supporting the RTOG trial. Sites must bypass the \"NOT Required\" assessment and complete and submit the report. The AdEERS System allows submission of all reports regardless of the results of the assessment. Note: Sites must select the option in AdEERS to send a copy of the report to the FDA or print the AdEERS repo rt and fax it to the FDA, FAX 1-800-332-0178. 7.5.3 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or MDS that is diagnosed during or su bsequent to treatment in patients on NCI/CTEP- sponsored clinical trials must be reported via the AdEERS system within 30 days of AML/MDS diagnosis. If you are reporting in CTCAE version 4, the event(s) may be reported as either: 1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy , 2) Myelodysplastic syndrome, or 3) Treatment-related secondary malignancy. 7.6 AdEERS Expedited Reporting Requirements CTEP defines expedited AE reporting requirements for phase 2 and 3 trials as described in the table below. Important: All AEs reported via AdEERS also must be reported on the AE section of the appropriate case report form (see Section 12.1).

Please see exceptions below under section entitled \"Additional Instructions or Exceptions.\" March 2005 Note: All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided. \"On study\" is defined as during or within 30 days of completing protocol treatment. Expedited AE reporting timelines defined: \u00be \"24 hours; 5 calendar days\" - The investigator mu st initially report the AE via AdEERS within 24 hours of learning of the event followed by a complete AdEERS report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-hour report. \u00be \"10 calendar days\" - A complete AdEERS report on the AE must be submitted within 10 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event. Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be reported regardless of attr ibution and designation as expected or unexpected with the exception of any events identified as protocol-specific expedited adverse event reporting exclusions. Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via AdEERS if th e event occurs following treatment with a commercially available agent. Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specific patient ID assigned during trial registration on all reports. Additional Instructions or Exceptions to AdEERS Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 2 and 3 Trials Utilizing a Commercially Available Agent: None 8.0 SURGERY Not applicable to this study 9.0 OTHER THERAPY 9.1 Permitted Supportive Therapy All supportive therapy for optimal medical ca re will be given during the study period at the discretion of the attending physician(s) within th e parameters of the protocol and documented on each site's source documents as concomitant medication. 9.1.1 Diarrhea/rectal frequency/urgency may be mana ged with diphenoxylate or Bladder irritation may be mitigated with phenazopyridine. Urinary frequency/urgency can be managed with anticholinergic agents or alpha-blockers such as tamsulosin. Erectile dysfunction can be managed with (PDE) inhibitors such as sildenafil. 10.0 TISSUE/SPECIMEN SUBMISSION Note: Patients must be offered the opportunity to partici pate in the correlative components of the study, such as tissue/specimen submission. If the patient consents to participate in the tissue/specimen component of the study, the site is required to submit the patient's specimens as specified in Section 10.0 of the protocol. Sites are not permitted to delete the tissue/specimen component from the protocol or from the sample consent. 10.1 Tissue/Specimen Submission The RTOG Biospecimen Resource at the Univer sity of California San Francisco acquires and maintains high quality specimens from RTOG trials . Tissue from each block is preserved through careful block storage and processing. The RTOG enco urages participants in protocol studies to consent to the banking of their tissue. The RTOG Biospecimen Resource provides tissue specimens to investigators for translational research studies. Translational research studies integrate the newest research findings into current protocols to investigate important biologic questions. The RTOG Biospecimen Resource al so collects tissue for Central Review of pathology. Central Review of tissue ca n be for eligibility and/or analysis. R T O G 0 8 1 5 23In this study, tissue will be submitted to the RTOG Biospecime n Resource for the purpose of tissue banking (recommended) and translational research (recommended). 10.2 Specimen Collection for Tissue Banking and Translational Research (Recommended) (12/10/10) For patients who have consented to participate in the tissue/blood component of the study (See Appendix I).

No clinical information is kept in the database. 10.4.2 Specimens for tissue banking w ill be stored for an indefinite per iod of time. Specimens for the translational research component of this protocol will be retained until the study is terminated, unless the patient has consented to storage fo r future studies. If at any time the patient withdraws consent to stor e and use specimens, the material will be returned to the institution that submitted it. 11.0 PATIENT ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Study Parameters (12/10/10) See Appendix II for assessments and timeframes. See Sections 11.1.1 to 11.1.6 for details and/or exceptions to Appendix II. 11.1.1 The pelvic +/- abdominal CT or MRI is required fo r patients with >1 risk factor (Section 3.1.1) and as described in Sections 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.2. 11.1.2 Transrectal ultrasound is a one-time test that is only for pati ents receiving LDR or HDR brachytherapy boost as a component of their tr eatment. This should ideally be performed prior to study enrollment as the RT modality (EBR T alone, EBRT + HDR, EBRT + LDR) must be R T O G 0 8 1 5 25specified at the time of enrollment. In the event that transrectal ultrasound is performed post- enrollment and results in a ch ange in the RT modality being adm inistered, the patient will no longer be eligible for participation in this study. (See last paragraph of Section 11.3) 11.1.3 The CBC/differential is required only for pat ients who will receive either LDR or HDR brachytherapy boost (must be known at the time of registration). 11.1.4 See Section 3.1.7 for special circumstances regard ing PSA. Also, PSA will be obtained prior to each follow-up visit. 11.1.5 Serum testosterone need only be obtained from patients randomized to receive ADT (Arm 2) at the time of study entry (baseline prior to starting ADT), at the start of RT (8 weeks following 1st LHRH agonist administration)\u2014may be performed in conjunction with timing of AST/ALT/alkaline phosphatase\u2014and every 6 months until rising to baseline levels or for 3 years (whichever is sooner). 11.1.6 Patients receiving anti-androgen therapy (Arm 2) will need monthly liver function testing (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) for the duration of that treatment. 11.2 Measurement of Response 11.2.1 Overall survival is the primary study endpoint and the event date of overall survival will be the date of death due to any cause. 11.2.2 Biochemical failure is defined as the document ed rise of 2 ng/ml above its post-treatment nadir value. 11.2.3 Local recurrence is defined as the document ed local recurrence as follows: Patients with clinical (palpable) suspicion of local recurrence following treatment completion should undergo biopsy for pathologic confirmation of local re currence. Once pathologi c confirmation is obtained, the event date will be the date at which the palpable progression wa s first identified. In the event of biochemical failure (nadir + 2 ng /ml), metastatic workup including, at minimum, chest x-ray, bone scan, and abdominopelvic CT should be obtained to exclude the possibility of distant failure. If negative, prostate biopsy should be performed. If positive, biochemical failure will be considered the lo cal recurrence event. 11.2.4 Regional recurrence is defined as the docume nted progression in pelvic lymph nodes. If discovered on CT of the pelvis prompted by a biochemical failu re, then the event date will be the date of documented biochemical failure. 11.2.5 Distant failure is defined as the documented meta static disease by any method. If diagnosed on diagnostic imaging prompted by biochemical fa ilure, then the event date will be the date of biochemical progression. 11.2.6 Freedom from failure is defined as the first event of biochemical failure, local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant metastasis, as described above. 11.2.7 Prostate cancer specific mortality is defined as a death due to prostate cancer or a complication from treatment 11.2.8 Non-prostate cancer specific mortality is defined as a death without evidence of prostate cancer or a complication from treatment. 11.2.9 Rate of salvage ADT administration is defined as the first administration of subsequent ADT (either LHRH agonist or anti-androgen) is given. 11.3 Criteria for Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment Patients who are experiencing excessive adverse events as deemed by their treating physician may be discontinued from the initiated protocol treatment. All attempts should be made to manage adverse events adequately so as to avoid this circumstance. As specified in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, anti-androgen therapy will be withhel d if AST/ALT values are elevated to 2x the institutional upper limit of normal. Study analysis will be based on \"intent to treat.\" If protocol treatment is discontinued, follow up and data collection will continue as specified in the protocol. 11.4 Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Note: Patients must be offered the opportunity to partici pate in the correlative components of the study, such as quality of life assessment. If the patient consents to participate in the quality of life component of the study, the site is required to administer the QOL assessments as specified in Section 11.0 of the protocol. Sites are not permitted to delete the quality of life comp onent from the protocol or from the R T O G 0 8 1 5 26sample consent. Blood collection is mandatory for patients consenting to the QOL portion of this study. 11.4.1 Prostate Cancer-Specific Health-Related Quality of Life: EPIC The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC) is a prostate cancer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) patient se lf-administered instrument that measures a broad spectrum of urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms related to RT and ADT.29 Instrument development was based on advice from an expert panel and prostate cancer patients, which led to expanding the 20-item University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) to the 50-item EPIC. Summary and su bscale scores were derived by content and factor analyses. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were high for EPIC urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domain summary scores (each r 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha 0.82) and for most domain-spec ific subscales. Correlations between function and bother subscales within domains were high (r >0.60). Correlations between different primary domains were consistently lower, indicating that t hese domains assess distinct HRQOL components. EPIC domains had weak to modest correlations with the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), indicating rationale for their concurrent use. Moderate agreement was observed between EPIC domains re levant to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate module (FACT-P) a nd the American Urologica l Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), providing criterion validity without excessive overlap. 65 EPIC is a robust prostate cancer HRQOL inst rument that measures a broad spectrum of symptoms; however, to decrease patient burden we will only use the domains most pertinent to this study: urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormo nal. The domains were validated separately, and since each domain will be used intact, there is no threat to validity. Dutch and Japanese translations of the EPIC are available, and a Spanish translation is planned but not yet available. 11.4.2 Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Inform ation System (PROMIS)-Fatigue Short Form The PROMIS fatigue measure (7 items) was developed by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), part of the NIH Roadmap Initiative, focused on developing a publicly available re source of standardiz ed, accurate, and efficient PRO measures of symptoms, distress, and functioning. Two content domains of fatigue, experience and impact, were identified by a panel of experts. An item pool of 58 fatigue experience and 54 fatigue impact items were developed. The psyc hometric properties of these items were evaluated in a sample of 450 individuals from t he general US population using classical test theory indices, monotonicity, and scalability. T he expert panel selected the 10 best items in each domain. These 20 items were presented to a panel of clinical experts. Only one item was dropped because of redundancy. A preliminary fatigue short-form measure of 7 items was created using items selected for consistency in the response scale, broad coverage across the fatigue continuum (i.e., high to low), and good precision of measurement (discrimination function). 11.4.3 Quality-Adjusted Survival Analysis: EuroQol (EQ-5D) The EQ-5D is a patient self-administrated quest ionnaire that takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.66 The first part consists of 5 items coveri ng 5 dimensions including: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension can be graded on 3 levels: 1-no problems, 2-moderate problems , and 3-extreme problems. Health states are defined by the combination of the leveled resp onses to the 5 dimensions, generating 243 (3 5) health states to which unco nsciousness and death are added.67 The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0, \"Worst health state,\" and 1, \"Best health state.\" The index score can be used in a quality adjusted survival analysis depending on the health state(s) of interest.68 For this study we plan to report the multidimensional utilities for co mparative purposes. The EQ-5D ha s now been tran slated into most major languages, with the EuroQol Group closely monitoring the translation process; translations can be accessed at www.euroqol.org . 11.4.4 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Sleep quality will be measured by 1 item (Q3) of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a self-rated questionnaire which meas ures sleep quality and disturbances.42 The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was developed to disc riminate between good and poor sleepers. The PSQI has good internal consistency (Cronbac h's alpha=0.83), stability (test-retest R T O G 0 8 1 5 27reliability=.85, P<.001) and discriminant validity. It has been used in patients with cancer and demonstrated sleep problems as expected.42 11.4.5 Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) Participants' level of physical activity will be assessed using th e Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ),43,44 which measures time spent per week in each of light, moderate, and vigorous activities. A score can be computed for each level of exercise. A total score is computed by summing the three levels weight ed by their respective metabolic (MET) equivalents of 3, 5, and 9. The GLTEQ has good test-retest reliability and has shown convergent validity with both objective and other self-report measures of physical activity.43,44 12.0 DATA COLLECTION Data should be submitted to: RTOG Headquarters* 1818 Market Street, Suite 1600 Philadelphia, PA 19103 *If a data form is available for web entr y, it must be submitted electronically. Patients will be identified by initials only (first middl e last); if there is no middle initial, a hyphen will be used (first-last). Last names with apostrophes will be identified by the first letter of the last name. 12.1 Summary of Data Submission (12/10/10) Item Due Demographic Form (A5) Within 2 weeks of study entry Initial Evaluation Form (I1) Pathology Report (P1) Pathology Material (P2) EPIC (FA) PROMIS (HP) EQ-5D (QF) PSQI/GLTEQ Form (QL) Post Treatment Evaluation Form (F0) ARM 2 only: At the start of RT and 3 months post RT Follow-up Form (F1) ARM 1: At 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after completion of RT, then every 6 months for 4 years, then annually ARM 2: At 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after completion of RT, then every 6 months for 4 years, then annually EPIC (FA) PROMIS (HP) EQ-5D (QF) During the last week of RT and at 6 months, 1 year and 5 years after completion of RT PSQI/GLTEQ Form (QL) Autopsy Report (D3) At the time of death (if available) 12.2 Summary of Dosimetry Digital Data Subm ission (Submit to ITC; see Section 12.2.2) [12/10/10] Item Due Preliminary Dosimetry Information (DD) R T O G 0 8 1 5 28Digital Data Submission - Treatment Plan submitted to ITC via SFTP account exported from treatment planning machine by Physicist Within 1 week of start of RT Digital data submission includes the following: CT data, critical normal structures, all GTV, CTV, and PTV contours Digital beam geometry for initial and boost beam sets Doses for initial and boost sets of concurrently treated beams Digital DVH data for all required critical normal structures, GTV, CTV, and PTVs for total dose plan (DV) Digital Data Submission Information Form (DDSI) - Submitted online (Form located on ATC web site, http://atc.wustl.edu/forms/DDSI/ddsi.html ) Hard copy isodose distributions for total dose plan (T6) NOTE: Sites must notify ITC via e-mail (itc@wustl.edu ) after digital data is submitted.

Assume an exponential survival distribution for each arm and define 1 is the hazard rate for Arm 1 and 2 is the hazard rate for Arm 2. (H A: 1 > 2 ). H0: 1 2vs. H A: 1> 2 Based on the prior results from multiple dose-esc alation trials in which patients were treated without androgen deprivation, we pr oject that the rate of 5-year OS of Arm 1 is 90% (a yearly hazard rate of 0.0211). The study is designed to sh ow an absolute improvement of 3.3% in the 5- year overall survival rate (i.e., a 5-year overall surv ival rate of 93.3%), which translates to a yearly hazard rate of 0.0139 in Arm 2. An exponential di stribution for overall su rvival distribution was assumed for each arm. Three interim analyses and a final analysis are planned for early stopping for the efficacy and futility. The efficacy test ing is based on the power family of test69 with =0 and the futility testing is based on the Freidlin and Korn70 method at a nominal significance level of 0.005. Two hundred twenty deaths are required to dete ct a 34% relative reduction in the yearly death rate with 85% statistical power using a one -sided log-rank test at the 0.025 significance level. After adjusting the sample size for these interim analyses, the sample size per arm for the R T O G 0 8 1 5 30hypotheses is 684. Guarding against an inelig ibility or lack-of-data rate of up to 10%, the final targeted accrual for this study will be 1520 patients. 13.3 Accrual and Duration (12/10/10) The proposed trial, RTOG 0815, builds on the ex perience obtained in RTOG 0126. RTOG 0126 involved a similar group of patients treated with dose-escalated radiot herapy and accrued 1431 patients over 6 years at an averag e rate of 20 cases per month. We are estimating an average of 20 cases per month in the new trial. We expect RTOG 0815 to complete accrual in 6.3 years. Based on patient accrual in prev ious RTOG randomized prostate studies, there will be relatively few entries during the initial 6 months while in stitutions are obtaining IRB approval. The total duration of the study is expected to be 11.3 years fr om the time the first patient is entered to the final analysis under the null hypothesis, the hazard rate of Arm 2 will not be better than that of Arm 1, and a uniform accrual rate of 20 patients per month. The RTOG Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will begin evaluating patient accrual semiannually following the anticipated quiet period. In accordan ce with CTEP policies for slowly accruing trials, if the average monthly accrual rate for the trial in the fifth and sixth quarters after study activation (i.e., in months 13-18) is less than 20% of the rate projected in the paragraph above (i.e., less than 4 patients per month), the study will close to further accrual. If the average monthly accrual rate is greater than 20% but less than 50% of projected (i.e., fewer than 10 patients per month), the trial will be placed on probation for 6 months. If the average monthly accrual rate at the end of the probationary period is less than 50% of projec ted, the study will close to future accrual. The participation of non-RTOG institutions through CT SU is expected to follow a similar pattern as seen in RTOG. 13.4 Analysis Plan (12/10/10) 13.4.1 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). T he time to failure for overall survival will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of documented death due to any cause. The overall survival function will be es timated by the K aplan-Meier method.71 We want to test whether or not the overall survival rate in Ar m 2 is higher than that of Arm 1. The null and alternative hypotheses are: H0: 1 2vs. H A: 1> 2 where, 1 and 2 are yearly death rate for Arm 1 and Arm 2, respectively. We will use the log- rank test72,73 with a significance level of 0.025 at the final analysis to test this hypothesis. In addition, the Cox proportional hazard regression model74 will be used to compare the treatment differences. Both adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be computed. The number of risk fact ors (1 vs. 2 or 3), como rbidity status (ACE-27 grade 2 vs, < 2), and modality (EBRT vs. EBRT+LDR brachytherapy boost vs. EBRT+HDR brachytherapy boost), age, and race (a s appropriate) will be adjusted for in this analysis. 13.4.2 Biochemical Failure by Phoenix Definition and Freedom From Failure The freedom from failure (FFF) rate by 5 years is defined as the proportion of patients without events of FFF failure by 5 years from randomizatio n among all eligible patients at baseline. The failure events for FFF will be the first occurrence of clinical failure (local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant metastasis), biochem ical failure by the Phoenix definition (PSA 2 ng/ml over the nadir PSA).60 Patients who are event free with less than 5 years of follow-up, die due to any cause, or who receive any salvage t herapy (e.g., salvage androgen deprivation, vaccine therapy, biologic/small molecule therapy, or ch emotherapy) will be censored. The biochemical failure (BF) rate by 5 years is defined in a similar way; the proportion of patients with biochemical failure by 5 years (PSA 2 ng/ml over the nadir PSA)60 from randomization among all eligible patients at baseline. The salvage ADT is defined as the first administration of subsequent ADT (either LHRH agonist or anti-and rogen). The rate of salvage ADT is defined as the proportion of patients who have salvage AD T by 5 years among all eligible patients at baseline. The endpoint FFF rate by 5 years will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method71 and the BF rate by 5 years will be estimated by cumulative incidence method.75 R T O G 0 8 1 5 31 The Z-test statistic for the difference between th e 2 rates with the standard errors estimated by Greenwood's method will be used, with a significance level of 0.025. The following test statistics (T.S.) will be used for testing between the 2 arms: = = = = += += 2 1 2 1 12 2 12 11 2 12 2 12 12 1 ) ( ) ( ) j j jjn i i i iin j j j jjn i i i ii rrfpp and 2p) are the FFF, BF, or the salvage ADT rate of Arm 1 and Arm 2, respectively, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method or cumulative incidence method, r i is the number of patients who are at risk and f i is the number of patients who have FFF, BF, or the salvage ADT failure events (i=1,2). If H 0 is rejected, then we conclude that Arm 2 is better than Arm 1. If H 0 is not rejected, then we conclude that Arm 2 is not better than Arm 1. In addition, logistic regression76 will be used to compare the treatment differences in the hypothesis with and without adjustment for at leas t the following covariates; the number of risk factors (1 vs. 2 or 3), comorbidity status (ACE-27 grade 2 vs, < 2), and RT modality (EBRT vs. EBRT+LDR brachytherapy boost vs. EBRT+H DR brachytherapy boost), age, and race (as appropriate). Odds ratios and the respective 95% confidence intervals will be computed. 13.4.3 Time to Failure of Secondary Survival Endpoints The time to failure for secondary endpoints (local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality, non-prostate cancer specific mortality) will be measured from the date of randomization to the dat e of the event of interest. The failure events for the secondary endpoints are defined as follow s\u2014local recurrence: biopsy-proven failure within the prostate/seminal vesicles; distant me and/or radiographic appearance of disseminated disease; prostate death due to prostate cancer; non-prostate cancer-specific mortality: death in a patient with disease clinically controlled. The treatment effect on these failures may impact the observable measures of outcomes (local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metast asis, prostate cancer-specific mortality, non- prostate cancer-specific mortality) and other compet ing risks may dilute the sensitivity. We will use the cause-specific hazard rate 77,78 (the instantaneous rate of cause-specific mortality in the presence of competing failure types as a function of time) approach to consider the competing events. Freidlin and Korn70 showed that the cause-specific ha zard rate approach is better than other approaches, for example, the cumulative incidence method,75 in most cases. The log-rank test on the times to the specific type of failu re, which considers the presence of competing events, will be used to test whet her the survival rates of these secondary endpoints in one arm are higher than that of the other arm for each hypot hesis at a significance level of 0.025. In this approach, patients who experience other failure fi rst are censored. In addition, Fine and Gray's regression79 will be used for these secondary survival outcomes. Both unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be computed. At least the treatment arm, the stratification variables (the number of risk factors, comorbidity status, and RT modality), age, and race (as appropriate) will be adjusted for in this analysis. 13.4.4 Estimation of Rates of OS of Patients Treated with the Different RT Modalities Three different RT modalities are allowed for th is trial: EBRT, EBRT+LDR brachytherapy boost, and EBRT+HDR brachytherapy boost. The rate of OS for patients treated with an RT modality among three modalities is defined as the prop ortion of patients who are treated with an RT modality and alive at 5 years from the randomization among all eligible patients treated with the RT modality at baseline. This rate will be estimated in each arm separately. 13.4.5 Comparison of the Incidence of Acute Adverse Events and Time to Late Grade 3+ Adverse Events and Correlation with Pre-Existi ng Comorbidity with Adverse Events Adverse events are scored according to CTCAE, v. 3.0. An acute adverse event will be defined as the first occurrence of worst severity of the adverse event occurring less than or equal to 30 days after the completion of RT. Univariate logistic regression76 will be used to model the distribution of acute adverse event s. Multiple logistic regression76 will be used to model the R T O G 0 8 1 5 32distribution of acute adverse events adjusted for covariates. Both unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be computed and tested using a one-sided Chi-Square test statistic with the si gnificance level of 0.025. Late grade 3+ adverse events will be defined as grade 3+ adverse events occurring more than 30 days after the completion of RT. The time to late grade 3+ adverse events will be measured from the time protocol treatment started to the time of the wo rst late grade 3+ adverse event. If no such late adverse event is observed until t he time of the analysis, the patient will be censored at the time of the analysis. Death without late adverse event will be considered as the competing risk for late adverse events and the distribution of ti me to late grade 3+ adverse events will be estimated using the cumulative incidence method 75 and tested using a one-sided Gray's test statistic75 with the significance level of 0.025. A Fine and Gray's regression model79 will be used to compare the treatment differences of time to late adverse event with and without adjusting for other covariates. Both unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be computed. At least the treatment ar m, the stratification variables (the number of risk factors and RT modality), age, and race (as appropriate) will be considered when it is adjusted in the analysis. The correlation of acute adve rse events and the ACE-27 grade ( 2 vs. 2) will be calculated by Chi-square test statistics at the significance level of 0.05. The acute toxicity will be considered in two ways: 1) absent or present or 2) grade 3 or < grade 3. The correlation of late adverse events ( grade 3 vs. < grade 3) and the ACE-27 grade ( 2 vs. 2) will be calculated by Chi- square test statistics at the significance level of 0.05. 13.4.6 Analysis for Endpoints Related to Quality of Life (QOL) Patient accrual for the QOL measurements will be limited to 200 cases in each arm. Quality of life will be assessed via the following instruments: the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC), the Patient-Reported Outcome Me asurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue domain, and the EuroQol (EQ-5D). Information regarding potential confounds will al so be collected in a short form (QL) using limited questions to minimize patient burden. Th is information can be used to evaluate the potential impact of these confoun ding factors on fatigue. Patient responses to the following will be collected in the QL form: muscle weakness (one item), overall sleep quality as measured by one item from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 42 and level of physical activity as measured by the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).43,44 Anxiety/depression is also a potential confound with fatigue and pat ient responses to the anxiety/depression item in the EQ-5D can be used. Protocol-eligible patients will be in cluded in the QOL analysis only if they agree to participate in the QOL portion of this study. All the QOL in struments (EPIC, PROMIS fatigue domain, EQ-5D) will be collected on all cases participating in this portion of t he trial. Patients will complete the EPIC, PROMIS fatigue domain, and the EQ-5D at pret reatment (baseline), week 3 of RT, at the last week of RT, and at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years after the end of RT. At the same time points, the QL form (i.e., one item from the PSQI, 3 items from the GLTEQ, and one question regarding general muscle weakness) will be collected. To minimize missing QOL data, we have included detailed instructions for collection of QOL and what to do if the patient misses a scheduled assessment, and RTOG provides individualized patient calendars available to Investigators and Research Associ ates 24/7 on the RTOG web site. We will describe the distributions of QOL data co llection patterns over all collection points in each treatment arm. Longitudinal data analysis, specifically the general linear mixed-effect model 80 will be performed to describe the change trend of the EPIC, PROMIS fatigue domain, and the EQ-5D across the 2 treatments. The pr imary objective in HRQOL analysis is to determine the QOL differences. The response will be the change of measurement from baseline for each measurement. The model will include the baseline and stratification variables (the number of risk factors, comorb idity score, and RT modality). Patient self-assessment of symptoms will be performed using 4 primary EPIC domains: urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms. The PROM IS fatigue domain consists of 7 questions to quantify the fatigue continuum (i.e., high to low), and good precision of measurement R T O G 0 8 1 5 33(discrimination function). Each question has a 5-point Likert scale (1-never, is a 2-part self-assessment questionnaire and only the first part will be used. This co nsists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depr ession). Each dimension is measured by a 3- point Likert scale (1-no probl ems, 2-moderate problems, and 3-extreme problems). There are 243 (=35) health states. We will transform the 5-item index score into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state) for comparative purposes. We hypothesize that the measurements from the EPIC will be wo rse in Arm 2 than Arm 1 because of the aggressiveness of treatment. We also hypothes ize that measurements from the PROMIS fatigue domain will be higher in Arm 2 than in Arm 1. To address the non-ignorable missing data caus ed by censoring survival time, the data analysis also will include patients who have not di ed. To examine trade-offs between survival time and QOL, we will combine them for each patient into a single measurement: Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). If (and only if) the pr imary endpoint hypothesis is substantiated, we will conduct a cost-utility analysis. The cost-u tility analysis will not be done until after the primary endpoint results are published. QALY is defined by the weighted sum of different time episodes added up to a total quality-adjusted su rvival time. These health state-based methods of quality-adjusted survival analysis are known as the quality-adjusted time without symptoms and toxicity method (Q-TwiST).45 Q-TwiST = i=1k qi si where q i is the quality (the utility coefficient) of health state i, s i is the duration spent in each health state, and k is the number of health states. We will use Glasziou's multiple health-state (Q-TwiST) models to use the repeated measur es of EQ-5D. Because Glasziou's method incorporates longitudinal QOL data into an anal ysis of quality-adjusted survival, the health- stated model must be constructed on the following assumptions: A1) QOL is independent from treatment. A2) A health state is independent from previous states. A3) Proportionality of quality-adjusted durati on and duration of the actual state of health Assumption A1 can be checked by plotting QOL over time according to treatment, and the t test can be used to compare the mean QOL scores of each treatment arm. Assumption A2 can be checked by comparing the QOL for patient groups in a given health state where the groups are defined by duration of previous health stat e experience using a regression model. Suitable checks for assumption A3 at minimum would be a simple plot. If data does not support these assumptions, we will use a method which uses the longitudinal QOL data directly. Cost-utility will be analyzed at 2 time points: at 1 year and 5 years posttherapy. We will use the 5-item utility score in EQ-5D for the cost-utility analysis. We will use the Z-test to test the hypothesis that the cost-utility in the 2 treatment arms is th e same with a significan ce level of 0.05 and a 2- sided test. To inspect the missing data mechanism, we will use at least a graphical method. A missing completely at random (MCAR) mechanism exists when missing values are randomly distributed across all observations. A missing at random (MAR) mechanism exists when values are not randomly distributed across all observations, ra ther than one or more sub-samples. If the cause of missing data is MCAR, listwise deletion (c omplete case analysis) will be done. If the MAR assumption is supported by the data, then an im putation method such as multiple imputation will be applied to impute missing data. If the MAR assumption is not supported by the data, then adjusting for covariates (such as the base line QOL score) might reduce the conditional association between outcomes and missing values. If missing data patterns look similar when stratified by such covariate(s), then an analysis that adjusts for such covariate(s) will be conducted and an imputation method such as multiple imputation will be applied. If approximate conditional independence cannot be obtained with any set of covariates, then MNAR (missing not at random) must be addressed by an explicit model for the missing data mechanism and then an imputation method such as multiple imputation will be applied. All results from the imputed analysis using the multiple imputation will be compared to the R T O G 0 8 1 5 34complete case analysis results to assess any potential biases. We will conduct a sensitivity analysis using various assumptions on the missing data to determine what impact missing data and imputation methods have on the study conc lusions. Imputation methods when prescribed by validated instrument developer s will be employed first. Additional methods or methods used when none are described for a given instrument may include linear mixed-effects models to obtain separate estimates for the QOL outcome within strata based on missing data patterns.81,82 RTOG recognizes that all options are subject to bias and analysis with more than one method for consistency across methods is prudent. 13.4.7 Correlation Between the Fatigue PROMIS Score Change and Plasma Cytokine Change Four hundred patients part icipating in the QOL port ion of this trial will be used for this analysis. The analysis will be done in each arm separately to test the prognostic vales of biomarkers. At least the following evaluated: CRP, TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-1ra, and IL-6. The highest fatigue is typically reported and plasma cytokine levels are known to be altered in the third to fourth week of radiati on therapy (RT). Therefore, the ev aluation time point will be 3 weeks after the start of RT. The fatigue PROMIS score change for each item will be calculated by subtracting the fatigue PROMIS score at 3 weeks following the start of RT from the baseline score. Similarly, the cytokine change will be calc ulated by subtracting the plasma cytokines measurement at 3 weeks following the start of RT from the baseline measurement. The fatigue PROMIS score change ranges from -4 to 4 (1-5 for each item). This will be categorized in a meaningful group at the time of analysis. The measure of each cytokine change will be a continuous variable. At the leas t, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to see if there is a correlation between the fatigue PROM IS score change and plasma cytokine change. Additional methods, such as linear mixed-effects, will be used. Additional time points will be tested in a similar way . 13.4.8 Collect paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, plasma, and whole blood for future translational research analyses The feasibility of proposed translational studies will be assessed followin g completion of accrual and sample collection. At the time of data maturity of this study, we will propose specific details of the markers to be investigat ed. We will address the assays that will be used and a list of specific correlative aims with appr opriate statistical considerations. 13.4.9 Group Sequential Testing for Early Terminat ion and Reporting of Efficacy and Futility A group sequential test with 3 planned interim analyses and a final analysis will be performed. The interim analysis will be carried out when the cumulative deaths are met. At each planned interim analysis, the p-value from the log-rank test statistic assessi ng treatment efficacy and futility with respect to the primary endpoint, OS, will be compared to the nominal significance level. The efficacy testing is based on the power family of test 69 with =0 (see Table 2 for nominal significance level for efficacy testing) and for the futility testing boundary we will use a less aggressive boundary, Rule C (at a nominal significance level of 0.005) in Freidlin and Korn. 70 The following hypotheses are tested: H0: 1 2vs. H A: 1> 2 where 1 and 2 are the hazard rate for Arm 1 and Arm 2, respectively. If the H 0 is rejected, then we conclude that the OS rate of Arm 2 will be better than Arm 1 and stop accrual if applicable. Table 2: Schedule for the Planned Interim Analysis Information Time Estimated Analysis Time* Cumulative Number of Deaths in the Two Arms Nominal Significance Level for Efficacy (Z-value) 0.25 4.7 years 55 0.0001 (4.049) 0.50 6.8 years 109 0.0018 (2.863) 0.75 8.9 years 163 0.015 (2.338) 1.00 11.1 years 218 0.025 (2.024) *Time to the interim analysis from the first patient entry without considering ineligibility or lack-of- data rate and under the null hypothesis For futility testing, the alternative hypotheses, H A (1 = 2 + 0.0072) will be tested at 0.005 level (the futility nominal significance level). If the com puted p-value is less th an 0.005 then we will R T O G 0 8 1 5 35consider stopping the trial in favor of the H 0 and conclude that the overall survival rate of Arm 1 will be better than Arm 2. Otherwise, we will continue the trial. Based on the results of each interim analysis, the following action will be taken and the responsible statistician will recommend to t he RTOG Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that the randomization be discontinued, if applicabl e, and the study be considered for early publication. Before making such a recommendat ion, the accrual rate, treatment compliance, safety of the treatments, and t he importance of the study are ta ken into consideration along with the p-value. The RTOG DMC will then make a recommendation about the trial to the RTOG Group Chair. 13.4.10 Interim Report to Monitor the Study Progress Interim reports with descriptive statistics will be prepared twice per year until the initial paper reporting the treatment results has been submitt ed. In general, the interim reports will contain information about the patient accrual rate wi th a projected completion date for the accrual phase, compliance rate of treatment delivery with the distributions of important prognostic baseline variables, and the frequencies and severity of the adverse event by treatment arm. The interim reports will not contain the results of the treatment comparisons with respect to the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints. This study will be monitored by the Clinic al Data Update System (CDUS) version 3.0. Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterl y by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. 13.4.11 Reporting the Initial Treatment Analysis The analysis reporting the treat ment results will be carried out after the criteria for early stopping/reporting are met. Five interim analyses and one final analysis will be performed for efficacy and futility of the addition of ADT and will be carried out as described in Section 13.4.9. It will include tabulation of all cases entered and those excluded from the analyses; the distribution of the important prognostic base line variables; safety treatments; treatment compliance; and observed results with respect to the primary and secondary endpoints will be shown. All eligible patients randomized will be in cluded in the comparison and will be grouped by assigned treatment in the anal ysis (intent-to-treat analysis). In addition, exploratory analyses of treatment comparisons of the primary and secondary survival endpoints will be tested using the Cox or Fine and Gray's proportional hazard model that includes treatment arms, the stratification factors (the number of risk factors and RT modality), age, and race (as appropriate). 13.5 Gender and Minorities In conformance with the National Institute of Heal th (NIH) Revitalization Act of 1993 with regard to inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research, participati on rates of men will be examined in the interim analyses. Based on the accrual statis tics from RTOG 94-08, we project that 81% of the men in the study will be White, 15% will be Black or African American, 3% will be Hispanic, 0.5% will be Asian, 0.3% will be Pacific Islande r and 0.2% will be American Indian or Alaskan Native. The following table lists the projected accrual by race/ethnicity. Projected Distribution of Gender and Minorities Gender Ethnic Category Females Males Total Hispanic or Latino N/A 46 46 Not Hispanic or Latino N/A 1474 1474 Ethnic Category: Total of all subjects N/A 1520 1520 Gender Racial Category Females Males Total American Indian or Alaskan Native N/A 49 49 Asian N/A 7 7 Black or African American N/A 228 228 R T O G 0 8 1 5 36 Gender Ethnic Category Females Males Total Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander N/A 5 5 White N/A 1231 1231 Racial Category: Total of all subjects N/A 1520 1520 13.5.1 In the setting of prostate cancer, African Am erican ethnicity has been associated with both increased incidence and inferior clinical outco mes. The etiology of this phenomenon remains unclear. As such, no specific differences in outcome are hypothesized based on race/ethnicity in this study. Data will be collected and available for retrospective outcomes analysis at the time of study conclusion. R T O G 0 8 1 5 37REFERENCES 1. Labrie F, Cusan L, Gomez JL, et al.

R T O G 0 8 1 5 41APPENDIX I RTOG 0815 Informed Consent Template fo r Cancer Treatment Trials (English Language) A Phase III Prospective Randomized Trial of Dose-Escalated Radiotherapy With or Without Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Thera py for Patients With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer This is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Y our study doctor will explain t he clinical trial to you. Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please ta ke your time to make your decision about taking part. You may discuss your decision with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care team. If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have prostate cancer. Why is this study being done? (12/10/10) The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of dose-escalated radiation therapy with or without hormone therapy on your prostate cancer. Prior studies have s uggested possible advantages to the administration of hormonal therapy with radiation. Howe ver, those studies were performed wi th radiation techniques that do not match those commonly used in clinical pr actice today (that is, dos e-escalated radiotherapy). Therefore, we will be testing to see if similar benefits for hormonal therapy are seen when us ed with current radiation therapy techniques. In current clinical practice, either radiation therapy alo ne (called Arm 1 or Group 1 in this study) or radiation therapy combined with hormone therapy (called Arm 2 or Group 2 in this study) would be considered an acceptable standard treatment for patients with a newl y diagnosed intermediate risk prostate cancer. The researchers conducting this study are testing the hypothesis that the si de effects of hormonal therapy are outweighed by an advantage in prostate cancer cure rates for patients receiving that treatment. There are 2 treatment groups in this study: 1) Patients who receive radiation therapy only 2) Patients who receive radiati on therapy plus hormone therapy If you agree to participate in this study, y ou will receive one of these 2 treatments. How many people will t ake part in the study? About 1520 people will take part in this study. What will happen if I take part in this research study? Before you begin the study ... You will need to have the following exams, tests or proc edures to find out if you c an be in the study. These exams, tests, or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done ev en if you do not join the study. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. History and physical exam, including a digital rectal ex am (DRE), an assessment of your ability to carry out activities of daily living (which will include ques tions such as whether you are able to feed, bathe, and dress yourself), and an assessment of other he alth conditions you may have (comorbidity). Blood tests to determine your PSA (prostate-specif ic antigen) and for blood count. The PSA value is a number that helps determine the aggress iveness of your prostate cancer. R T O G 0 8 1 5 42 A CT (Computed Tomography) scan or MRI (Magnet ic Resonance Imaging) of your pelvis and abdomen to determine if there is any evidence of cancer spread to the pelvic lymph node s. A CT scan is a study using x-rays to look at one part of your body. An MR I is imaging using a strong magnetic field to look at one part of your body. A bone scan (for some patients, if applicable) to determine if the cancer has spread to the bones During the study ... (12/10/10) (1/11/11) If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need the following tests and procedures. They are part of regular cancer care. Transrectal ultrasound assessment of th e prostate (brachytherapy patients only) Blood tests to measure testosterone and liver function An assessment of urinary symptoms and function (brachytherapy patients only) You will be \"randomized\" into one of the study groups des cribed below. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. A computer program will place you in one of the study groups. Neither you nor your study doctor can choose the group you will be in. You will have an equal chan ce of being placed in either group. If you are in group 1 (often called \"Arm 1\"): You will receive radiation treatments to the prostate gland and seminal vesicles once daily, 5 days a week, Monday through Friday, for a total of 44 treatments. Each radiation treatment will take approximately 20 minutes but may be sp ecific to the center in which you are being treated. If you choose to receive br achytherapy (permanent or temporary radiation seed implant), the total number of daily treatment sessi ons will be 25. The logist ics of the brachytherapy implant procedure (if you have chosen to undergo th is type of treatment) should be thoroughly reviewed by your treating physician. If you are in group 2 (often called \"Arm 2\"): You will receive radiation treatments to the prostate gland and seminal vesicles as specified under group 1 above. You also will receive hormone therapy for 6 months. The hormone therapy will begin 2 months before the start of the radiation treat ments. There are two parts to the hormone therapy. You will take injections of a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, ei ther under the skin or in the muscle (typically every 1 to 3 months), and you will take a pill, either flutamide three times per day or bicalutamide once per day. The injected LHRH agonist will reduce the am ount of circulating testosterone and the pill will interfere with the action of any remaining testosterone. During Radiation Therapy or Radiation Plus Hormone Therapy: You will be seen weekly during r adiation treatment to check for any side effects you may be experiencing as a result of the treatment. During the third week and the last week of radiation tr eatment, your ability to carry out activities of daily living (which will include questions such as whether you are able to feed, bathe, and dress yourself) will be assessed. If you are receiving brachytherapy: Blood test for bloo d count during the first and fifth weeks of treatment If you are receiving hormone therapy: Blood test to measure testosterone; monthly blood tests for liver function When you are finished receiving radiation therapy or radiation plus hormone therapy, you will need these tests and procedures: PSA measurement will be obtained at 6-8 weeks after finishing radiat ion treatment and prior to each follow-up visit. A physical assessment, including a digital rectal exam (DRE) and an assessment of your ability to carry out activities of daily living (which will include questions su ch as whether you are able to feed, bathe, and dress yourself) at 3 (group 1 only), 6, 9, and 12 months after finishing radiation treatment, every 6 months for 4 years, and y early thereafter. R T O G 0 8 1 5 43 If you receive hormone therapy: Testos terone levels will be checked ever y six months for three years or until they return to normal levels. Additional testing may be ordered as deemed clin ically appropriate by your treating physician. Study Plan Another way to find out what will happen to you during the study is to read the chart below. Start reading at the top and read down the list, following the lines and arrows. How long will I be in the study? (12/10/10) You will receive 44 radiation treatments over approximately 2 months. If you choose to receive the brachytherapy implant, you will receive 25 daily treatments plus the im plant procedure over a time frame of approximately 6 weeks. Hormone therapy, if given, will last 6 months. Afte r you are finished receiving therapy, the study doctor will ask you to visit the office for follow-up exams at 3 (group 1 only), 6, 9, and 12 months after finishing radiation treatment, every 6 months for 4 years, and yearly thereafte r. The study doctors would like to keep track of your medical condition by seeing you every year for your lifetime. Can I stop being in the study? Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop. He or she will tell you how to stop safely. It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thin king about stopping so any risks from the radiation and hormone therapy (if given) can be evaluated by him/her. Another reas on to tell your study doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study? You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taki ng part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, researchers don't know all the si de effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. These side effects may be related either to the radiotherapy, hormonal therapy (if randomized to receive it), or both. There are several radiotherapy options allowed on this study in the form of external beam radiation, low dose rate brachytherapy, and high dose rate brachytherapy. Each of t hese may be associated with subtle differences in their side effect profiles. The type of radiotherapy you receive on this study is a choice to be made between you and your physician. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen RRaannddoommiizzaattiioonn (You will be in one Group or the other) GGrroouupp 11 RRaaddiiaattiioonn TThheerraappyy 44 treatments if no brachytherapy or 25 treatments plus brachytherapy implant GGrroouupp 22 RRaaddiiaattiioonn TThheerraappyy 44 treatments if no brachytherapy implant PPlluuss HHoorrmmoonnee TThheerraappyy ffoorr 66 mmoonntthhss R T O G 0 8 1 5 44side effects. Many side effects go aw ay soon after you stop radiation or hormone therapy (if given). In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away. You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study. Risks and side effects related to the radiation therapy include those which are: Likely Increased urinary frequency or urgency Burning or discomfort/straining with urination Increased frequency of bowel movements or change in stool consistency Increased straining/discomfort with bowel movements Mild fatigue Less Likely Rectal bleeding (usually mild) Chronic bowel/bladder symptoms as described above Temporary blockage of urination requiring use of a catheter Erectile dysfunction For patients undergoing brachytherapy, risks associated with aspects of an invasive procedure such as those associated with anesthesia, infection, and bleeding mu st be considered and discussed with your treating physician. If permanent seed brachytherapy is us ed, there is a possibility of loss or migration of seeds leading to areas of under- or overdosage in certain parts of the pros tate or elsewhere. Rectal or bladder complications may occur if these organs are affected because of seed misplacement. Rare, But Serious Permanent rectal or bladder injury requiring surgery for treatment Risks and side effects related to the hormone therapy include those which are: Likely Hot flashes Erectile dysfunction Loss of libido Mild fatigue Breast tenderness or mild enlargement Diarrhea Less Likely Headaches Bone/joint pain Liver toxicity (detected on a blood test) requi ring reduced dose or stopping treatment Severe fatigue Skin rash/hives Swelling Decrease in bone mineral density There may be increased risk of rectal or bladder side effects as a result of the interaction between the hormone therapy and the exter nal beam radiation therapy. Rare, But Serious Severe allergic reaction Increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease Increased long-term risk of developing diabetes Reproductive risks : You should not father a baby nor donate sper m while on this study or during the first 3 months after the completion of therapy because the radi ation and drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby. Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth c ontrol methods to use and how long to use them. Some R T O G 0 8 1 5 45methods might not be approved for use in this study. Some of the drugs and radiation used in this study may make you unable to have children in the future. For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. Are there benefits to taking part in the study? Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. It is not known how much of a benefit combining hormone therapy with radiat ion therapy will have for your type of prostate cancer compared to the usual treatment. We do know that the information from this study will help researchers learn more about the combination of hormone therapy plus radiation therapy as a treatment for prostate cancer. This information could help future cancer patients. What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? Your other choices may include: Getting treatment or care for your cancer without bei ng in a study; this could include the following options, either alone or in combination with each other: o Radiation therapy (external beam radi ation therapy and/or brachytherapy) o Radiation therapy plus hormone therapy o Hormone therapy o Surgery Taking part in another study Getting no treatment Talk to your study doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study. Will my medical information be kept private? Data are housed at RTOG H eadquarters in a password-protect ed database. We will do our best to make sure that the personal information in your medical record wi ll be kept private. However, we cannot guarantee total privacy.

[*Only applies to sites using the CIRB.] Please note: This section of the informed consent form is about additional research that is being done with people who are taking part in the main study. You may take part in this additional research if you want to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say 'no' to participating in this additional research. R T O G 0 8 1 5 47You can say \"yes\" or \"no\" to each of the following studies. Below, please mark your choice for each study. Quality of Life Study We want to know your view of how your life has been affected by cancer and its treatment. This \"quality of life\" study looks at how you are feeling phy sically and emotionally during your cancer treatment. It also looks at how you are able to carry out your day-to-day activities. This information will help doctors better understand how patients feel during treatments and what effects the medicines are having. In the future, this informati on may help patients and doctors as they decide which medicines to use to treat cancer. You will be asked to complete 4 questionnaires at the fo llowing times: before treatment begins, during the last week of radiation therapy (with or without hormone ther apy), and at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years after the end of radiation therapy. It takes about 15 minutes to fill out each questionnaire. If any questions make you feel uncomfortable, you may skip those questions and not give an answer. In addition, if you agree to participate in this part of th e study, you will have blood draw n before you start radiation therapy treatment (with or without ho rmone therapy) and during the last week of radiation therapy treatment. We would like to keep about 2 tablespoons of blood at each of these times for future research. If you agree, this blood will be kept to be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. If you decide to take part in this study, you will be aske d to fill out the questionnaires and have blood drawn. You may change your mind about completing the que stionnaires and having blood drawn at any time. Just like in the main study, we will do our best to make su re that your personal inform ation will be kept private. Please circle your answer. I choose to take part in the Quality of Life Study. I agr ee to fill out the Quality of Life Questionnaires and have blood drawn. YES NO Use of Tissue and Blood for Research About Using Tissue and Blood for Research You are going to have a biopsy (or surger y) to see if you have cancer. Your doctor will remove some body tissue to do some tests. The results of these tests will be given to you by your doctor and will be used to plan your care. We would like to keep some of the tissue that is left over from your surgery for future research. If you agree, this tissue will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. Please read the information sheet called \"How is Tissue Used for Research \" to learn more about tissue research. This information sheet is available to all at the following web site: http://www.rtog.org/tissue%20for%20research_patient.pdf In addition, if you agree, you will have blood drawn befor e you start radiation therapy treatment (with or without hormone therapy) and during the last week of radiation therapy treatment. We would like to keep about 2 tablespoons of blood at each of these times for future re search. This blood will be kept to be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. Your tissue and/or blood may be helpful for research. T he research that may be done is not designed specifically to help you. It might help people who have cancer and ot her diseases in the future. Reports about research done with your tissue and/or blood will not be given to you or y our doctor. These reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect on your care. R T O G 0 8 1 5 48 Things to Think About The choice to let us keep the left over tissue and/or bl ood for future research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care or y our participation in the main part of the study. If you decide now that your tissue and/ or blood can be kept for research, y ou can change your mind at any time. Just contact us and let us know that you do not want us to use your tissue and/or blood. Then any tissue and/or blood that remain will no longer be used for research and w ill be returned to the institution that submitted it. In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health. While the study doctor/institution may give them reports about your hea lth, it will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are. Sometimes tissue and/or blood are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). Even if your tissue and/or blood are used for this kind of research, the results will not be put in your health records. Your tissue and/or blood will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your tissue and/or blood may help to develop new treatments for cancer in the future. Benefits The benefits of research using tissue and blood inclu de learning more about what causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them. Risks The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. Making Your Choice Please read each sentence below and think about your choice . After reading each sentence, circle \"Yes\" or \"No\". If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse, or call our research review board at __________________________ [IRB's phone number].
