Currently, no treatments with robust evidence of clinical benefit exist, and utilization of experimental agents have been recommended by national and international guidelines as a part of clinical studies.Method In this retrospective study, a total of 323 patients severe acute respiratory syndrome due to PCR-documented COVID-19 infection admitted in our unit were included. Patients were categorized into two groups as those who did or did not receive high dose intravenous vitamin C. we examined the effect of high dose intravenous vitamin C administered in addition to other commonly used agents on prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Results As compared to patients who did not receive vitamin C, those in the VC group were not significantly different in terms of the length of hospital stay (p=0.05), re-admission rate (p=0.943), admission to intensive care, need for advanced oxygen support (p=0.488), need for advanced medical treatment (p<0.001), and mortality (p=0.52).Conclusion The limited evidence based on small samples precludes definitive conclusions regarding the potential efficacy of high dose vitamin C in these patients, indicating the need for further assessment within the context of clinical research. Hasta ahora, la pandemia de la enfermedad por m\u00e1s de comparaci\u00f3n con los pacientes que no recibieron vitamina C, los grupo vitamina fueron significativamente en estos pacientes, lo que indica la necesidad de una mayor "}
