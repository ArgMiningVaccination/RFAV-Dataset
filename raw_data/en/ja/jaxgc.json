Dr. Ita Wegman and Rudolf Steiner PAAM's focus is on education, collaboration, and communication. - Education Anthroposophic Medical Training is open to MDs, DOs, NDs, NPs, PAs, dentists, pharmacists, and students of these disciplines. Our training offerings are developed for those new to Anthroposophic Medicine and for those with years of experience. - Collaboration We work with many groups and associations who advocate for holistic medicine both in the U.S. and abroad. We develop collaborative dialogues with academic organizations and institutions to bring forward better education and additional research. - Communication PAAM supports and sponsors doctors and nurses to speak and present research at critical academic and integrative symposiums and conferences, and to attend and speak at important events and school programs. PAAM is not alone. We actively promote and support efforts for additional research, accessible training, partnerships with key allies, a substantial grassroots movement, and the will and courage to actively face the legislative, regulatory, economic and cultural challenges of our time. We are members of the IVAA (International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations), which promotes the availability and integration of Anthroposophic Medicine in health care systems to improve health outcomes. We are associated with the Medical Section at the Goetheanum in Switzerland.

New Initiatives The Foundation for Health Creation PAAM has started a fledgling patient and public health platform to foster health creation and to develop resources for parents, families, communities and individuals to assist in navigating the challenges to being healthy and resilient in our modern-day world. Through the free seasonal e-newsletter as well as free and low-cost webinars, we are addressing topics such as home health, anxiety, nutrition, technology, vaccines, end of life care, pro-active health practices, environmental medicine, toxicology, the development of health resilience, and so much more. Academic Research and New Medical Facilities There is currently a Phase I clinical trial of Mistletoe therapy taking place at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. A Phase II trial will require substantial monetary support, and there are other important ongoing and potential Mistletoe studies in need of funding. There is also growing interest among the integrative oncology community to look collaboratively at feasibility and legislative changes that would allow for the growth of Anthroposophic Medicine and integrative medicine. Legislative activity and the development of clinic and hospital programs able to demonstrate the efficacy of Anthroposophic Medicine are greatly needed, and projects such as these will require significant funding and grants to make them a reality.
