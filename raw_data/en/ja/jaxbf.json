Carter, DVM, PhD, PhD, PhD, DECAR, (NP) is defined as a focal mucoid placental inflammation in which the bacterial infection(Amycolatopsis spp., and/or Crossiella equi as the most common isolates) is limited to the chorionic surface of the ventral placenta without infection of the fetus. NP was first diagnosed in Central Kentucky in 1986 and continued to result in episodic outbreaks of abortion and preterm birth in mares in 1998, 1999, 2011, 2017, and 2020. To date, the pathogenesis of the disease remains an enigma and attempts to induce an experimental infection in mares have been unsuccessful. While episodic in nature, NP remains a problem to the equine breeding industry, as its diagnosis and treatment remain challenging and economic impact is immense. In some cases, NP can be diagnosed through transabdominal ultrasonography to detect placental separation and the accumulation of hyperechoic exudate. However, since a limited area of the placenta is accurately visualized by transabdominal ultrasonographic scanning, the lack of apparent lesions in the placenta does not exclude the possibility of disease. NP treatment has been empirically applied and has been based on common treatments for ascending placentitis and the results of culture and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria isolated from lesions post-foaling. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review and updates on equine NP. "}
