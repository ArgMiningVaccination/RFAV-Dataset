This cleansing kit is composed of traditionally detoxifying, nourishing, mineralizing and therapeutic herbs known to target many organ systems, yet specifically focus on the liver, gallbladder and gut. These herbs can help boost the metabolism and assist in the removal of stagnation and toxic accumulation.* Cleansing and detox dates back to ancient times. The healing benefits of restricting certain dietary patterns, and adding cleansing superfoods is something that all ancient cultures practiced one way or another. Whether it was for spiritual/religious reasons, or to simply prevent dis-eases, cleansing regimes have been a natural part of human evolution. Cleanses can help deprogram cravings, over-accumulation and even mental patterning that needs weeding out. At Anima Mundi, we recommend cleansing several times a year. This makes it an easier habit to adopt, and optimizes higher level body-mind functioning and prevention.* Our Deep Detox Kit Contains: [Chanca Piedra:](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/chanca-piedra-liver-cleansing-tea) Liver & Gall Bladder Cleanser, a powerful medicinal herb from the Amazon rainforest.

Before any meal, take your [Amargo](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/herbal-bitters) about 30 minutes before eating to increase bile production (2-3x per day total). Think of this as your booster anytime you're about to eat a meal, or a heavier smoothie/ juice if you're on a juice cleanse.. Late AM: Within a green smoothie or juice, blend 1 tsp of [Liver Vitality](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/liver-cleanse-daily-purge) per 16oz of juice or smoothie. If you're experienced in cleansing you can double the amount for a stronger dose. 1-2 hours after lunch, drink 1 tsp of [Viridem Elixir.](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/greens-superfood-elixir) Mid-Late Afternoon: In a decaffeinated chai, or choice of warm latte or tea, incorporate 1 tsp of [Pau D'Arco](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/pau-d-arco-golden-tahuari-bark-organic). It's particularly tasty and effective when combined with aromatic and digestive, chai-flavors and very effective when coupled with digestive and aromatic plants like Cardamom, Cinnamon, Clove, Ginger, etc. Evening Tea: Add 1/4 tsp of [Chanca Piedra](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/chanca-piedra-liver-cleansing-tea) into your choice of evening tea. It works wonderfully with soothing and gentle herbs such as Tulsi, Rose, Fresh Ginger, Dandelion root, Burdock, Chamomile, etc. Optional: add 1/4 tsp Curam Elixir. *Depending on how you're feeling that day, you can swap the Pau D'Arco and Chanca Piedra. Recommendations This cleanse is best when coupled with a plant-based and high-fiber diet. It can also be kicked-up-a-notch with a liquid cleanse woven into it for a higher intensity approach. The herbs will last for about 1 month if used daily in the recommended ratios. Whether you're doing a 7 day, 14 day up to a 30 day cleanse, the herbs can be used in the same suggested pattern below along with your chosen dietary preferences. You can weave these herbs into any type of cleanse you might be doing, from an all liquid cleanse to a specific dietary routine, and you can use the herbs as described, or adjusted to your needs to optimize your strategy. But, most importantly follow you own GUT and listen to the pace you need to go. If you feel yourself wanting to go at a more gentle rhythm, please do so. Gauge the dosage that resonates with you if it feels like the recommended dosage is too much. It's (very) important to keep a peaceful and stress-free mind during a cleanse to avoid overproduction of stress hormones and damage.
