(e-mail: National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institu te of Fundamental Research, Bangalore 560 065, India Prion protein-mediated disorders appear to originate from the aggregation reactions of the prion protein. Like other amyloidogenic pr oteins, prion proteins form a range of fibrillar morphologies. The pre- fibrillar forms seen at the beginning of the reaction are also heterogeneous; he nce it appears that struc- tural heterogeneity sets in early during the aggrega- tion reaction. The prion protein aggregation may therefore proceed from many different precursor states, and structural hete rogeneity in prion fibrils might originate from the utilization of distinct nuclea-tion and elongation mechanis ms. This review discusses the current understanding of the structural heteroge- neity inherent in the aggregation reactions of prion proteins. It examines how an understanding of the structural and mechanistic basis of prion protein aggregation can provide molecular-level insights into the characteristic features of prion disorders, namely the infectious nature of the prion protein, prion strain phenomena and species barriers. Keywords: Alternative pathways, amyloid fibrils, oligo- mers, prion protein, structural heterogeneity. T prion protein (PrP) is a highly conserved glycopro- tein, which is expressed ubiquitously in the mammalian brain, specifically in neurons 1-3. It is composed of two domains4, is anchored to the cell membrane through a C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and is also glycosylated at two asparagine residues. The N-terminal domain is largely disordered, and has 4-5 octa-peptide repeats (Figure 1 a). It has a high affin- ity for divalent metal ions, such as Cu2+, and becomes partially structured upon interaction with Cu2+ (refs 5-7). The C-terminal portion is structured, consists of three long -helices and two small -strands, and has a disulphide bond that links helices 2 and 3 (Figure 1 a and b). The exact biological function of the prion protein is unknown. It has, however, been linked to multiple physio-logical processes 8,9. An alternative, non-native conforma- tion of protein, PrPSc, is infectious, and causes prion diseases10,11, a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), mad cow disease and scrapie. Discovery of the prion The cause of CJD was unknown for many years. The disease was known to progress fast, after onset, causing death within a few months without invoking any immune response 12-14. Similarities between CJD and Kuru in humans15, and also between Kuru in humans and scrapie in sheep16, became evident. Upon vaccination of sheep against scrapie, using a formalin-treated suspension of ovine brain and spleen, the sheep, instead of developing immunity against scrapie, succumbed to the disease 17, suggesting that the pathogen is resistant to formalin and heat. It was proposed that scrapie is caused by a 'slow Figure 1.

The full length mammal- ian prion protein has 209 amino acid residues, and consists of two do-mains. The N-terminal domain (23-120) is unstructured and contains 4-5 octapeptide repeats, shown in blue boxes between residues 51 and 91. The C-terminal domain (121-231) is folded into two small -strands and three -helices. This protein is anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor at the C-terminus. There are two glycosylation sites, at residues 181 and 197.

Along similar lines, it was proposed that Kuru is also transmissible like scrapie, and also occurs because of a 'slow virus' 16,19. It was later shown that the scrapie agent is highly resistant to ionizing and UV radia-tions 20-22. A similar resistance was seen for the CJD agent23. These findings led to the conclusion that the agents causing these diseases possessed highly unusual properties. The nature of the infectious agent was highly debated. Ideas regarding its nature ra nged from it being a small DNA virus or a membrane fragment, to a polysaccharide or a protein 24-30. It was observed that procedures that modified or hydrolysed proteins (such as treatment with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), urea, guanidinium thio-cyanate or phenol) affected the infectivity, whereas procedures that modified nucleic acids did not 10,31-33. The results established, for the first time, that a protein was required or responsible for these unusual diseases. The infectious agent was named as prion ('proteinaceous infectious particle') 10. After it was establ ished that the infectious agent is a protein, efforts were directed towards discovering the identity and properties of this protein. It was observed that a purified sample, which was enriched in scrapie infectivity, contained mostly one protein 34,35, which showed remarkable resistance to protease cleavage. Re-sistance to proteinase K cleavage helped in the isolation of a protein fragment of an apparent molecular weight of 27-30 kDa, which was called PrP 27-30 (refs 36 and 37). The resistance to proteolysis hindered sequence determi-nation of this protein 36. However, sequencing of its N-terminal region led to the subsequent molecular clon-ing of the PrP gene 1,2. It was realized that PrP 27-30 is the N-terminally truncated part (residues ~ 89-231) of the full-length prion protein1,2. Interestingly, PrP was detected at similar levels in crude lysates of scrapie-infected brain and in normal brain 37, supporting the hypothesis that PrP might be a secondary component involved in the disease38. It was, however, seen that the structural properties of the protein were different in the uninfected and diseased animals, which suggested that the normal (cellular) form of the prion protein (PrP C) adopts an alternative conformation (PrPSc) in prion diseases39. There has been much debate about whether prion dis-eases occur through the novel alternative conformation of the protein, or not. Evidence supporting the 'protein only hypothesis' is that the prion protein is required for patho-genesis, as mice lacking the prion protein never develop prion diseases 40,41. It has also been observed that overex- pression of the prion protein causes a decrease in the in-cubation period (the duration between infection and appearance of disease symptoms) of prion diseases, as well as an increase in susceptibility, suggesting that the protein is important for prion pathogenesis 42. Further- more, in the presence of lipid and RNA, full length recombinant moPrP converts in vitro into an infectious isoform43. Upon intra-cerebral injection into mice expressing the normal level of prion protein, they develop disease with all the neuropathological hallmarks of prion diseases 43. These observations confirm that no genetic material is required for prion transmission. The conver-sion of PrP C into its pathogenic isoform is facilitated by RNA (polyanions) and lipid, which can also be achieved just by changing the physical nature of the reaction con-ditions 44. The PrPSc conformation and prion-mediated toxicity The nature of PrPSc is still poorly defined, but it forms an aggregate, which shares features of amyloid fibrils formed by many other proteins. Amyloid fibrils are pro-tein aggregates with a high internal order. They possess a characteristic cross- motif, a -sheet bilayer, in which the sheet is organized parallel to and the -strands per- pendicular to the fibril axis45,46. The formation of amyloid fibrils by specific proteins is associated with specific neu-rodegenerative disorders 47,48. Like amyloid fibrils, the PrPSc conformation of prion protein is -rich49, is thermodynamically more stable50, more resistant against protease digestion34-37 and less soluble than its normal cellular counterpart, PrPC. Furthermore, prion rods, seen during the purification of PrPSc from the diseased brain, display properties of amyloid fibrils51. The amyloid plaques, formed in prion diseases, are rich in prion pro-tein 52-54. Thus, it seems that PrPSc represents either amy- loid fibrils of the prion protein, or amyloid aggregates formed during the course of amyloid fibril formation by the prion protein. Although the formation of PrP Sc is often associated with prion diseases, the molecular mechanism of prion-mediated toxicity is unclear. Mice lacking PrP C are nor- mal, and resistant to prion disorders40,41, suggesting that the loss of PrPC function due to its conversion into PrPSc is not the cause of the disease. Grafting PrPSc into a brain region lacking PrPC does not lead to prion pathogenesis55, suggesting that PrPSc is not toxic by itself. More recently, it was shown that depleting PrPC prevents disease and reverses spongiosis56,57, suggesting that there is a constant requirement of PrPC for pathogenesis. Furthermore, prion pathogenesis does not show a correlation with the amount of PrP Sc and sometimes the disease occurs even in the absence of any detectable PrPSc, suggesting again that PrPSc may not be the toxic form58-63. In the case of amyloid-related diseases, a view has emerged that the final amyloid fibrils are not the toxic form. Instead, the intermediate oligomers and protofibrils formed along the pathway of fibrillation appear to be the toxic forms 48,64-66. Along similar lines, it is possible that during the process of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc,REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1313 Figure 2.

Indeed, it has been reported that an oligomer is the most infectious species in prion disorders 67. The oli- gomeric forms found at the initial times of prion aggrega-tion appear to be toxic 68. But mature amyloid fibrils formed by the prion protein have also been reported to show toxicity 68, as do mature fibrils formed by other pro- teins69. It seems that fibril fragmentation enhances the cytotoxicity associated with amyloid fibrils69, but it re- mains to be seen whether fibril fragmentation increases the amount of toxic oligomeric intermediates of the prion protein as well as of other amyloidogenic proteins. Structural studies on PrPSc-like conformations and regions involved in PrPC to PrPSc transition While a high-resolution structure of PrPC is available70, not only is the structure of PrPSc ill-defined, but so also is its size, because of its high heterogeneity and insolubility. No covalent modification has been shown to be required for PrPSc formation71,72. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) -rich. Epitope mapping PrPC and structures73. Further- more, PrPSc has higher thermodynamic stability50, and, as noted above, a greater resistance to protease diges-tion 34-37. Multiple models have been proposed for the structure of PrP Sc. Electron crystallography of the two-dimensional crystals of PrP 27-30 (described above; Figure 2 a) and a mini-prion, PrPSc106 (23-88, 141-176; Figure 2 b)74 has suggested a model (Figure 2 c) in which residues 89- 175 form left-handed -helices and the C-terminal region remains in the native-like conformation75. Some molecular dynamic simulation studies have sug-gested that the core of amyloid protofibrils of the prion protein is composed of three-stranded sheets containing residues 116-119, 119-132 and 160-164 and an isolated strand containing residues 135-140 (ref. 76). The growth of protofibrils appears to occur via association of identical interfaces in which the isolated fourth strand is connected REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1314 to the three-stranded sheet forming a continuous four- stranded sheet, where the first and fourth strand interface forms spiral protofibrils with a 3 1 axis of symmetry (spi- ral model; Figure 2 d). According to this model, the three helices of the native protein are mostly unaffected or in-tact in protofibrils 76. This model was also found to be consistent with the 2D crystal of PrPSc (Figure 2 a). An experimental assessment of the -helical and spiral model has suggested that the spiral model for PrPSc (Figure 2 d) is consistent with most of the biochemical characteristics of the PrP Sc conformation77. An important result of these studies is that the -helices of the C-terminal domain re- tain their structure, and do not participate in the conver-sion of PrP C to PrPSc. On the other hand, a comparison of several features of the structure of PrP C to structures in a databank of 'normal' proteins has suggested that the most unusual structural features of PrP C are found in helix 2 (residues 172-194), which appears to be energetically frustrated in its helical state 78. Molecular dynamics simulations sug- gest that the second half of helix 2 (residues 184-194) and parts of helix 3 (residues 200-204 and 215-223) un-dergo a transition from an -helical conformation to a random coil state during PrPC to PrPSc conver- sion79. These results are consistent with recent hydrogen exchange (HX), electron para magnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and solid-state NMR (ssNMR) studies (see below). The structure of amyloid fibrils formed by recombinant human prion protein (r-huPrP) has been studied in detail. They are formed at pH 7, typically in the presence of 2M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), and are shown to be infectious in transgenic mouse models over-expressing PrP C (ref. 80). HX, site-directed spin labelling and EPR spectroscopy have suggested that the core of r-huPrP amyloid fibrils is composed of the C-terminal region of the protein molecule, which spans helix 2, a major part of helix 3, and the loop between these two helices in the native structure 81,82. No extensive hydrogen bond- ing, as indicated by the lack of significant protection against HX of amide hydrogens, has been detected in the N-terminal part of the PrP 90-231 fibrils, arguing against the involvement of the N-terminal region in the - structure core. Single line spectra observed in the core region of PrP using site-directed spin labelling and EPR spectroscopy have suggested that these residues form monolayers that stack on top of one another, forming a parallel in-register -structure (Figure 2 e)82. ssNMR studies of the full length Syrian hamster PrP (shaPrP; 23-231 residues) amyloid fibril, also suggest that the core of mammalian prion amyloid fibrils corresponds to residues 173-224 (ref. 83), and that the -sheets are indeed arranged in a parallel in-register structure (Figure 2 e). Hence, high-resolution data strongly indicate that the PrP C to PrPSc conformational transition occurs in the C-terminal domain during amyloid fibrillation. The amyloid fibrils formed by many other proteins too, including amyloid 84,85, -synuclein86, tau87, -sheet conformations, in which the adjacent peptide chains line up in the same N to C orientation, with corresponding residues apposing each other. It seems to be the most common fold of amyloid fibrils. The Y145 stop mutation in huPrP (huPrP 23-144) is associated with inherited prion disorders. There have been extensive structural studies of the amyloidogenic aggregates of this protein variant. Magic angle ssNMR spectroscopy has suggested that the core of the amyloid fibrils formed by this variant encompasses residues 112-141 (ref. 92), and that most of the other residues are largely disordered. The core is composed mainly of three -strands, containing residues 112-115, 118-122 and 130-139. Similarly, a study a vari-ant, containing the inherited prion disorder-associated mutation P101L, extended -sheet conformation93. HX measure- ments have suggested that the core of fibrils formed by this fragment is composed of two strands, containing residues 102-109 and 117-136, joined by a conforma-tionally heterogeneous turn formed by residues 110-116 (ref. 94). From these studies, it seems that in the case of prion fragments lacking the C-terminal domain, the fibril-lar core is composed mostly of residues 102-139. But in the case of the full-length prion protein, residues 160-220 form the core of the fibrils, and it remains to be answered as to why, despite their propensity to adopt a -sheet con- formation, residues 102-139 do not participate in fibrilla-tion of the full-length protein. The structure of infectious PrP Sc remains obscure. ssNMR-based studies have been carried out on an infec-tious sample of yeast PrP 91,95, but it is possible that in these studies the physical properties of the bulk of the amyloid do not represent those of the minority of the in-fectious amyloids. The structure of an infectious sample of mammalian rPrP has also been determined 80-82,94,96, but the infectivity of this sample was quite low. Importantly, it is now possible to generate infectious PrP Sc-like con- formations, whose infectivity is similar to that of PrPSc isolated from animals, from rPrP in vitro . This would certainly be of great help in understanding the structural features of infectious PrP Sc. A recent HX study with infectious PrPSc has revealed that the core is composed of residues 80-90 to 231 (ref. 97). While understanding the structures of amyloid fibrils and infectious PrP Sc is important, one also needs to understand how they form. Also, it is necessary to know how the aggregation process gets initiated, what kinds of intermediates are formed, and the kinds of residues and interactions that are important for their formation. Not only will these studies lead to a better elucidation of the features of prion diseases, but will also help in the generation of therapeutics. REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1315Mechanism of amyloid fibril formation Amyloid fibril formation seems to commence from par- tially structured conformations of proteins98-100, which appear to provide the necessary intermolecular interac-tions for assembly. But owing to their transient nature, direct structural information on aggregation-competent, partially unfolded conformations is available only for a few proteins 101,102. Partial unfolding in the case of a globular protein and partial folding in the case of a natively unfolded protein, both leading to the formation of an aggregation-competent, partia lly-structured conformation, can be induced by mutations, by changes in the environ-mental conditions or upon chemical modification 103. Although a structural perturbation of the native structure resulting in the formation of a partially structured con-formation seems to be necessary, a globular protein could conceivably expose a locally unfolded segment, for example, during its conformational breathing motions, to form amyloid fibrils 104. The mechanism of protein aggregation is often describable by two basic (linear) consists of two stages, nucleation and growth. The nucleation phase consists of a number of thermodynamically unfavourable equilibria. The nucleus represents the highest energy structure, and its formation constitutes a bottleneck in the polymeriza-tion reaction. Once the nucle us is formed, subsequent steps become favourable. The kinetics of an NDP reac-tion 107,108 shows a lag phase, which is abolished when a small amount of nucleus in the form of fully formed fibril is provided as a seed at the beginning of the reaction. There is a critical concentration for the formation of a polymer, and a strong depende nce of the nucleation rate on protein concentration. On the other hand, an isodesmic (linear) polymerization reaction 106 does not involve sepa- rate nucleation and elongation phases, and polymerization from any of the monomeric subunits is equally favour-able 110,111. Each association step involves an identical interaction; consequently, th e rate constants are inde- pendent of polymer size. Thus, an isodesmic polymeriza-tion reaction resembles the elongation phase of an NDP reaction. The kinetics of an isodesmic polymerization reaction does not involve a lag phase, and no critical con-centration exists. Kinetic studies can distinguish between the two poly-merization models, but it is not easy to do so because the distinction between them is not always robust, and depends on the nucleus size as well as on the associa- tion and dissociation rate constants. Furthermore, NDP and isodesmic models represent two extremes of protein polymerization, and it is conceivable, as seen for amyloid fibril formation by several proteins, that a poly-merization reaction can possess features of both models 109,111. For a few proteins, the amyloid fibrillation reaction can be described well as a NDP reaction. For the aggregation reaction of most proteins, however, the kinetics shows only weak dependences on protein concentration 112-116. This weak dependence on protein concentration has been interpreted as an NDP mechanism involving a small nucleus size. A monomeric nucleus has been suggested in the case of polyQ peptides, which indicates that an unfa-vourable conformational change in the monomeric protein may constitute the rate-determining nucleation event 115,117. An NDP mechanism with a monomeric nucleus would be similar to the monomer-directed con-version model, a model proposed for PrP C to PrPSc con- version (see below). Furthermore, secondary nucleation events, such as nucleation on the surface of pre-existing fibrils or on exogenous impurities, have been proposed to occur during the formation of amyloid fibrils by a few proteins 108,112-114,116,118-120. For many proteins, spherical oligomers and/or proto-fibrils are seen to form rapidly at the beginning of the aggregation reaction leading to the formation of mature amyloid fibrils. For such proteins, the aggregation mechanism has been referred to as 'assembly via oligo-meric intermediates' 112,121-123. In this mechanism, the formation of the pre-fibrillar aggregates appears not to be limited by an unfavourable nucleation event, and, there-fore, can be considered as isodesmic polymerization. Because of the heterogeneity i nherent in the process, and the insoluble nature of mature fibrils, it is not easy to carry out kinetic measurements to determine whether the pre-fibrillar aggregates are on the direct pathway to mature fibrils, or whether they are off-pathway aggregates. For example, in the case of yeast prion protein Sup35NM, single molecule experiments indicate that fibril growth occurs by monomer addition 113, which would suggest an off-pathway role for the pre-fi brillar aggregates that have been reported in other studies112 to be on-pathway. Nevertheless, for some proteins, it appears that the pre-fibrillar aggregates do lie on the direct pathway of fibril formation 124-129. In such cases, amyloid fibril formation might nucleate within the pr e-fibrillar aggregates and grow via many different ways109. In most amyloid fibril formation reactions, the growth of aggregates and the acquisition of -sheet structure seem to be coupled112,121,128,130-132. It appears that the associating units (monomers or oligomers) first add on to the ends of the growing aggregates, and then undergo the -sheet conformational change. Recently, it has been seen for three proteins that amyloid fibril formation occurs from conformationally converted oligomeric intermedi-ates, i.e. the -sheet conformational change occurs in the oligomeric intermediates before they associate with the ends of growing aggregates 123,127,133. It seems that any individual protein can adopt multiple, distinct fibrillar morphologies 134, and that a range of pre- fibrillar states precedes the formation of fibrils by many REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1316 proteins. In the case of the prion protein, it appears that structural heterogeneity prevails at the level of pre-fibrillar oligomers and protofibrils 133. In this context, an understanding of the initial and intermediate stages of amyloid fibril formation reactions can provide an insight into the structural heterogeneity inherent in mature fibrils. Understanding the structural as well as the kinetic basis of the conformational polymorphism seen in amyloid fibril structures is a major goal of studies on protein aggregation, including prion protein aggregation studies. Prion diseases have several characteristic features not shared by other neurodegenerative diseases associated with amyloid fibril formation, and it is crucial to gain molecular-level insight into how these features arise. Characteristic features of prion diseases Infectiousness The PrPSc conformations can replicate themselves and cause the conversion of PrPC to its PrPSc self10,11. The ability to be infectious in this manner differentiates prion diseases from other amyloidogenic disorders. Prion repli-cation is often described either by a refolding model (monomer-directed conversion; Figure 3 a) or by a seed- ing model (nucleation-dependent polymerization; Figure 3 b). According to the refolding model135, PrPC and PrPSc are separated by a high activa tion energy barrier, and the conformational change associated with PrPC to PrPSc con- version constitutes the rate-limiting step for the process. Figure 3. Models for the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (an alternative conformation). Yellow squares represent PrPC and blue circles PrPSc. a, Refolding model and b, Seeding model. Reprinted with permission from Weissmann137. PrPSc acts as a template and upon interaction induces a conformational change in PrPC to convert it into PrPSc. According to the seeding model136, PrPSc exist as oli- a number of unfavourable equilibria. PrPSc is therefore regarded as the nucleus of a classical nucleation-dependent polymeriza-tion reaction (see below). Upon formation, PrP Sc acts as a seed to convert more PrPC into PrPSc, leading to the formation of prion fibrils. Because of the presence of an unfavourable nucleation step, there is a lag phase in the reaction. The exponential nature of the kinetics of this reaction suggests that the pr ion aggregates undergo con- tinuous fragmentation to generate more and more seeds for growth 137. Since PrPSc formation is always seen to be associated with oligomerization67, the seeding model has been widely accepted as the more plausible mechanism for the replication of PrP Sc. Both models of PrPSc forma- tion (Figure 3) can be, however, described as slight varia-tions of the NDP model, where the nucleus is monomeric in the case of the refolding model and oligomeric in the case of the seeding model. Prion strains The same prion protein can give rise to a range of infec-tious conformations (prion strains), which differ in their incubation periods, the brain ar ea they affect, and their disease phenotypes 138-143. Earlier, it was debated whether prion diseases occur because of viruses or proteins (see above). At that time, the observation of different prion strains led to opposition of the 'protein only hypothesis', because it was difficult to understand as to how a protein could adopt multiple confor mations. Later, it was shown that the prion strains represent distinct conformations of PrP Sc. These strains show differences in their protease digestion patterns144, secondary structure content145, epi- tope exposure146, as well as stability towards thermal denaturation147. When different strains are transmitted to isogenic animals, strain differences become apparent as differences in incubation pe riods or phenotypes, suggest- ing that differences in strains are not because of differ-ences in the hosts 148, but arise from differences in the structure of PrP. Strains also appear to differ in glycosy-lation patterns, and in the attachment of GPI anchors 149,150. The role of these covalent changes versus non-covalent structural changes, in defining the strain is, however, not understood 143,151. Species barrier Infectious prion isolated from one species either does not transmit or transmits with a longer incubation period, into another species. This phenomenon is referred to as the 'species barrier' for prion transmission 24. In the case where transmission of prion from one species to another occurs REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1317with a longer incubation period, subsequent transmission to the same species occurs with a decreased incubation period. After many rounds of transmission in the same species, the incubation period becomes fixed 24. This phe- nomenon is known as adaptation. It now appears that many of the characteristic features of prion diseases may originate from the amyloid forma-tion reaction of the prion protein. It is important to criti-cally examine the mechanism of mammalian prion protein aggregation, the structural he terogeneity inherent in the process, as well as the possible roles prion aggregation may play in determining the characteristic features of prion diseases. Recombinant PrP as a model system to study prion aggregation Recombinant prion protein (rPrP) has been used exten- sively to study the aggregation of prion proteins. Like naturally occurring PrP, rPrP has a folded C-terminal domain and an unstructured N-terminal domain, and has the disulphide bond linking helices 2 and 3 intact. Although it lacks any post-translational modifications, including the C-terminal GPI anchor, its structure and thermal stability are similar to those of naturally occur-ring PrP 152. This suggests that post-translational modifi- cations do not affect significantly the stability and structure of PrP C. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, it can be converted in vitro into an infectious prion iso- form43,44. Thus, it becomes an easily producible and useful model system to study the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. Mechanism of amyloid fibril formation by the prion protein Onset of prion aggregation The observation that amyloid fibrillation reactions com- mence from partially structured conformations (see above) suggests that the process of fibril formation is linked intricately with the folding reaction. There have been several studies of the folding of the prion protein, mostly with fragments (PrP 90-231 or 121-231) containing the C-terminal domain, which has a folded structure. The prion protein folds rapidly; hence it has been difficult to study its folding kinetics and to characterize its folding pathway. Early stopped-flow mixing studies of the fold-ing and unfolding of the C-terminal prion domain 121-231 had suggested that this domain folds without any detectable intermediate 153. Later studies showed the pres- ence of a folding intermediate, as suggested by the devia-tion from linearity in the folding arm of the chevron plot, and a burst-phase change in fluorescence during the reac-tion 154. The folding intermediate was found to be popu-lated more at acidic pH than at neutral pH154. Continuous- flow mixing measurements showed that there are two dis-tinct phases in the folding reaction of the rhuPrP 90-231 (ref. 155), providing direct evidence for the rapid accu-mulation of an early folding intermediate (with a time constant of 50 s), followed by a rate-limiting folding step (with a time constant of 700 s) 155. The presence of a folding intermediate has also been shown by HX studies in native-like conditions 156. A high-pressure 2D NMR study has suggested the presence of a metastable unfold-ing intermediate at pH 5.2 (ref. 157). It has been suggested that an alternative conformation of the prion protein (PrP*) binds to PrP Sc and gets con- verted into PrPSc conformation158,159. The aggregation rate shows no direct correlation either with the destabilization of the native prion protein or with the familial mutations associated with the prion diseases 160. Interestingly, the familial mutations associated with prion diseases appear to stabilize the folding intermediate161, suggesting that PrPSc formation might be commencing through this fold- ing intermediate. Moderate c oncentrations of denaturants stabilize the folding intermediate and facilitate aggrega-tion 154,162. The observation that the intermediate present in the folding or unfolding pathway of the prion protein is populated more at acidic pH is consistent with the view that PrP Sc formation can occur in the endocytic pathway where the pH is slightly acidic163,164. These indirect lines of evidence suggest that the aggre-gation of PrP may initiate from the monomeric folding or unfolding intermediate. Direct kinetic evidence correlat-ing the amount of intermediate, when modulated either by denaturant concentration or by mutation, with the rate of aggregation, is yet to be obtained. Equilibrium between -rich monomer and -rich oligomer Native PrP, which is rich in -helical structure, under- goes a structural transition into a -rich conformation in the presence of a trace amount of urea with NaCl, or of GdnHCl 162,165-167. The -rich conformation has exposed hydrophobic surfaces, as indicated by increased ANS binding 165, and is oligomeric. Its formation involves con- current protein-protein association and conformational change 166. The -rich oligomer appears predominantly octameric, as suggested by electrospray mass spectro-metry measurements 168. The native disulphide bond remains intact during the oligomerization process166. The observation that a partially denaturing condition and acidic pH accelerate conversion into -sheet suggests that the unfolding intermediate might be involved in the formation of the -rich oligomer. The pH-dependence of the structural transition sug-gests that the -rich monomeric PrP exists in equilibrium with the -rich oligomer168-170. The equilibrium favours REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1318 the -rich monomeric PrP at neutral pH, and the -rich oligomer at acidic pH. The -rich oligomer appears to be separated from the -rich monomeric PrP by a large acti- vation energetic barrier167. The kinetics of the structural transition of the -rich monomeric PrP into -rich oligo- mer is hyperbolic, as monitored by the change in the sec-ondary structure as well as by the increase in size, using size exclusion chromatography 166. The reaction does not show any effect of seeding, suggesting that this process is not autocatalytic, which is characteristic of PrP C to PrPSc conversion (see above). Recently, -rich oligomers have been seen to form at pH 2, in the absence of any denaturant128,129,133. At this pH, their structure appears to be different from those of other -oligomers reported earlier. Prion oligomers rich in -structures are also formed upon removal of the disulphide bond in the presence of NaCl171,172. Further- more, discrete soluble oligomeric forms are seen to form upon thermal unfolding of the prion proteins at low pH (~ 3.5) in the presence of salt173-175. Although the far-UV CD spectra of the oligomers formed in different conditions suggest that they are - rich, they differ in their FTIR spectra173-175. It therefore appears that high structural heterogeneity exists in the oligomeric aggregates formed by the prion protein. In order to understand the phenomenon of prion strains, it is crucial to determine the role of structurally distinct prion oligomers in the amyloid fibril formation reaction, as well as in the pathological diversity of the prion proteins. Transition of -rich monomer into amyloid fibrils The -rich monomer, the predominant form present at neutral pH, forms long, straight amyloid fibrils in the presence of a denaturant, in a process that appears to be nucleation-dependent (pathway I; Figure 4 a and b and 5)114,168-170. The aggregation kinetics involves a lag phase (Figure 4 b), which is abolished upon the addition of a small amount of seed at the beginning of the reaction. However, the aggregation properties of the prion protein are not completely consistent with the classical NDP model (see above). Although the kinetics involves an ini-tial lag phase, the lag phase is only weakly dependent on protein concentration, and does not fit to a t 2 depend- ence114 (Jain and Udgaonkar, unpubl ished). This suggests that the aggregation reaction involves secondary nuclea-tion events 114. A plot of the log of the elongation rate versus the log of the protein concentration was seen to be linear, with a slope of 1, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of polymerization is conformational rearrangement in the polypeptide upon assembly, rather than associa-tion 114. The length of fibrils depends on pH114; shorter fibrils form near neutral pH, where fibrillation is faster, and longer fibrils form at lower pH, where the fibrillation kinetics is slower. This observation has been interpreted in terms of the off-pathway nature of the -rich oligomer. Near neutral pH, a higher amount of monomers leads to rapid nucleation. Hence a large number of nuclei are formed, leaving behind a small concentration of mono-mers available for elongation, and, consequently, shorter fibrils are formed. At acidic pH, the equilibrium shifts in favour of the -rich oligomer, and due to a smaller con- centration of the -rich monomer, fewer nucleation sites are formed, leaving behind a relatively larger concentra-tion of monomers to take part in the elongation of the nuclei into fibrils. Consequently, longer fibrils are formed at acidic pH. In a recent study (Figure 6), spherical oligomers were seen to form during the initial lag phase of the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation at neutral pH. Interestingly, these oligomers appear to be capable of seeding the aggregation reaction, which suggests that they are on the direct pathway to the mature fibrils (Jain and Udgaonkar, unpublished). The presence of an oligomeric intermediate can explain the unusual nature (weak dependence of the lag phase as well as of the aggregation rate constant on protein concentration) of prion protein aggregation (see above). It would be important to characterize the core of these oligomers and fibrils in order to gain insights into how these oligomers lead to the formation of fibrils. High-resolution atomic force microscopy studies on the long, straight amyloid fibrils formed by the full-length mouse prion protein (moPrP) have suggested that the fibrils are highly heterogeneous in their structures. They differ in the number of protofilaments as well as in the manner in which the protofilaments are intertwined to form fibrils 176. Several other studies have also exposed the heterogeneity inherent in prion fibril structures. Changes in the aggregation conditions have been seen to lead to the formation of morphologically distinct prion fibrils which differ in their stabilities, as monitored by epitope exposure using ELISA at different GdnHCl con-centrations 177. Differences in shaking conditions were also found to lead to structurally and morphologically distinct fibrils (S-shaped and R-shaped fibrils) 178, but it seems that a contamination of 0.1-1% PrP 30-231 in the full-length PrP 23-231 preparation was responsible for these two conformational variants of fibrils 179. These two fibril polymorphs had different folding patterns of the -strands, as characterized by CD, FTIR, HX, proteinase K digestion and the binding of conformation-sensitive fluorescence dyes, suggesting that they had different secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures 180. The -rich oligomer leads to the formation of worm-like fibrils Many studies had suggested that the -rich oligomer is an off-pathway aggregate and does not directly participate inREVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1319 Figure 4.

An off-pathway role for the -rich oligomer had been indicated by a study of the pH dependence of the formation of long, straight fibrils (see above), which showed that the length of the lag phase decreases with an increase in the amount of the -rich monomer, and increases with an increase in the amount of the -rich oligomer. This suggested that the formation of long, straight fibrils commences from the -rich monomer169. Epitope mapping, proteinase and peptide mapping suggested that the -rich oligomer and long, straight amyloid fibrils have different internal structures 168. The off-pathway nature of the -rich oligomer is consistent with the dependence of the length of the long, straight fibrils on the pH of the reac-tion (see above). It is important to realize that the studies suggesting an off-pathway role for the -rich oligomer involved the use of high concentrations of salts and denaturant168-170, which can inhibit the growth of the -rich oligomer. In the presence of a low concentration of salt and in the absence of denaturant, the -rich oligomer, formed by moPrP gives rise to worm-like fibrils at pH 2 (Figure 4 c and d)128,133, having a fibrillar morphology that is struc- turally different from that of the long straight fibrils formed from the -rich monomer (pathways II and III; Figures 4 a, c and Figure 5). The worm-like fibrils have smaller diameters, as determined from their heights on AFM mica, and curly morphologies (Figure 4 c). Interest- ingly, worm-like fibril formation involves a pathway that is distinct from that of the long, straight fibril formation. The kinetics of worm-like fibril formation is hyperbolic; REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1320 Figure 5. Pathways of amyloid fibril formation by the prion protein. The -rich monomeric form of the prion protein exists in a pH- dependent equilibrium with the -rich oligomer. At pH 7, the equilibrium favours the -rich monomers, which, in the presence of sub- denaturing concentrations of de naturant and upon shaking at 37 \u00b0C, form long, straight amyloid fibrils (pathway I). The transition of the -rich monomer into long, straight fibrils occurs through spherica l oligomeric intermediates, and the transition appears to be n ucleation- dependent. The equilibrium between the -rich monomer and the -rich oligomer favours the latter The -rich oligomer con- verts into worm-like fibrils in a process that appears not to be limited by an unfavourable nucleation event. The -rich oligomer consists of two distinct oligomeric sub-populations, the larger oligomer (oli gomer L) and the smaller oligomer (oligomer S). Oligomer S app ears to be an off-pathway aggregate formed in competiti on with the on-pathway oligomer L. The transition of oligomer L into worm-like fibr ils occurs through alternative pathways. In one pathwa y (pathway II), which operates at 120 mM NaCl, the -sheet conformational conversion follows aggregate growth, while in the other (pat hway III), which operates at 200 mM NaCl, the -sheet conformational conversion pre- cedes aggregate growth. In pathway II, late ral association of the elongate d aggregates, which leads to the formation of mature, worm-like fibrils, constitutes the final step. In contrast, lateral association and -sheet conformational conversion occur simultaneously in pathway III. The worm-like amyloid fibrils formed in the al ternative pathways differ in their structures. no lag phase is seen (Figure 4 d). The kinetics shows a weak dependence on protein concentration, and there is no apparent critical concentration, suggesting that the process is not limited by nucleati on. It appears, therefore, that the formation of worm-like fibrils follows the isodesmic (linear) polymerization mechanism. It remains to be investigated whether the morphologically distinct fibrils formed on the separate pathways involve the same or different core segments of the amino acid sequence. The fibrillation of moPrP and 2-microglobulin shows remarkable similarity128,181. For both the proteins, the formation of long, straight fibrils commences from mono-mers in a nucleation-dependent manner, whereas an oli-gomer forms worm-like fibrils in a process that appears not to be limited by an unfavourable nucleation event (Figure 5). The aggregation reaction can be switched between the two pathways by a change in aggregation con- ditions 181. It remains to be seen whether the fibril formation reactions of other proteins also share this feature. The -rich oligomer has been shown to consist of two distinct sub-populations, namely a large oligomer (oli-gomer L) and a small oligomer (oligomer S), which differ not only in their sizes but also in their secondary struc-tures 129. Interestingly oligomer L, and not oligomer S, transforms directly into worm-like fibrils (Figure 5)129. The transformation of the -rich oligomer into worm-like fibrils occurs in multiple steps128, and pathways133. The worm-like fibrils formed on the alterna-tive pathways differ in their external dimensions as well as in their internal structures133. The reaction can be switched between the alternative pathways by carrying out the reaction at different salt concentrations (pathways II and III; Figure 5). Salts appear to modulate the aggre-gation mechanism via a direct physical interaction with the protein 133. Fibril formation by the full-length prion protein requires unusual and typically drastic environmental con-ditions. The formation of long, straight amyloid fibrils requires the presence of 1-2 M of GdnHCl, or both 1 M GdnHCl and 3 M urea, with 150 mM NaCl (refs 168, 170, 182), and invariably requires agitation of the solu-tions. It is now possible to aggregate a mutant variant, associated with an inherited prion disorder, at pH 4 in the absence of any denaturant, but continuous shaking is essential for the induction of aggregation reaction 183. The formation of worm-like fibrils occurs only at low pH, although it does not require agitation. It would appear that protonation of critical residues leads to the formation of an amyloidogenic conformation by destabilization of the native structure. The formation of worm-like fibrils would occur at undetectable levels, and slowly, at pH 7, because the protonated amyloidogenic conformation would be present at very low concentration at this pH. The slowness of the aggregation of such protonated amy-loidogenic conformations may be physiologically rele-vant, because the prion diseases are late-onset diseases 184.

AFM images of aggregates formed at different time-points during the formation of long, straight fibrils by the mouse prion protein. The reaction was carried out at 37 \u00b0C, pH 7, and with 750 rpm shaking. For the 26, 45 and 51 h time-points, the pro-tein was diluted to 0.6 M before applying onto the mica. In the case of the 66, 74 and 130 h time-points, the protein was diluted to 5 M before applying onto the mica. Molecular origin of the characteristic features of prion diseases Infectiousness The amyloid fibrils formed by yeast as well as by mammalian PrP adopt an in-register parallel -sheet (see above). The parallel in-re gister structure can explain the infectious nature of prion proteins; the ends of the fibril provide a template guiding the conformation of the new monomer joining the fibril to be the same as the last monomer already in the fibril 185,186. Presently, it is not known whether the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc by PrPSc is similar to the conversion of the soluble proteins into amyloid fibrils by seeds from the fibrils. Prion strain The phenomenon of prion strain, wherein the same prion protein forms a range of infectious particles, appears to originate from the ability of a prion protein to aggregate into structurally distinct amyloid aggregates. Amyloid polymorphs of a prion protein may form by distinct arrangements of an amyloidogenic segment in different amyloid aggregates (packing polymorphism), by partici-pation of different amyloidogenic segments in different amyloid aggregates (segmental polymorphism), or by a combination of the former two (combinatorial polymor-phism) 187. From the observation that distinct amyloid aggregates of prion can form in vitro , either upon protein mutation or upon a change in aggregation conditions, it is conceivable that different mutations in the prion protein, or fluctuations in the environmental conditions prevailing within cells, underlie the phenomenon of prion strains. It is insightful to consider the following observations. Recently, it has been shown that prions can evolve in cell culture 188. A heterogeneous population of brain- adapted prion, when transferred to cell culture, adapts to the cellular environment, and out-competes the original brain-adapted prion 188. Upon re-inoculation into the brain, it is out-competed by the brain-adapted prion188. Similarly, in cell culture, a swainsonine inhibitor-resistant prion sub-strain becomes selected (evolved) in swainsonine inhibitor. The inhibitor-resist ant prion sub- strain, in the absence of the inhibitor, is out-competed by an inhibitor-susceptible counterpart 188. This suggests that the prion protein aggregates or PrPSc are highly heteroge- neous and, depending on the environmental conditions, only a few conformations survive and are transmitted. When amyloid polymorphs formed under different aggregation conditions, were i noculated into mice, it was observed that the stable amyloid fibrils produce a prion strain with a longer incubation period, whereas the more labile amyloid fibrils genera ted a different strain, which had a shorter incubation period 177. As suggested by in vitro prion aggregation studies176,178, these observations imply that the conformational inadaptability between various types of PrP Sc, which appears to constitute the basis of prion strains and the species barrier, can origi-nate also from the environmental conditions that they have evolved in. Species barrier The species barrier may originate from differences in the sequence of a few critical regions of the prion proteins from different species, which can lead to the formation of species-specific conformations of PrP Sc. If the prion sequences of two species have differences in these critical regions, the PrP Sc conformation of one would be incom- patible with the prion sequence of the other, and the PrPSc REVIEW ARTICLE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 101, NO. 10, 25 NOVEMBER 2011 1322 conformation of one would be incapable of converting the PrPC of another species into PrPSc. It is instructive to consider the following observations189,190. PrP 23-144 has been used extensively as a model sys-tem to understand the species barrier as well as the strain phenomenon in prion diseases. Using different fragments, it was observed that the fragments ending before residue 139 did not show a propensity for amyloid fibrillation. This indicated that residues within the 138-141 segment are critical for amyloid fibrillation 191. The PrP 23-144 fragments of huPrP, moPrP and shaPrP have distinct lag phases, and show differences in the structures of the amy- loid fibrils formed. huPrP can be seeded with huPrP or moPrP, but not with shaPrP. moPrP can be seeded with either of the three, and shaPrP can be seeded only with shaPrP. A comparison of the amino acid sequences in the critical region 138-141 of the prion proteins from these three species shows species-specific differences at posi-tions 138 and 139. Interestingly, species-specific substi-tutions of a single amino acid residue in the critical region can bypass the species barrier, as judged by seeding capability. Furthermore, the sequence-specific seeding specificity correlates well with the structural characteristics of the amyloid fibrils formed 189,190,192. The degree of dis- similarity in the steric zipper structure seems to deter-mine the transmission barrier 192. Thus, it appears that amyloid fibrils of prion proteins of different species rep-resent different strains, and that the species barrier, as well as prion strains, originate from the inability of the conformations of different prion sequences to adapt to each other in segments critical for amyloid fibril forma-tion. Conclusions Studies with purified proteins are now providing insights into the mechanism of prion protein aggregation and the structures of prion aggregates. The aggregation reaction of the prion protein appears to commence from a partially structured conformation, and progression towards prion fibrils is highly dependent on the aggregation conditions. At neutral pH, the prion protein, under strongly destabi-lizing conditions, transforms into long, straight fibrils with sigmoidal kinetics, and the reaction appears to be nucleation-dependent. On the other hand, at acidic pH the prion protein aggregates, without any requirement of the presence of denaturant, to form worm-like fibrils, a fibril morphology that is strikingly different from that of the long, straight fibrils that form at neutral pH. The forma-tion of worm-like fibrils follows hyperbolic kinetics and appears not be limited by an unfavourable nucleation event. Under both conditions, a structurally diverse en-semble of oligomeric species is populated at the initial stages of the reaction, which appears to lead to structur-ally distinct amyloid fibrils. The observation that struc-tural heterogeneity exists also at the initial stages of fibrillation, suggests that it se ts in early during the reac- tion. The formation of structurally diverse aggregates at the initial stages of the reaction suggests that many dif-ferent precursor states could be utilized for the formation of mature prion fibrils. The transitions of distinct precur-sor states into prion fibrils appear to utilize distinct path-ways of aggregation. A change in protein sequence or a change in the aggregation conditions, may switch the reaction between the available alternative pathways, and can thereby lead to the formation of structurally distinct prion aggregates. Although the exact relationship of in vitro prion aggre- gation to prion-mediated cell toxicity awaits future studies, the principles of prion aggregation, emerging from the in vitro studies, appear to provide potentially the molecular basis of prion infection, replication, as well as the origin of prion strains. It is, however, important to note that similar principles underlie the amyloid fibril formation reactions of many other proteins. The parallel in-register structure, that potentially defines the molecular basis of the infectious nature of the prion protein, is the most common fold of amyloid fibrils, and amyloid fibrils of many other proteins possess this fold. It is increasingly becoming evident that structural heterogene-ity as well as template-assis ted conformational changes, are characteristics of protein aggregation by many other proteins 134,193-195, whose aggregates appear infectious in cell culture, as well as upon grafting and injection into animals 188,196-205. It is not clear as to why infectiousness is restricted only to the prion protein in nature, and why other amyloidogenic proteins do not appear to be infec-tious. Future studies may clarify whether the infectious nature of the prion protein originates from the presence of its C-terminal GPI anchor 206, which is absent in other amyloid-forming proteins. 1.
