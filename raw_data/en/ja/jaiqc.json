We have systematically reviewed antibiotic duration and timing of intravenous to oral switch for 36 paediatric infectious diseases and developed evidence-graded recommendations on the basis of the review, guidelines, and expert consensus. We searched databases and obtained information from references identi ed and relevant guidelines. All eligible studies were assessed for quality. 4090 articles were identi ed and 170 studies were included. Evidence relating antibiotic duration to outcomes in children for some infections was supported by meta-analyses or randomised controlled trials; in other infections data were from retrospective series only. Criteria for intravenous to oral switch commonly included defervescence and clinical improvement with or without improvement in laboratory markers. Evidence suggests that intravenous to oral switch can occur earlier than previously recommended for some infections. We have synthesised recommendations for antibiotic duration and intravenous to oral switch to support clinical decision making and prospective research. Introduction Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for children in hospital, but few data are available to inform optimal duration of therapy. In view of the global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, the need for evidence-based recom mendations for the optimal duration of intra-venous and oral antibiotics, and when to switch from the intravenous to the oral route, is crucial (appendix reference [AR] 1). Shorter antibiotic courses can potentially a ect antimicrobial resistance, and have already been advocated for a few infections (AR 2 and 3). So far, there has been no systematic review of the evidence guiding the minimum duration of intravenous antibiotics before switching to oral treatment for infections in children. We aimed to determine, in children younger than 18 years with bacterial infections, the minimum intra-venous and total antibiotic duration required to achieve outcomes similar to or better than those with traditional longer durations administered for speci c infections. We then aimed to make evidence-based recommendations for optimal intravenous and total antibiotic duration and criteria for intravenous to oral switch. Methods The Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Infectious Diseases Australasian Stewardship of Antimicrobials in Paediatrics (ANZPID-ASAP) group of the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases collaborated on this study. Using 2009 PRISMA guidelines (appendix), the group systematically reviewed the literature on intravenous and total duration of antibiotics and the timing of switching from the intravenous to oral route for 36 infections in children younger than 18 years. Evidence-based recom-mendations synthesised from the review ndings, relevant guidelines, and consensus opinion of the group were produced (appendix). There were four review coordinators (BJM, DA, DI, PAB) and 18 review contributors. Search strategy and selection criteria The group searched MEDLINE from 1946 to Nov 21, 2014, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (up to Nov 21, 2014) using a standard overall strategy for all infections, and then separately with speci c terms for each infection (appendix). Further information was obtained from secondary references identi ed from articles, and relevant guidelines. All study types published in peer-reviewed journals and published con-ference abstracts, except single case reports, were included. Studies were limited to those in human beings and reported in English, but no restrictions on year of publication were applied. Studies included were those of children younger than 18 years diagnosed with a bacterial infection for whom data about intravenous, oral, or total antibiotic duration and outcomes were reported. When data were scarce in children and the infection was likely to be similar in children and adults, relevant adult studies identi ed from other information sources were also reviewed. Interventions assessed were comparison between di erent intravenous antibiotic durations, comparison between di erent oral antibiotic durations, comparison between the use of intravenous and oral antibiotics, intravenous or oral antibiotic durations, and criteria for intravenous to oral switch. Outcome measures sought were clinical improvement or recovery and persistence of infection, complications, and recurrence of infection. No restriction was set on follow-up duration because of the di ering natural histories of included infections.

Risk of bias was assessed (appendix) at study level according to adapted grading of evidence and recommendations by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC; AR 4). Risk of bias a ected data synthesis by attributing weight according to the assessed bias in the study. No speci c assessment was made for reporting bias, though it has been identi ed in our review where deemed possible. Negative studies were included. Data extracted and synthesised were ages of participants, underlying comorbidities (eg, immuno-compromised), type of bacterial infection, duration of intravenous antibiotics, duration of oral antibiotics, persistent or recurrent infection, and complications of infection. The only simpli cation made was that if a systematic review included multiple similar studies with similar outcomes not all of them were independently cited. Data synthesis and recom mendations incorporated the level of evidence and weighted the risk of bias accordingly.Guidelines Evidence-graded recommendations were made for intravenous and total antibiotic duration and timing of intravenous to oral switch for bacterial infections in children. These guidelines were made on the basis of a synthesis of the literature from the systematic review, relevant current guidelines (AR 5-28), and expert consensus opinion from the ANZPID-ASAP group. In making recommendations, the group applied grading of evidence strength and consistency according to the adapted NHMRC criteria (appendix; AR 4). Role of the funding source No funding was provided for this study. Findings Our search identi ed 4090 abstracts. 671 potentially relevant articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 170 studies met the inclusion criteria ( gure). Most studies were not of high quality, with only 61 (36%) being randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews (appendix). Speci c infections were reviewed individually, and for most of them there were no systematic reviews or trials of antibiotic duration or intravenous to oral switch. Bacteraemia and endocarditis Antibiotic duration for meningococcal bacteraemia can depend on coexistent meningococcal meningitis. In of all-cause bacterial meningitis, children with meningococcal meningitis with or without meningo-coccaemia who were improving were randomised to short (4-5 days) versus long (7-10 days) duration of intravenous antibiotics; no deaths or relapses were recorded in either group. 1,2 In observational studies, 4 days of intravenous antibiotics for meningococcaemia is not associated with excess mortality or relapse. 3,4 In two systematic reviews including several di erent study types and a large retrospective study of occult pneumococcal bacteraemia, no di erences in serious complications between intravenous and oral antibiotics were recorded. 5-11 However, children who remained febrile at follow-up (median 33 h) were more likely to have developed focal infections or persistent bacteraemia if they were treated with oral antibiotics. 11 Results from another series showed that intravenous antibiotics given for fewer than 2 days and oral antibiotics for 10 days did not result in any complications. 12 For bacteraemia with associated pneumonia, initial intravenous antibiotics led to a lower admission rate than did oral-only antibiotics and improved condition at follow-up. 13 In a small trial of neonates with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, Chowdhary and colleagues14 showed higher treatment failures with 7 days of intravenous antibiotics than with 14 days. Three retrospective series documented wide variations in median duration of intravenous antibiotics (5-162 days). 15-17 In a study of neonates with meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia, the Child Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia (P N Britton, Prof D Isaacs); Infection Management and Prevention Service, Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia (J E Clark BMBS, C Nourse MD); Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, SA Pathology, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, SA, Australia (C M Cooper BMBS); Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia (Prof N Curtis PhD, J Osowicki MBBS, M Starr MBBS, P A Bryant PhD); Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia (Prof N Curtis, J Osowicki, P A Bryant); Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia (Prof N Curtis, M Starr, P A Bryant); Department of Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia (G M Haeusler MBBS); Department of Infection and Immunity, Monash Children's Hospital, Clayton, VIC, Australia (G M Haeusler); School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia (J E Clark, C Nourse); and Department of Paediatrics, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, NT, Australia (J R Francis MBBS) Correspondence to: Dr Penelope A Bryant, Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia penelope.bryant@rch.org.au See Online for appendix4251 records identied through database search65 additional records identied through other sources 226 duplicates removed 4090 records screened 3417 records excluded 3174 not relevant 176 case reports 67 non-English language 673 full-text articles assessed for eligibility 503 full-text articles excluded 251 not relevant 109 no relation between antibiotic use and outcome 94 included in systematic review 26 adult data only 20 case reports 2 retracted 1 Cochrane review subsequently updated 170 studies included in systematic review Figure: Study pro lewww.thelancet.com/infection Published online June 16, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30024-X 3Review mean duration of vancomycin treatment for those without any complications was 9\u00b77 days (SD 5\u00b71), although recurrences were greater with fewer than 14 days of antibiotics than with 14 days or longer. 18 Children with MRSA bacteraemia without endocarditis had a median antibiotic duration of 22 days (IQR 12-29), with bacteraemia persisting for a median of 6 days (IQR 2-7), despite e ective antibiotics. 19 Results from a retrospective study of uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in children showed no di erence in mortality or recurrence between short (median 10 days, IQR 10-10) and longer course (14, 14-17) of intravenous antibiotics. 20 In Hakki and colleagues' retrospective study21 of mostly adults with P aeruginosa bacteraemia after stem-cell transplantation, risk of recurrence was increased but not signi cantly so (p=0\u00b706) when fewer than 14 days of antibiotics was compared with 14 days or more. The only data on antibiotic duration in multiresistant Gram-negative bacteraemia are from a study in critically ill adults: after onset of bacteraemia length of stay in hospital was the same for patients with sensitive (median 27 days, IQR 9-63\u00b75) as with resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia (35 days, IQR 10-77), suggesting lack of need for long-term antibiotics with Gram-negative resistance (AR 29). Two studies of bacteraemia caused by non-typhoid salmonellae showed no di erence in com-plications or recurrence between less than 7 days of antibiotics and 7 days or more. 22,23 Outcomes in retrospective studies24-26 of central venous catheter (CVC) infection with S aureus or Gram-negative organisms in children and adults vary: salvage can be successful if bacteraemia clears rapidly (AR 30 and 31). In two studies of CVC-associated S aureus bacteraemia in children, median intravenous antibiotic duration was 10 days 24 and 14 days,26 with duration, CVC removal, and recurrence being unrelated. In adults, longer durations decrease complications. 16,27,28 After line removal for CVC infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci and Bacillus species, short intravenous courses (3-5 days and 5-7 days, respectively) are non-inferior than longer courses. 29-31 Results from small series in immuno- competent and immunocompromised children showed that CVC-associated bacteraemia resolved with 7-21 days of intravenous antibiotics, but no studies have compared antibiotic durations with line removal or retention. 32-36 A few studies of anti-infective locks have yielded mixed results, and larger studies are awaited. No trials in childhood infective endocarditis exist, so practice is usually extrapolated from adult data. Results from retrospective studies in children show that antibiotic durations are unrelated to complications or recurrence (all-cause 4-6 weeks, 37,38 S aureus 2-6 Streptococcus pneumoniae use).40 Guidelines for treatment of viridans streptococci rely on adult data, which show that shorter durations (2-4 weeks) are e ective for susceptible isolates (AR 32-35). Oral antibiotics alone were used in six patients for a median of 6 weeks with no recurrences in one small study published in 1977 . 41 CNS infections In a systematic review of bacterial meningitis in children no di erence in outcomes between 4-7 days and 7-14 days of antibiotics was recorded, 2,42-46 and results from observational studies show low failure rates with 4-7 days. 47,48 However, potential selection bias could reduce the applicability of the results. A large trial in resource-poor countries found similar outcomes with 5 or 10 days of ceftriaxone, 1 although the study lacked power to assess individual organisms. Failures have occurred after treatment for up to 14 days for Listeria monocytogenes meningitis, 49 and 21 days of treat- ment is recommended for Gram-negative meningitis (AR 36). Intraventricular antibiotics increase mortality so are not recommended (AR 37 and 38). In a large retrospective study of childhood brain abscess, there was no di erence in morbidity or mortality between patients who received less than 6 weeks, 6 weeks, or more than 6 weeks of antibiotics, and no di erence in outcome by amount of intravenous versus oral antibiotics in patients who received 6 weeks of antibiotics in total. 50 In an observational study, children with positive cultures and clinical improvement received 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by 4 weeks of oral antibiotics with no increase in recurrence. 51 Studies mostly in adults have assessed intravenous durations of 1-2 weeks, with intravenous to oral switch based on clinical improvement and normalisation of C-reactive protein and found no recurrences (AR 39 and 40). 52 Results of studies of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection in children show that, irrespective of antibiotic duration, the highest chance of cure is with shunt removal. 53,54 For simple shunt infection the mean e ective intravenous antibiotic duration was 9\u00b77 days (SD 1\u00b77) and with intraventricular antibiotics 6 days (SD 1\u00b77) to 8 days (range 3-17). 55,56 For complicated shunt infection (eg, multicompartment hydrocephalus), 3 weeks of intra-venous and 2 weeks of intraventricular antibiotics were e ective. 57 In three studies, shunt reinfection was not associated with duration of antibiotics.58-60 In one study with shunt retention, if there was no blockage or infection with S aureus, intravenous or intraventricular antibiotics for 14 days resulted in no recurrence by 6 months. 61 Respiratory infections In pharyngitis and otitis media, either antibiotics are not needed or oral antibiotics are prescribed, so they are not included in this Review. In a small trial in children and adults with drained peritonsillar abscess, a comparison of intravenous and oral antibiotics showed no di erence in complications or recovery time. 62 In two studies of drainage and initial intravenous antibiotics the median length of stay was 4 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online June 16, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30024-XReview 2-3 days as a proxy for intravenous antibiotic duration, although no information about postdischarge antibiotics was given. 63,64 In adults, drainage followed by single-dose intravenous and 7 days of oral antibiotics is e ective65 (AR 41), although resolution can occur with drainage alone or antibiotics alone. 63,66 In four retrospective series of children with drained retropharyngeal abscess the average intravenous duration was 3-6 days and oral duration 7-10 days, with no clinically signi cant complications. 67-70 51 (75%) children in one study were managed with antibiotics alone. 68 Clinical symptoms such as return of neck mobility and toleration of oral fl uids and diet were indications for intravenous to oral switch. 69,70 Oral durations varied from 7-9 days on the basis of symptom improvement to 3-6 weeks on the basis of CT resolution with no major complications with either duration, suggesting that 7-9 days is su cient. 69,70 Three retrospective and one prospective series with low complication, low recurrence rates, or both found average durations of treatment with intravenous antibiotics of 4\u00b75-7 days for uncomplicated mastoiditis and 7\u00b78-11 days for mastoiditis with mastoidectomy, 71-74 followed by an average of 7-9 days of oral antibiotics.71,73 C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) did not predict length of stay or oral antibiotic duration in one study in which patients without intracranial com-plications received 7-10 days of oral antibiotics after discharge and at least 15 days if there were intracranial complications. 75 No di erence in rate of readmission to hospital between intravenous and oral outpatient treatment after mastoidectomy was found. 76 Of four trials of acute sinusitis comparing 10-14 days of antibiotics with placebo, two favoured treatment and two found no di erence in outcomes. 77-80 Results from two systematic reviews suggested that children with severe illness (fever >39\u00b0C, 3 days of purulent nasal discharge, headache, facial pain) can bene t from antibiotics 81 and that those with non-severe illness are likely to improve after 7 days with or without antibiotics. 82 Authors of a Cochrane review83 and a systematic review84 calculated that eight children needed to be treated with antibiotics to achieve one additional cure, and results from the systematic review showed that the e cacy of antibiotics was not established. A trial compared 3 with 5 days of azithromycin, and showed similar clinical resolution. 85 No di erence in outcomes was found in a systematic review in adults comparing short (3-7 days) with longer durations of antibiotics (AR 42). Only retrospective, hospital-based case series of acute cervical lymphadenitis have been published and most start intravenous antibiotics, but they probably represent a minority of cases. 86-88 Durations vary widely for intravenous use from 2 to 22 days and 7 to 10 days for oral use; longer durations were often associated with surgical drainage. 86-90 Recurrence rates in all studies were low. A Cochrane review of children aged 2-59 months with non-severe pneumonia found no di erence in outcomes for 3 versus 5 days of antibiotics.91 Four additional trials in children aged up to 12-16 years found no di erence between 3-5 days of antibiotics and longer durations.85,92-94 In comparisons of intravenous with oral antibiotics for moderately severe pneumonia, three trials and a Cochrane review showed similar resolution of fever and oxygen requirement. 95-98 However, severe pneumonia (oxygen saturation <85%, shock requiring intravenous fl uid bolus) or complicated disease (immuno com- promised, chronic lung or heart disease, pleural e usion at diagnosis) were excluded. In their systematic review in children younger than 5 years in resource-poor settings, Lassi and colleagues 99 concluded that 3 days of oral antibiotics was su cient for non-severe pneumonia. A systematic review of all aspects of ventilator-associated pneumonia in children yielded no paediatric data for antibiotic duration, so on the basis of adult data the recommendation was to stop antibiotics after 3 days if cultures were negative or after 8 days with clinical or biomarker improvement (AR 43). All other studies are in adults: results from systematic reviews, trials, and a prospective study comparing short course (7-8 days) with longer course (10-15 days) antibiotics showed no di erence in mortality (AR 44-49). In one study a higher recurrence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia was recorded with 8 days of antibiotics than with 15 days if sputum but this recurrence did not lead to higher mortality (AR 44). Declining infl ammatory markers including C-reactive protein (AR 50) and procalcitonin (AR 51) are associated with better outcomes, but have not been used to guide intravenous to oral switch. A Cochrane review of short-course versus long-course antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill adults found no increase in mortality when procalcitonin was used to guide antibiotic cessation (AR 52). No studies of antibiotic duration for pleural empyema in children exist. A systematic review of operative versus non-operative management found mean antibiotic durations of 12\u00b78 days (SD 3\u00b78) and 21\u00b73 days (SD 7\u00b79), respectively, although whether the route was intravenous or oral was not speci ed. 100 In another systematic review, length of stay in hospital (as a proxy for intravenous antibiotic duration) was similar with an average of 6 days for both groups. 101 In studies comparing di erent antibiotics but with the same duration, 14 days or more of intravenous antibiotics were used with relapse being uncommon. 102,103 In a retrospective series of S pneumoniae empyema, there was no di erence in intravenous antibiotic duration and outcomes between penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains, suggesting that longer durations for resistant bacteria are unnecessary. 104 Few studies of lung abscess in children have been done. A comparison of antibiotics alone (with or without percutaneous drainage) with surgical drainage found a mean of 18 days of intravenous antibiotics in the medical www.thelancet.com/infection Published online June 16, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30024-X 5Review (antibiotic only) group compared with 26 days in the surgical group with similar mean oral durations (13-17 days), which were unrelated to clinical or radio logical improvement or mortality. 105 Three other retro spective series found a mean total antibiotic duration ranging from 24 to 40 days. 106-108 Two trials in adults stipulated a minimum of 6 days of intravenous antibiotics, but did not relate duration to clinical improvement (AR 53 and 54). Musculoskeletal infections In two systematic reviews, short course intravenous antibiotics (<7 days 109 and 3-4 days110) for uncomplicated acute osteomyelitis had similar cure rates to longer courses, with one of them 110 suggesting that a total of 3 weeks was su cient.109-112 In a large trial, after a median of 4 days of intravenous treatment, no di erence in cure between 16 and 26 days of oral antibiotics was seen.113 Some studies base intravenous to oral switch on clinical response and others include C-reactive protein. 113 Data are lacking for complicated acute osteomyelitis, but experts suggest longer-term intravenous duration. Although not powered to nd a di erence, an analysis of bacteraemic bone and joint infection in children showed no di erence in mean intravenous antibiotic duration (4 days) or outcomes between patients with and without bacteraemia. 114 The inadequate evidence available for subacute and chronic osteomyelitis in children was highlighted in a systematic review of 14 small observational studies; the conclusion was that long courses of antibiotics are no more e ective than shorter courses, and that 2 days of intravenous plus 6 weeks of oral antibiotics will su ce. 115 A Cochrane review in adults found no di erence between intravenous and oral antibiotics (AR 55). In a retrospective study, adolescents whose prosthetic spinal rod was removed because of chronic infection received 2-3 days of intravenous and 10 days of oral antibiotics with no recurrence. 116 There are no studies of antibiotic duration when prosthetic material remains. Although the conclusion from a systematic review of acute septic arthritis in children was that the ideal antibiotic duration was not de ned, 117 results from subsequent small trials and observational data showed that administration of 7 days or more of intravenous antibiotics followed by 3-4 weeks of oral antibiotics is e ective and safe. 112,118-123 In a de nitive large trial, children with culture-positive septic arthritis were randomised after 2-4 days of intravenous antibiotics to complete a total of either 10 or 30 days of oral antibiotics, and there were no di erences in treatment success. 124 As with osteomyelitis, concurrent bacteraemia can be treatable with shorter duration intravenous antibiotics. 114 For pyomyositis in children, in two retrospective series the mean duration of intravenous antibiotics was 11-13 days and of oral antibiotics 20-30 days, 125,126 whereas two other series described 4-7 days of intravenous antibiotics with a mean total of 2-6 weeks, all with low complication rates. 127,128 Intravenous to oral switch was based on clinical improvement and reduced infl ammatory markers.126-128 When surgery is required, intravenous antibiotics are usually continued until postoperatively.126 Skin and soft tissue infections The conclusion from a Cochrane review of adults and adolescents with cellulitis was that extended intravenous antibiotics were unnecessary. 129 In prospective studies of children with moderate or severe uncomplicated cellulitis (rapidly spreading erythema, tenderness, lymphangitis, systemic symptoms) initially treated with intravenous antibiotics, most have recorded successful switch to oral antibiotics after 2-3 days of intravenous antibiotics. 130,131 In retrospective studies, a median of 2 days of intravenous followed by 7 days of oral antibiotics did not result in complications. 132,133 A prospective study including children with preseptal cellulitis found a median intravenous duration of 2 days (IQR 2-3) and oral 7 days (5-7) with no complications or recurrence. 131 Intravenous to oral switch was based on reduced swelling and erythema. Retrospective series have reported success without complications with 2-3 days of intravenous and 7-8 days of oral antibiotics. 132,134-137 In two retrospective series of children with orbital cellulitis, a mean of 9\u00b73 days (SD 3\u00b76) of intravenous antibiotics (total 21\u00b70 days, SD 3\u00b70 days) 138 and median of 4 days (range 2-8) of intravenous antibiotics139 were given with no long-term complications. One small study compared orally bioavailable antibiotics with historical intravenous cases, and although antibiotic durations were not reported no di erence in mean length of stay or complications was noted. 140 A study of MRSA skin abscesses of less than 5 cm diameter found no bene t from antibiotics for drained abscesses. 141 A larger trial in children of skin abscesses of all sizes and causal organisms compared 10 days of oral co-trimoxazole with placebo after incision and drainage. 142 There was no di erence in failure rate, and a di erence in new lesion formation at 10 days had disappeared by 3 months; treatment failure did not correlate with abscess size. Results from a trial of systemic antibiotics ver sus placebo in super cial surgical site infection with local wound treatment showed that antibiotics increased bacterial clearance without clinical bene t. 143 The conclusion from a systematic review of adults with deep surgical site infection after spinal instrumentation was that spinal rod removal could shorten intravenous and oral antibiotic duration. 144 In children, small case series suggest that for removed prostheses 1-2 weeks of intravenous and 6 weeks of oral antibiotics are su cient, 145,146 whereas for retained prostheses 4-6 weeks of intravenous and several months of oral antibiotics might be necessary. 147,148 In one study, normalisation of C-reactive protein and ESR was used to guide intravenous to oral switch. 147 Postsurgical mediastinitis is a speci c deep surgical site infection for 6 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online June 16, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30024-XReview which common durations of 4-6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics are extrapolated from scanty adult data (AR 56). In a retrospective study in children and neonates with postsurgical mediastinitis, the median duration of intravenous antibiotics was 11 days (range 7-28), with no recurrences or deaths. 149 Whether oral antibiotics were used after intravenous administration is unclear. Abdominopelvic infections According to a Cochrane review of all ages after appendicectomy, prophylactic intravenous antibiotics were superior to placebo for prevention of wound infection and intra-abdominal abscess. 150 For paediatric studies the di erence was longer statistically signi cant but favoured single-dose preoperative antibiotics.151 Studies of antibiotics versus surgery in children with appendicitis are too small to apply a recommendation (AR 57). Results of a systematic review of complicated appendicitis in children showed that limiting total anti biotic duration to 3 days was not associated with higher complication rates. 152 In three trials and a retro spective review no di erence in clinical improve ment or complications were seen when shorter intravenous and total antibiotic durations were compared with longer durations, the shortest regimen being a mean of 3\u00b74 days [SD 1\u00b77] intravenous and no oral antibiotics. 153-156 No de nitive criteria are available for stopping or switching intravenous antibiotics, but children157 and adults (AR 58) with intra-abdominal sepsis have low complication rates if intravenous antibiotics are stopped when patients are afebrile and tolerating diet. No outcome studies of antibiotic duration in acute cholangitis in children exist. In a study that included several children, failure to respond early to intravenous antibiotics was associated with mortality (AR 59). The only study that included children exclusively assessed clinical outcomes in acute cholangitis after the Kasai procedure (biliary bypass surgery for biliary atresia) according to institutional protocol: all antibiotics were administered intravenously for at least 2 weeks. After 1 week, 30 (75%) of the children had improved and no child needed more than 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment. 158 There are no studies in children of either prophylaxis of infection in acute necrotising pancreatitis or treatment of established infection of pancreatic necrosis. A Cochrane review (AR 60), a systematic review (AR 61), and a trial (AR 62), all in adults only, found that antibiotics did not reduce mortality or pancreatic infection. Conversely one systematic review of antibiotics started within 72 h of symptoms showed reduced mortality compared with placebo (AR 63).

Table: Recommendations for minimum intravenous and total duration of antibiotics and timing of intravenous to oral switchwww.thelancet.com/infection Published online June 16, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30024-X 9Review infection, no studies in adults or children have addressed duration of antibiotics in this condition. A Cochrane review of antibiotics for necrotising enterocolitis identi ed only two studies that assessed antibiotic choice but not duration (AR 64). However, one study speci ed 10-14 days of intravenous antibiotics in each arm, 159 and a retrospective study compared two dif- ferent intravenous regimens administered for 7-10 days, 160 both of which had low complication rates. Oral antibiotics are not recommended. Genitourinary infection In a Cochrane review of childhood lower urinary tract infection no di erence in persistent bacteriuria or recurrence was noted between 2-4 days and 7-14 days of oral antibiotics. 161 Results from a subsequent Cochrane review showed that single-dose antibiotic was associated with more persistent bacteriuria than was 10 days of antibiotics, although no di erence in symptom duration or recurrence occurred. 162 A large retrospective study of infants younger than 6 months found no di erence in treatment failure between intravenous antibiotics for 3 days or less and 4 days or more. 163 A Cochrane review and trial of acute pyelonephritis in children treated with 10-14 days of antibiotics, found no di erence in duration of fever or renal damage between all intravenous antibiotics, 3 days of intravenous followed by oral antibiotics, or all oral administration. 164,165 Similarly, a Cochrane review in all ages with pyelo-nephritis found no di erence between di erent routes of administration. 166 Some data on antibiotic duration for urinary tract infection with Gram-negative bacteraemia suggest that shorter intravenous durations than recom-mended for bacteraemia alone (ie, 10 days) could be su cient (eg, a mean of 6 days with varying subsequent oral durations; AR 65). 167,168 In a trial comparing 3 days of intravenous antibiotics with no intravenous admini-stration, followed by 14 days of oral antibiotics for febrile urinary tract infection, there was no di erence in recurrence rate between groups, even with bacteraemia. 168 However, only 13 of 306 patients had bacteraemia, so numbers are too small to recommend a minimum duration this short. In the largest retrospective multicentre study of infants with bacteraemic urinary tract infection, no relapses occurred with a mean intravenous antibiotic duration of 7\u00b78 days (SD 4\u00b70), with the lowest mean duration at any institution of 5\u00b75 days (SD 3\u00b70), suggesting that shorter courses could be appropriate in healthy infants who have recovered. 169 There are no studies of antibiotic duration in epididymitis, but the question of whether antibiotics are needed at all has been addressed. In prepubescent boys, antibiotics are usually recommended for epididymitis associated with abnormal urine (AR 11). Two retro spective studies of urinalysis in epididymitis found low rates of abnormal urine (1-7%), although in one of them 128 boys (91%) received antibiotics (AR 66 and 67). In a prospective study, 36 (84%) of 43 boys without pyuria received no antibiotics, while the ve (10%) with pyuria received antibiotics, although duration was not stated. 170 At a mean follow-up of 3 months, there were no com plications in the group that did not receive antibiotics. Discussion We have reviewed the evidence for minimum intravenous and total antibiotic duration in children younger than 18 years with bacterial infections, comparing shorter courses with traditionally longer durations. In many infections, especially when clinical improvement is rapid, emerging data suggest that traditional long durations of intravenous antibiotics might be unnecessary and that intravenous to oral switch can occur earlier. In most of the other infections evidence for routine longer courses is sparse. The frequent use of traditionally longer courses indicates the paucity of evidence and lack of consensus guidelines and, in the face of this gap, natural clinical instincts to take a conservative approach with patient care. However, longer durations of antibiotics are associated with increased antimicrobial resistance, so the cost must be weighed against the potential bene ts, especially if these bene ts are unproven. therefore derived evidence-based recom- mendations for minimum intravenous and total antibiotic duration for all bacterial infections reviewed, and graded the recommendation according to the quality of the evidence (table). We have also taken into account information from available guidelines (AR 5-28). Although the evidence is generalisable for most patients, recommendations should be used as a framework to tailor treatment individually in the context of each patient's condition, including underlying immuno de ciency, infection severity, and rate of Panel: General principles guiding intravenous to oral switch of antibiotics Clinical condition Clinically stable without signs of severe sepsis (fever alone need not prevent switch) Ability to absorb oral antibiotics Able to tolerate oral medication (not vomiting or nil by mouth) No impairment to absorption (eg, mucositis) Older than 28 days (<28 days not an absolute contraindication, but absorption variable) Availability of an appropriate oral antibiotic Antibiotic treats the identi ed or expected organism Antibiotic available in appropriate or palatable paediatric formulation Antibiotic has su cient penetration of a ected tissues Practical issues Adherence to oral antibiotics The family agrees with the plan10 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online June 16, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30024-XReview Declaration of interests We declare no competing interests.

Short versus prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy for children with uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia. J Antimicrob Chemother 2014; 69: patients might need longer total durations for some infections because of diminished immune defences to combat infection. In addition to recommendations for speci c infection, review of the contributing articles has highlighted general principles that should be considered when deciding whether the switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics is suitable, including clinical condition, ability to absorb oral antibiotics, and availability of an appropriate oral choice for children (panel). In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, strategies to reduce antibiotic overuse are crucial. Optimising the duration of intravenous and oral antibiotics aims to provide the shortest safe duration of antibiotics to treat infection. By reviewing the available evidence systematically, we have synthesised recom-mendations in the context of available guidelines for antibiotic duration and criteria for intravenous to oral switch. These recommendations can be used to support clinical decision making and, where data are scarce, as a basis for prospective research on optimal antibiotic durations.
