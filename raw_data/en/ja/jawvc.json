Gen. (Dr) Velu Nair Dr. Geeta Jotwani, Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi Dr. Gitika Kharkwal, Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi Published by: Indian Council of Medical Research , New Delhi - 110029 January 2021 \u00a9 Copyright Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) The journey of the bone marrow transplant (BMT) started with animal studies in the 1950s, wherein, the murine leukemia was treated with X -rays and homologous bone marrow. These studies formed the basis of clinical applications of BMT in humans in 1957, whe n the first successful transplant was performed in monozygotic twins in New York (syngeneic transplant) in a patient with acute leukemia. With this breakthrough, BMT gained popularity all over the world, including India where the first successful allogenei c BMT was done on 20th March 1983 at Tata Memorial Hospital., Mumbai. With the understanding that hematopoietic stem cells constitute the bone marrow, BMT was also known as Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Keeping pace with the contemporary nomenclature, the committee decided to adopt the presently accepted nomenclature of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). HCT has revolutionized the treatment of many, hitherto, incurable diseases and is offered for serious life threatening conditions. It has now become the standard of care for numerous benign and malignant diseases and is integrated in many treatment protocols. It is one of the most complex and demanding of medical therapies posing several challenges to the trans plant physician and unit. India has come a long way in the field of HCT and undergone rapid expansion in its technology and use. As on date, our country has more than 95 transplant centers with over 19000 transplants reported, catering to foreign patients as well. Despite HCT being a well -established clinical practice, a gap was felt in the distinction between its use for approved and unapproved indications. The National Guidelines for Stem Cell Research -2017 had listed the approved indications of HCT. However, the concerns related to rampant use of stem cells for unapproved indications needed to be addressed as they pose a threat to the well -being of vulnerable and diseased groups. Keeping the above in mind, Ministry of Health and Fa mily Welfare (MoHFW) and NITI Aayog requested ICMR to formulate separate guidelines to bring about clarity for the stakeholders. Moreover, the expeditious development in this field with evolving transplant practices and the increasing numbers of long -term survivors necessitated the need for continuous awareness and education of all stakeholders which include physicians, nurses, healthcare providers who are involved in stem cell transplantation and patients. ICMR Drafting committee consisting of eminent tr ansplant physicians, clinicians, pathologists and scientists took upon the enormous task of framing this document. The committee recognized that despite the merits associated, HCT is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and will continue to remain a highly specialized and personalized medicine. It requires significant infrastructure and a specialized team under tertiary care support. Hence, information on indications, use of specific technologies, and trends in the application of HCT is essen tial for optimizing transplant outcomes. The committee referred to EBMT and ASTCT guidelines along with the existing rules and regulations while drafting the document. The aim of the National Guidelines for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (NGHCT) -2021 is to lay down a template and help transplant physicians and centers formulate their own protocols and policies to conduct HCT. These guidelines in over 12 chapters, highlights the significance of HLA typing in HCT, handling, processing and preservation o f stem cells and follow up of patients after transplant. Most importantly, it also enlists the indications for HCT, both in adults and pediatric patients. It should be noted that this guideline is a template, and it is ultimately left to the transplant physician's discretion and institutional policies to formulate protocols at the user end. Each transplant centre is expected to write their own SOPs, wherever applicable, using the guidelines as a template. In addition to these guidelines, the drafting com mittee also decided to formulate another set of documents , on 'Evidence -Based Use of Stem Cell Therapy in Human Diseases' to address the experimental use of stem cells and assimilate available evidence in this nascent field. For this, ICMR invited Level I and Level II evidence, writing to professional societies and also through an open call on the ICMR website. Thereafter, fifteen thematic groups viz. Neurological and neuromuscular, Cardio -vascular etc. were identified. The clinical experts for each group w ere invited to review the literature and examine various claims on the use of stem cells. Based on the inputs received from the experts, evidence -based status of use of stem cells, for few such disease conditions have been framed. We sincerely hope tha t this document explicitly brings forth the directions for permitted and experimental use of HCT in approved and unapproved indications respectively. Going forward, ensuring positive engagement with all stakeholders, this document will be reviewed and upda ted periodically in view of latest scientific evidence and research in the field. Dr. Balram Bhargava Secretary Department of Health Research Ministry of Health and Family Welfare & Director General Indian Council of Medical Research The Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation guidelines have come into existence due to the vigorous and untiring efforts of a group of medical experts from across the country. It was the vision of MoHFW and ICMR, DHR combined with the expertise of veterans in t he field that resulted in the formation of this document. Transplant physicians all over India can now look up to these guidelines for knowing the best practices in the field of hematopoietic cell transplant. We profusely thank members of the Core commit tee, Dr. Rajiv Sarin, Lt. Gen. (Dr) Velu Nair, Dr. Anurag Agrawal and Dr. Subrata Sinha for their vision in taking forward this task and continued directions. We wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Drafting Committee for HCT under the leadership of Lt. Gen. (Dr) Velu Nair for spearheading the mammoth task of shaping of this document and making it a reality. The committee comprising Dr. Lalit Kumar, Dr. Navin Khattry, Dr. Gaurav Kharya, Col. (Dr) Mishra, Col. Kaur, Vikram Mathews , Dr. Sharat Damodar and Dr. Revathy Raj worked day in and out for considering and deliberating upon all comments and suggestions given by the stakeholder s and addressed all their concerns in the final document. We also appreciate the valuable inputs given by Dr. Pankaj Malhotra and Col. (Dr) Suman Pramanik in the finalization of the document. In this regard, ICMR also acknowledges the comments and suggest ions given by the stakeholders when the draft document was placed in public domain. It is only with these combined efforts that we hope to make HCT a safe and easily available treatment modality for the diseased population. The patience, furtherance and patronage of Prof. Balram Bhargava, Secretary, Department of Health Research and Director General, ICMR is truly avowed. I appreciate the persistent support of Dr. Gitika Kharkwal and Dr. Varsha Dalal for coordinating and collating inputs.

Preamble The first successful human bone marrow transplant (BMT) in 1959 marked a turning point in the history of medicine, laying the first -ever step towards haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) . The more recently accepted nomenclature of HSCT is , hematopoetic cell transplantation (HCT) . HCT became established as a therapeutic option for a wide variety o f life -threatening haematological including immunolymphoid, myeloid and genetic disorders where HCT has shown a proven benefit as listed in Annexure I . Another milestone was the successful treatment of a child with Fanconi Anemia with umbilical cord blood (UCB) from his sibling in 1987, which established UCB as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC s). The present guidelines is restricted to the homologous use of non modified HSCs (as in a conventional allogeneic or autologous hematopoetic cell transplantation for specified indications) .1 Homologous use means the repair, reconstruction, replacement, or supplementation of a recipient's cells or tissues with human cells, tissues, and cellular or tissue -based product (HCT/P) that performs the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor, https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -minimal The distinction between homologous and non -homologous use also applies to autologous use of HCT products, where the donor and recipient are the same person. Recipient cells or tissues that are identical (e.g. skin for skin , HSCs for HSCs without manipulation ) to the donor cells or tissues, and perform one or more of the same basic functions in the recipient as the cells or tissues performed in the donor is considered a s homologous application. Also, in the scernario where recipient cells or tissues that may not be identical to the donor's cells or tissues, but that perform one or more of the same basic functions in the recipient as the cells or tissues performed in the donor are considered as homologous. Non - homologous use of hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC) or hematopoietic derived cells (as in use of HSC/HPC to treat cardiomyopathy, neurological disorders etc ) is still experimental and is not covered in these guidelines and one should refer to the National Guidelines for Stem Cell Research (NGSCR -2017)2. https://www.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/guidelines/Guidelines_for_stem_cell_research_2017.p df National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 2 The new generation therapeutic products , including modified /manipulated hematopoietic derived cells such as NK cell s, CAR -T cell s and virus specific cytotoxic T cells are covered under National Guidelines for Gene Therapy Product Development and Clinical Trials3 (NGGTPD&CT) -2019 and upcoming immunotherapy guidelines. https://main.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/guidelines/guidelines_GTP.pdf The last two decades, unfortunately, have witnessed a proliferation of indiscriminate use of stem cell -based therapies, without establishing their safety or therapeutic efficacy. These therapies could harm the patients health and incur a significant out of the pocket expenditure. Initially, the lack of clear guidelines and regulations compounded the problem of misuse of stem cells for unproven therapeutic interventions. To address this complex issue, Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Therapy were first formulated in 2007 and revised in 2013 and 2017 as National Guidelines for Stem Cell Resear ch (NGSCR). BMT or hematopoietic cell transplantation hematological disorders outlined in Annexure I . Autologous transplant is primarily used for various hematological malignancies, some solid tumor s, and autoimmune dis orders . Other than HCT for approved indications ( Annexure I ) the use of stem cells in all other diseases is investigational and must be done within the purview of a clinical trial, as stated in NGSCR - 2017. Despite this clarity, there is a mi sconception , that using autologous stem cells in non - hematological settings could be included as clinical practice. This misconception has led to the increased commercialization of stem cell therapy for unproven non -homologous indications. This practice ha s undermined genuine clinical trials using stem cells that would pave the way to establish the safety and efficacy of various unproven indications. 2. Aims and Scope This document recommends a set of standards for HCT. The document's primary intent is to indicate those conditions for which HCT is the standard of care. However, this document does not include those conditions in which therapeutic use of stem cells/ HCT is no t yet proven, but is in the state of basic, translational, or clinical research, including clinical trials. These guidelines apply to all stakeholders, including treating physicians and associated clinical establishments where HCT is being performed . National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 3 3. Hematopoietic Cell Transplantaion In India, over 19000 transplants have been performed for various indications by more than 95 centers, majority (73%) of which have been done in the past eight years.4 Seventy percent of all allogen eic HCTs in India are from, HLA matched sibling (MSD) donors, however, lately there is an increase in the matched unrelated donor (MUD) and haploidentical HCTs.4 The rise in MUD transplants has been possible due to the establishment of various unrelated donor registries in the country over the last decade, increasing the poo l of donors. Haploidentical HCT has also gained popularity in recent times, due to ease of donor availability , safe and better strategies in the absence of a fully matched donor.5,6 Though much progress has been achieved in India in this field , physicians still face many challenges. Lack of teams with multi -specialty personnel, inadequately equipped transfusion medicine departments, inaccessibility to many life saving drugs for various post -transplant complications , high cost and increasing incidence of multi drug -resistant gram -negative bacterial infections are some issues that need attention in our country to improve outcomes. 4. Approved Disease Conditions for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Taking congnisance of the international status and the outcome s of the various clinical trials conducted in the field in past several decades and reviewing the recommendations of American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT)5 and EBMT6, it was opined tha t the indications for which HCT is a recommended therapeutic option are as outlined in Annexure I . 5. HLA-typing in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system (the major histocompatibility complex [MHC] in humans) is an important part of the immune system and is controlled by genes located on chromosome 6. It encodes cell surface molecules specialized to present antigenic peptides to the T -cell receptor (TCR) on T cells. A close match between a donor's and a patient's HLA antigens is essential for a successful transplant outcome. Better HLA matching reduces the risk of graft -versus -host (GVHD) disease. Some patients may face a greater challenge in finding a match ed donor because some HLA types are less common than others. Some HLA types are found more often in certain racial and ethnic groups. Following are the National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 4 requirements for Histocompatibility & Imunogenetics testing laboratories performing HLA typing for HCT: 5.1. HLA typing should be done at a NABL accredited facility. 5.2. If the HLA typing is outsourced, there should be a written agreement between the center and the concerned laboratory capturing the terms of agreement, accreditation details of the laboratory, and expe cted degree of resolution that is required. 5.3. Centers offering haploidentical HCT should either have in -house laboratory facility for testing anti -HLA antibodies or can be outsourced to a NABL accredited facility . 5.4. HLA typing definitions and results should use the official World Health Organization (WHO) HLA Nomenclature7 http://www.hla.alleles.org for reporting HLA assignments. The typing assignments must conform to the WHO nomenclature of the HLA system . Slashes should be used to separate a string of alternative alleles while repor ting (e.g., A*02:01/02:02/02:07/02:10 to mean A*02:01 or A*02:02 or A*02:07 or A*02:10). 5.5. The HLA typing report must include the loci tested, the level of resolution of the typing, the typing method used, and the version of the database used to interpret the results. A comment on the matching status of the donor/recipient pair should be stated in the report. 5.6. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) should be available in Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics testing laboratories for the following: 5.6.1. To confirm the identity of the patient and the donor sample. 5.6.2. To confirm the identity of the MUD HSC/HPC unit and Cord Blood Unit (CBU). 5.6.3. For sample testing procedures/ kits used for testing (CDSCO/CE/FDA certified) 5.6.4. To store samples, results, data and docum ents of patients and donors undergoing testing. 5.6.5. For anti -HLA antibody testing in the case of mismatched recipients and donors. 5.6.6. For reporting formats and release of reports 5.6.7. For validation, calibration and maintenance of equipment. 5.7. HLA matching criteria for donor selection8 5.7.1. Related Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplants : The patient, siblings, and parents (where available) should be HLA -A, -B and -DRB1 typed at a minimum of low resolution. If there is homozygosity, high -resolution National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 5 typing should be done for the patient and prospective donor, at HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and DQB 1 loci. 5.7.1.1. Where consanguinity exists within the family, other relatives may also be typed as prospective donors. 5.7.1.2. For a fully matched related donor, a repeat sample for confirmatory HLA typing may be done at the discretion of the BMT physician. 5.7.1.3. In case of no n-availability of a fully matched family donor, a high - resolution typing is mandatory at HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and - DQB1 loci for the patient and alternate donors. 5.7.1.4. In haploidentical transplants, patients should be screened for the presence of allo -antibodi es against potential donors. Donor specific allo -antibodies against HLA class I and class II of the prospective donors should be quantified by using the single antigen bead method on the Luminex platform and/or cell -based immunoassays. 5.7.1.5. In HCT for i nherited disorders, the prospective related donors need to be screened for a similar genetic defect. 5.7.1.6. When MFI >= 2,000 the incidence of poor graft function/ graft failure is increased7. 5.7.1.7. If the above prospective donor cannot be avoided, desensitization methods should be attempted . 5.7.2. Unrelated Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplants The availability of sizeable international voluntary donor registries and cord blood banks facilitate alternative source of stem cells for patients without a suitable related donor. 5.7.2.1. The recommendations are a 10/10 high -resolution match at HLAA, -B, -C,-DRB1, and with the unrelated donor. 5.7.2.2. If a 10/10 match donor is not available, a single allele mismatch at HLA- DQB1 locus is most acceptable. Matching/mismatching at other loci should be considered on an individual basis following the transplant physician's evaluation of the patient's transplant -related risks . 5.7.3. Criteria for Choosing Umbilical Cord Blood Unit9 5.7.3.1. UCB units should be HLA typed to high for HLA -A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 loci. 5.7.3.2. The aim should be to select an unrelated UCB with 2 allele mismatches. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 6 5.7.3.3. In a double UCB transplant where more than one unit is required, both the UCBs should be at least 4/6 matched to the patient using intermediate resolution (antigen level) for HLA loci A and B and high resolution (allelic) typing for HLA DRB1. 6. Source of Stem cells and the Process of mobilization and collection Sources of HSCs include bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood . 6.1 Bone Marrow Harvest 6.1.1. A marrow harvest has to be performed under general or loco -regional anesthesia or under sedation from the posterior superior iliac crest. 6.1.2. The harvest should be done in small aspirate volumes of 2 to 5 ml to avoid dilution with blood, changing aspiration sites each time. 6.1.3. The goal should be to collect at least 2 -3 x108/kg nucleated cells of the patient's body weight. However, the maximum volume collected should not be more than 15 -20 ml/kg of the donor's body weight. The optimal method to obtain the targeted nucleated cells from the bone marrow is to do a mid -way nucleated cell count to predict the total volume of marrow to be harvested. 6.1.4. All efforts should be attempted to avoid allogen eic blood transfusion to the dono r post marrow harvest. If unavoidable, the allogen eic packed red cells should be leuco -depleted and irradiated before transfusion to the donor. An option of autologous blood transfusion from the donor can also be considered (3 weeks before harvest). 6.1.5. The use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) for 2 to 4 days at the discretion of the transplant physician , prior to marrow harvest , can be used to speed the engraftment. This strategy increases the yield of mononuclear cells. If the harvest i s inadequate, an option of additional peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) can be considered. 6.1.6. Bone marrow harvested in operation theatre and subsequent graft manipulation, if required, must be done under the direct supervision of a trained transplant physici an /transfusion medicine specialist . 6.2 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection (PBSC) 6.2.1 In the majority of patients, PBSC is the source of stem cells. The donor receives G -CSF 10 mcg/kg for 4 to 5 days and PBSC is collected on the 5th and if required, on the 6th day. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 7 6.2.2 The goal should be to collect at least 2 -3 x 106/kg CD 34+ cell s of the patient's body weight for fully HLA matched related donor transplants and at least 5 x 106/kg for matched unrelated and haploidentical transplants. 6.2.3 Several studies have compared the outcome of allogen eic HCT using BM or PBSC. These studies uniformly show rapid engraftment with PBSC, but with an increased risk of chronic GVHD (cGvHD). 6.2.4 The donor's preferences must also be taken into account as there are risks of anesthesia in bone marrow harvest. 6.2.5 In most patie nts undergoing autologous transplantation, the stem cell source is usually PBSC. 6.2.6 Stem cell collection by apheresis and subsequent graft manipulation, whenever required, must be done directly under the immediate oversight and supervision of a trained transplant physician / transfusion medicine specialist. 6.3 Umbilical Cord Blood 6.3.1 Cord blo od is predominantly used in children. It has less risk of GvHD but more time to engraftment and increased risk of graft failure. 6.3.2 The selection of UCB u nit is based on various factors , such as patient 's diagnosis, degree of HLA matching, cell dose, conditioning regimen to be used, age and recipient's weight.9 6.3.3 The collection, banking and release for administration of the UCB should be done as per the NetCord -FACT International Standards.10 6.4 Autologous back -up: While there is no level I evidence, autologous back up of HSCs may be considered on a case to case basis at the transplant physician's discretion especially in alternative donor transplants. 7 Strategies for Mobilization of Stem Cells in Autologous Transplantation 7.1 Cytokine -induced Steady State mobilization (without chemotherapy): G -CSF is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mcg/kg for 5 consecutive days.A peripheral blood CD 34+ cell count is obtained on the 4th day and if the count is higher than 20/\u00b5L, then stem cell harvest is done on the 5th day after administering day 5 GCSF. If the count is less than 20/\u00b5L, then according to disease status and risk of mobilization failure, the use of plerixafor is recommend ed at a dose of 240 mcg/kg subcutaneously. The minimum total CD 34+ cell dose should be 2 x 106/kg National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 8 recipient body weight in 1 -3 collections. If the collection goal is not reached after the third leukapheresis, a successful mobilization is unlikely. For tan dem transplants, the requirement of cell dose is 2 x 106/kg recipient body weight for each transplant. 7.2 Chemotherapy -induced mobilization 7.2.1 The most commonly used agent for chemotherapy -induced mobilization is cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 -4 g/m2. G-CSF i s started at a dose of 5-10ug/kg/day on days 4 or 5, and the peripheral blood CD34+ cell count is measured at the start of leukocyte recovery from day 8 or 9. Stem cell collection is initiated when the peripheral blood CD 34+ cell count is greater than 20/ \u00b5L. 7.2.2 Disease -specific salvage chemotherapy can also be exploited for stem cell mobilization as in lymphomas. 8 Pre-Transplant Work -up of Recipient and Donor 8.1 Recipient Work -up: The work -up of recipient undergoing autologous or allogen eic transplant is divided into two groups. 8.1.1 Disease -specific investigations that help assess the status of disease pre - transplant. 8.1.2 Investigations for assessing the function of various organs pre -transplant to predict the risk of post -transplant complications. These include : 8.1.2.1 Complete blood count, comprehensive biochemistry including liver function test (LFT), kidney function test (KFT), serum electrolytes, blood sugar level. 8.1.2.2 Coagulation profile, blood grouping, and antibody screening. 8.1.2.3 Urine - rout ine and microscopy examination 8.1.2.4 Chest X -ray or Non -contrast CT chest for the detection of active pulmonary infections. 8.1.2.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG). 8.1.2.6 Echocardiography or Multi -gatedAcquisition Scan (MUGA) Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 8.1.2.7 Pulmonary fu nction test that includes spirometry and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide(DLCO) for patients above the age of 8 years. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation National Guidelines for Hematopo to exclude pregnanc y in female patients of reproductive age group. This test should be performed at least seven days before initiation of conditioning regimen. 8.1.2.9 Baseline blood sample for short tandem repeats (STR) or variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTR) based chimerism monitoring (for the allogeneic transplant) is recommended. 8.1.2.10 Fertility counseling regarding fertility preservation as and when applicable. 8.1.2.11 Screening tests for infection: i. HBs Ag, anti -HBs Ag, anti - HBcIgG, anti -HBcIgM PCR the physician's discretion ) for those patients undergoing allogeneic transplant 8.2 Donor Work -up 8.2.1 A thorough history and physical examination are required. The medical history should include questions to evaluate whether a transmissible disease is present. 8.2.1.1 Vaccination history, 8.2.1.2 Travel history, 8.2.1.3 Blood transfusion history, 8.2.1.4 To identify persons at high risk of transmission of infectious disease, 8.2.1.5 To identify persons at risk of transmitting inherited conditions, 8.2.1.6 To identify persons at risk of carrying a hematological or immunological disease and 8.2.1.7 To determine the history of malignant disease. 8.2.2 Potential allogeneic donors either fully matched or haplo -matched should undergo the following investigations: 8.2.2.1 Complete blood complete biochemistry including LFT, sugar, coagulation profile 8.2.2.2 Urine - routine and microscopy examination 8.2.2.3 ECG, Chest X - ray 8.2.2.4 Serum -HCG to rule out pregnancy in female donors of reproductive age group. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 10 8.2.2.5 Baseline blood sample for short tandem repeats (STR) based chimerism monitoring. 8.2.2.6 HBs Ag, anti -HBs -HBcIgG, and 2 8.2.2.7 CMV IgG 8.2.2.8 Informed consent with details of the procedure of stem cell collection with all possible risks of stem cell donation ( Annexure II). 8.2.2.9 Inform ed consent for data registration needs to be given by the patient for reporting to stem cell registries or use in research purposes (Annexure -II). 8.2.3 The work -up of unrelated donor depends on the registry coordinating the transplant but usually encompasses the above. 9 Processing of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC)10,11 The processing of HSCs should maintain the purity and potency of the cells for transplantation. Flow -cytometric based cell counts, viability analysis, and sterility testing are done before cryopreservation and storage . HSC processing involves the following: (Annexure -III). 9.1 Plasma depletion is performed in recipients of minor ABO -mismatch allograft, children with a small blood volume or patients with coexisting renal or cardiac comorbidities. In the setting of minor ABO -mismatch allograft, plasma depletion is done when donor anti -recepient is oagglutinin titers are higher than or equal to 1:256 with a target of decreasing it to less than or equal to 1:128. 9.2 Red cell depletion : In major ABO -incompatible transplants with recipient anti - donor isoagglutinin titer >= 1:32, the red cel l contamination in PBSC graft should be kept <20 ml and RBC depletion of BM grafts should be considered using sedimenting agents like hydroxyl ethylstarch (HES), centrifugation, or cell separator (automation) to prevent hemolytic transfusion reaction. Red c ell depletion is also performed in patients with renal dysfunction, to help reduce lysed red cell fragments and free hemoglobin. 9.3 Immuno -magnetic cell selection technology : In vitro T-cell depletion: 9.3.1 A novel technique of T -cell depletion primarily used in haploidentical transplants is by use of in-vitro T cell depletion kits. This technique has National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 11 improved significantly over the years using the Miltenyi -Biotectechnique (CliniMacs or Prodigy system, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). 9.3.2 It initially s tarted with the use of positive selection of CD 34+ progenitor cells where the stem cell s carrying CD 34+ cells were retained, and the rest of the cells harvested from either bone marrow or peripheral blood were discarded. This technique significantly decreased the risk of graft versus host disease but is complicated by an increased risk of rejection and opportunistic infections. 9.3.3 With advanced technology, a negativ e selection of CD 3+ and CD 19+ cells is now possib le. TCR alpha /beta dep letion and CR45RA depletion removes the T lymphocytes capable of causing GvHD.This technique is superior to the previous CD34+ selection as it is associated with a lesser risk of opportunistic infections and GvHD. The same process can also be used t o process the graf t or subsequent donor lymphocyte collection by apheresis to generate donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), CD45RA depleted DLI products, NK subsets for DLI or viral cytotoxic lymphocytes from a donor. 9.4 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) - Modified (CAR) T cells (CAR -T cells): T cells are a component of the adaptive immune system, as effectors of cell mediated - immunity. T cells exert their cytotoxic and potentially anti -tumoral effect upon engagement of the T - cell receptor is by a cognate peptide antigen, which is presented in the context of a specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The concept of tumor -targeted T cells has come to a reality as a result of genetic modification strategies capable of generating a tumor -targe ting T cell receptor. Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are recombinant T cell receptors composed of an extracellular fragment derived from the immunoglobulin variable fragment, as single chain (scFv), which is, in turn, linked to intracellular signaling sequences that are derived from T cells. Insertion of a CAR in a T cell can induce activation of the T cell upon ligation of the scFv with its target antigen. There are currently two US FDA approved CAR -T cells (i) tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) (ii) axicabtage neciloleucel (Yescarta). There are many more in clinical trials. While this technology is not yet available in India, several groups are working to establish the technology and make it locally available. CAR -T cells will follow all the steps and regulatory requirements of HCT along with additional standards for the manufacturing and release of products for clinical use. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 12 CAR-T cell therapy must be done only in centers with experience in HCT and under the supervision of physicians trained in HCT. A number of the process and complications are similar to those seen with HCT. Additionally, there are certain unique complications with CAR -T cells such as cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities that the physician will need additional training before administering CAR -T cell therapy. Until approved in India, all use of CAR -T cells will have to be done in the setting of a CDSCO approved clinical trial and in compliance with NGGTP&CT -2019 . 9.5 Cryopreservation is performed using aseptic precautions in a microbiological safety cabinet within 72 hours of stem cell collection: 9.5.1 Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) is a cryo protectant that red uces the osmotic stress on the stem cell membran e and prevents dehyd ration of the cell. It prevents both extracellular and intr acellular ice crystal formation during freezing. 9.5.2 All the consumables like gauze pieces, syringes, tr ansfer bags, DMSO, and 5% human albumin bottles /autologous plasma bags are opened i nside the cabinet. 9.5.3 The cryoprotectant solution is prepared in a sterile transfer bag with DMSO, 5% human serum albu min, and plasmalyte in the of 1:1:3. In lieu of albumin and plasmalyte, autologous plasma could also be used . 9.5.4 The final DMSO concentration should be 5 -10% with albumin and electrolyte solution for optimum preservation of HSCs. 9.5.5 Six percent HES could also be used along with 5% DMSO for cryopreservation of HSC. HES is a non -penetrating macromolecular cryoprotectant that forms a gla ssy membrane around the cell. 9.5.6 The final volume in each cryo -bag should not exceed 70-100 ml and air bubbles need to be expelled from the bag. 9.5.7 Care should be taken to add the DMSO slowly into the transfer bag because it dissipates heat, and the final cryopr otectant solution should be refrigerated for 30 minutes. 9.5.8 The cryo -bag labels bearing the product volume, patient and donor details are pasted on the left upper corner of the bag and placed inside cassettes. 9.5.9 Freezing: post cryopreservation freezing can be d one in two ways: 9.5.9.1 Controlled rate freezing involves cooling of HSC product at a computer -cont rolled rate with close temperature monitoring of the product and freezer. It takes place in a device called National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 13 Planer that allows injections of liquid nitrogen gas into the freezing chamber in a programmed fashion to control the freezing rate. Initially, it is cooled at the rate of 1\u00b0C/minute until -14\u00b0C to -24\u00b0C (transition temperature). It is then supercooled to shorten the latent heat of fusion (i.e. the kinetic energy released at the freezing point). After solidification of a product - controlled rate, freezi ng is done by institutional protocol until the product temperature reaches -90\u00b0C. The cryo -bags in cassettes are then transferred to the liquid nitrogen tank for further storage, preferably in the vapor phase and stored maximum upto 5 years for clinical us e.12 9.5.9.2 Non -controlled freezing or dump freezing involves the transfer of HSC product into a mechanical freezer at -80\u00b0C. Fresh HSC product can b e stored at 2 -8\u00b0C for upto 72 hours before processing for cryopreservation beyond which CD34+ number and viability may reduce. The stored product may be used for transplantation upto 24 months of storage13. Long term storage is recommended in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen between -150\u00b0 C to -196\u00b0C as it reduces the risk of microbial contamination of products. 9.6 Quality Control Flow -cytometry based CD34+ cell enumeration is done before processing and a microbial detection system is employed to test for any contamination during processing and storage. 9.7 Transport Fresh HSC product is transported at 2 -8 \u00b0C in a sterile, cold box within 24 -72 hours. Shipment of frozen HSC product is made in a secondary container to prevent leakage and contamination. The temperature is continuously monitored and maintained below minus 150\u00b0C. 9.8 Thawing, washing, and Infusion Cryopreserved HSCs are wrapped in sterile zip -locked bags and rapidly thawed in a water -bath at 37\u00b0C with gentle rotatory motions until no traces of ice remain. A semi -automated, dry warming electrical device could also be used for thawing. To avoid DMSO toxicities, the dose limit of DMSO that can be infused shall not exceed 1g/ kg of recipient weight in a day. Washing of HSCs in plasmalyte with 5% albumin National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 14 would reduce lysed red cells, free hemoglobin, and DMSO but will lose some CD34+ cells. A post thaw CD34 viability assessment can be done a t the discetion of the transplant physician or as per the institutional protocol. 9.9 Processing Facility All processing of HSCs should be done in dedicated space within the institution or the blood bank under the supervision of transplant physician / transfusion medicine specialist. The blood bank should be licensed and/or accredited by appropriate authorities. 10 Conditioning Chemotherapy7 Conditioning chemotherapy is an integral part of any transplant, be it, autologous or allogeneic. The objectives of conditioning chemotherapy depend on the underlying disease for which HCT is being offered. For benign diseases the main objectives are to ge t rid or defective bone marrow or immune system, whereas, for malignant diseases the objectives are two fold, firstly to get rid of defective bone marrow and secondly to get rid of the malignant clone. To minimize the risk of graft failure or GvHD (in allo geneic HCT) conditioning chemotherapy is often integrated with some form of serotherapy. The intensity of chemotherapy depends on a number of factors, such as underlying disease, type of transplant (MSD, MUD or haploidentical HCT) and performance status of the patient. Based on the extent of myeloid or immune ablation, the conditioning chemotherapy is categorized as Myeloablative (MAB) or Reduced intensity (RIC). In the initial years of HCT, the conditioning used to be MAB but over the period of time the emphasis is more towards reduced intensity or myeloablative but reduced toxicity conditioning. 11 Immune Suppression7 11.1 In allogeneic HCT, there is an inherent risk of GvHD which increases with increasing HLA disparity. The risk is minimum with HLA identical sibling donor HCT and maximum with HLA haploidentical HCT. Apart from HLA disparity, the amount of alloreactive T cells infused with the graft also decides the extent of GvHD, thus the risk is less with bone marrow as source and its more with the use of peripheral blood as graft source. Over last few decades the transplant physicians have constantly tried to find ways to minimize the risk of GvHD despite HLA disparity. Historically standard immune suppression included calcineurin inhibitors (Cyclo sporine) alone or in combination with methotrexate or steroids. Although cyclosporine continues to be the most frequently used immune suppressive agent, there are newer agents which are equally or more National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 15 immune suppressive with a better toxicity profile. Few such agents are second generation calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors such as sirolimus. 11.2 In Haploidentical HCT, post -transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) platform championed by the Baltimore group has been found to be effective GvHD control strategy. By the virtue of causing immune tolerance, it is known to reduce the risk of acute and chronic GvHD more effectively than the conventional GvHD strategies alone. Persistence of recipient antigen presenting cells in post HSCT period is known to increase the risk of GvHD by reacting to alloreactive donor T cells. Post -transplant cyclophosphamide given at 50 mg/kg for 2 days between day 3 -5 addresses the alloreactive T cell and helps achieve better immune toler ance thus reducing the risk of GvHD. 11.3 Another strategy is using in -vitro T cell depletion which has been elaborated in section 9.3. 12 Post -HCT Follow -up in the Initial 12 weeks Early post HCT follow -up is at the discretion of the transplant physician and guided by the institutional policies. However, a general outline is suggested is as follows , 12.1 Meticulous follow -up post HCT remains an integral part of the procedure to identify early side effects and prevent complications. 12.2 A minimum of 1 to 2 clinic visits weekly to check vitals and undergo a thorough clinical examination. 12.3 Close monitoring of therapeutic drug levels of cyclosporine/tacrolimus/sirolimus is recommended. 12.4 Monitor for side effects of calcineurin inhibitors, such as hypertension, r enal impairment, and dyselectrolytemia . 12.5 Weekly complete blood count and blood biochemistry, including renal and liver function tests. 12.6 SOP for the care of central venous catheter. 12.7 Pre-emptive screening for viral infections is done depending on the underlying disease and type of transplant ,. 12.7.1 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) by polymerase 12.7.2 Blood Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and adenoviral monitoring is done for high - risk transplants such as MUD, haploidentical, and CB transplant s. 12.8 Early imaging with non -contrast CT chest for investigation of cough National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 16 12.9 Donor chimerism post engraftment is usually done on days 28, 60, 90, 180, 270 and 365 . at the discretion of the transplant physician. 12.10 It is recommended that the patient stays under the follow -up of the transplant center for a min imum period of time as decided by the institutional protocol . 12.11 All measures to ensure infection prevention need to be continued for a minimum of 100 days, including personal hygiene and a clean diet (cooked soft food and boiled water). Avoid raw vegetables, fruits, and crowde d areas. 12.12 Disease -specific follow -up is advised as per standard guidelines. 12.13 The family must be issued clear instructions in the discharge summary with the points of contact in case of emergencies. 12.14 All cellular blood products transfused should be irradiated . 12.15 As general rule, live vaccines can be safely administered 24 months post transplant in the absence of active chronic GvHD / immunosuppression See 13.8 . 12.16 The HCT are as follows: 12.16.1 Neutropenic Sepsis: This complication occurs in almost all HCT recipients, and institutional policy should be in place for empirical antimicrobial therapy of bacterial and fungal infections, based on local sensitivity and resistance patterns. All personnel should adhere to ho spital infection control policies to prevent and reduce infections in transplant patients. 12.16.2 Bleeding: Most patients develop bleeding with a platelet count of less than 10 -20 x 109/L.A hospital transfusion policy should be in place to prevent management blee ding episodes. 12.16.3 Mucositis and Nutrition: High dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation leads to grade III or IV mucositis in over half of the patients undergoing transplantation. Supportive care in the form of enteral or parenteral nutrition and pain relief by the use of opioids s hould be considered. 12.16.4 Dyselectrolytemia: Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia are common causes of dyselectrolytemia in the transplant setting. These abnormalities need to be aggressively corrected. 12.16.5 Engraftment syndrome: Is defined as fever of a no n-infectious origin, which develops when white cell count increases post - transplant. Classical features include fever >38.30 C, skin rash, non - cardiogenic pulmonary edema or hypoxia, or a sudden increase in CRP values >20mg/dL. Treatment includes stopping G -CSF and administration of a short course of steroids.14,15,16 National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 or Veno -occlusive dise ase (VOD): SOS is characterized by jaundice, fluid retention, and tender hepatomegaly appearing in the first 35 -40 days after HCT. Treatment includes liberal use of diuretics, restriction of fluids and defibrotide.17,18,19,20 12.16.7 Acute Graft vs Host Disease (aGvHD): This is the most dreaded complication of allogeneic transplantation. It is characterized by damage to skin, liver, or gut leading to skin rash, jaundice, or diarrhea. The initial classification by Glucksberg et al21 was later modified by Przepiorka et al .22 Early intervention with the use of corticosteroids leads to the resolution of signs and symptoms in approximately 50% of patients. Institutional policy to treat steroid - refractory G vHD should be in place. 12.16.8 Graft Failure: is an infrequent but often fatal complication of HCT seen in <5% of autologous, matched related and unrelated donor transplants. The incidence increases to 10% or more in haploidentical and CB transplantation, and its etiology is multi - factorial. The key i s to take preventive measures following the early identification of risk factors. 12.16.9 Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC): Post -transplant can be categorized according to the time of occurrence as early or late -onset. Early - onset typically occurs within 48 hours of completion of chemotherapy and is due to the direct toxic effect of drug metabolites and radiotherapy on bladder mucosa. Late -onset HC usually starts after neutrophil engraftment and can occur several months post HCT. This is generally due to the reactivation of BK or adenovirus. Clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of signs and symptoms of cystitis. Supportiv e treatment includes maintaining adequate hydration, and bladder irrigation may be required in severe cases. Cidofovir may be useful in some patients with BK and adenoviral hemorrhagic cystitis, although the efficacy is uncertain. 12.16.10 CMV reactivation : With the growing number of alternative donor transplants and shift of emphsis from myeloablative to immuneablative stratagies, post transplant CMV reactivation has emerged as an important complication. The intent of the physician should alway s be to treat CMV reactivation and prevent progression to CMV disease. The drug of choice for management of CMV reactivation is ganciclovir/valganciclovir, however if the National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 18 reactivation is documented pre -engraftment then foscarnet is the preferred option. In ganciclovir non -responsive cases, foscarnet or cidofovir can be used as add on therapy as per institutional protocols. 13 Post -HCT Follow -up After 12 weeks Post HCT follow -up is at the discretion of the transplant physician and guided by the institutional policies. However, a general outline is suggested is as follows , 13.1 Ensure smooth transition of care to primary referral physicians . 13.2 Early tapering of immune -suppression if there is no evidence of GvHD in hematological malignancies and delayed tapering in benign disorders . 13.3 If there are signs of GvHD, immune -suppression must be continued for a more extended period. 13.4 Adequate antifungal prophylaxis must be maintained for at least three months or longer if on steroids or dual immune -suppres sion. Antiviral and pneumocystis prophylaxis for atleast one year or beyond if on immune -suppressive drugs. 13.5 Monitor for herpes zoster in post HCT patients. 13.6 Signs of chronic GvHD include dry eyes and mouth, skin pigmentary changes, raised liver enzymes, lun g involvement or any other organ involvement .23 13.7 Patients on steroids for GvHD need special monitoring to prevent infections, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis. 13.8 Vaccination s with inactivated vaccines is recommended 6 months to 1 -year post - transplan t as outlined in Annexure IV24-29 14 Post HCT Follow -up for Late Effects All HCT patients must be followed up long term. A visit to the physician monthly for the first one year followed by three monthly visits in the second year, six-monthly for the next three years, and yearly thereafter. 14.1 Height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, urine analysis, complete blood coun t, renal and liver function test, lipid profile, and blood sugars to be done at each visit 14.2 Neurocognitive status and psychological assessment 14.3 Ocular examination for dry eyes or cataract 14.4 Mouth examination for xerostomia or ulcers 14.5 Thyroid function tests once a year 14.6 Echocardiography to assess ejection fraction once a year 14.7 Pulmonary function tests for age above 8 years once a year National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 19 14.8 Secondary sexual characteristics and puberty assessment where appropriate 14.9 Musculoskeletal examination for contractures or joint stiffness 14.10 In patients with chronic GvHD - bone mineral density for osteoporosis 14.11 Examination for second malignancies, especially breast and cervix in women; leukemia, bone tumor, thyroid and brain tumors for all patients. 14.12 Life style modifications to ensure physical activity, healthy diet and integration into all activities considered normal for that age group 15 Standards/Requirments for HCT Centers The following criteria are necessary, at a minimum, for the safe and successful performance of HCT. 15.1 Patient Volume 15.1.1 A sufficient number of patients must be treated each year to allow the development of a designated transplant unit with an experienced, fulltime clinical and nursing team. 15.1.2 This would require, in general, that the center performs a minimum of ten transplants per year. 15.1.3 Sufficie nt transplants must be performed to preferably not have the unit empty. 15.1.4 If both allogeneic and autologous transplants are performed, at least a total of 10 should be performed annually to allow sufficient experience in the technical aspects of both proced ures. 15.1.5 For alternative donor transplants, the center should have atleast performed 10 matched related donor transplants. 15.1.6 For new units, compliance with these volume goals should be attained within the first three years of functioning. 15.2 Infrastructure and Facilities 15.2.1 There must be a designated transplant unit with atleast two or more designated transplant beds. The unit could be part of a facility for treating immune -suppressed patients that also include patients with acute leukemia and ot her hematological disorders. 15.2.2 The necessary equipment and experience for ex vivo handling of marrow and/or PBSCs should be available. This includes at least the facilities with protocols for cryopreservation and management of ABO blood group incompatibility. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 20 15.2.3 If allogeneic HCT is performed, the transplant unit must demonstrate access to a NABL -certified histocompatibility laboratory for the necessary tissue typing. 15.2.4 The transplant unit must have facilities in place to effectively manage these p atients. This should include SOPs for air - handling (e.g. positive pressure, filtered air, or laminar airflow rooms) as well as monitoring of its quality. A minimum of 12 air exchanges per hour for a new unit and at least 6 air exchanges per hour for an ol d unit, functional for 6 or more months, is recommended. Support of trained house -keeping staff for maintaining the facility is also critical.10, 30 15.2.5 Twenty -four -hour, high -quality support from laboratories, blood bank, and radiology should be available. Th e facility for irradiation of cellular products, either in -house or outsourced, should be available. 15.2.6 Appropriate microbiology laboratory facilities, including bacteriology, virology, and mycology facilities, should always be available. 15.2.7 A radiotherapy unit with the ability to perform total body irradiation (TBI) should be available within the hospital or in its close proximity . 15.2.8 Intensive care unit (ICU), dialysis, bronchoscopy, and imaging facilities should be available for both adults a nd children within the institution. 15.3 Personnel 15.3.1 Transplant Physicians 15.3.1.1 Physicians who perform HCT should have documentable experience with the procedure . 15.3.1.2 If both autologous and allogeneic HCTs are being performed, the treating physicians should have documentable experience with both types of procedures. 15.3.1.3 Access to a broad range of subspecialty consultations in both medical and surgical specialties such as intensivist, infectious disease (ID) s pecialist, pulmonologist, nephrologist, cardiologist, and dermatologist must be available to treat complications associated with HCT. 15.3.2 The nursing team is a vital component of the transplant team. The ratio of nurse to a patient should not be more than 1:2 . 15.3.3 Donor fitness should be certified by an independent physician and not by any member of the transplant team. 15.3.4 It is preferred to have a designated HCT coordinator and social worker for the transplant center. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 21 15.3.5 Resident medical personnel should be available in the center for 24 -hour medical cover. 15.3.6 A nutritionist should be available for dietetic advice for patients 15.4 Academic Qualification for BMT Physician Physicians performing peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow transplantations must be licensed to practice medicine. They should be certified and have the requisite training and experience in hematology, medical oncology, immunology, and/o r pediatric hematology/oncology. Any of the following qualifications is mandatory for a BMT physician: 15.4.1 DM/DNB with 15.4.4 Candidates with MD/DNB (Internal Medicine /Pediatrics) should undergo at least 2 -3 years of training in a recognized department of Hematology/ Medical Oncology with at least one year of training in HCT. 15.4.5 Equivalent qualifications from other countries recognized by the Medical Council of India (MCI) with at least one year of training in HCT. 15.5 Documentation and Data Management 15.5.1 All transplant performed must be meticulously documented and preserved as per the SOPs of the institution. 15.5.2 Physicians performing this procedure should be encouraged to report their data to available registries [e.g. Indian Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant (ISBMT), Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry (CIBMTR), Asia Pacific Blood and Marrow Transplant (APBMT), European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry (EBMT) and when appropriate, publish essential observations in the medical literature. 16 Unrelated Donor Registry One of the main limiting factors in HCT is the availability of a suitable donor. Only 20 - 30% of patients needing HCT will find an HLA matched sibling donor. Another 5 -10% may find a match among close relatives - in the setting of consanguinity or closely -knit communities. Hence, nearly 60 -70% of patients requiring HCT will not have a fully matched related family donor. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 22 16.1 The donor pool has expanded rapidly over the last few decades by the availability of matched unrelated donors and unrelated cord blood units from various donor registries, both national and international. Also, haploidentical transplants have further contr ibuted to the expansion of the donor pool. 16.2 The first registry in the world was established in 1974 called the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Registry, established by the mother of Anthony Nolan, who suffered from Wiskott -Aldrich Syndrome. 16.3 Bone marrow donors w orldwide (BMDW) was established in 1988 at Leiden, Netherlands, and has > 30 million donors and over 720,000 cord blood units registered. There are > 60 registries from over 45 countries registered with BMDW globally. 16.4 In India, presently there are more tha n 95 HCT centers, and the Indian registries include: 16.4.1 DATRI (blood stem cell donors registry), Chennai 16.4.2 JEEVAN BLOOD BANK, Chennai 16.4.3 MDRI (Marrow Donor Registry India), Mumbai 16.4.4 GENE BANDHU (Bharat Stem Cells), New Delhi 16.4.5 (Bangalore Medical Services Trust), Bangalore 16.4.6 BMCDT -BMR (Medical College Alumni), Bangalore 16.4.7 ARJAN VIR Foundation, Delhi 16.5 The Indian registries have a total of more than 500,000 voluntary donors 16.6 Matched unrelated donor grafts for Indian patients are also procured from international registries such as DKMS (Deutsche Knochen Mark Spenderdatei), National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), and Anthony Nolan (AN).

National Guidelines for Hematopo Annexures National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 27 Annexure I Indications of HCT The proposed indications for HCT in adult and pediatrics has been adopted from Durate et al5 which has been included in 'The EBMT Handbook 2019 '. However, since HCT is a dynamically evolving field, changes will be made periodically as i ndicated. Table 1 - HCT indications for adults 5 Disease Disease status GNR/III Myelo high DIPSS score S/II S/II S/III GNR/III D/III GNR/III GNR/III MG AA aplastic anemia, AD autoimmune disorders, AIC active inflammatory component, AL amyloidosis, ALL acute central nervous system, CO clinical option (can be carried after careful assessment of risks and benefits), CP chronic phase, CR1, 2, 3 first, second, third complete remission, CTCL cutaneous T cell lymphoma, D developmental (further trials are needed), DIPSS Dynamic International Prognostic Score System, DLBCL diffuse large cell transplantation, I D IPI International Prognostic Index, JIA gravis, multiple myeloma, MMAD mismatched alternative donors (cord blood, haploidentical an d mismatched unrelated donors), MRD minimal residual disease, MS multiple sclerosis, MSD matched sibling donor, MUD well -matched unrelated donor (8/8, 10/10 or 9/10 if mismatched is sclerosis, S st andard of care (generally indicated in suitable patients), Sa sarcoma, SAA severe aplastic anemia, sAML secondary acute myeloid leukaemia, SLE systemic lupus erythematosus, SPS person cell lymphoma, TKI tyrosine kinase inhibitors, WM Waldenstr\u00f6mmacroglobulinemia. This classification does not cover patients for whom a syngeneic donor is available Levels of evidence - Grade I: Evidence from at least one well -executed randomised trial. - Grade II: Evidence from at least one well -design ed clinical trial without randomisation; cohort or casecontrolled analytic studies (preferably from more than one centre); multiple time -series studies or dramatic results from uncontrolled experiments. - Grade III: Evidence from opinions of respected aut horities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies or reports from expert committees. aCategories are based on number of white blood cells, cytogenetics and molecular markers at diagnosis and time to achieve remission bConstitutional SAA include Fanconianemia, dyskeratosiscongenita, Blackfan -Diamond anemia and other inborn bone marrow failure syndrom es (see table for paediatric indications ) cAggressive MS. Standard of care (S): Indications categorised as S are reasonably well defined and results compare favourably (or are superior) to those of non -transplant treatment approaches. Obviously, defining an indication as the standard of care does not mean an HSCT is necessarily the optimal therapy for a given patient in all clinical circumstances. Standard of care transplants may be per formed in a specialist centre with experience in HSCT and an appropriat e infrastructure as defined by the JACIE guidelines. Clinical option (CO): The CO category applies to indications for which the results of small patient cohorts show efficacy and acceptable toxicity of the HSCT procedure, but confirmatory randomised studies are missing, often as a result of low patient numbers. The broad range of available transplant techniques combined with the variation of patient factors such as age and comorbidity makes interpretation of these data difficult. Our current interpretation of existing data for indications placed in this category supports that HSCT is a valuable option for individual patients after careful discussions of risks and benefits with the patient but that for groups of patients the value of HSCT needs further evaluation. Transplants for indications under this he ading should be performed in a specialist centre with major experience in HSCT with an appropriate infrastructure as defined by JACIE guidelines. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 31 Developmental (D): Indications have been classified as D when the experience is limited, and additional research is needed to define the role of HSCT. These transplants should be done within the framework of a clinical protocol, normally undertaken by transplant units with acknowledged expertise in the management of tha t particular disease or that type of HSCT. Protocols for D transplants w ill have been approved by local research ethics committees and must comply with current international standards. Rare indications where formal clinical trials are not possible should be performed within the framework of a structured regis try analysis, idea lly an EBMT non -interventional/observational study. Centres performing transplants under this category should meet JACIE standards. Generally not recommended (GNR): The GNR category comprises a variety of clinical scenarios in which the use of HSCT cannot be recommended to provide a clinical benefit to the patient, including early disease stages when results of conventional treatment do not normally justify the additional risk of a HSCT, very advanced forms of a disease in which the chance of succ ess is so small that does not justify the risks for patient and donor and indications in which the transplant modality may not be adequate for the characteristics of the disease. A categorisation as GNR does not exclude that centres with particular expert ise on a c ertain disease can investigate HSCT in these situations. Therefore, there is some overlap between GNR and D categories, and further research might be warranted within prospective clinical studies for some of these indications.

Patient Informed Consent Form for Adults - Autologous HCT 1. Registration No. 2. I, the undersigned Mr./Ms.____________________________, have been explained by my treating physician(s) in the language I understand, the procedure of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which is now an accepted therapy for my disease. I understand that this treatment gives me a fair chance of improving my survival. I have also been explained the other treatment options. I have been explained the potential risks and possible complications. 3. Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) can be associated with various complications. The most important of these are: 3.1. Graft failure : This is extremely rare in autologous HCT as an adequate dose of stem cells is collected prior to transplant. However, delayed engraftment may occur in some heavily pre -treated patients. 3.2. Relapse/recurrence : Despite transplant, some patients are known to have relapse/ recurrence. The same is monitored post -transplant. Treatment options for relapse/recurrence will be discussed by the treating physician with you . 3.3. Infections : Following conditioning regimen, your neutrophil countdecrease to very low levels which makes you prone to infections(Bacterial, viral and fungal). 3.4. Organ toxicity : High do se chemotherapy/radiation may potentially cause organ dysfunction which may be reversible or irreversible. The common organs affected are liver, kidney, lung and heart. 3.5. Long -term complications: Long term complications such as sterility, other organ dysfunc tions and second malignancy are known to occur post -transplant. 3.6. The financial aspects of the aforesaid procedure have been explained to me and I understand that it may increase in case of untoward complications. 4. Before we can perform the HCT, all your question should have been answered. Please ask these, either to your primary oncologis t, hematologist or one of the transplant consultants. You should only sign the consent form when you are satisfied that you have received sufficient information. 5. My signature (patient /authorized representative) below constitutes my acknowledgment that: 5.1. I have read, understood and agreed to the foregoing and it has been explained to me in the language understood by me. 5.2. All my questions have been satisfactorily answered and I have all the desired information to give an informed consent. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 38 5.3.

Registration No. 2. I, the undersigned Mr./Ms.____________________________, have been explained by my treating physician(s) in the language I understand, the procedure of allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation (HCT), which is now an accepted therapy for my disease. I understand that this treatment gives me a fair chance of improving my survival. I have also been explained the other treatment options. I have been explained the potential risks and possible complications. 3. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation ( HCT) is associated with any of the following complications: 3.1. Infections : Bacterial, fungal and viral infections frequently occur after HCT. Close observation for any signs of infection is an integral part of the patient's management after HCT. Various methods are used to try and avoid infections, including the use of prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal and antiviral agents. 3.2. Organ toxicity : The patient's underlying condition together with the intensive treatments used before the transplant inevitably damages many tissues of the body. Most or all of the damage may be reversible. If it is irreversible, the patient may die as a result of organ f ailures. Your transplant physician will have given you an estimate of the chance of this happening to you 3.3. Graft -versus -Host Disease (GvHD) : This is the result of the donor cells reacting against the patient cells. It occurs in about 45% of all transplants, and is usually milder with matched family donors. It can be severe or fatal, even with a \"good\"match. The main sites affected are the skin, gut, and liver. We try and minimize its development by using drugs such as cyclosporin, methotrexate or steroids po st-transplant. 3.4. Relapse/Rejection : Relapse may occur following all transplants; it may be more common when no graft -versus -host disease occurs. Sometimes, the donor graft may not be accepted by the patient at all, or the graft may be lost after initially b eing accepted. These phenomena are known as primary and secondary graft rejection respectively. Patients may succumb to infections or bleeding until and unless the second transplant with the same or another donor is performed. 3.5. Long -term complications: There may be some long term complications of the procedure and it is very likely that you will become sterile after the transplant. There is also a small risk of developing second cancer due to the treatment received. 4. There can be other potential complications not mentioned above as well. 5. No guarantee of success can be given with any transplant. The fact that you are being offered a transplant is a reflection of the likelihood of the disease persisting or returning without further intensive therapy . Once the conditioning therapy is started, the patient is committed to undergoing HCT. National Guidelines for Hematopo ietic Cell Transplantation 2021 40 6. The financial aspects of the procedure have been explained to me and I understand that it may increase in case of complications. 7. Before we can perform the HCT, all your questions should have been answered. Please ask these, either to your primary oncologist, hematologist, or one of the transplant consultants. You should only sign the consent form when you are satisfied that you have received sufficient informat ion. 8.

I have also been informed that for peripheral blood stem cell collection, I will have to be given medication s in the form of growth factors which can lead to minor discomfort / flu like syndrome. Very rarely serious complications such as splenomegaly, splenic infarction or rupture may occur due to growth factor administration. I have been explained that if marr ow harvest is done, I / my child might be transfused with irradiated platelets and in rare situations I / my child may have to be given Irradiated Red Cell Concentrate from some other donor of the same blood group.
