Method Performed an integrative review of the literature mixed with me experience, analyzing factors contributing to quality of high health education and created a conceptual scientific model that makes visible the connection between essential elements of medi - cal status and analytical interpretations. Objective Discussing and analyzing in \"virtual conversation\" the signifi - cant factors associated with health quality promotion and preven- tive elements based in Art Philosophy of father of Modern Medi- cine, Hippocrates, \"the Great Physician\" was called by Aristotle.Main Text Wherever the art of Medicine is loved, there is also a love of Hu- manity. Hippocrates Without romanticism and humanism the medicine will be a \"surrealistic picture without spirit and colors\". EDASK The greatest medicine of all is teaching people how not to need it. Hippocrates Take a different approach to health and wellness that utilizes the armor of preventive medicine and principles of its lifestyle. EDASK If someone wishes for good health, one must first ask one- self if he is ready to do away with the reasons for his illness. Hippocrates Correct attitude transform everything... must be consequent on consecutive health rules. EDASK They are (Illnesses) developed from small daily sins against Na- ture. HippocratesFigure 1 Citation: (2021): 16-21.And small seductive sins but persistent, can creating great diffi - cult living problems. EDASK Everyone has a doctor in him or her; we just have to help it in its work. Hippocrates Actually in medicine the \"inner-discipline cooperation\" is obliga- tory but the \"interdisciplinary cooperation\" is necessary, as great as- sistance and promotion. EDASK The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well. Hippocrates Greatest healing force for everyone is located in harmonic combi- nation of \"the ethical quality and spiritual affection\". EDASK Our food should be our medicine, our medicine should be our food. Hippocrates Healthy food selection could be not only sensorial but primary chemistry equilibrium of indispensable ingredients on culinary art. EDASK The physician treats, but nature heals. Hippocrates The concept of \"nature heals\" provides factual opportunity of healthy \"ecosystem\", with therapeutic programs, at the context of multi-disciplinary cooperation. EDASK Make a habit of two things: to help; or at least to do no harm. HippocratesIs important to live a meaningful medical life helping patients if you can, but even if you can't do that, at least not harming them. EDASK It's far more important to know what person the disease has than what disease the person has. Hippocrates Elixir of life starts at DNA and finish to the Joy. EDASK If there is any deficiency in food or exercise, the body will fall sick. Hippocrates A sedentary life with food deficiency is \"auto-apoptosis, self-de- structive\" that starts from the mind and reflected all over the body. EDASK Health is the greatest of human blessings. Hippocrates The healthy life is \"precious commodity\" and \"gifted comfort\". It is possible to improve both the quality and quantity of daylife and best of all do it naturally and healthy. EDASK Leave your drugs in the chemist's pot if you can heal the patient with food. Hippocrates Drugs brings \"liberty but with dependency\"... EDASK Foolish the doctor who despises the knowledge acquired by the ancients. Hippocrates17Virtual Conversation with Hippocrates Spirit Citation: 16-21.\"Amputation and distortion\" of any kind of history due to ca- reerism and egocentrism sooner or later converted in boomerang. EDASK A wise man ought to realize that health is his most valuable pos - session. Hippocrates Healthy body is greatest treasure and the best life gift, whom do not always appreciate. EDASK Cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always. Hippocrates Many of the things we think of as medical cures are possibly only \"spontaneous recoveries\", trying to treat often, \"hopes of mitigating their effects but sometimes we only treat the symptoms\", must never lose affection offering to every patient \"the comfort and hope with the sweetest speech\". EDASK Walking is a man's best medicine. Hippocrates To overcome a sedentary life, intensify the activity and creativity, active lifestyle and reduce of sedentary pastimes. EDASK Nature itself is the best physician. Hippocrates The best and infinitely of remedy art comes from nature and ex - tends to medicine. EDASK The way to health is to have an aromatic bath and a scented mas- sage every day. Hippocrates Unfortunately, for most of us a massage therapy every day is not practical, massage has a positive effect on every medical condition, enjoying the health benefits. EDASK Natural forces within us are the true healers of disease. Hippocrates The high rate of \"humanism\" displays within \"empathy compas - sion and courage\", supported of natural impacts. EDASK Everything in excess is opposed to nature. Hippocrates When it's used something excessively as addictions, should wait the disadvantaged response and their consequences, this is \"a guide for doing anything in moderation\". EDASK Each of the substances of a man's diet acts upon his body and changes it in some way. Hippocrates Diatrophy and super foods supplements united with intensive ac - tivity is beneficial restorative therapies. Implementing the nutrition rather than medication, combining nutritional scheme as anti-stress, in harmony with genetic data. EDASK 18Virtual Conversation with Hippocrates Spirit (2021): 16-21.The function of protecting and developing health must rank even above that of restoring it when it's impaired. Hippocrates Medicine is science for health restoration and the art that con- tacted intimately the soul. EDASK We must turn to nature itself, to the observations of the body in health and in disease to learn the truth. Hippocrates Regenerative and Integrative Medicine, provide to patients a comprehensive approach to health and wellness on nature using \"customized treatment protocols\". EDASK Where there is love of medicine, there is love of humankind. Hippocrates Don't know if medicine was born simultaneously with art but I ascertained that both reflected \"humanism in crescendo\". EDASK Physicians are many in title but very few in reality. Hippocrates An artist, an intellectual, a multidimensional personality, but above all a \"humanist\", this is the doctor synthesis. The greatest grievance within me is for those doctor \"who are not doctor but something else\". EDASK Divine is the task to relieve pain. Hippocrates It's not surrealistic or futuristic but divine attempted to relieve the pain of a sufferer. EDASK Figure 2 I am of the opinion that the brain exercises the greatest power in the man. Hippocrates Healing is a component of mental and spiritual practice, via prayer, meditation and psychotherapy is enhanced mental function and supports physical health. EDASK Healing in a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity. Hippocrates Holistic healing requests the convenient time, but in unison and special opportunity, is difficult to divide and underestimate them. EDASK19Virtual Conversation with Hippocrates Spirit Citation: (2021): 16-21.It is safer to proceed a little at a time, especially when changing from one regimen to another. Hippocrates Especially in Medicine, any strategically principal change, should be step by step, with \"respect for the status quo regimen\", improving it, in \"harmonic mixture of traditional with modern\". EDASK Things that are holy are revealed only to men who are holy. Hippocrates The Only philosophy and ideology indoctrination that doesn't cre- ate \"prison of thinking\" and remains holy is Medicine, where philoso - phy was converted into art. EDASK The art has three factors, the disease, the patient, the physician. The physician is the servant of the art. Hippocrates Doctor need strong continuous training in the science as well as the art of medicine, with spiritual humanistic in personal motivation, \"to be really competent at reducing uncertainty and comfortable in addressing it\". EDASK There are in fact two things, science and opinion. The former be- gets knowledge, the latter ignorance. Hippocrates Science and knowledge illuminate the humanity, opinions suits of tastes, illuminate the illiteracy. EDASK Silence is not only never thirsty, but also never brings pain or sor - row. Hippocrates Sometimes Silence is more expressive than words, Silence is way thought for the doctor, compassionate silence but for the patient is mode therapy that brings only peace. EDASK Declare the past, diagnose the present, foretell the future. Hippocrates A motto attributed to Hippocrates philosophy, where informative valuable advices offered in the past, credit and competent of inte- grated healthcare systems contribution for correct, rapid diagnosis at the right time, that are strong base for decided in advance a future perspectives provision.

EDASK To do nothing is sometimes a good remedy. Hippocrates \"Nothing\" especially in Medicine sometimes is good solution or mandatory affair, like \"often a doubtful or unnecessary remedy\" as justification. EDASK For extreme diseases, \"extreme methods of cure\", as to restriction, are most suitable, when the disease exists in all its vigor, it is neces- sary to use the most sparing diet. Hippocrates The highest ideal of a cure is rapid and extreme as shortest, safest, most reliable and most harmless way with adequate diet, is \"general rule of treatment\" that remain effectively.
