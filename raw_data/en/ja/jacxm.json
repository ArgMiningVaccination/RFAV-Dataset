We are proud to assist patients in Cleveland and the surrounding communities. Aromatherapy is defined as a therapeutic use of purified essential oils. I work with the doTerra line of oils as they are a certified therapeutic grade essential oil company. I am able to utilize these oils from different plants to help address any issues or behavioral conditions that your pet may be experiencing. What you want the outcome to be will determine what type of oil I use. Aromatherapy can enrich the experience of Acupuncture. If your dog or cat has any issues with physical, behavioral, physiological, or emotional problems, aromatherapy can assist him or her. Many times the animal will choose which oil will suit them by showing an interest in the bottle of oil. Animals have a great sense of smell, which is why is aromatherapy is so beneficial. On average, dogs and cats smell fifty to one hundred times better than humans. I want your pet to live a long and healthy life. I am able to help accomplish this through the help of aromatherapy. Just like humans, animals will greatly benefit from it. I love the results that it gives our patients. I always welcome questions before or after your appointment. I want you to feel completely comfortable and confident throughout the entire process. If you have any additional questions regarding aromatherapy, contact me today at "}
