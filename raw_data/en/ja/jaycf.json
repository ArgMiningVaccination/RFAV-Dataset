The goal is to reach a lasting cure, not just symptom management. Patients are treated from the perspective that the body, when supported by natural substances, has great capacity to heal itself. The naturopathic doctor also recognizes when surgical and pharmaceutical intervention is necessary; whether it be in conjunction with, or in lieu of the natural therapies. | || | Sonoma Naturopathic Medicine [Rebecca Porrino, ND](https://www.sonomavalleyhospital.org/ihndoctor/rebecca-porrino-nd/) Sonoma Naturopathic Medicine 710 West Napa CA 95476 707.996.9355 [info@sonomanatmed.com](mailto:info@sonomanatmed.com) [www.sonomanatmed.com](http://www.sonomanatmed.com) [Danielle Schwaderer, "}
