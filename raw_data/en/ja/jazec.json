On such an important milestone, Brunei Darussalam is therefore please d to share its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) Report at the 2020 High -Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development. Brunei Darussalam's SDGs journey is guided by its national vision, Wawasan Brunei 2035 , where the country aspires to be widely recognised for its educated, highly skilled and accomplished people, with a high quality of life and a dynamic and sustainable economy by 2035. Whilst preserving its unique social, cultural and traditional values, the Governmen t of Brunei Darussalam aims to ensure that the country and its people will continue to thrive and prosper in the fast evolving modern world. The country has made progress in accomplishing the SDGs by building upon its early achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Through the VNR process which brought together the whole nation, Brunei Darussalam was able to take stock of its SDGs accomplishments, identify opportunities and challenges as well as gain invaluable lessons and insights. Since the beginning of this year, the world has been confronted with the COVID -19 pandemic, that has resulted in loss of lives, impacted the livelihood of the people, and affected socio - economic development. This unprecedented situation highlighted that our live s are increasingly interconnected and dependent, with challenges cutting across borders requiring global solidarity and concerted efforts. Therefore, and with a decade left to fulfil the 2030 Agenda, it is critical that we further strengthen regional and i nternational cooperation and partnership, including capacity building and assistance, towards attainment of the SDGs. Brunei Darussalam remains commited to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, in line with its Wawasan Brunei 2035 , to ensure that no one is left behind. HAJI HASSANAL DARUSSALAM Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 2 Introduction In 2008, Brunei Darussalam began its new journey towards Wawasan Brunei 2035 , its national vision, in which by 2035, the country aspires to be recognised for its educated, highly skilled and accomplished people, with a high quality of life and a dynamic, sustainable economy . This V ision guides Brunei Darussa lam's development strategies and policies, which have also incorporated sustainable development perspectives. During the 70th Session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2015, Brunei Darussalam joined other Member States in endors ing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As an early achiever of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Brunei Darussalam thereafter continues to leverage upon this success to achieve the SDGs, notably the Goals that are directly aligned with Wawasan Brunei 2035 . This report comprehensively sets out the country's achievements and ongoing collective efforts to implement the SDGs. It also acknowledges the challenges that lie ahead whic h the Government w ill strive to address through lessons learnt and, where relevant, based on international best practices. The citizens of Brunei Darussalam continue to enjoy high quality of life in a safe, se cure and prosperous environment as a result o f the provision of essential services and high standard infrastructure including in health, education, clean water and sanitation, housing, legal institutions, tele - communications as well as decent employment . Brunei Darussalam has no record of extreme poverty and is progressively implementing and improving on most of the SDGs. The Government has implemented national policies and plans of action that ensure inclusive economic participation, through the empowerment of women , youth, low income earners and th e differently abled. In Brunei Darussalam, the universal access to high standard education at all levels and nine years of formal compulsory education has resulted in high literacy rate of 97.2%. Health indicators show that Brunei Darussalam's efforts have matched those of the developed nations. Significant measures have been taken to ensure that infectious diseases are well -controlled, as recently exemplified by the country's successful response to the COVID -19 pandemic . The protection of environment and natural resources has always been a priority to Brunei Darussalam whereby 72% of total land area is still covered with forests, of which 41% is gazetted as forest reserves. Brunei Darussalam has actively participated in regional and international meetings as well as workshops aimed at enhancing understanding and promoting closer cooperation, capacity building, and sharing of best practices towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. The country also continues to be a part of the global partnership for development and supports collaboration for mutual benefit for all.

In gearing up for the country's Voluntary Nationa l Review (VNR) at the 2020 High - Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, Brunei Darussalam has established a nother Special Committee, which is co -chaire d at the ministerial level by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) . This Special Committee spearheads the preparation of Brunei Darussalam's VNR report and efforts in stock taking and reviewing the country's progress towards the achievement of the SDGs2.

Brunei Darussalam has also attended several workshops organised by the UN and ASEAN , which allowed for learning other countries ' experiences and best practices in undertaking their VNRs. These include, among others, the ASEAN Forum on SDGs with National Development Planning Agencies - Accelerating SDGs Implementation in ASEAN jointly organised by the ASEAN Secretariat and the Embassy of Switzerland in the Republic of Indonesia (July 2019 ); the 3rd South -East Asia Forum on Implementation of the SDGs organised by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP) ( October 2019 ); regional and international webinar workshops organised by the UN Department of Economic and Social A ffairs (UN DESA) and UN ESCAP (March 2020 ); and the 7th Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development (May 2020 ). Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 4 Sustainable Development Goal 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere Brunei Darussalam places great importance in caring for the well -being and welfare of its people, and continues to exert efforts towards eradicating poverty in all its forms. Towards this, the National Council on Social Issues (MKIS ), established in 2008, is mandated to address challenges arising from these efforts. This Council is chaired by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and its members include the Prime Minister's Office (PMO); Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE); Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA); M inistry of Religious Affairs (MORA); Ministry of Education (MOE) and Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Foundation (YSHHB), a non -governmental organisation (NGO ). The MKIS focuses on 12 social issues, which are poverty; social security; unemployment; housing for the p oor; mentality; immoral behaviour ; crime prevention; family institution; persons with different abilities (PWDs); elderly; women; and children . Under the MKIS , there are five Special Committes which review and monitor the implementation of their respective Plans of Action and policies or directives, as set by the Council. AN INTEGRATED AND WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH TOWARDS POVERTY ERADICATION Progressive economic growth is important to ensure that poverty is addressed through the 3 Members are Councils of State, PMO; PMO; MOFE; Ministry of Health; MOE ; MORA; MOHA; Ministry of Primary Resources and Tourism; Ministry of Development (MOD); MCYS, Department of Economic Planning and Statistics, MOFE; Manpower Planning and Employment Council, PMO; Housing Development Department, MOD; Land Transport Departmen t, Ministry of Transport and Infocommunications (MTIC); Jobcentre Brunei, Ministry of MORA; YSHHB; Darussalam Enterprise (DARe); Council on Social Welfare; and Society for Community Outreach & Training Organisation. provision of employment and other economic opportunities that will also serve to meet Wawasan Brunei 2035 . This is in line with the vision of the Integerated Plan of Action on Poverty Eradication produced by the Special Commit tee on Poverty Issues3, which is to reduce dependency on welfare assistance towards a self -reliant and resilient community. Such vision is achieved by empowering greater self -reliance, and breaking the cycle of p overty through capacity building for employment and entrepreneurship. This Plan of Action is currently being reviewed, in order to increase its effectiveness and to be more result -oriented, and is due to be implemented by July 2020. The revised Plan of Ac tion for this Special Committee will focus on ten strategies, which are skills training ; education; employment; entrepreneurship; finance; infrastructure (housing); infrastructure (transportation); well as policy, legislation and gui delines. A whole of nation approach, spearheaded through inter -ministerial engagement, is crucial in im plementing this Plan of Action. The role of other stakeholders is also necessary, through the inclusion of various corporate social responsibility (CSR )-related programmes and volunteerism activities that target poverty eradication. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 5 Towards further improving the wellbeing and the welfare of the people, the Government is currently in the process of implementing a comprehensive and centrali sed national welfare system , Sistem Kebajikan Negara (SKN). The system, expected to be operational by July 2020, will provide direct access to those in need, making sure no one is left behind. At the same time, this will ensure an efficient, timely and effective welfare system, allowing a true picture to be depicted in the provision of benefits to recipients and their dependents. SUPPORTING MECHANISMS Brunei Darussalam has always emphasised the importance of providing a sustainable social security system for its people, especially those who are least able to cater for themselves. This includes initiatives that provide financial assistance and platforms to target groups to eradicate poverty: Monthly Welfare Assistance (BKB ) BKB, provided through the MCYS, is designed to act as a supplement to protect these target groups from poverty, and ease their hardship until they receive a sufficient source of income and become economically independent. In December 2019, the total number of BKB recipients were 5, 812 heads of household s. The average recipients per month of BKB in 2019 were about 5,700.

Zakat In Brunei Darussalam, giving zakat is a religious obligatio n, where muslims whose wealth sits above the minimum threshold are obligated to pay 2 .5% on their collective assets. Additionally, muslims also pay zakat fitrah during the holy month of Ramadhan, to be distributed to poor muslims. Zakat is collected by the Zakat Collection and Distribution Section under the Brunei Darussalam Islamic Religious Council (MUIB ) and distributed as assistance to those who are not able to fend for themselves and their families. Zakat is also used to fund enrichment programmes aimed at empowering zakat recipients. In 2018, zakat amounting t o B$5.2 million was distributed to 3,669 recipients. This includes through the purchasing of medical supplies and equipment that are needed by those incapable of work due to health problems.

Additionally, through the micro grants under the Development Assistance Programme as well as the Youth Entrepreneurship Enhancement Programme, a total of B$47,739 .00 has been given to 32 entrepreneurs to run and/or expand their business. In view of the potential of this initiative, the MCYS has allocated B$30,000.00 annually under the Development Assistance Programme to provide assistance to at least 10 entrepreneu rs since FY 2019/2020. EMPOWERING THE POOR The Government has advocated the empowerment of the poor by enhancing their productivity through improving employability and encouraging entrepreneurship. The said objective has been achieved through the implemen tation of capacity building programmes, as well as provision of necessary training and skill sets. This is also in line with the Manpower Planning and Employment Council (MPEC)'s strategies for the vulnerable groups and the Plan of Action on Poverty Eradic ation under the MKIS . More focus has been given to poverty eradication initiatives through empowerment tools that aim to break the poverty cycle and to ensure sustainable income. Target groups identified as able-bodied and able -to-work among the poor have continued to undergo trainings for entrepreneurship, self - development and positive mindset. Since April 2016, the MCYS has developed the following five empowerment programmes: Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 7 i) Employment Plan Programme Under this P rogramme, the MCYS, in partnership with various companies, assists BKB recipients to increase their employability and find employment.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 16 Sustainable Development Goal 2 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Image: His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan and Yang Di -Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam reaping the first commercial harvest of Sembada 188 paddy at Wasan Agricultural Area , in February 2019 . Brunei Darussalam is committed to strengthening the country's food security, which will ensure its citizens' access to adequate supply of safe and nutritious food at affordable prices. ENSURING FOOD SECURITY Brunei Darussalam's sources of food are largely through imports whereby in 2019, the country imported food from over ninety countries. To minimise this heavy reliance on imports, various initiatives and programmes have been implemented to increase domestic production and capacity, in order to increase the coun try's self -sufficiency levels. The Government, through the Ministry of Primar y Resources and Tourism (MPRT), has strengthened efforts to develop its agricultural sector. In 2018, the gross output of agricultural production was B$436.3 million, representing an increase of 6.6% from B$409.3 million in 2017. Of this, 56.1% (B$244.6 million) was derived from the livestock industry; 14.6% (B$63.7 million ) was produced by the crop industry; whereas the remaining balance (29.3%) with an estimated value of B$128 million was contributed by the agrifood industry. All of these agricultural industries have each Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 17 shown an increase of 6.6% in production value as co mpared to 2017. Rice is a staple food in Brunei Darussalam and as reiterated by His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan and Yang Di - Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam , attaining se lf- sufficiency in rice production w ill remain a national priority. The Department of Agriculture and Agrifood (DOAA) continues to put greater efforts to increase local production by employing hybrid and high yielding varieties, adopting modern farming and dual seasons cropping practices, encouraging domestic entrepreneurship, including among the youth, as well as introducing commercial -based rice production at a larger scale. New planting areas have also been developed, such as the Agricultural Development Area of Kandol, which is an area of 500 hectares operated by PaddyCo, a newly established government -owned company. The first phase of the project has started since early 201 9 and the second phase is expected to commence in the second half of 2020. The project is expected to contribute 6,0 00 to 8,000 Metric T onnes of paddy, a n equivalent of 3,600 to 4,800 Metric Tonnes of milled rice, which will contribute 11% - 15% of the nat ional rice requirement by 2025. Figure 1: Local Paddy Yield (Metric Tonnes), Actual and Forecast Other initiatives include field research and trials of different varieties of rice from Republic of Indonesia, Republic of the Union of Myanmar and People's Republic of China, to test their suitability to Brunei Darussalam's climate and soil conditions. All these efforts will enable the country to achieve its trajectory of rice self -sufficiency by three - folds over the next five to six years. The Gov ernment has reassured that there is always an adequate supply of rice in the market sold at reasonable prices. Such commitment was evident during the COVID - 19 pandemic, in which the general public was reassured of the sufficient rice stock of more than six -months supply. In its efforts to ensure the standard and safety of its produce, the country has in place policies and legislations , in line with international practices, to cover elements of preventio n against infection of diseases; publi c health; agricultural pest s and noxious plants ; and protection of plant varieties. These include the Wholesome Meat Order 2011, Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Act (Cap. 47) (1984 Ed), Brunei Good 1,649 2,308 4,3946,0997,89510,78612,59313,9682010 2015 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Self Sufficiency Achievements 3.3% annual growth in agricultural and agrifood production between 2015 and 2018. 100% self-sufficiency level (SSL) reached for production of chicken eggs. 90% and 29% SSL for production of poultry meat and red meat. 47% and 37% SSL for production of vegetables and fruits.

Such regulatory mechanisms together with various initiatives for production are aimed t owards sustainable agriculture. Brunei Darussalam also undertakes regional and bilateral cooperation, as part of its efforts to ensure adeq uate, affordable, safe and nutritious food supply . CHILD NUTRITION One of Brunei Darussalam's priority initiatives in the prevention and control of obesity and non -communicable diseases (NCDs) is to focus on optimal nutrition status from the early years. This strategic initiative, known as ' Giving Every Child the Best Start in Life ', has adapted the World Health Organization ( WHO )'s global targets for identifying priority areas in maternal, infant and young child nutrition.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 19 children under -five, reduction in low birth weight, controlling childhood obesity , increasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, and reducing childhood wasting. The Government continues to strengthen whole of nation actions under the ' National Strategy for Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN) in Brunei Darussalam 2014 -2020' , which was the first national framework for MIYCN in the country. Brunei Darussalam promotes exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, and recently launched an initiative to provide free breastpumps f or newly expecting mothers. Also provided are free breastfeeding classes for expecting mothers as well as a dedicated hotline for those who need breastfeeding advice. Additionally, the prices for milk formula for children are controlled through the Price C ontrol Act (Cap. 142). In 2017, as part of efforts to achieve the country's vision for a healthier nation, Brunei Darussalam introduced excise taxes on food products with high sugar and monosodium glutamate (MSG) contents. The amount of tax imposed is B$4.00 per ten litres on drinks with sugar content of six grams or more per 100 ml and of 30% of the price for MSG. Healthier choices in schools are promoted through the 'School Canteen Guidelines ' and the 'Drinking Water Policy '. Meanwhile, for maintaini ng nutrition in child care centres, a 'National Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines for Child Care Centres ' was developed in 2019, which represents a milestone in the development of an essential public health policy for children especially in ensuri ng their optimal nutrition and adequate physical activity. These guidelines, developed by the MOH in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports (MCYS ), serve to guide all local child ca re centre providers when establishing their centres, to ensure optimum and supportive environments for infants ' and young children's nutrition and activity needs. These guidelines also serve as a useful resource and reference guide for policymakers and r elated stakeholders particularly those involved in the management, operations and regulations of child care centres. The MOH has also implemented the Healthier Choice Logo since 2017, whereby food industries, particularly food manufacturers and food suppliers, either international or local, are encouraged to reformulate and produce healthier choice products in the market. Products that comply with the healthier choice criteria can be awarded a healthier choice logo to be affixed onto their packaging. This helps to create demand and supply of healthier choice products in Brunei Darussalam. To meet nutritional goals, mitigate obesity and improve access to equal and equitable education, in order to achieve the fullest potential of all students, Brunei Darussalam, through the Ministry of Education , offers two forms of food programmes in schools: i) The 'Feeding Scheme ', started in 1954, serves healthy meals and/or snacks to eligible students in primary schools and hostels nation wide. In 2019, 29,755 students were eligible ; and ii) The 'Program Harapan dan Anak Harapan ', developed in June 2018, targets the most disadvantaged 41 primary schools (to supplement the Feeding Scheme) and 5 secondary schools to provide meal plans . In 2019, 11,695 students were eligible . Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 20 Sustainable Development Goal 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well -being for all at all ages As highlighted in its Wawasan Brunei 2035 , Brunei Darussalam recognises the importance of health in determining the quality of life and wellbeing of the people as well as its contributin g role to national development. The country also acknowledges that health care is one of its major public investments in human development and that healthy and productive citizens will positively contribute to socio - economic development. TOGETHER TOWARDS A HEALTHY NATION Universal health coverage is the cornerstone of Brunei Darussalam's health policy. As such, q uality of life in the country is enhanced through the planning and implementation of a healthcare system framework towards universal health coverage for people at all levels . The Ministry of Health ( MOH ) through their vision of 'Together Towards a Health y Nation' ensures the country's continuous provision of a high quality and comprehensive health system that is effective, efficient, responsive, affordable, equitable and accessible. Its comprehensive health system covers all aspects of health promotion, p revention and control of illness, treatment and rehabilitation. This vision is fully aligned with SDG3 which emphasises the importance of achieving universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, acc ess to quality essential health care services and access to safe, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. As a commitment to strengthen the national health system and service in the country, the MOH has formulated a Strategic Plan 2019 - 2023, which prioritises five ke y goals: i) Excellence in healthcare services; ii) Prevention and control of Non - Communicable Diseases (NCDs) ; iii) Protection of public health through effective policies and regulations; iv) Sustainability through resource optim isation and innovation; and v) Transparent and proactive governance. The Strategic Plan is aligned with the World Health Organiz ation (WHO) 's recommendations on strategic health indicators and targets as a measure of the country's health status, risk factors, service coverage and health systems. Extending beyond healthc are in a clinical setting, the Strategic P lan includes prevention and control of diseases as well as protection of public health at large. Most importantly, this Plan aspires to consistently place people, and not merely the diseases, at the centre of the country's healthcare. Image: Universal health coverage. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 21 Brunei Darussalam has made remarkable achievements particularly in mee ting most of the global health targets, including the attainment of universal health coverage and certification of free from infectious diseases namely polio, malaria, measles and rubella. Quality and access ible medical, dental and health care continues to be pro vided at a nominal fee of B$ 1 for citizens. This includes high quality maternal and child health services covering vaccination programmes and antenatal screenings, which have significantly contributed to the cou ntry's low maternal and child mortal ity rates. In 2018, the country's life expectancy was about 77.5 years. In addition to the provision of public health services, there are also specialised private healthcare centres, such as Jerudong Park Medical Centre (JPMC) , Gleaneagles JPMC and Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre, which itself consists of three centres, namely the Brunei Cancer Centre, Brunei Neuroscience Stroke and Rehabilitation Centre as well as the Maxillofacial, Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Centre. PRIORITISING HEALTH OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN As one of its priority agenda on health, Brunei Darussalam is continuously committed to improving the health of women and children. This has thus far resulted in the maintenance of low maternal mortality rates and the achievement of the target set under the SDG s for neonatal and child mortality. Such commitment is in line with the call by the global community, such as the U nited Nations (U N) and WHO, which recognises and strongly advocates the importance for the improvement of women and child health as they are key to the progress on all development goals. Brunei Darussalam is in a good position to continue achieving the targets of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births as well as reducing the neonatal mortality rate to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under -5 mortality rate to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services in Brunei Darussalam has expanded Selected Health Achievements High Quality maternal and child health services >95% 100% antenatal coverage births attended by skilled health personnel Universal health coverage >80% 80% coverage of essential services customer satisfaction High immunis ation coverage >95% 100% immunis ation coverage (DTP -Hib- IPV-HepB 3), Mumps, Measles, Rubella and Hepatitis B (birth dose).

In addition to providing high quality antena tal, postnatal and child health care, the MCH services also provide health screening and birth spacing service for women through the Well -Woman Clinic. Home nursing care for mothers and infants are also included in the first week following delivery as well as home visits for monitoring certain high -risk patients and for tracin g patients who miss their appointments. Image: Prioritising health of women and children . The completion of the new Women and Children Centre in 2014 marked a significant milestone in the hi story of women and child healthcare in the country. The new C entre provides enhanced holistic care and integrated services for better quality, more efficient and effective health care system to the patients. The MOH has also developed a 'National Strategy for Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition ' (MIYCN ) with a mission to improve the health and nutritional status of mothers and mothers -to-be, infants and young children. It reflects global targets outlined by the WHO in the Comprehensive Implementation Plan on MIYCN to reduce incidences of childhood stunti ng, wasting and overweight, low birth weight infants and to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding. IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL -BEING Recognising that health encompasses mental health and well -being, the Government has undertaken efforts to improve the mental health and well -being of its people. The Mental Health Order 2014, which came into force on 1 November 2014 to replace the Lunacy Act 1929 (Cap . 48), aims to ensure equality, non -discrimination and shared responsibility of stakeholders when addressing the care and treatment of mentally disordered persons. It is also to ensure a patient -centred and holistic approach in the care and treatment of mentally disordered persons includ ing their rehabilitation and re integration into the community. Sp ecific provisions were included for special categories of patients including those who lack the capacity to give consent for treatment. There are additional provisions for safeguarding the welfare of mentally disordered persons at risk of abuse or neglect, and those incapable of managing themselves and their affairs. The country also stresses the importance of giving support and respect to individuals who are experiencing mental health issues. In this regard, the Government launched the 'Talian Harapan 145', a national mental health helpline, where qualified counsellors are available to provide advice or counselling in handling situations or pressure that can cause mental or emotional disruption. Although mental health is a fundamental component of healt h, recognition of mental disorders and awareness about its importance is limited. In Brunei Darussalam, the social stigma and lack of under standing about mental disorders are major barriers to seeking help amongst the public. Therefore, increasing understanding and overcoming stigma through strategic c ommunications and social mobilis ation are crucial steps Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 23 towards strengthening mental health programmes locally. Mental health promotion usually involves actions that improve psychological well - being. The MOH, through various departments and in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, has gradually increased its mental health promotion activities in addition to the services currently provided. One such initiative is the anti - bully programme, 'Bully - Free Brunei ' ('Brunei Bebas Buli '), which focuses on children, particularly in the school setting. So far , more than 40 out of 152 schools have participated in the wor kshops run by this programme since it was first launched in 2018. This campaign, which is a collaboration between the MOH and the Ministry of Education (MOE) , is further complemented by other mental health promotion activities conducted in schools. The MOH has also organised several mental health promotion programmes in workplaces. Dubbed the 'i-Mind Programme ', this initiative focuses on the wellbeing and em otional resilience of the workforce apart from increasing their understanding of mental disorders. Mental health awareness campaigns have also been conducted in the community, through an initiative called 'Mind Your Mind ' ('Jaga Minda Kita '). This effort , which aims to raise public awareness and understanding about mental disorders , has been carried out annually since 2014 in public places including major shopping malls, cafes and mosques. Realising the multi -sectoral nature of the social determinants of and interventions for mental health, as well as its many associations with NCDs, mental health promotion has been elevated as a key initiative under the MOH's strategic goals on the prevention and control of NCDs and also recently included under the purvie w of the Multi -Sectoral Taskforce on Health in 2019. It is hoped that these actions can help the country to achieve the vision of a mentally healthy and resilient nation. PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH Brunei Darussalam's focus is also to maintain its relativel y low communicable disease burden, reduce the risk of importation of communicable diseases and maintain preparedness in responding to any outbreaks of infectious disease of public health concern. Emerging and re -emerging infectious diseases remain as a sig nificant public health threat regionally and globally a s evidenced by the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. Although Brunei Darussalam has made significant improvements in making the country safer, it needs to continue to enhance its capacities and pre paredness level through a whole of nation approach linking all relevant sectors and players, including finance, health, agriculture, environment, emergency responders, security agencies and others, in working closely together to protect the public health. In October 2019, Brunei Darussalam conducted the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of International Health Regulations (IHR) Core Capacities, an assessment of Brunei Dar ussalam's capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats (which may be biological, chem ical or radiological in nature) and a joint review of the country's capacities to prepare for and respond to complex public health emergencies. A team of international health experts and their national counterparts met to evaluate Brunei Darussalam 's capacities in 19 technical areas. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 24 Together , these areas , including disease surveillance, national legislation, risk communication capacity, food safety, zoonotic disease and biosafety and biosecurity, span the capacities required under the International Health Regulations (2005) to respond to all known natural and man-made emergency health threats. The National Committee on the Implementation of the WHO IHR 2005, chaired by the Minister of Health , will review, consider and plan for the implementation of the various recommendations from the JEE, once the official report is finalised and released by the WHO. The official report is expected to be released in 20 20. PREVENTING AND CONTROLLING NCDs Brunei Darussalam 's 'National Multisectoral Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs (BruMAP -NCD) 2013 -2018 ' was developed to prevent and control NCDs through enabling healthier environments as well as reducing risk factors and better management. The goal is to achieve 18% relative reduction by 2018 in Brunei Darussalam to be fully aligned with the global target of a 25% relative reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025. Evaluation on this goal has been done by two WHO consultants in November 2019, in which the report is currently being drafted. There are two strategic themes to the Action Plan, namely improving health through enabling environment and healthy choices , and improving health through enhancing the continuum of care for NCD s, with five objectives, which are to : i) Reduce tobacco use; ii) Promote balanced and healthy diet; iii) Increase physical activity; iv) Identify people at risk for NCDs and manage effectively; and v) Improve the quality of care and outcome of NCDs management. Brunei Darussalam is committed to the global targets for NCDs, whereby within the next five years, the co untry targets to curb obesity and diabetes; reduce the rate of tobacco use by 30%; reduce the rate of those suffering from high blood pressure by 25%; reduce the rate of high sugar drinks intake among children by 50%; and reduce the rate of tooth decay in children. This whole of nation approach in tackling NCDs has been further strengthened with the establishment of the Multisectoral Taskforce on Health that currently oversees five main cross -functional issues, namely: i) Giving Every Child t he Best Start in Life; ii) Reducing Smoking; iii) Improving B runei Darussalam 's Food Environment; iv) Supporting Active Communities; a nd v) Ensuring A Mentally Health a nd Resilient Nation. The Task Force is chaired by the Minister of Health and members comprise d of several Permanent Secretaries and Heads of Departments fro m relevant government agencies. Identified actions have been agreed on for each initiative and implemented by the MOH in collaboration with related government agencies, with quarterly reporting on the progre ss of the various initiatives and actions.

This was followed by a similar programme conducted specifically for a local senior citizen association, PENYULUH, in the Belait District in 2015. The program me was reviewed and re -introduced at the S enior Citizen Activity Centre s in the Tutong D istrict in 2018 and in the Belait D istrict in 2019. This revised programme is planned to be rolled out to the Brunei -Muara and Temburong Districts in 2020. The aim of t he programme is to raise awareness of senior citizens on health -related issues, specific health services and issues related to ageing as well as to empower senior citizens so that they can continue to live a healthy lifestyle and enjoy good quality of life . Health care in Brunei Darussalam has evolved rapidly over the years to where it is now achieving universal health coverage and the provision of comprehensive services encompassing primary, secondary to tertiary care and also pu blic health services that serve in protecting the health and safety of the general population. Recognising the cross -cutting nature of health issues and the importance of engagement and partner ship for health through a whole of nation approach, the MOH continues to actively engage other relevant stakeholders and together, the country intends to translate the strategic plan for health into integrated actions, to derive significant health outcomes and improve the wellbeing of the people.

The country has always prioritised universal access to education for its citizens, emphasising on equity and equality for a ll. It recognises the crucial need for human resource development in order to meet its needs for an educated and marketable workforce, in which it has made significant progress. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is committed to providing an educational system that prepares and equips the young generation for their present and future roles in the development of the country and as global citizens. Through the 'Strategic Plan for 2018 -2022', the MOE has set its mission to deliver holistic education to achieve the fullest potential for all in line with its vision of 'Quality Education, Dynamic Nation'. The country's education system aims to nurture each and every child, and to help students d iscover and maximise their talent, as well as to develop passion for lifelong learning. Figure 2: Ministry of Education Strategic Plan for 2018 -2022 Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 29 FREE, BASIC EDUCATION FOR ALL In ensuring inclusive and equal access to quality education, all children are provided free and compulsory basic education. In 2009, the MOE embarked on a new education system, the National Education System for the 21st Centur y (SPN21), which implemented several changes to the education system, namely the education structure, curriculum and assessment as well as technical education. SPN21 allows for highly capable students to complete their secondary education in four years rat her than five years. It caters to students' needs, by providing multiple pathways for students to choose programmes that suit their capabilities, interests, inclinations, growth and development. The SPN21 ensures that within broad learning areas, learners will develop knowledge, understanding and essential skills, with the attitudes and values to ensure holistic development within the context of the 21st century. This provides the basis for lifelong learning and employability in a progressive and challengi ng world. Additionally, it seeks to inculcate sound moral values as a strong foundation in an era of rapid progress and change, and to empower educated and highly skilled people to be ready for the challenges to come. Brunei Darussalam implements a policy of providing 12 years of education to all children . This consists of one year of pre - school education, six years of primary education, three years of lower secondary education and two years of upper secondary or vocational and technica l education. Meanwhile, the Compulsory Education Act 2007 mandates for all children aged 6 to 14 , irrespective of gender, race or abilities, to attend school regularly to ensure that children receive at least nine years of formal education. Private and int ernational education institutions also play key roles in and make significant contributions to the National Education System, from preschool and primary education up to higher education. EARLY EDUCATION In terms of improving access to quality early educa tion, Brunei Darussalam has seen an increasing trend in the gross enrolment rate and net enrolment rate in pre -primary and primary education. The country has successfully achieved and maintained high pre-primary enrolment of five -year old children. School leaders actively engage parents at least eight months before the school year starts. Image: Parents involvement in the SAFE program me in 2019 . Since 2014, the MOE has enhanced parenting education through the 'School and Family Engagement (SAFE) Program me' in all pre -schools, which enable s parents to be deeply involved in their children's literacy development. Brunei Darussalam also introduced the Assistant Teacher Volunteer Programme to enable volunteers to be placed in schools to assist pre -school teachers to ensure that all students are better able to access quality early childhood education. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 30 INCLUSIVE EDUCATION In ensuring inclusive quality education for all, students with special needs are provided with special educa tion programmes, at both primary and secondary mainstream government schools. The number of current students with special needs in these schools has reached to about 2 ,014 students. Modifications and/or adaptations are made to the curriculum, as well as in teaching and learning strategies to suit the needs of these students, so that they may achieve their fullest potential. Image: Learning Daily Living Skill and ICT in a school under the Model Inclusive School s Project . In 2008, the Model Inclusive Schools Project was introduced and implemented in selected primary and secondary schools, with the aim of improving access and participation for students with special needs. Image: Cooking and g ardening projects in Centre of Excellence, Sultan Hassan Primary School, Temburong District . In January 2019, the MOE embarked on a major centralisation initiative to set up two Centres of Excellence for students with special needs in the Temburong District. These C entres offer appropriate infrastructure s and facilities, specialised resources and learning equipment, while providing Special Education Needs Assistance (SENA) teachers and teacher aides to meet student needs based on their diagnosis. The Centres aim to p romote equal and equitable oppo rtunities according to student needs and abilities in order to ensure access, engagement and active participation. LITERACY AND NUMERACY Since the formalisation of education in 1912, Brunei Darussalam has made remarkable progress in its literacy rate . The basic literacy rate has increased from 69.4% in 1971, to 96.9% in 2016 and 97.2% in 2019 . The Centralised Assessment Unit (CAU) at the MOE was formed to provide evidence - based data and comprehensive reports in improving teaching pedagogy and students' learning outcomes based on Student Assessment Trackers (SAT). The SAT is a standardised measure on Literacy and Numeracy that provides data which can be used to improve students' competency. Brunei Darussalam also particip ated in the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for the first time in 2018 to measure its students' proficiency in Reading, Mathematics and Science , benchmarking against 79 other countries and economies. Among the participating ASEAN Member States , Brunei Darussalam was ranked 3rd in all domains of the PISA 2018. Overall results have placed Brunei Darussalam in the 60th place for Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 31 Reading, 51st for Mathematics and 50th for Scienc e. Since 2016, the country has implemented the Brunei Darussalam Literacy and Numeracy Standard which provides a national benchmark for all schools implementing the SPN21 curriculum which include instruction, assessment, and intervention . This is to ensur e that students are able to achieve a high level of competency in literacy and numeracy by the end of each school year. Brunei Darussalam also continues to undertake several initiatives to improve literacy levels and quality of teaching for children, such as the distribution of Early Literacy packs in joint collaboration with various ministries. The Language and Literature Bureau conducts an Early Literacy Programme, which includes educating expectant parents on the importance of reading and early lite racy. LIFELONG LEARNING The MOE, through its Strategic Plan 2018 - 2022, is committed and dedicated in supporting Wawasan Brunei 2035 to develop a knowledge -based society through increasing the opportunities to lifelong learning (LLL) and encouraging its people to embrace the concept of LLL throughout their life and work. Realising the importance of such pursuit of knowledge in Brunei Darussalam, the MOE has established the Lifelong Learning Centre, known as the L3 Centre. This Centre oversees the LLL programmes and activities conducted by various LLL centres and providers, and acts as a 'one -stop information centre' for LLL programmes and activities in the country. The L3 Centre plays an important role in supporting the MOE to improve opportunities for LLL through developing policy, framework and guideline to promote access to LLL, reviewing the provision of LLL, and promoting enrolment in LLL programmes and activities. There are several other LLL centres under the MOE, which a lso support the M inistry's strategic initiatives through their LLL programmes and activities such as the Centre for Lifelong Learning at Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD), Leadership and Lifelong Learning Centre at Universiti Islam Sultan Sharif Ali (UNIS SA), Tri -CEd at Universiti Teknologi Brunei (UTB), and Continuing Education and Training under the Institute of Brunei Technical Education (IBTE CET). OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER EDUCATION Brunei Darussalam offers various alternative programmes for its post -secondary students to cater to their strengths and interests. Its local universities, UBD, UTB and UNISSA, offer numerous undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes. As a reflection of their progress and development, both UBD and UTB are young universities that have recently been highly ranked in the QS World University Rankings and the QS Asian University Rankings. Image: UBD . Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 32 On the other hand, Politeknik Brunei (PB) was estab lished to cater to the needs of young Bruneians with Level 5 Diploma qualifications. Consecutively, Brunei Darussalam's Technical Education Transformation resulted in the establishment of the IBTE. Both of these Technical and Vocational Education Training institutions adhere to a demand -driven approach that follows the Brunei Darussala m Qualification Framework . This framework was developed together with stakeholders to ensure alignment with industry needs. The IBTE and PB offer technical education opportuni ties through a variety of diploma and certification programmes. There are also opportunities to pursue further education at private higher education institutions such as Laksamana College of Business, Kemuda Institute , Micronet International College, Interna tional Graduate Studies College , Cosmopolitan College of Commerce and Technology, Mahakarya Institutes of the Arts Asia, HADtech College and BICPA -FTMS Accountancy Academy. Image: UBD graduates . Educational scholarships for further education in both local and overseas institutions are offered by the Government and private sectors. Additionally, an education loan facility is also made available to provide support for students who are keen to pursue higher education but do not meet the minimum requirements to qualify for scholarships. In 2018, the Technical and Vocational Education Scholarship Scheme was introduced to provide additional academic opportunities to school leavers with 3 'O' levels and b elow to continue their studies. IMPROVING QUALITY OF TEACHERS Brunei Darussalam has taken several initiatives t owards ensuring that teaching quality and standards can be improved and enhanced. The MOE has introduced th e Brunei Teacher Standards , which is a set of teaching competencies designed to raise the quality of teaching, to improve the attainment of all students and the overall quality of education in Brunei Darussalam. The Brunei Darussalam Teachers Academy (BDTA) aims to provide continuous and quality professional development programmes that develop and build teachers' capacity. This programme is designed to develop the expertise of teachers in their respective fields towards effective teaching and learning , thereby promoting students' excellence. To evaluate its progress in ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, Teacher Performance Appraisal is applied as performance descriptors for teaching competencies, with SAT used to measure students' achievements and learning in literacy and n umeracy. The MOE has newly established the Department of Educators Management to ensure the Ministry is supplied with highly skilled and successful human resource (teachers, school leaders and specialists) through a comprehensive and robust human resource management that focuses on four domains: Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 33 i) Development and implementation of rigorous and comprehensive selection and recruitment process of teachers; ii) Strategic deployment and redeployment of teachers and school leaders according to needs and priority; iii) Career progression pathway for both teachers and school leaders; and iv) Succession planning projection and provision of pre-retirement programmes to educators who are going to retire. The MOE has also embarked on the Literacy and Numeracy Coaching Programme towards realising SPN21 policy objectives on improving student learning outcomes in line with National Literacy and Numeracy Standards. The strategic objectives of this programme are to ac hieve high quality English Language and M athematics teaching; produc e highly literate and numerate students ; and a system empowered to deliver sustained improvements in literacy and numeracy. In July 2019, 149 English Language and Mathematics teachers , 24% beyond the targeted number , were accredited as Coaches, thus ensur ing the sustainability of the programme. These coaches comprised of a pool of selected teachers of the English Language and Mathematics who have completed a Coaching Integ rated Professional Development for three phases (Accredited, Specialist and Expert) f or up to 12-15 months and are supported via one -on- one in -school coaching based on specialisation (English Language or Mathematics) and pedagogical appr oach using Teaching for Mastery Framework in English Language and Mathematics. SUSTAINABLE EDUCATION In progressing towards the acquisition of 4th Industrial Revolution skills, the Ministry's Science, Technology and Environmental Partnership (STEP) Centre provid es a value - added platform for schools and assist s teachers in encouraging and increasing the involvement of students in quality STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) activities and program mes. One of their initiatives was the Green School Gardening (GSG). Other initiatives include empowerment of students in digital literacy via programming and coding competitions. Such competitions have been co -organised by STEP Ce ntre and the Authority for Info -communications Technology Industry as early as in primary schools and with full support from the Curriculum Development Department a nd BDTA in providing educational materials and training respectively. Image: Students harvesting lettuce and plan ting Pak Choi during the GSG program me. Since the introduction of SPN21, the MOE has incorporated topics on Global Citizenship Education in formal curriculum at different levels of education, both in classroom settings and through extra - curricular activities, to educate students about global mat ters in different levels of education . GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP To enhance the global partnership for development, the Government offer s scholarships for international students to Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 34 pursue higher level education in various academic institutions in Brunei Darussal am.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 43 Sustainable Development Goal 6 Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Brunei Darussalam has an abundant natural supply of fresh water. The Government places great importance on an effective water supply system, to ensure that the population has access to clean, safe and affordable drinking water that conforms to the World Health Organiz ation 's standards, while at the same time ensuring that it is sustainable. The country's target is to sustainably use its water resources so that the future generations are able to enjoy the same benefits. Access to clean water and sanitation: 100% of the population has access t o clean and safe drinking water since 2000. 93% of the population has access to sanitation . Wastewater treatment service is provided at no cost to the public. Currently 35 catchments (18 major and 17 subsidiary rivers) throughout the country. With increasing demands and pressures due to population growth and business needs, the Government is concurrently addressing the challenges of wastewater, river water quality, as well as water security and water resource management to support and sustain the quality of life and economic productivity. WATER CONSUMPTION Despite its progress in recent years, Brunei Darussalam has one of the highest daily water consumption rates per capita in the region. Figure 3: Water Consumption in Brunei Darussalam (lit re/capita/day) . This necessitates the Government to balance water supply and demand, such that the consumption of water does not adversely impact its water resources. To address this issue, the country's key approach for an effective water supply system and sustainable water resources include s: i) Integrated planning and development with the aims to create a data sharing platform, knowledge sharing through feasibility studies and masterplan as 420 380 370 290 250280310340370400430 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2035 Current Target Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 44 well as to streaml ine policies pertaining to water resource management; ii) Adopting alternative funding mechanism to reduce dependency on government funds and increase financial robustness for effective implementation of water projects; and iii) Water balance that include addressing non-revenue water (NRW) , reviewing water tariff, strengthening water conservation awareness and enforcement. In order to enhance water security for the future, the Government plans to update the forecasted water demand through a feasibility s tudy in the supply of transboundary water from the Temburong District, the least populated of all the four districts, to Brunei -Muara District , the most heavily populated district . EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF WATER To efficiently manage water, the Government intends to undertake a comprehensive study and management of NRW , which covers water lost in the water network through pipe leaks, tanks overflow, metering inaccuracies and illegal tapping of water. Currently, NRW accounts f or 40% of the total water supply. This study is expected to be able to increase the reliability of the pipe systems, reduce water disruptions as well as improve supply of water, through minimisation of pipe leaks and identification of quick repair areas. The Government is also in the process of implementing a new water tariff system and a new Unified Smart Metering System, in which the new rates are based on a tiered structure for residential, commercial and raw water. This progressive tariff system bett er reflects the costs of water production as well as encourages more efficient use of water. This will ensure sustainability of the water supply by addressing the substantial discrepancy between revenue collection and production expenditure. It is also i n the process of producing the Brunei Darussalam Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme , which aims to determine the terms and conditions, requirements and guidelines for water fittings, appliances, apparatuses and products to be labelled for water efficiency. This will enable consumers to make informed choices in purchasing more water effic ient products and consequently inculcate water saving practices. The Government also acknowledges the importance of saving water through the promotion of more sustainable consumption behaviour by the general public. ROBUST SANITATION MANAGEMENT In Bru nei Darussalam, wastewater treatment service is provided at no cost to the public. The G overnment places a high priority to ensure the robustness and continuity of sanitation facilities and services in the country. Currently, there are 35 catchments (18 major and 17 subsidiary rivers) throughout the country, to effectively manage and maintain sewerage infrastructure and assets. Through ministerial projects as well as projects under the National Development Plans, 93% of the population has access to sanitation. The remaining 7% of the population without access to sanitation are old water village settlements as well as a small proportion of the population living in very remote areas. The Govern ment's target is to i ncrease access to sanitation from 93% to 97% by 2035. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 45 Figure 4: Access to Sanitation in Brunei Darussalam (%) . Achieving this will require the adoption of sound engineering solutions that are able to be applied to the complex arrangements of the old water settlements, vacuum systems for the remaining new water village settlements as well as septic systems strategis ed for the sparsely populated and remote residential areas. Further, the Government aims to not only provide access to sanitation for all but also to ensure that the river ecosystems are healthy. Towards the 2030 Agenda, the Government will continue in ma intaining 100% access to clean and safe drinking water as well as improving access to sanitation , while also intensifying efforts to ensure that these are achieved in a sustainable manner. 6569708080919397 19901995200020052010201520192035 Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 46 Sustainable Development Goal 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Ensuring the provision of reliable, efficient, affordabl e and safe electricity supply in the country remains a priority for the Government. Residents in Brunei Darussalam benefit from a well -developed, reliable and low -priced utilities system. It has among the highest electrification rates in ASEAN with 99.9% of the population connected to the grid. Access to electricity: 99.9% of the population is connected to the grid . Generation Capacity from 777.70 MW (2015) to 877 MW (2019) . Electricity demand expected to grow 3 -4% to 5,900 GWh between now and 2029 . Brunei Darussalam's electricity generation capacity has increased in recent years, as seen from the figure below. Figure 5: Electricity Generation Capacity in Brunei Darussalam . Power grids in the country are operated by two providers, namely the Department of Electrical Services under the Ministry of Energy and Berakas Power Company, which provides reliable power to approximately 60% and 40 % of the national power demand respectively . Figure 6: Trend of Frequency of Power Outages (lasting more than 1 hour) . Brunei Darussalam's electricity demand is expected to grow by 3 -4% between now and 2029, driven by increased industrial and economic activities, transportation needs and population growth. In an increasingly electronic and electrified age with the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution, the International Energy Agency reported that global electricity demand rose by 4% in 2018, nearly twice as fast as overall energy demand, and is rising at its fastest pace since 2010. Within ASEAN alone, electricity demand is expected to grow twice the rate of the overall energy demand by 2040.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY It is important to balance this demand growth with sustainability, affordability and reliability of supply in the long -term. Industries are increasingly looking for smarter and more sustainable ways to prod uce and use electricity. There will be an increased reliance on innovations in technology; business models; and trans -border connectivity and integration to meet electrification needs in a manner that addresses the trilemma of affordability, reliability an d sustainability. Sustainable and inclusive electrification for socio -economic development is one of the pressing energy developments and issues. It will be a key opportunity as well as challenge in the future. To sustainably meet this demand, Brunei Darussalam is conscious of the need to further diversify its energy mix and incorporate alternative and renewable energy sources into the grid. It has traditionally met such demand with fossil fuels, namely through n atural gas. However, more alternative and renewable energy sources are coming into play to fuel this demand. Brunei Darussalam aims to strengthen national sustainable energy efforts through the implementation of renewable and alternative energy, as well as energy efficiency initiatives, to support the country's energy security, economic growth and environmental sustainability. Brunei Darussalam seeks to prioritise the development of legislative measures in order to accelerate Energy Efficiency and Conse rvation (EEC) , and Renewable Energy (RE) Projects. The Government aims to 8Mono -crystalline, Poly -crystalline, Tandem, Amorphous, Copper -Indium -Selenium and with Intrinsic Thin -layer reduce energy intensity to 45% by 2035 (using 2005 as the base year) through EEC legislative measures a nd initiatives; power efficiency improvement; and increase RE capacity to at least 30% in the total power generation mix. To raise general awareness at all levels and sectors of the community, the Ministry of Energy (ME) continues to conduct nationwide promotion of plans and programmes related to EEC and RE. In order to achieve these targets, among the initiatives are the implementation of relevant Standards and Labelling Orders as well as EEC Building Guidelines for various sectors; appointment of Energy Managers; RE Deployment, in particular solar; and the deployment of Green Transportation. SOLAR PV SYSTEM The first solar trial carried out in Brunei Darussalam in 2011 was Tenaga Suria Brunei with 1.2 MW capacity for power generation. Six different types of solar PV panels were tested8. This project provided valuable information for the country on the most applicable and high performance PV technologies suitable to the local meteorologi cal conditions. In the next three years, in boosting RE power generation capacity, the ME is looking to build a 30 MW solar farm to be located at Sungai Aka r in the Brunei -Muara District. Subsequently, throu gh various solar farm projects and rooftop sola r installations, Brunei Darussalam aims to have total installed capacity of solar power generation of at least 300 MW by 2035. This is to support its goal to increase RE capacity to at least 30% in the total power generation mix. RURAL ELECTRIFICATION The ME has ensured a 99.9% electrification rate for the country . With an abundance of land in relation to its small population of less Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 48 than half a million, a small portion of Brunei Darussalam's population resides in remote areas, particularly in the rural ar eas of the Belait and Temburong D istricts. In these areas, distance and terrain pose challenges to connectivity to the grid. A key part of ensuring complete electricity access for the population, especially in these rural areas , where provision of transm ission cables is challenging , is through small -scale RE pro jects, specifically solar power . The small -scale roll out of solar panels in rural areas has had significant effect s on the lives of residents. As a supplement to the generators in place, it has allowed them to enjoy greater stability in electricity supply, while being decentralised from the main grid. It also reduces emissions from generators powered by fossil fuels. In the long term, Brunei Darussalam aims to power these rural areas with permane nt supply using cables, and therefore via integration to the main grid. In ensuring a fully integrated national grid, a project to connect the Temburong District, a district which mostly relies on diesel power generation, to the main power system via a 66kV line is also underway, with a target completion date within the next five years. BILATERAL POWER INTERCONNECTION Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia are currently looking into undertaking electricity trade through a bilateral power interconnection project. T he completion of this interconnection line will integrate Sarawak , Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam to the ASEAN Power Grid's Eastern System. This power exchange would be a commitment to support the use of RE including hydropower sources, in the region for further energy security and to mitigate climate change effects. REGIONAL COOPERATION ON RENEWABLE A ND ALTERNATIVE POWER GENERATION In supporting regional efforts towards ensuring sustainable energy, Brunei Darussalam and the Republic of Korea co - chair the Renewable and Alternative Power Generation (RAPG) Work Stream under the auspices of the East Asia Summit (EAS) Energy Cooperation. This Work Stream was established as a result of a meeting between His Majest y Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan and Yang Di -Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam and President Barack Obama of the United States of Amer ica in March 2013 in Washington D.C. The Work Stream's main aims are to spur new RE collaborat ion and cooperation in the EAS r egion. Projects under the Work Stream will co -exist and complement the current RE activities within ASEAN and its Dialogue P artners. It also aims to elevate the role of RE i n the region by capacity building and exchange of knowledge and skills. Since its establishment, the RAPG Work Stream has focused its activities for EAS members to strengthen RE promoting policy through scaling up investments into the region. The Work Stre am has also carried out Renewable Technology Demonstration and Renewable Energy Resource Mapping for the region. Brunei Darussalam continues to actively implement EEC measures in its effort to diversify energy source s for sustainable devel opment, as well as introducing the RE policy to encourage investment in renewable energy systems. Innovation, technology and collaboration will be key to meet current and future electricity demands. Brunei Darussalam supports global and regional calls for collaboration and welcome opportunities to explore joint research and innovation towards a m ore sustainable energy future. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 49 Sustainable Development Goal 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Echoing the SDG s principle of leaving no one behind and the call for collaboration amongst the global community, Brunei Darussalam's economic policies are aimed at ensuring inclusive and sustainable growth that create s employment and improve s living standards for all. HUMAN CAPITAL Brunei Darussalam recognises that people are one o f the country's greatest assets. Therefore, it remains committed to invest i n them for the country's future by maintaining inclusive policies on access to quality education, healthcare and financial inclusion , and enhancing labour productivity. Based on th e 2019 Labour Force Survey , in line with an increase in the working age population by approximately 32,00 0 persons (defined as aged 15 years and over), there was also an increase of more than 19,000 in the number employed. Brunei Darussalam recorded a decline in the unemployment rate from 9.3% in 2017 to 6.8% in 2019. The unemployment rate for youth (define d as those aged 15 to 24 years) also continued to decrease from 48.5% in 2014, to 44.2% in 2017 and 39.8% in 2019 . On 1 January 2020, the Manpower Planning and Employment Council (MPEC) was established under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) , replacing the previous Manpower Planning C ouncil , to manage unemployment issues in an efficient , effective and transparent manner. The MPEC will foster cooperation with education institutions and domestic industries, as well as ensure employability of local university and technical education graduates. The MPEC will continue to work together with comp anies to learn more about projected human resources needs. The Government is actively implementing initiatives and programmes to reduce the unemployment rate, particularly for the youth. One such initiative is the I -Ready Apprenticeship Programme, which i s a three - year programme to help equip unemployed graduates with skills for the industry as well as to elevate their employability and marketability. Previously only available for those with Bachelor Degrees or higher, the programme has recently been exten ded to include Diploma Level 5 (HND or Advanced Diploma) and Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET). Another effort is driving the growth of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) , which has been the backbone of Brunei Darussalam's economy. MSMEs play an important role not just for economic development but also in job creation, thus providing income and reducing unemployment. ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION The Oil and Gas Sector remains as the main contributor to Brunei Darussalam's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Nonetheless, between 2010 and 2019, the country has seen increasing contribution of the Non -Oil and Gas Sector to the economy. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 50 Figure 7: Oil and Gas & Non -Oil and Gas Sector contribution to GDP (2010 -2019) . For long term economic sustainability, Brunei Darussalam continues to intensify its economic diversification efforts in five main priority sectors, namely (i) Downstream Oil and Ga s; (ii) Food; (iii) Tourism; (iv) Services; and ( v) Infocommunications Technology (ICT) . Increasing activities in these sectors are expected to boost the growth of industries and spin-offs, create employment, increase exports and accelerate the country's econom ic growth . To do so, the Government actively promotes attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Brunei Darussalam to stim ulate private sector activities and to encou rage local entrepreneurs, especially MSMEs, to reap the benefits of FDI by participating in the spin-off activities. As a result of these efforts, as of 2018, the value of FDI which is currently operating in the country is B$4.7 billion, whereas the value of the FDI currently being implemented is B$1.5 billion. FDI itself has generated more than 1,000 jobs for the local workforce and has also contributed towards increasing the country's exports. The 11th National Development Plan (NDP) (2018 - 2023) is geared towards supporting the Government's efforts to diversify by strengthening the private sector . With the theme 'Increase Non -Oil and Gas Sector Output as Catalyst for Economic Growth', projects under t he 11th NDP are focused on spurring growth in the private sector, including the provision of infrastructure and utilities and ensuring that the workforce needs of future industries are met. Brunei Darussalam also actively promotes tourism as one of its pr iority sectors , which includes sustainable or eco -tourism . Efforts so far have been implemented based on the Ministry of Primary Resources and Tourism (MPRT) 's Strategic Plan (2016 -2020). The tourism industry has shown a gradual increase in the number of visitors between 2014 and 2018 especially those travelling by air. In 2018, the number of tourist arrivals by air increased by 7.4% with a total of 278,136 visitors compared to 258,955 visitors recorded in 2017. To date , the Tour ism Development Departmen t has launched promotional packages highlighting places of interests and distinctive niche activities that are offered in a sustainable manner in Brunei Darussalam. 63.7 62.7 55.7 36.3 37.344.32010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Percent Oil and Gas Sector Non Oil and Gas Sector Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 51 MPRT Strategic Plan (2016 -2020) The MPRT envisions a sustainable growth and increase in the number of tourists and tourism activities through: Strengthening and ensuring the sustainability of existing tourism products. Producing more quality tourism offerings with focus on: o Primary tourism products. o Emerging products with potential, such as beaches and recreation al parks. o Activity based products such as bird watching, diving, and sports. o Adventure tourism. o Culture and community -based tourism. Image: Belalong Canopy Walkway, Temburong District. MSMES DEVELOPMENT As of 2017, MSMEs accounted for 57.3% of employment in the country. The number of MSMEs also increased from 5,427 in 2010 to 5,876 in 2017. Brunei Darussalam embraces a whole of nation approach to drive the entrepreneurship agenda in the country. In 2016 , Darussalam Enterprise (DARe) was set up with the primary goal of supporting the growth of MSMEs in Brunei Darussalam. Figure 8: Number of MSMEs in Brunei Darussalam . Entrepreneurship initiatives implemented by DARe include 'Industry Business Academy ', 'Accelerate Bootcamp Programme ', 'Micro Bootcamp Programme ' and 'Brunei Mentors for Entrepreneurs Network '. These programmes target all groups of entrepreneurs including start -ups and thos e who are expanding their businesses beyond Brunei Darussalam. DARe also organises a MSME s fair annually to give local entrepreneurs a platform to promote their locally made products. To complement these efforts , other ministries have also introduced ini tiatives that provide assistance and support for Bruneians who are keen to become entrepreneurs. For example, in the area of agriculture and tourism, the MPRT is giving opportunities for local companies to participate and invest in the primary sector's economic activities. To date, a total of 5,635 active entrepreneurs have engaged in agriculture and agrifood sectors, of which 78% (4,407 entrepreneurs) were involved in the crop industry. A total of 2,093 5,427 5,248 5,721 5,876 2010 2015 2016 2017 Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 52 entrepreneurs have engaged in the fisheries sector an d a total of 3,219 jobs were created in the tourism sector. Altogether, employment for 7,981 locals have been created. The Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) set up the Entrepreneurship Village, in support of the Ministry of Education 's National Entrepreneurship Agenda, which aims to create and support high growth in entrepreneurship, drive job creation and economic growth in the country, in line with Wawasan Brunei 2035 . Since the introduction of this Entrepreneurship Village in 2014 at the university campus , about 16 % of graduates from UBD have successfully become entrepreneurs , with 300 start -ups founded by UBD graduates. Complementing the Village is the UBD Startup Centre (USC) which provides a space for UDB alumni and graduating students to explore entrepreneurial ideas . This centre provides a platform and the ecosystem for startup growth within the university that includes facilities, co -working space, mentoring and network su pport. CONDUCIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The Government reaffirm s its commitment in maintaining a conducive business eco - system to promote private sector development, vis -\u00e0-vis FDI and MSMEs. Such efforts have been successful thus far, as reflected in the high scores received in several indicators under the World Bank Doing Business, with laudable improvements in streamlining process for starting a business, paying taxes, and getting electricit y. For the 2020 edition, Brunei Darussalam was ranked 1st, with New Zealand, for ease of 'Getting Credit'; 16th for 'The Easiest to start a Business' in the region ; and 66th worldwide for efforts in 'Enforcing Contracts' and 'Resolving Insolvency'. Brune i Darussalam also recognises the importance of fostering healthy competition in the domestic market to contribute in enhancing efficiency and consumer welfare. As such, with the implementation of the Competition Order 2015 and the establishment of the Comp etition Commission of Brunei Darussalam, the country is expected to reinforce a pro- business and pro -investment climate, in line with the Government's long term goal to achieve a dynamic and sustainable economy. The country's network of free trade agreements as well as regional and international trade initiatives that it is a part of have opened up opportun ities for local businesses to explore and become an integral part of the global value chains. Related to this, trade facilitation remains an area o f focus to spur more economic activities in the country. This is achieved, among others, through simplified and streamlined customs processes, including through the online Brunei Darussalam National Single Window and information readily available through the Brunei Darussalam National Trade Repository. To further promote industrial development, the Government has also established industrial sites, some of which cater to specific industries such as Pulau Muara Besar for oil and gas downstream industries; and Digital Junction for ICT and high-tech industries. All of these sites are in close proximity to the main sea port and the international airport. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 53 FINANCIAL ACCESS AND LITERACY Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) has collaborated with relevant agencies and financial institutions in facilitating access to financial products and services available in the country . In terms of access to banking and financial services for all, there were 14.3 bank branches and 64.4 ATMs per 100,000 adults in 2018. In 2018, the Government established the Bank Usahawan with the objective of providing accessible financing for MSMEs in Brunei Darussalam. With flexibility offered in terms of bank collaterals, the Bank is able to take into consideration the unique character of each entrepreneur and provide a landscape of solutions that serve their best interests. Other private banks have also implemented financing programmes specifically for MSMEs, such as SME360 by Bank Islam Brunei Darussalam (BIBD) and SME Financing Scheme by Baiduri Bank . Along with ensuring access to financing, AMBD has also undertaken efforts to encourage financial literacy and inclusion through courses, talks, roadshows and events to various target audiences and age groups. Further, several notices and guidelines, as part of AMBD's regulatory measures, were issued to improve the market conduct of the financial ser vice providers and enhance the financial consumer protection framework in the country. Brunei Darussalam has also established a National Financial Literacy Council, which aims to ensure that all citizens are able to achieve the ir highest financial well -being, given their resources and commitments , through access to well -suited financial products, independent information and advice. SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE The Government recognises the important role of supporting infrastructure for economic development particularly in tele - communications and transportation. The Maritime and Port Authority Brunei Darussalam was established in 2017 with a vision to form a 'Conducive and Dynamic Maritime and Port Environment' which will help to fulfil the needs of import and export activities. Additionally, the Muara Port Company was formed in 2017 through a joint venture to operate the Muara Port Container and Conventional Terminals. The company is expected to further improve the efficiency and throughput of Muara Port. A robust infrastructure is crucial in order for the digital economy to flourish. Brunei Darussalam has restructured its ICT sector with the consolidation of its telecommunications infrastructur e under one company, namely Unifi ed National Networks Pte Ltd. The infrastructural improvement is anticipated to widen the platform for innovation and competition at the retail level. On 24 January 2020, three service providers have relaunched themselves, providing users with more choices of innovative servi ces at competitive prices. Through such efforts, residents of the country can expect substantial improvements in the availability and quality of telecommunication services at more affordable prices. This would result in wider access to mobile networks and internet connectivity for everyone in the entire country, especially for those living in the rural areas, as well as to reduce the cost of doing business for local entrepreneurs. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 54 Brunei Darussalam is also well on its way to prepare for and embrace the pot entials of the digital economy. This includes the formation of the Digital Economy Council to provide national steer and direction on digital economy initiatives for Brunei Darussalam. DECENT WORK In ensuring decent work for all, Brunei Darussalam has ra tified two fundamental conventions under the International Labour Organiz ation , namely on minimum age and the worst forms of child labour (The Minimum Age Convention (No. 138) and The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (No. 182)). Accordingly, t he rights of children continue to be legally enforced through various relevant legislations. Section 103 of the Employment Order 2009 was amended in 2015 to prohibit the employment of children in any industrial undertaking9. Brunei Darussalam is also taking concrete steps towards ratifying an additional fundamental convention, namely on forced labour. The Department of Labour (DoL) works closely with other ministries and enforcement agencies on any suspected labour and trafficking cases, as and when they arise. The DoL continues to enforce the minimum terms and conditions of employment as provided in the Employment Order 2009 , which applies to all workers in the private sector and provides for the payment of wages, rest days, medical leave, maternity leave and other such rights that are in line with national conditions and practices. The Safety, Health and Environment National Authority (SHENA) , which is a statutory body , was established in 2017 to regulate and enforce all matters pertaining to workplace safety and health, environment and radiation in the country . Its mission is to ensure Brunei Darussalam remains as a safe place to work and live. SHENA has actively engaged stakeholders in the general industry and non -industry sectors as well as the public through open Health, Safety and Environment forums. In 2019, two fatalities were recorded - a decrease from eight in 2018 and the lowest since 2016. There were zero major accidents recorded and 92% safety case certificates were issued out of 65 safety case reviewed. 9 \"In an industrial undertaking or in an undertaking which is an industrial undertaking\" Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 55 A WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Brunei Darussalam (NCCIBD) The NCCI BD is comprised of the Brunei Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Brunei Darussalam . Established in April 1985, mooted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to represent Brunei Darussalam's business community in the local and international arena, the Association connects international businesses with local businesses and also serves to guide and assist enterprises in the country. The NCCIBD's members are MSMEs which are mainly based in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade as well as the agriculture, tourism, food and beverage, and services sectors. Among the services offered by the NC CIBD include: i) business matching services among members domestically and internationally; ii) training programs (upon request with a small fee); iii) integrity check of businesses both locally and internationally; iv) engaging with the Government's policy makers on issu es/matters related to the business community; and v) advisory and networking services both nationally and internationally. As a focal point for international businesses to collaborate with and disseminate business opportunities to members, the Association a lso signs Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) with other international Chambers of Commerce and Industries worldwide. The NCCIBD also monitors enterprises for 6 months to find viable business models and targets fresh university graduates. The Brunei Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, founded in 1964, aims to support the interests of as well as provide leadership, guidance and development support to businesses. The Association is working closely with the Government in promoting trade an d economic development, localisation, and is planning to launch an incubation program for the younger generation in 2020/2021, which will : offer business planning support; advisory services; organise workshops (3 -month and 6 -month training programs); offer office workspace for 2 -3 groups of enterprises; connect young people to financial institutions; and provide mentoring services. In addition to general business services, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Brunei Darussalam , a non -profit Chinese bu siness association established in 1946, also provides business and industry information exchange opportunities and promotes communication between the international business community. This Association is committed to cooperate on the promotion of national economic and trade development, su ch as in the tourism industry. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce offers its Young Entrepreneur Council memberships to youth who are interested to engage in entrepreneurship, through which they are given opportunities and a p latform to network with experienced members, as well as learn entrepreneurship skills. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 56 WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY COVID -19 The COVID -19 pandemic has had adverse effects on businesses and individuals in Brunei Darussalam. To mitigate these impacts , and to enable swift economic recovery , the Government has taken several interim measures: To assist the private sector, particularly MSMEs , and ensure their operational viability : A six -month deferment on employers' contributions to Employees Trust Fund (TAP) and Supplemental Contributory Pensions (SCP) for private sector employees earning B$1 ,500 per month and below in all sectors under the MSMEs category. Contributions by companies will be paid in advance by the G overnment to ensure that the annual dividend payments to employees in the private sector will not be affected. The Government will finance the SCP contributions for those registered as self-employed within the stated period, to ensure that they will have ongoing Survivorship Fund protection. Provision of: o 30% discount for six months on rental rates of government buildings for MSMEs in the targeted sectors such as tourism, hospitality (including hotels and lodging houses), restaurants and cafes, as well as air passenger and water passenger transportation . o 15% discount for six months on electricity and water bills for businesse s in the targeted sectors. o 50% tax discount for six months on corporate income tax for the year of assessment 2020 for the targeted sectors. o 25% salary subsidy to local employees of MSMEs for a period of three months, for local employees who are receivin g a monthly salary of B$1,500 and below, and who contribute to the TAP. Temporary exemption of custom and excise duties on Personal Hygiene products, to assist businesses and consumers with the increasing de mand related to health products . Removal of rent al charges for wet and dry markets that are provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs for a period of six months. Help for MSMEs through participation on e -platforms for more effective business matching to help merc hants market their goods online through the platform www.ekadaibrunei.bn . This measure is intended to assist and provide opportunities and incentives for traders to use e -platforms to operate and maintain their business more efficiently and competitively. 'Community for Brunei' - a Corporate Social Responsibility initiative by BIBD , a virtual marketplace designed to help small businesses, whilst highlighting different social and charitable causes important to the heart of Brunei Darussalam . 'Buy Local Produ ce Campaign' - following the temporary closure of a number of markets in the Tutong and Belait Districts as part of measures to Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 57 curb the spread of COVID -19 in the country, this initiative is to ensure the income of local market vendors and farmers continue to be secure and unaffected by the temporary closure. It will also help to ensure price stability for agricultural produce and encourage planting of agricultural produce in a continuous manner. DARe will also increase the grant amount to further expand th e Co-Matching Grants initiative , which will assist businesses to improve and better prepare for current and future situations.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 59 Sustainable Development Goal 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 9 encompasses three main aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialisation, and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or an enterprise. Industrialisation drives economic growth, creates job opportunities, and thereby reduces poverty. Innovation, particularly sustainability -driven innovation, advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and at the same time s upports the environmental aspect of the 2030 Agenda. The Government provides the public infrastructure and utilities required for the community to function. These include affordable housing, health systems, schools, road connectivity and bridges, drainage systems, protection of coastal areas, parks and recreations as well as public utilities such as water supply , electricity and sanitation. These are essential to stimu late socio - economic activities in the country. Within the Ministry of Development ( MOD ), the Department of Town and Country Planning is responsible for the planning of the physical infrastructure development through the establishment of th e National Land Use Master Plan . ENHANCING CONNECTIVITY Through its National Development Plans (NDPs), Brunei Darussalam has made progress on the quality and connectivity of its infrastructure. 97.6% of the country is connected by roads with 198 out of 203 r ural villages connected. The Department of Roads is responsible to plan, design, construct and maintain the road infrastructure network, bridges and related services to ensure safe and efficient movement of people and goods. Construction for t he Brunei M uara - Temburong Bridge began in 2014 . It is Southeast Asia's longest oversea bridge wi th a length of 26.3 kilometres and acts as a direct link to Temburong District, which is geographically separated from the rest of the country. Upon its opening on 19 Ma rch 2020, a previously lengthy journey that required a boat or passing by car through Malaysia became a short direct drive. Image: The Brunei Muara - Temburong Bridge. This bridge is expected to contribute greatly towards the socio -economic development of the country and to the overall well -being of the residents of the Temburong District. The modernisation project of Brunei International Airport (BIA) was completed in 2015. Other projects are also being carried out to upgrade BIA such as Airfield Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 60 Pavement Rehabilitation Works to cater for bigger and wide body aircrafts. Currently, BIA serves six airlines flying to 30 cities on scheduled flights in 16 countries, with an average of 58 aircraft movements per day. According to 2019 air traffic records, a total of 2.15 million passengers and 24,876 tonnes of cargo moved through BIA from a total of 17,947 commercial aircraft movements. The current capacity of the existing a irport passenger terminal is 3 million passengers and 50,000 tonnes of cargo. Meanwhile, the declared capaci ty of air navigation services/ runway is 30 movements per hour. In 2019, a ir freig ht (cargo) traffic and commercial aircraft movements grew by 1.78% and 23.5% respectively in comparison to 2018. Passenger traffic also increased by 15.3% compared to the previous year. Between 2010 and 2018 , arrival of visitors by air has grown by 3.3 % annually (Compound Annual Growth Rate).

Currently, 90% of businesses have access to the internet while most have implemented ICT systems and continually improve them to stay competitive in their respective industries11. The importance of ICT was underlined during the COVI D-19 pandemic, which saw an increased usage of online services, notably in the education and business sectors. All learning institutions were able to incorporate online learning whereas most of the public and private organisations offered their services on line. In Brunei Darussalam, the Authority for Info - communications Technology Industry (AITI) is responsible for providing a conducive environment that will promote an innovative and vibrant ICT industry . AITI also ensures that telecommunications services are accessible to all and are supplied as efficiently and economically practicable, at performance standards that meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the country. In 2019, the Digital Economy Council was established to provide n ational steer and direction on d igital economy initiatives to elevate Brunei Darussalam to the status of a smart nation. Coordination involving ministries, private sector and non- governmental organisations was undertake n to review the purpose of the ICT policy for the country in the areas of E -government, ICT and telecommunications industries. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 61 In April 2020, t he Ministry of Transport and Infocommunications (MTIC) launched its new five -year st rategic plan MTIC 2025 , with its vision 'Connected Smart Nation' towards ensuring its direction for sustainable national development in the fields of transportation and infocommunications. In furthering its digital agenda, a 5G Taskforce was established to increase the country's readiness in the implementation of 5G technology. The Government's recent modernisation of its telecommunication infrastructure is also intended to ensure the provision of competitive and efficient telecommunications and internet services. Brunei Darussalam aspires to improve its position in international rankings, including being top three within ASEAN in the Global Cybersecurity Index , top 40 in the International Telecommunications Union ICT Development Index and top 40 in the UN E - Government Survey. ENCOURAGING INNOVATION AND INDUSTRIALISATION Innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and prompts the development of new skills. The establishment of t he Brunei Research Council aimed to further promote sustainable developme nt and investment in scientific research and innovation. The Ministry of Primary Resources and Tourism (MPRT) has earlier this year developed a facility for a Genetic Development and Selective Fish Breeding Program me, which is expected to increase aquacul ture industry productivity.

Universiti Tek nologi Brunei (UTB) and Gropoint Pte Ltd have signed a n MoU to enhance the research and development of premium muskmelon in Brunei Darussalam. Under the MoU, training programmes for university stude nts and staff will be provided. For example, two UTB postgraduate students under the Food Science and T echnology programme of the School of A pplied Sciences and Mathematics have initiated research activities in collaboration with Gropoint Pte Ltd and the MPRT . These activities include studying and gathering data on morphological and physiological characteri stics of locally grown Japanese muskmelon and conducting scientific research on packaging technology for exports of this premium fruit . Future collaborative plans between the two partners will also includ e research and development in the areas of marketi ng, post - harvest studies, disease and pest management, and food product development. These efforts are part of the Centre for Research on Agri -Food Science and Technology's strategic plans to translate research outcomes into products and Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 62 process in on -going efforts to link academia with the industries. The G overnment and education institutions also celebrate creativity and innovat ion, which in turn inculcate innovation mindsets in the country. Inaugurated in 2005, UTB holds the 'Creative, Innovative Product and Technological A dvancement (CIPTA) Competition ' which covers all areas of Science, Technology and Engineering, and is opened to all schools, technical and tertiary academic institutions, government and private organisations and the general public. In 2019, the Government introduced the 'Innovation Pre mier Award ' with the aim of promoting and encouraging innovation in good governance while further enhancing the quality of service delivery in the civil service. An example of a project that was awarded was an initiative by the Royal Customs and Excise Dep artment to digitise vehicle passes in order to ease cross -border movement of vehicles. As a joint initiative by the MTIC, AITI and Infocom Federation Brunei, the 'Brunei ICT Awards ' (BICTA) is held to spur innovation among the local ICT players. With the categories of School, Tertiary and ICT Industry, BICTA is a platform to stimulate innovation and creativity amongst students, ICT companies and individuals. BICTA also serves as a benchmark for local ICT development, as winners wil l represent Brunei Daru ssalam at the 'Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards ' (APICTA Awards ), a competition amongst 16 member economies of APICTA from the Asia -Pacific region. Brunei Darussalam's participation in APICTA since 2008 has resulted i n two winner awards and 27 merit award s to date. To further develop its industry by encouraging creativity and innovation, Brunei Darussalam conti nues to promote and develop an ' Intellectual Property ( IP) Culture' , which is backed by various IP legislations and rules. The Brunei I ntellectua l Property Office (Bru IPO) was established on 1 June 2013, with a mission to increase an effective IP awareness, promote IP management and commercialisation, deliver an efficient IT infrastructure and to improve IP services. BruIPO is also responsible for the administration of laws and policies related t o Intellectual Property such as Trademarks Act (Cap 98), Patent Order 2011, Industrial Designs Order 1999, Copyright Order 1999, Layout Designs Order 1999, and Plant Varieties Order 2015.

SUPPORTING THOSE IN NEED Welfare assistan ce programmes by government and non -government al agencies provide benefits and assistance , both financial and non -financial, for those in need, including families, the elderly and PWDs . The Government seeks to empower those in need by providing them with skills and knowledge that will enable these individuals to be economically independent, while also removing any potential structural barriers. Priority is placed on encouraging entrepreneurship and increasing skill sets. For instance, the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports (MCYS) makes available programmes and opportunities for PWDs, women and youth, that will enable them to find employment or become entrepreneurs. Similar initiatives are also conducted by the Brunei Darussalam Islamic Religious Council , in addition to their disburse ment of zakat .

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 75 Sustainable Development Goal 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable The Ministry of Development (MOD), through the Department of T own and Country Planning , is responsible for planning the country's infrastructure development, given the limited proportion of developable land in Brunei Darussalam . The MOD continuously aims to safeguard sufficient land for various uses, protect amenity, and preserve a high quality of living as the population expands. INTEGRATED LAND USE PLANNING Land is a vital asset that acts as an impetus for the country's deve lopment and progress. The Government therefore strives to adopt a sustainable approach in land use, which places equal emphasis on the economic, social and environmental aspects. Developable land is 34.0% of the total land area of Brunei Darussalam , whe re 5.5% of this is categorised as easily developable land. The target is to optimise land use within the development plans, and address the challenge of sustainability of land for development. Action plans to optimise land use include reviewing land dens ity, plot ratio and plot coverage for development, and promotion of compact deve lopment, such as higher density, vertical development to meet sustainable development objectives. The guidelines for land use are prepared through the National Land Use Maste r Plan , District Plans, Local Plans and Planning Schemes whereby lands are zoned in accordance to the education al, residential, agricultural, commercial, industrial and health sectors. The National Land Use P lanning Council (NLUPC) was also established to address competing demands on land use to accommodate the country's present and future needs. HOUSE OWNERSHIP Brunei Darussalam prioritises home ownership for its citizens, as evidenced by the introduction of the National Housing Programme (RPN) in 1976 which assist citizens, especially those in the lower income groups, to be able to own homes at rates subsidised by the Government. As of 2019, the home own ership rate was 66.0% with a target of 85% by 2035. To achieve this target, the MOD is working to ensure long -term financial viability of the RPN, in order to deliver a more cost -effective and sustainable financial model.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 76 Image : Presentation of house key plaques to new house o wners under the RPN (2019). BUILDING SAFETY The Authority for Building Control and Construction Industry (ABCi) is a governing body that regulate s the development of the construction industry by ensuring all construction work abide s by the requirements for development control under the Building Control Order 2014 , which aims to ensure the safety and health of the public. The ABCi launched the 'Piawaian Brunei Darussalam 12:2017 - Build ing Guidelines and Requirements' in 2017 as an amendment to the 2014 edition . The new edition streamline s the r equirements for development control, as part of efforts to further ease the processes. ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE CITY Effective management of Brunei Darussalam's environment requires collective responsibility and shared commitment of multiple government agencies. The Department of Environment, Parks and Recreation (JASTRe) is tasked to develop a planned approach to sustainable environmental management and protection , allow ing for synergistic coordination of relevant agencies in tandem with the departments' goals to become an effective regulator of environmental management. In terms of legislation, the country has gazetted two laws pertaining to the management and protection of the environment, namely the Environmental Protection and Managemen t Order (EPMO) 2016 and the Hazardous Waste (Control of Export, Import and Transit) Order (HWO) 2013. Under the EPMO 2016, activities deem ed to have environmental impacts and identified as Prescribed Activities are required to submit Written Notification, together with Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and/or Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) , to JASTRe for approval prior to the commencement of such activities. The HWO 2013 serves to regulate the export, import and transit of hazardous and other waste, in line with the country's commitment as a party to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Dispo sal. JASTRe has also issued, among others, the following documents related to pollution: i) Environmental Acts and Guidelines; ii) Pollution Control Guidelines for Industrial Development; iii) EIA; and iv) Recycle 123 Handbook. To achieve sustainable environmental management, JASTRe targets to reduce waste generation per capita, currently at 1.15 kilogram per capita per day. In this regard, the Solid Waste Management Strategy set out by JASTRe aims to address and manage waste issues in Brunei Darussalam in an effect ive and sound manner through the following : i) Waste minimisation through 3R; Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 77 ii) Provision of efficient, cost effective and sustainable waste collection; iii) Youth empowerment to champion and partake in various environmental initiatives and activities; and iv) Enhancem ent of enforcement to curb littering and illegal dumping. Continuous efforts are also underway to harmonise and improve the present waste collection system for Brunei Darussalam towards an integrated waste management system by 2025. This includes instilli ng a sense of responsibility among individuals and the community for their own waste management . To reduce reliance on the Government for the overall waste collection and management, privatised waste collection services from home to home have been effectively carried out in many areas in the country. The JASTRe is also targeting to ensure good air quality in the country throughout the year, well within the standards of the World Health Organiz ation and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Action plans include environmental protection and management for industries and construction activities to take proper air quality preventive and mitigation measures under the EIA; strengthen regulations and enforcement again st illegal activities that pollute air quality and address air pollution from vehicular emissions. In light of increas ing bush and forest fires in the country, due to hotter and drier weather conditions, Brunei Darussalam is actively under taking preventi ve measures. These include tackling rampant open burning and mitigating bush and forest fires, which are being strengthened through the current amendments to the EPMO 2016 . Brunei Darussalam is also working closely in addressing transboundary haze pollut ion in the region with its ASEAN counterparts through the ASEAN Ministers responsible for the environment, land, forest fires and haze track . At present, river water quality monitoring is being carried out for all major rivers in Brunei Darussalam's four districts. The various parameters measured and recorded are currently being compiled to develop and eventually determine the state of the river water quality. The river water quality is targeted to increase from medium quality to high quality (80 -90 based on the river water quality index) by 2035. Through the Sewerage Laboratory, sewage treatment plant performance and treated water (effluent) discharged into rivers are monitored in order to meet the required water quality standard and treatment performanc e. Monitoring of receiving water is also carried out to ensure there is no pollution and river ecology is not affected by the effluent. Under the EPMO 2016, industries are lis ted under Prescribed Activities, which requires them to monitor their environment al discharges and ensure s that they comply with the permissible standards and limits set by JASTRe. In addition, Brunei Darussalam supports international efforts to manage the environment in a sustainable manner as reflected in the country being signatory to a number of multilateral agreements to tackle environmental challenges including ozone depletion, climate change and transbound ary movement of hazardous waste . Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 78 As part of the country's capital city rejuvenation efforts, the Taman Mahkota Jubli Ema s was officiated by His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan and Yang Di -Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam on 22 October 2 017 for recreational activities. The s aid park has become a landmark in the capital that signifies the importance of health y living . The closure of selected roads in the capital Bandar Seri Begawan to traffic from 6 am until 10 am every Sunday for the weekly Bandarku Ceria allows the public to engage in leisure sports, other recreational activities and business activities , to further promote healthy lifestyle s and to strengthen family institutions. The Taman Mahkota Jubli Ema s, in combination with the weekly closure of the roads for Bandarku Ceria , contributes greatly to the target of promoting open universal access to sa fe, inclusive and accessible green and public spaces. Image: Taman Mahkota Jubli Emas. Brunei Darussalam is also participating in the ASEAN Smart City Network initiative, where by cities from all ASEAN M ember States work together towards the common goal of smart and sustainable urban development. Bandar Seri Begawan has been selected as the country's Pilot City in this project. DISASTER MANAGEMENT Due to its size and geographical location, Brunei Darussalam is not a disaster -prone country. A number of people, albeit limited, are affected by disasters, mostly from low - level hazards such as flash floods, forest fires and landslides. In addressing flash floods, the Gove rnment has invested in an extensive drainage system which aims to address flood mitigation issues and to ensure public assets are secured. It targets to reduce flood prone areas through an effective integrated flood risk reduction approach which include the following initiatives: i) Adopt ion of a real time early warning flood detection system that will send alerts to the public; ii) Formulation of the Drainage Act to provide the Department of Drainage and Sewerage with authority to carry out enforcement duties a gainst non - compliance; iii) Flood mitigation projects through National Development Plans; and iv) Proactive drainage maintenance. As a result of these efforts, flood prone areas in the country have been reduced by 28.6% based on the baseline in 1997. The MOD aims to achieve a percentage reduction target of 49.5% by 2035. Flood Prone Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 79 The Strategic National Action Plan f or Disaster Risk Reduction i s an example of Brunei Darussalam's measures related to disaster risk reduction . It was drafted in consultation with government agencies, the private sector and civil society, to address the needs of all Bruneians during the occurrence of a disaster. The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) implements domestic program mes, such as Tabletop Exercises and Community Based Disaster Risk Management, to ensure awareness and knowledge of disaster response are mainstream ed to communities effectively without discrimination. The NDMC h as introduced a Disaster Preparedness Coordinator programme, which loo ks to train community and grass roots leaders with the abilities and competencies to assist authorities during disaster preparedness activities or disaster response operations. Brunei D arussalam is also currently finalising its Disaster Management Strategic Policy Framework this year. This framework is an integrated policy that aims to build the country's resilience to disast ers and develop holistic disaster risk management at all levels, and is in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 -2030. In addition, t he NDMC is working closely with the District Disaster Management Committee (DDMC) that consists of multiple government agencies and is chaired by t he District Office. The DDMC has connections with grassroot leaders who assist in monitoring the well - being and ensuring the needs of communities are taken care of , particularly at flood -prone areas and villages. Several regional initiatives are being used as models in this country for disaster management plans and initiatives . Brunei Darussalam has hosted the 11th ASEAN Emergenc y Response and Ass essment Team Induction Course, together with the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Ass istance on Disaster Management in April 2018. At l east 25 local experts have been recognised to have the competency in assessing and coordinating large scale dis aster relief. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 80 Sustainable Development Goal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns WASTE MANAGEMENT Brunei Darussalam recognises the need to use its resources sustainably in all aspects of life. Tackling waste is an important issue for the country , with current waste generation standing at 1.15 kilogram per capita per day. The Government aims to reduce t his to 1 kilogram per capita per day by 2035. The Department of Environment, Parks and Recreation (JASTRe) continues to engage stakeholders such as yo uth, academic institutions, private companies and non - government al organisations (NGOs) in combating pla stic pollution in the country through provision of guidance on good practice s and a variety of regulatory measures. These include the introduction of the 'No Plastic Bag Everyday ', 'Plastic Bottle Free' and 'Reduce The Use of Styrofoam ' initiative s. One of Brunei Darussalam's efforts to reduce waste is through the introduction of the 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) concept . The country has exceeded its initial target of 20% recycling rate by 2020, with the current rate to -date at 25%. The target is to achiev e a recycling rate of 30% by 2035. In its move to combat plastic pollution, particularly on single -use plastics, JASTRe introduced the 'No Plast ic Bag Weekend' initiative in 2011, covering Saturday s and Sunday s. Carrying the slogan ' It Takes a Nation to End Plastic Po llution' , it has resulted in major department stores reporting a steady decrease of a 12% monthly average, with a reduction difference of 77% in plastic bag use between January and December 2018. This initiative was gra dually expanded into the 'No Plastic Bag Everyday' initiative starting 1 January 2019, with over 60 participating stores . Excise duties on plastic products were increased in 2017 in support of efforts to reduce the amount of plastic waste to be disposed of, encourage the use of recycled materials and to help minimise pollution. Future developments in addressing plastic pollution include rol ling out the ' No Plastic Bag Everyday ' initiative nationwide to other users of plastic bags such as small shops or convenience stores, res taurants and food stalls; expanding the 'Plastic Bottle Free ' initiative beyond the government sector; as well as exploring the possibility of halting sytrofoam importation and prospect of increasing excise tax for single -use plastics. The Municipal Depar tment is also strictly enforcing proper disposal of waste particularly in public areas, whereby it imposes heavy penalties for those found to be illegally dumping their waste in these areas. SUSTAINABLE USE OF PRIMARY RESOURCES Brunei Darussalam is consc ious of the need to use its primary resources, such as its seas and forests, in a sustainable manner. The Primary sector, that includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, is bound by various interrelated government policies and regulations. Any sectoral project being implemented has to be sustainable in nature with elements of conservation well in place, by considering its impact to the environment as a whole. Each sector has specific initiatives, programmes or regulatory measures in place to ensure susta inability , Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 81 such as the Brunei Good Agricultural Practice , Good Animal Husbandry Practice s, Good Aquaculture Practices, Control and Prevention of Overfishing, Brunei Selection Felling System , and quota system in forestry production. To control and prevent overfishing, there are regulatory measures that determine zoning systems for fishing which are divided according to sizes and scale of operations. Commercial fishing vessels are only allowed in Zone 2 (3.1 - 20 nautical miles), Zone 3 (20.1 - 45 nautical miles) and Zone 4 (45.1 - 200 nautical miles). Further, the fisheries Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) has been set at 21, 300 Metric T onnes per year, where the total annual harvest to date is well below the M SY. Additional regulatory measures include allocation of fishing licenses according to available quota for both commercial and small scale fishing in the respective zones; specific a llowable types of fishing gears; and the banning of trawlers that will tak e effect by 1 January 2021. SUSTAINABLE TOURISM Tourism is one of t he priority areas that has significant impact s to the country's economic growth, due to the spin -offs generated to economic activities, local employment, and entrepreneurship. Amongst the strategies to promote a sustainable tourism sector are to strengthen and ensure the sustainability of current tourism products while introducing more niche tourism that are activity based, such as bird watching, diving, sports, adventure touris m as well as culture and community - based tourism. To date, there has been an increase in community -based tourism particularly those that provide authentic cultural immersion experiences and green destinations such as Eco Ponies Garden in the Tutong Distric t, Sumbiling Eco Village in the Temburong District and Kampong Sungai Seri Begawan. In recognition of stakeholders' joint actions to decrease the negative environmental or social impact brought on by rapid tourism expansion, Brunei Darussalam's Kampong Ayer was recently awarded wi th the 'ASEAN Sustainable Tourism Award ' (ASTA) in the Urba n ASEAN sustainable tourism category whereas Bangar Town in the Temburong District was recognised with the 'ASEAN Clean City Award '. Meanwhile, the private sector has also demonstrated their commitment to sustainable tourism, where the Radisson Hotel and U lu Ulu Resort were presented with the 'ASEAN Green Hotel Award ' in January 2020, for their initiatives in energy -saving, use of green products and community involvement. The community based One Village One Product (OVOP) initiative provides opportunities for villagers to promote their handicrafts and their ethnic cultural show performances to tourists, thus contributing to the socio -economic development of the community. Such community -based tourism activities are jointly coordinated by the Department of Tourism Development and the District Office and promoted as part of tourism package s for both local and foreign tourists to experience the uniqueness and cultural diversity of local communities. COMMUNITY OUTREACH A collective responsibility and shared commitment by government and non - governmental agencies as well as the public on environmental awareness is essential. Raising environmental awareness is made through activities and programmes for various audience s or target groups including the education sector. A variety of mediums used include talks and hands -on activities; Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 82 educational trip s; and dissemination of environment -related information via social media, mass media and radio. Environmental awareness has a lso been active ly advocated by non -government al and non-profit organisations as well as social enterprises . A WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH Green Brunei Green Brunei, a social enterprise established in 2012, aims to promote environmental sustainability through youth -led initiatives in the fields of education, conservation and advocacy. Their initiatives to ensure responsible consumptio n in Brunei Darussalam include: Organising recycling competitio ns and regular recycling drives; Setting up a Green Depot in Kuala Belait, as a 'waste bank' that enables local communities to recycle and collect points, which can then be converted to cash. This Green Depot concept will b e extended to a second location; and Organising regular ta lks and workshops related to waste management. La Vida In addition to its other activities, La Vida, a non -profit organisation , operates the La Vida Thrift Shop, with the following aims: Promote concepts of reduce and reuse by accepting secondhand or unused goods from community donors and selling them at low prices; Encourage a culture of waste reduction and buying second hand to save cost and the environment through social media channels and s ustaining a physical shop front; and Support underpri vileged mothers throug h paid internships at the store. Its future plans include providing part or full time employment for these mothers, with travel, training and day care support. Image: La Vida Thrift Shop donation activities. The shop enforces the 'Go Green' initiative and charges for plastic bag use. Proceeds go to fund La Vida's various programmes and initiatives aimed at poverty eradication, inclusive education and character building. La Vida also hopes to provide a platfo rm for sales of artisan products made by local artist s/entrepreneurs using recycled/ upcycled items, upcycling workshops, educational platform for the general public as well as students.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 83 Sustainable Development Goal 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts The environmental aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are in line with Wawasan Brunei 2035 , whereby Brunei Darussalam aims to develop and maintain a high quality of life while ensuring the preservation of its natural environment. CLIMATE CHANGE Globally, the country only contributed about 0.025 % of the total greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions in 2018. At the same time, with 72% forest coverage, the country still has one of the highest carbon sinks relative to its size. Brunei Darussalam may be one of the least to contribute to global warming, yet it is impacted by heavy do wnpours, floods, heatwave and wildfires that are already affecting the people, landscapes, wildlife and livelihoods in general. The country's mean temperature has shown an i ncreasing trend of 0.25 degree c elsius per decade with rainfall amount increasing at a rate of 100mm per decade. As part of the global community, Brunei Darussalam is fully committed to international efforts to address climate change and contribute to the impleme ntation of the SDGs by 2030, t he objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and goals of the Paris Agreement. Brunei Darussalam became Party to the UNFCCC on 7 August 2007 and submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution on 1 Decembe r 2015. Brunei Darussalam is also among the 130 countries that have ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and one of the first ASEAN Member States to ratify the Paris Agreement on 21 September 2016 which led to its early entry into force. Thes e commitment s mean shifting development priorities to wards sustainable inclusive transition to low -carbon and resilient green growth. As such, Brunei Darussalam has implemented several national measures and strategies to combat the potential risks of climate change to the country. These include reviewing the usage and consumption of energy among the public and private se ctor; developing new guidelines, regulations and policies to reduce GHG emissions; promoting the sustaina ble use of energy; renewable energy deployment; forest plantation programme; and raising awareness on the potential impacts of climate change through continuous promotion al and educational programmes. WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH Climate change is under the purview of the Brunei Climate Change Secretariat (BCCS), a government authority mandated to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate Brunei Darussalam's climate change policies, strategies and actions. In an effort to ensure a whole of nation approach in addressing the adverse effects of climate change, the Government has strengthened its climate governance to ensure an effective cross -sectoral climate action could be coordinated at a national level. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 84 The governance structure includes a Brunei National Council on Climate Change, an Executive Committee on Climate Change and three working groups on Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation and Resilience, and Support Framework. The Brunei National Council on Climate Change consists of key ministers to provide the highest level of strategic direction in addressing climate change. The Executive Committee on Climate Change includes Permanent Secretaries, CEOs, Managing Directors and Chairmans from relevant public, private and non -governmental organisations (NGOs) . The working g roup members include directors and officers from government, non -government and academic bodies. These varying levels ensure a multi - sectoral approach to clima te change mitigation, adaptation and support. The climate governance continues to work in a whole of nation approach which resulted in the development of the Brunei National Climate Policy (BNCP) to pave for B runei Darussalam's low carbon and climate resilient pathways for a sustainable nation, with 2035 as the target year. The policy will underpin the principles, values and strategies to reduce carbon emissions, increase carbon sink, strengthen climate resilie nce nationwide as well as outline the national adaptation plan. A total of 39 agencies, consisting of government bodies, private sector agencies, research and academic institutions, and NGOs were appointed as members of the BNCP drafting committee. To pro vide insights from youth's perspective, a group of 51 youth representatives from different sectors of Brunei Darussalam were invited to participate in the review of the BNCP draft. Upon completion of the BNCP, there are plans for the BCCS to work with th e Ministry of Education to frame opportunities to inculcate climate education. Brunei Darussalam stands committed to reaffirming and fulfilling its international commitment under the Paris Agreement. This year, the Gover nment will be communicating its enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution that demonstrate s the country's increased climate ambition. Brunei Darussalam has submitted its first and second National Communications to the UNFCCC. The Biennial Update Report i s planned to be submitted once there is capacity to develop the report. There are plans to establish a National Designated Authority to operationalise Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on carbon market mechanisms and open up prospects for industries to off set their GHG emissions through international carbon markets in the future. CARBON EMISSIONS In 2018, Brunei Darussalam's GHG emissions were approximately 10.1 million tonnes. As 99% of electricity is generated from natural gas, power generation is the largest contributor to GHG emissions in the country. As such, the Government has introduced a number of measures to rectify this, namely: i) Promoting efficient energy consumption behaviour through the implementation of a smart tariff sys tem and smart meters; ii) Energy management in government and commercial sectors; iii) New tariffs for commercial and industry sectors; Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 85 iv) Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC) Building Guidelines for Non - Residential sectors; and v) Increasing shares of new and renewable energy (NRE). Preliminary GHG emissions (2018) - 10.1 million tonnes Power Generation 55.9% Fugitive Emissions 18.1% Land Transport 13.6% Manufacturing & Construction 4.1% Industry Processes 3.78% Waste Sector 2.18% Agriculture & Land Use 1.35% Residential Sector 0.9% In achieving Brunei Darussalam's climate action aspiration goals towards carbon neutrality, among others, the Ministry of Energy's strategic actions include rejuvenation projects within the oil and gas industry facilities for GHG emissions abatement, both onshore and offshor e mainly from venting and flaring activities. The rejuvenation projects have attributed in reducing the shares of fugitive emissions of total GHG emissions from 38% in 2015 to 18.1% in 2018. CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATOR The BCCS has developed an online carbon footprint calculator where by the public is able to calculate their own individual carbon footprint and learn to offset their carbon emissions by adopting trees. This initiative is supported by Green Brunei, a local NGO. CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE As a small, coastal area with a tropical climate, Brunei Darussalam has medium to high climate change exposure. The country's coastal are as are low -lying (up to 12 metre s below sea level) which increases its susceptibility to the impact of rising s ea level. Although the country has been fortunate enough to not have experienced major natural disasters, it is still susceptible to flash floods, forest fires, strong wind, and landslides. Even though the number of people affected is relatively low, the Government still recognis es the need to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to protect and safeguard the country's people, landscapes, wildlife and livelihoods against climate -related hazards an d disasters. Brunei Darussalam's climate resilience and adaptive capacity go hand -in-hand with disaster risk reduction efforts in reducing the population's exposure to disasters, especially the vulnerable. These include carrying out structural prevention and mitigation measures through flood mitigation, slope protection and coastal protection projects whilst also building community resilience across all levels. CLIMATE FINANCE At the regional level, Brunei Darussalam is co-leading a project with the Phil ippines in collaboration with the ASEAN Secretariat Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 86 and the UNFCCC -Regional Collaboration Center , on ASEAN Climate Finance Strategy Project under the ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change Action Plan. This project aims to facilitate the development of climate finance strategy in order to enhance access to and mobilisation of finance as well as to catalyse climate finance and investment for the implementation of priority climate mitigation and adaptation actions. An ASEAN Climate Finance Strategy seeks to bring policy cohesiveness across government ministries, central banks, financial players and regulators, and take climate change into macroeconomic policy, fiscal planning/budgetin g, public investment management and procurement. The desired outcome of the ASEAN Climate Finance Strategy focuses on delivering on the needs identified by ASEAN Member States in their pursuit of sustainable development, in accordance with goals outlined in their NDCs, natio nal adaptation plans, roadmaps for implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other relevant policies or strategies providing clarity to donors and providers of climate finance. A WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH Green Brune i Green Brunei is a local social enterprise whose initiatives include s: Conduct education programmes on topics related to climate change and sustainable development such as: o Green Leaders Camp, which engages local operators , such as Eco Ponies, Kunyit7Lodge, Sunshine Travel and mangrove tour boat operators , as a partner or resource person. o Climate Camp, partnered with Sumbiling Eco Village. o Organise various educational field trips for students to widen their knowledge on local tourism, specifica lly on the use of local resources and promotion of culture. Collaborated with the BCCS to develop an online carbon calculator (http://carbon.green -brunei.com) that enables Bruneians to calculate their own carbon footprint and to adopt trees to offset their carbon footprint. Regularly organise beach, river and community clean -ups, recycling drives and tree planting initiatives. Enable a platform for youth to voice out their environmental concerns directly to the relevant stakeholders, including the ministe rs. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 87 Sustainable Development Goal 14 Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development Located on the north coast of Borneo Island, with 161 kilomet res of coastline, Brunei Darussalam is endowed with rich tropical marine biodiversity occurring in mangrove, mudflat s, open seas and coral reef ecosystems. As such, t he Government places importance on the proper and sustainable management of these ecosystems. PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT To ensure the sustainability of its rich marine biodiversity for the current and future generation s, Brunei Darussalam regulates the management of fisheries activities and fishing areas as well as protect s both coastal and sea water environments through several laws and regulations. The Government has taken several measures and initiatives in controll ing and significantly addressing marine pollution. The Fisheries Order 2009 governs the protection and management of marine biodiversity in the country, in which one of the provisions is the establishment and management of the marine reserves and parks. In January 2015, the Government established the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to protect and conserve the biodiversity of its fragile coral reef , marine plants and animals. Brunei Darussalam's MPA, a coral reef of 1,208 sq. kilometres in size or about 20% of its Total Marine Area, is significantly higher than the SDG s target of 10%. This showcases Brunei Darussalam's commitment towards the conservation of its marine areas. In addition, as part of the country's efforts t o sustainably maintain its marine resources, its fisheries policies include: i) Enforcement of zoning systems with license quotas for both commercial and small scale fishing; ii) Enforcement of allowable types of fishing gears; iii) Banning of trawlers that is expected to take effect by 1 January 2021; and iv) The imposition of a moratorium on fishing activities in Zone 1, which is within three nautical miles from the coastline . Image: Brunei Darussalam established the MPAs to protec t and conserve the biodiversity of its seas. Other conservation efforts include banning any catching and landing of endangered species, such as all shark species, from Brunei Darussalam's waters and their sale in domestic markets, as well as on importation and trade of shark products. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 88 In combating illegal, u nreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) in Brunei Darussalam's waters, the 'National Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing' was launched in 2011. Image: Regulating management of fisheries activities and fishing areas to protect both coastal and sea water environments. Its main objectives include enhanc ing and strengthen ing the overall level of fisheries management in the country 's water s; to sustain fisheries resources and the ma rine environment; and to optimis e the bene fits of adopting responsible fishing practices. Further, there are regulator y measures such as the Fishery Limits Act (Cap. 130) and other administrative policies carried out to regulate fishing in the country's waters. REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS Brunei Darussalam continues to support regional and global cooperation efforts towards conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources, such as the Resolution and Plan of Action on Sustainable Fisheries for Food Security for the ASEA N Regio n Towards 2020 as adopted by ASEAN Member S tates and her counterpar ts, under a joint ASEAN - Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center ( SEAFDEC ) Declarati on on Regional Cooperation for C ombating IUU Fishing and Enhancing the Competitiveness of ASEAN Fish and Fishery Products signed on 3 August 2016 in Bangkok, Thailand. In 2015, Brunei Darussalam joined other ASEAN Member S tates as well as Australia, the People's Republic of China, Republic of India, Japan , the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and the United States of America in the East Asia Summit on Enhancing Regional Maritime Cooperation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in declaring and committing to enhance cooperation in sustainable ma rine economic development in accordance with relevant international instr uments, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) . MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE YIELD (MSY) Fish and fish products remain prominent in local diets. In this regard and taking into account its limited sea area, Brunei Darussalam places an importance on the sustainability of its marine ecosystems, and encourages the development of alternatives for marine fo od production. Other means of increasing seafood production in the country Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 89 include encouraging increased investment in the aquaculture industry especially in offshore cage fish farming to increase the gross output from the sector. In 2018, the aquaculture industry has contributed 13% towards the overall fisheries industry production. In addition, the Government enforces the limit of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) in the fisheries capture industry at 21,300 Metric Tonnes (MT) per year, where in 2018, total harvest of the capture industry was well below the MSY at only 13,566 MT. All these efforts are to ensure that there are no over fishing activities; coral reefs and mangroves ar e well preserved; and responsible fishing and environmental ly friendly technology or non -hazardous fishing practices are a lso well promoted to industry players. Brun ei Darussalam remains committed towards conservation and sustainable use and management o f its marine resources, in line with national and international standards and obligations, including through international conservation platforms such as the Convention of Biological Diversity . Further to these, the Government will continue to review and update, where relevant, policies, rules a nd regulations as part of the country's efforts toward the sustainable use of its marine resources . Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 90 A WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH BruWILD Established in April 2014, the Biodiversity and Natural History Society (BruWILD) is a n NGO that consists mainly of trained biologists and conservationists with differing fields of interests and expertise. BruWILD members dedicate their time and efforts to share knowledge and interests on biodiversity conservation and environmental protection in Brunei Darussalam as well as abroad. Based on their experience and local knowledge, they strive to provide the best educational support to local schools, institut ions, nature groups and wildlife enthusiasts. They also work closely with local authorities in biodiversity conservation, wildlife rescue and sustainable development. One of their three key projects is ' Saving Our Ocean' , which was expanded from their #indamauplastik (#don'twantplastic) initiative. The #indamauplastik initiative aimed to prevent marine pollution, especially plastics, in which they partnered with few local food and beverage companies for a week of awareness on plastic pollution and collaborated with Seastainable.co, a social enterprise based in Singapore, who provided reusa ble straws for the initiative. Image: BruWILD outreach programme. 'Saving Our Ocean ' undertakes to prevent marine pollution through education and action, such as through Brunei Darussalam's first micro -documentary titled 'Tiny Heroes of Our Sea'. Made in partnership with Our Sea Our Legacy, a Singapore based documentary collective, the video has reached thousands of viewers with the key message of protect ing marine life and end ing pollution. This year, BruWILD is working with Reef Stakes Malaysia, in creating an educational card game that not only celebrates natural heritage but also to learn and appreciate the complexities in balancing development and conser vation of intertidal ecosystem.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 91 Sustainable Development Goal 15 Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Brunei Darussalam's ongoing journey in conserving its forests began 50 years before its independence, with the enactment of the Forest Act in 1934. Among others, this Act provided for the administration of the forests and reservation of forest lands. In response to challenges and opportunities, the Forest Act (Cap. 46) was revised in 2013 to give an emphasis on the importance of protection and conservation of forest ecosystem. The country has two major legal instruments to protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of its terrestrial ecosystems, name ly the National Forestry Policy 1989 and the Forest Act (Revised Edition 2013). Meanwhile, legislation s such as the Wild Life Protection Act 1978 and the Wild Fauna and Flora Order 2007 allow authorities to effectively manage and administer forest resources, such as preservation and conservation of endangered and threatened species . Other legal instruments, including the Land Code; Land Acquisition Act; Antiquities and Treasure Trove Act; Fishery Limit Act (Cap . 130); Fisheries Order 2009, the Town and Country Planning Act and Environmental Protection and Management Order 2016, are als o in place to provide the legal basis for the administration and management of the country's forest estate and its biodiversity. PROTECTION OF TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS Together with the aforementioned laws, policies and legislations as well as strong governance, the country is ab le to maintain its forest cover and to protect and conserve its forest ecosystem. Despite its size, Brunei Darussalam shelters an estimated 15,000 species of vascular plants and 2,000 species of trees. 72% of total land area is covered with forests, of which 41% is gazetted as forest reserves. The Government is currently undertaking efforts to increase the areas gazetted as forests reserves to 55%. Image: Promoting the sustainable use of its terrestrial ecosystems. As part of the initiative s in protecting and conserving the forest ecosystem , the country has also dedicated three separate forest reserves, namely Pulau Selirong Forest Reserve, Ulu Temburong National Park and Berakas Forest Reserve, to the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy . Peat swamp forests (PSF) are the second most dominant forest type in the country, covering 16% (around 90,000 hectares) of Brunei Darussalam 's total land area, 80% of which is still estimated to be relatively intact and covered with good quality PSF. These Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 92 PSF are dominated with endemic species of Shorea albida , locally known as Alan , which is listed in T he International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Image: The land viaduct of the Brunei Muara - Temburong Bridge traverses the mangrov e swamps of Labu Forest Reserve and was designed to have minimal environmental impact. With effective cooperation between government agencies, the private sector and local communities, Brunei Darussalam has also made progress in the conservation and sustainable management of peatlands including the total ceasing of logging operations in PSF from October 2017; improved coordination mechanisms and approaches to control peatland fires; as well as rehabilitation and restoration of peatland in the Badas PSF. Besides flora, faunal diversity in the country is composed of an estimated 121 mammal species; 474 bird species; 182 amphibians and reptiles; and 500 species of marine fish and invertebrates14. Meanwhile in protecting against the harms of alien invasive species, the academic sector is continuously doing research and studies while the Governme nt is strengthening its quarantine service by regulating the entry of potential invasive species into the country. 14 https://www.cbd.i nt/doc/world/bn/bn -nr-05-en.pdf Images : Faunal diversity in Brunei Darussalam. SUSTAINABLE USE OF RESOURCES One of Brunei Darussalam's initiatives towards achieving sustainable use of forest resources is the Brunei Selection Felling System (BSFS) , adopted since 1986, that is aimed at enhancing the overall timber productivity of the forest. An important component of BSFS is the application of enric hment planting of which to date has a cumulative acreage of more than 14,000 hectares, a decade after its introduction. In addition, public awareness programmes are also being actively organised through Community Outreach Programmes, by enco uraging participation from the government sector and the general public such as the local communities, non- governmental organisations ( NGOs ), private sector as well as students. Su ch programmes include tree planting activities and forest -related research projects. Additionally, the proposed Biodiversity Order will facilitate the implementation of biodiversity conservation and management in the coun try. The proposed Order emphasis es on the importance of biodiversity conservation, bio -prospecting as well as access and benefit sharing that will Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 93 help Brunei Darussalam to sustainably manage its biological resources. PROMOTION OF RESEARCH The Government will continue to collaborate with academic and research institutions in the conduct of flora and faunal research to determine and identify new and unknown species within the natural ecosystems of Brunei Darussalam. The Institute for Biodiversity and Environmental Research (IBER) at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) aims to become a centre of excellence for biodiversity and environmental research, through undertaking innovative research, education and outreach activities in tropical biodiversity and environmental studies. There are two research centres under IB ER, namely the Kuala Belalong Field Studies Centre (KBFSC) in Ulu Temburong National Park, and the Botanical Research Centre i n the UBD campus. The KBFSC is a well -known biodiversity hotspot. Various species new to science have been discovered there inclu ding the tree frog, Leptomantis belalongensis , three mychotererotrophic plants from the new caenogastropod species, Craspedotropis gretathunbergae . International research collaborations, field courses and citizen science projects are regularly held at KBFSC, thus increasing opportunities for scientific discoveries. A well -maintained permanent plot network at KBFSC ensures the long -term monitoring of growth and dynamics of the forest, enabling the effects of climate change to be studie d. The new species discoveries highlight the value of untouched wildernesses like the Ulu Temburong National Park and KBFSC as high conservation value area s, where there are still so many species yet to be discovered. Images (Clockwise from left): Craspedotropis gretathunbergae, Leptomantis belalongensis EFFORTS 7,800 hectare Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park, a declared ASEAN Heritage Park in 1984 in Brunei Darussalam, i s considered both a natural and cultural heritage. The park, which includes catchments of small rivers feeding into Brunei Darussalam 's largest lake, is not only a wildlife sanctuary but also a recreational centre, and a venue for research and education. T his ASEAN Heritage Park is also one of the biggest wildlife sanctuaries in the country and therefore serves as nesting grounds to several rare and endangered species. It is one of Brunei Darussalam 's Important Bird Areas (IBAs) as listed by BirdLife International. To further strengthen the country's efforts in the protection and conservation of forest resources, Brunei Darussalam has pledged 58% of its total land area for the Heart of Borneo (HoB) Initiative. The HoB Initiative is a voluntary transboundary cooperation initiative between the Government of Brunei Darussalam, Republic of Indonesia (Kalimantan) and Malaysia (Sabah and Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 94 Sarawak), to conserve the biodiversity that lies within the HoB for the benefit of the people who re ly upon it. Image: Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park. This is done through the effective management of forest resources and the conservation of a network of protected forest areas, productive forests and other sustainable land uses. In addition, taking the lead within ASEAN, Brunei Darussalam was the first to contri bute to the ASEAN Biodiversity F und, which provides a sustainable financing mechanism to the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity , and ratified the Centre's Establishment Agreement in 2008. Brunei Darussalam has ratified the Convention of Biological Diversity in 2008, becoming its 191st party, through which the Government could further strengthen ongoing conservation efforts and strategies on sustaina ble uses of biological and natural resources in accordance with national and international standards and commitments. The country has also recently become a party to the Asian Forest Cooperation Organiz ation (AFoCO) in 2018. AFoCO aims to strengthen regi onal forest cooperation, undertake projects and translate sound forest policies and proven technologies into action with a mission to rehabilitate degraded forest land and to prevent deforestation and forest degradation in the context of Sustainable Forest Management as well as under the broader scope of addressing the impact of climate change. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 95 A WHOLE OF NATION APPROACH BruWILD In addition to its ' Saving Our Ocean ' project, BruWILD undertakes two other key projects, namely their educational outreach Eco-Pahlawan programme and wildlife Report & Rescue project. BruWILD's Eco -Pahlawan programme engages students, teachers and members of the public in ensuring that the correct principles of biodiversity conservation are communicated and practiced. To date, BruWILD has engaged hundreds of students around the country through various educational roadshows, conferences, and youth group/activities. They hope to extend their work by collaborating with region al partners for greater impact. Image: BruWILD's Eco -Pahlawan programme. Images: BruWILD outreach programme and Eco -Pahlawan programme. Meanwhile, BruWILD's Report & Rescue Program me enables its trained members to carry rescue and rehabilitation work on injured wildlife, many of which are threatened species (such as slow loris and pangolin). BruWILD is hoping to operation alise the Sinaut Wildlife Rescue Cent re with the support of the Wildlife Division of the Ministry of Primary Resources and Tourism in the next five years. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 96 Since the inception of BruWILD's Report and Rescue program me in 2014, BruWILD has been working with the Wildlife Division to end wildlife poaching in Brunei Darussalam . While they do not have authority to apprehend any law breakers, they are able to mediate any reports of wildlife poaching activities reported by members of the public through their hotline. BruWILD will continue to support the Wildlife Divisio n through its Report & Rescue program me. Images: BruWILD Report and Rescue programme . Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 97 Sustainable Development Goal 16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive i nstitutions at all levels Brunei Darussalam, the 'Abode of Peace ', is a country with a small population, strong religious values and a rich heritage of tradition and culture. It is well -known as a peaceful country with its people of different races and religion s living side -by-side in harmony, under the national philosophy of 'Malay Islamic Monarchy '. The Government continues to preserve harmony and prosperity among its people, including by protecting their basic rights and securing access to basic needs. The Government also practises transparent, fair and non -discriminatory policies. In Brunei Darussalam, social harmony is due to strong social values emanating from the importance placed upon family institution s, community support and mutual respect, as well as strong foundation of faith and religion. Social inclusiveness is inherent in Brunei Darussalam 's society . Participation of all walks of life can be seen in various national events and festivities , for instance Bandarku Ceria and the tradition of 'Open House ' visits during cultural celebrations. The celebration of the National Family Day since its inception in 2012 has also focused on the pivotal role of family institutions in maintaining social harmony and integration. Intermarriages between people of different races are historically common in Brunei Darussalam dating as far back as the 14th century15. Moreover, high respect for the elders and 15 The earliest record of inter -racial marriage in Brunei Darussalam was between Princess Ratna Dewi, daughter of Sultan Muhammad Shah of Brunei Darussalam and Ong Sum Ping from China. 16 The Civil Court and the Syariah Court. teachers irrespective of race and religion has always been part of Brunei Darussalam's culture. Elders are always given preferential treatment in public services and Teacher's Day is celebrated yearly with acknowledgement given to teachers for their service and contribution to the society. These tradition s and norms strengthen social harmon y, promote friendship and foster understanding amongst communities in the country. PROTECTION FROM HARM AND INJUSTICE Brunei Darussalam strongly upholds the fundamental principles of human rights. The Government continues to promote and protect human rig hts in the country, through an inter -agency consultative mechanism in cooperation with various non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) as partners. The laws of Brunei Darussalam follow a dual16 legal system where all persons are viewed and treated as equals . The laws are enacted to protect the society against all forms of harm and injustice. Several legislative measures have also been taken to promote and further strengthen the protection of human rights in the country. In addition to the dual penal codes, several laws and legislations have been established towards protecting the vulnerable, preventing violence as well as address ing Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 98 human trafficking and smuggling, such as the Wome n and Girls Protection Act (Cap. 120); Islamic Family Law Act (Cap. 217); Married Women Act (Cap. 190); Children and Young Persons Act (Cap. 219); Preve ntion of People Smuggling Order 2019; and An ti-Trafficking in Persons Order 2019. Government initiatives to prevent violence, especially domestic violence, are supported by a numbe r of charitable and welfare NGOs , whereas protection and support for victims of violence are provided primarily by the Government through the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports (MCYS). Despite being one of many countries with laws on the death penalty, there has been a de facto moratorium on its execution in Brunei Darussalam. The Government strongly believes that every individual should be given the opportunity to repent and the criminal justice system works to ensure that criminals are afforded a chance to rehabilitate through a comprehensive in -care and after care system. Law enforcement measures have continued to be strengthened , notwithstanding the low crime rate in the count ry. Between 2014 and 2017, there was a decrease of 17.1% from 4,128 to 3,424 criminal cases handled by the Royal Brunei Police Force (RBPF) . The tradition of upholding strong family institution s and a holistic education system provid es important early inte rventions in mitigating crimes in Brunei Darussalam. The ability to access justice is a crucial component of securing peaceful, just and inclusive societies where effective and accountable institutions govern a t all levels. 17 \"In an industrial undertaking or in an undertaking which is an industrial undertaking\" The Syariah Court in May 2018 commenced the implementation of the Sulh or reconciliation process for family cases as a form of alternative dispute resolution that is private, less formal and speedier than court litigation. The implementation of the Sulh has shown positive results, wit h 61% of cases settled through the Majlis Sulh in 2018. While the mediation process remains voluntary in Brunei Darussalam, the civil courts have seen an increase in the number of cases being mediated before accredited mediators where in 2019, a total of 14 cases have been referred for mediation in the High Court , with two out of three cases having been successfully mediated. ENSURING THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD Brunei Darussalam recognises children as a valuable asset to the country and their vulnerabilit y to manifestations of socio - economic problems and violence. As such, the Special Committee on Family Institution s, Women and Children has approved the National Plan of Action on Children which has two strategic focus: i) To ensure policies and legislations that meet the needs of the children are in place ; and ii) To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social services for children. This demonstrates the country's commitment to formulating and implementing focused strategies and interventions on improvi ng the rights of the child. The rights of the child are enforced through various legislations applicable to all citizens and residents of the country . The amendment to Sect ion 103 of the Employment Order 2009 prohibit s children from being employed in any industrial undertaking17. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 99 Meanwhile, the Penal Code (Cap. 22) provides protection for children against any sexual exploitations and was further amended in 2017 to broaden the definition of rape, and to enhance penalties and punishments for various offences against a woman or children under 14 years of age. As the lead agency on the Convention on the Rights of the Child , the MCYS works closely with other g overnment agencies, including the RBPF, Ministry of Health (MOH), and Ministry of Education (MOE) , to ensure all complaints received, including of child abuse, are addressed immediately and effectively. The Government has also set up hotlines as a form of direct communicat ion with the public, specifically children. Since 2006, the Government has put in place 'Talian Kebajikan 141', a public hotline to provide information and receive complaints about social issues as well as provide immediate advice by trained officials. The calls are registered in accordance with the requirements of Child Helpline International. In 2019, the MCYS , together with telecommunications provider TelBru (now known as Imagine) , launched another hotl ine intended specifically for children called 'Talian ANAK 121', 'Talian ANAK 121' aims to provide a safe platform for children to speak, express their feelings and report issues anonymously and witho ut fear. Through this system, urgent cases will be immediately forwarded to and urgently handled by specific parties. Since its launch in October 2019, the hotline has received approximately 9,867 calls (as of March 2020). In late 2019, to further strengthen national inter-agency collaboration on child protection, Brunei Darussalam began formulating a National Framework on Child Protection (NFCP) , which is expected to be completed in July 2020 . Activities and progress under the NFCP will be presented to the Special Committee on Family Institution s, Women and Children under the National Council on Social Issues . Key outputs under the NFCP are expected to be: i) The production of evidence -based assessment tools, which include sector - specific screening guidelines and a child abuse reporting guideline, that can be used by relevant agencies involved in child protection; and ii) A national database or Register of Children and Young Persons in Need of Protection , which will maintain the records of those who need or may need protection. This register will facilitate inter-agency monitoring of such individuals and ensure the timely administration of necessary interventions . PREVENTION OF TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS Trafficking in P ersons (TIPs) is a gra ve violation of human rights, in which women and children are the most vulnerable victims. The Government has enacted various legislations such as the Preve ntion of People Smuggl ing Order 2019, An ti-Trafficking in Persons Order 2019 as well as the Women and Girls Protection Act (Cap. 120) to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights, especially women and children. To finance the cost of repatriation of smuggled persons and trafficked persons or such other purposes, Brunei Darus salam has also established the ' Anti-Trafficking in Persons Fund' . In recent years, the Government has made progress in its anti -trafficking law Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 100 enforcement efforts by enhancing the capacity of p rosecutors and law enforcement agencies through inter -agency coordination, regional and international training programmes and workshops , including those organised by ASEAN, as well as technical assistance. The Human Trafficking Investigation Unit (HTU) of the RBPF has increased its efforts by screening for human trafficking indicators in cases involving prostitution, unpaid wages, runaway workers, or labour abuse. The HTU also receives referral cases from other agencies on potential cases of TIPs. Prosecutions for non -trafficking offences, such as human smuggling or labour violations and offences under the Women and Girls Protection Act (Cap . 120), came as a result of HTU investigations. To protect victims of TIPs, Brunei Darussalam has expanded victim protection measu res during judicial proceedings and carried out victim screening procedures as well as strengthened investigations into alleged labour abuses that amount to trafficking. In 2016, the country introduced a legislative amendment to Section 236B of the Criminal Procedure Code which allows victims to provide evidence through live video or live television link in any inquiry, trial, appeal or proceedings if the court is satisfied that it is expedient in the interest of justice. Five Technology Courts were set up at a cost of B$4.5 million that are equipped with a computer system as well as audio -visual equipment , including a computer based recording facility which allows oral testimony to be digitally recorded. Such facilities afford due protection to trafficking victims whilst also encouraging them to testify against traffickers. Standardised interview guidelines are also used to screen and identify poten tial human trafficking victims i n oper ations with suspected TIPs elements. Brunei Darussalam has continued its prevention efforts through training programmes for labour and immigration officials as well as NGOs. Awareness campaigns have been conducted on offences and penalties under immigrat ion, passports, labour trafficking and smuggling of persons related laws. The MCYS continues its role in the promotion and protection of women and children rights by providing shelter and care to victims of TIPs. Plans are underway for the development of a new shelter, a place of safety, due to be completed in 2021. This shelter will emphasi se a home environment and aim to provide victims of abuse and those in need of protection with a greater feeling of safety, security and home comfort. Given the gravit y of TIPs ' issues , Brunei Darussalam has been actively engaged in international efforts in addressing this global concern. Brunei Darussalam has been collaborating with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and participated in various regional as well a s international meetings relating to issues concerning people smuggling, TIPs and transnational crime. Brunei Darussalam has ratified the ASEAN Convention Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which came into force for Brun ei Dar ussalam on 24 April 2020. On 14 November 2017, Brunei Darussalam signed the ASEAN Consensus on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers. In 2020, Brunei Darussalam has acceded to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 101 Women and Children, s upplementing the United Nations Conventi on Against Transnational Organized Crime . In promoting human rights within the regional context, Brunei Darussalam provides annual contributions to the ASE AN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) Fund and contribut es to the development of AICHR Thematic Studies including on legal aid. Brunei Darussalam is currently working with other ASEAN Member States on Thematic Studies on the Right to Education, Right to Peace, the Right to Life and Juvenile Justice. PROVISION OF LEGAL IDENTITY Brunei Darussalam has a policy of single nationality and does not recognise dual nationality. It also does not permit cessation of Bruneian nationality if the person has no other national status. The Birth s and Deaths Registration Act (Cap. 79) and the National Registratio n Act (Cap. 19), which require the registration of all persons within a predetermined period, provide the necessary measures for the Government in the provision of legal identity. The Brunei Nationality Act (Cap. 15) provides the acquisition for either a Bruneian father or mother to obtain nationality for their children. The said Act outlines that non- nationals, including stateless people, who are permanent residents, can be naturalised subject to the fulfilment of cer tain criteria, including period of d omiciliation, fluency in Malay L anguage and knowledge of Bruneian culture and tradition. Between 2015 and 2019, 1,926 persons were granted citizenship. The Government issues its stateless residents , including those with permanent resident status , with a Certificate of Identity to assist them to travel abroad and return to the country. The Government ensures inclusive application of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Cap. 79), which provides that all children, including stateless children, who are born in the territory should have their births registered and that relevant statistics are kept. Relevant authorities in Brunei Darussalam are further committed to carry out country - wide awareness campaigns relating to birth and death registration, as well as immigration and nationality matters. Awareness programmes on the Births a nd Deaths Registration Act (Cap. 79) and its Regulations to the Heads of Mukims and Chiefs of Villages were recently implemented in 2018 and early 2020 . PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS Brunei Darussalam recognises the importance of effective, accountable and transparent institutions towards its development as well as achievement of the 2030 Agenda. Service delivery, both in the public and private sector, is one of the key focus areas in its Wawasan Brunei 2035 . In strengthening its efforts towards combating corruption and bribery, the Prevention of Corruption Act was revi sed in 2019 . The Anti -Corruption Bureau (ACB) , established back in 1982, enforces the said enactment. The ACB has taken steps to continuously improve skills and capacity building of its officers in the areas of prevention and investigation of corruption cases and offences which fall under the said Act. The trainings also include cross -border corruption investigations using the latest methods and best practices on effective methodologies in eradicatin g corruption and prevention strategies. The Penal Code was amended in October 2018 to introduce higher penalties for criminal breach of trust. Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 102 Brunei Darussalam became a State Party when it signed the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2003 and ratified the Convention in December 2008 . The provision of laws , such as Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Order 2005 and Criminal Asset Recovery Order 2012 , enhances and facilitates the cooperation of investigations undertaken with the assistance of foreign countries to track offenders and the procurement of bribes brought and concealed abroad. The Bureau is also taking steps to strengthen bilateral relations with anti -corruption agencies in neighbouring countries through exchange of information and assistance in relation to corruption including money laundering and proceeds of crimes of corruption . These efforts, among others, have led to an improvement in B runei Darussalam's rankings in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) in 2019, whereby it jumped from the 41st rank in 2016 to the 35th rank in 2019 and was the 2nd least corrupt nation in ASEAN. Government expenditure for ministries and departments are published annually, whereby budget proposals are deliberated publicly in the annual Legislative Council meetings. National policies and development plans are also discussed during those meetings . Towards fulfilling the public needs for its services, the Government implements the Client's Charter ( Tekad Pemedulian Orang Ramai - TPOR) , which is one of the main strategies intended to facilitate ministries and departments to improve the quality of their service delivery. Monitored by the Management Services Department (MSD) of the Prime Minister's Office , TPOR is a statement or a written commitment by a department of the service/ product standard to be delivered, allow ing the public to know clearly and accurately the service quality rendered by that particular department. Additionally, the Public Sector Performance Grading Programme is an instrument to assess and measure a Civil Service Organis ation's performance level as one of the efforts towards improvement, efficiency, performance efficacy, productivity and quality of service delivery. The Governmen t has also introduced a platform for the public to provide feedback on the quality of service delivery. The Customer Satisfaction Survey in the Public Sector (Kajian Selidik Tumpuan Pelanggan - KSTP ) acts as a check and balance in order to ensure that the public perspectives on the effectiveness of service delive ry are consistent with that of g overnment agencies. Image: The KSTP done electronically at one of the government service counters. The 34 g overnment agencies which have been selected for the purposes of carrying out the KSTP are mainly agencies which frequently provide services to the general public. Continuous biannual monitoring is carried out two -fold by the identified agencies and by the MSD.

Brunei Darussalam's Voluntary National Review Report at the 2020 United Nations High -Level Political Forum | 109 Conclusion Brunei Darussalam recognises that achieving sustainable development requires concerted efforts, both from the Government and non -government stakeholders. Underpinning such effort s is a requirement to have a dynamic and sustainable economic growth that is envisioned in its Wawasan Brunei 2035 . Whilst the country's diversification initiatives have begun to bear fruit, there is a need to accelerate the growth of its Non -oil and Gas Sector. This necessitates further development of the country's private sector by encouraging more innovative entrepreneurs and continuing to attract FDI in its priority sectors. The Government reaffirms its commitment to increase the economic empowerment and participation of all segments of the society including the youth, women, differently abled and the disadvantaged. Boosting modern infrastructures such as quality roads, electricity and telecommunication are necessary enablers to economic and social growth. In addition, accelerating initiatives to build a skilful work force is very important , not only to match the industry need s, but also for the population to be future ready particularly in the context of the 4th Industrial Revolution and digital economy. Brunei Darussalam continues to undertake efforts to enhance the health and welfare of its citizens, through the further st rengthening of its national health system and service in a coordinated and cohesive manner as outlined in the Ministry of Health's Strategic Plan (2019 -2023) .

The Sistem K ebajikan Negara , expected to be operational by July this year, will create a comprehensive and centralised national welfare system that will ensure assistance is given to those who are in need. In order to have a complete understanding of the country's progress in achieving the 2030 Agenda, it will seek to further identify gaps in and availability of its SDGs data and strengthen mechanisms for monitoring and reporting progress for the SDGs. Brunei Darussalam looks forward to learning and benefiting from other countries' experiences in their implementation of the SDGs.
