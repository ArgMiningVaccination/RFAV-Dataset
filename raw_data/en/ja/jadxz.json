So she headed to grad school where she met her future business partner Dr. Ervina Wu. Both co-founders of [Yina](https://yina.co/), a luxury skincare line, grew up immersed in Chinese culture practicing yang sheng (nourish life), \"the art of self-care, promoting longevity and vitality by nurturing the body, mind, and spirit.\" \"Like the jade roller and gua sha, the concept of yang sheng encompasses a lot of buzz right now but they're all rooted in a 2,500-year old Chinese philosophy,\" says Gray. At its essence, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is rooted in breaking down the calendar based on when farmers plant, harvest goods, and nourish the soil. These patterns determine what one should ingest and apply to the body\u2014and when. \"It's 24 notes that follow the rhythm of the year and seasonal eating, and what you put in soups, broths and your self-care,\" says Gray. For Dr. Wu, TCM struck a stronger, personal chord after its practices helped her through cancer treatments. She left the world of venture capital to pursue a PhD in TCM and clinical training in autoimmune disease. She is also a certified dermatologist. \"She studied Chinese Medicine while diagnosed with a very malignant type of breast cancer,\" recalls Gray. \"I still remember her wearing a headscarf while seeing patients after going through chemotherapy which was amazing of her.\" After three years of R&D, the duo invested $30,000 in personal savings to launch Yina in 2016, featuring products sustainably made in California with organic and powerful bio-adaptive botanicals. They rented a 10 x 14 square-foot room in Berkeley where they honed in on key formulas for body oils and treatment balms. True to its roots in TCM and backed by science, Yina leverages ingredients like camellia seed oil, safflower oil, licorice root, tea seeds, tea leaves and flower extracts. They later expanded the collection with botanical serums, mists and masks that tap the cleansing powers of Moringa and coconut carbon, while softening with real pearl powder. \"We address skin conditions based on medicinal ways of doing things that also happen to help with softening fine lines and helping with the skin's glow,\" says Gray. The duo doctors of Chinese Medicine have not invested in marketing or advertising, but there were larger blockades to growth. \"Retailers tend to carry white-owned brands over us, even when they claim to support diverse brands, they rarely stock more than 20% of BiPOC-owned brands,\" says Wu. \"We have been approached by a few Chinese Medicine brands for so-called partnerships. These brands literally wanted our ideas and products for free, and they also happened to be owned by white founders with no qualifications in Chinese Medicine. When we called them out, they ghosted us.\" Says Gray: \"It was hard when we first started because we were talking about foreign Chinese medicine and there was always a backlash about Chinese-based things. So when we approached bigger retailers it was hard to get the conversation going.\" Buyers from high-end department and specialty beauty stores said they already carried an East Asian brand and that was enough. Others attached an automatic stigma to things made in China, even though all Yina products are made in California. \"At the end it was good everyone said no because it helped us focus on our DTC strategy,\" says Gray. Despite the slow and steady path to growth (as well as the forces working against them), Yina hit momentum in 2019 when they saw 40% year-over-year growth, then 45% in 2020. \"We grew during the pandemic because people were at home focusing on self-care rituals more than ever,\" she says. They grew through word of mouth, organic social media, and favorable press from the beauty editors. They also rely on a network of top TCM practitioners who carry and sell Yina. For the cofounders, it was the perfect formula for building a loyal fanbase, with a 40% retention rate. Yina also provides holistic solutions and education to guide one through personalized rituals, with a focus on demystifying Chinese medicine. Gray explains why demystification is an important facet of their platform. \"[TCM] uses a foreign language and people have a misconception that you can only get TCM from a Chinatown herbal shop when you really can go to a certified modern clinic for treatments.\" She adds that marketplaces like Amazon sell inauthentic formulas and Yina aims to be a credible resource. \"We are here to demystify and share beautiful stories of Chinese medicine, an important part of our culture,\" says Dr Wu. This aspect of their mission has resonated more than ever since the start of Covid-19, which sparked a wave of violence against the Asian American Pacific Islander community. Last month they hosted a masterclass with beauty influencer Renee Chow @Gothamista and donated 100% of proceeds to [Stop AAPI Hate](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Ug-gCERKo3tBj6nnHNZpSo?domain=stopaapihate.org). \"We need to help grassroots organizations and write laws to protect our community,\" say Wu. On April 18, Yina will host another [Gua Sha masterclass](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/UWZfCG6wq3fw9LqqS7QYZS?domain=eventbrite.com) where 50% of proceeds will go to [Rise.Now](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/N4q1CJ6Ew3fxoQyyczsCKG?domain=risenow.us), an organization founded by Forbes Under 30 alumna Amanda Nguyen. In addition to better representation on shelves, Gray and Dr. Wu say the media, beauty, fashion, and wellness industries should question if they are doing their part to empower AAPI culture. Says Dr. Wu, \"For starters, stop using the term 'oriental medicine,' it's Chinese Medicine or East Asian Medicine. They also should question if they are commodifying or exoticizing our culture and traditions.\" For instance, they noticed many companies profiting from the gua sha boom in the U.S. The company created a gua sha made of bian stone, rich with 30 minerals and components. It's shaped larger and differently to allow for gua sha on not just the face but the entire body\u2014which was the original art of gua sha. \"Gua sha is for everyone,\" says Gray, \"but if you're a person or business using it as a selling point then it's your responsibility to acknowledge its roots. This tool is based on thousands of years of history that was used for microcirculation and better lymphatic drainage. Give credit to its origins in China and how it was popularized across South Asia. It's very much rooted in "}
