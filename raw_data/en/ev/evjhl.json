Ideally it's always best to [buy essential oils](https://www.up-nature.com/collections/essential-oils) from an organic source that are labeled as \"Therapeutic grade,\" meaning they are free of toxins and chemicals and are unfiltered and undiluted. Also beware of genetically modified ingredients and choose Non GMO essential oils.
