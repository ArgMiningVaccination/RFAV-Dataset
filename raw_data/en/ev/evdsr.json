Bottom lineStrider are heralded as pioneers in the balance bike world. The 12\" Sport is probably the most popular model available. It's definitely been responsible for initiating a love of cycling and for training many toddlers to ride a real bike without the aid of training wheels. It does seem critical to mention that a German laboratory found excessive amounts of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphthalene in the Strider Sport's rubberized grips. These substances are suspected to be carcinogenic. With increased awareness, it seems likely that Strider will replace these with a safer substance. In the meanwhile, you will want to replace them by yourself. Weight and cost are kept low by using bushings instead of bearings and solid foam tires instead of inflatable rubber. However, these tires are accused of being slippery on certain surfaces and in the presence of the slightest moisture, causing slips and accidents. This led some parents to see the Sport as overpriced. Despite this - and even though reviews seem to be duplicated across many websites - it does seem that the Strider Sport has received many glowing reviews.
