INTRODUCTION Nineteen ninety-one marked the forty-fifth anniversary of the ver- dict in the International Military Tribunal's trial at Nuremberg of leading officials of the Third Reich.' The Tribunal's decision is con- sidered a historic landmark which exerted a major influence on the substance and spirit of Anglo-American and international jurisprudence.2 Following the Nuremberg case, the United States undertook the prosecution of an array of lower-echelon Nazi leaders, military officers, and major industrialists in twelve separate prosecutions. These twelve decisions applied and extended the Nuremberg principles and made a substantial contribution to the development of the corpus of international criminal law. Yet, virtually no comprehensive discussion of these cases exists in the legal literature.' This essay first outlines the decision of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg and then sketches the twelve post-Nuremberg decisions.4 The concluding section provides a summary of the legal principles established by these tribunals. II. THE LEIPZIG AND NUREMBERG TRIALS A.

It suggested that each Allied Power should take responsibility for prosecuting prisoners-of-war and those accused over whom they had custody. It recommended that a multinational tribunal appointed by the Allied Powers and their associated states should be charged with adjudicating those whose actions victimized nationals of more than one country. This international tribunal also should assume jurisdiction over high-echelon officials who ordered or failed to halt the commission of war crimes and also over those not prosecuted before national courts. In carrying out these prosecutions, the tribunal should apply \"the principles of the law of nations as they result from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience.\", These unprecedented recommendations toward the creation of a new world order floundered on the shoals of politics.8 The United States objected to what it viewed as a significant incursion on the prerogatives of state sovereignty.9 The Americans particularly objected to the creation 5.

The commission condemned the Central Power's war of ag- gression, but did not recommend prosecution for those who designed and ordered such military action. It urged that in the future that penal sanctions should be lodged against those responsible for such grave outrages against the elementary principles of international law. This recomendation was based on the lack of positive law regulating States' deployment of force. In addition, the complexity and time-consuming nature of such an investigation would consume time and attention and detract from the prosecution of those responsible for violations of the laws and customs of war. Pun- ishment inevitably would be tardily imposed and would lack moral potency. Id. at 119-20. 7. Id. at 121-22. 8. Violations of the law of war traditionally were punished through the use of reprisals or the payment of compensation. Following the termination of hostilities, peace treaties incorporated clauses providing for the amnesty of those chargeed with offenses against the law of war. See Lippman, supra note 1, at 2-3. 9. See Memorandum of Reservations Presented by the Representatives of the United States[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG of a multinational tribunal'\u00b0 empowered to apply the novel and vague principles of humanity.\" The United States also disagreed with ab- rogating the act of state doctrine and permitting an international tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over heads of state. '2 According to the Americans, sovereigns were only legally and politically accountable to those within their domestic constituency.'3 The Americans expressed the need to strictly define the circumstances under which high-echelon officials would be held liable for a failure to take affirmative acts to prevent violations of the laws or customs of war.'4 The Allied leaders reached a compromise. In Article 227 of the Treaty of Versailles, the Allied Powers and associated states accused William II of Hohenzollern (\"Kaiser Wilhelm\") of a \"supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties.\" ' A \"special\" multinational tribunal composed of representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan was to \"try the accused.\"''6 Article 227 did not charge the Kaiser with an international crime; however, it brought a political charge which technically preserved the Kaiser's legal immunity.7 The Germans accused of having committed acts in violation of the laws and customs of war were to be brought before military tribunals.'8 In the end, the Germans were not held internationally liable for war crimes. The Dutch bowed to pressure from European conservatives and refused to extradite the Kaiser to stand trial. The Allies developed a fear that war crimes trials would create domestic unrest and destabilize the German government and, in the end, agreed that the Germans should prosecute forty-five individuals.9 Predictably, the Germans had to the Report of the Commission on Responsibilities, Apr. 4, 1919, Annex II, reprinted in 14 AM.

Some were acquitted,0 others received lenient sentences2 and the vast majority of the cases were dropped.22 Those convicted eventually had their convictions annulled.3 The Versailles Treaty signified the resolve of the international community to hold personally liable those accused of violations of the laws and customs of war. The public \"arraignment\" of the Kaiser for offenses against \"international morality and the sanctity of treaties\" was a step towards the abrogation of the act of state doctrine and the imposition of criminal liability upon governmental leaders.14 Ultimately this effort was frustrated by the continuing hold of sovereign immunity and nationalistic sentiment. The Allies' resolve to vindicate the rule of international law was tainted by their decision to focus exclusively on offenses committed by enemy forces. In addition, by vesting jurisdiction over war crimes in national courts, the Versailles Treaty failed to establish that such offenses were directed against the international com- munity rather than against individual countries. B. The Nuremberg Trial The promise of Versailles was fulfilled at Nuremberg. On Sep- tember 30, 1945, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg convicted nineteen high-echelon German leaders of Crimes Against Peace, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.25 20.

Seven defendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from ten years to life (Doenitz, Funk, Hess, von Neurath and von Schirach) and twelve were sentenced to death by hanging (Borman who was tried in 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG The Tribunal determined that its jurisdiction was based upon the law of the Nuremberg Charter.26 According to the Tribunal, the Allies clearly possessed the right to legislate for those occupied territories which were under their control. The provisions of the Charter were not an arbitrary exercise of power. They were an \"expression of international law existing at the time of [the Charter's] creation.' '27 The Tribunal did not directly address whether the war of aggression charge violated the legal maxim nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine lege (no punishment without a law). It recognized that although the prohibition on ex post facto punishment was a general principle of justice, it was not a restraint on the sovereign prerogative of States.8 The Tribunal proposed that in this instance, it was not unjust to punish those who \"in defiance of treaties and assurances\" have attacked neighboring states without warning.29 The defendants were clearly aware Three were acquitted: Schacht, von Papen, and Fritzche. Id. at 588-89. Article 6(a) of the Nuremberg Charter defined Crimes Against Peace: (a) Crimes against peace: Namely, planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing.

Therefore, they must have known that their actions were \"wrong, and so far from it being unjust to punish [them], it would be unjust if [their] wrong were allowed to go unpunished.\"30 The Tribunal rejected that international law was solely concerned with actions of sovereign states and provided no punishment for in- dividuals. It proclaimed that the proposition that \"international law imposes duties and liabilities upon individuals as well as upon states has long been recognized.\"'3' In addition, the requirements of inter- national law take precedence over the demands of domestic law. The \"very essence of the Charter is that individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience imposed by the individual state. \"32 The Tribunal rejected the act of state defense and held that individuals are criminally liable under international law regardless of their station or rank. It was held that \"[h]e who violates the laws of war cannot obtain immunity while acting in pursuance of the authority of the state, if the state in authorizing action moves outside its competence under international law.\"'33 The Tribunal also held that superior orders did not constitute a defense. However, such orders would mitigate punishment where an individual was under the threat of imminent harm.4 30. Id. The Kellog-Briand Pact of 1928 was signed by 63 states including Germany. Article 1 required States to settle their disputes by pacific means. Article 2 condemned the recourse to war for the solution of international disputes.

The Pact did not include a penal provision. The Tribunal, however, argued that the solemn denunciation of war as an instrument of national policy necessarily involves the prop- osition that an aggressive war is illegal under international law. TRIAL OF THE MAJOR WAR CRIMINALS, supra note 25, at 463. In the absence of an international legislature, the Tribunal contended that international law must be interpreted in a dynamic fashion. \"[The] law is not static, but by continual adaptation follows the needs of a changing world.

The Tribunal next elaborated upon the substantive offenses punishable under the Charter. Article 6(a) defined Crimes Against Peace defined in Article 6(e) of the Nuremberg Charter.3The aggressive war charge was the foun- dation for the Nuremberg trial. It is \"the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.' '36 The consequences of a war of aggression are not merely confined to the belligerents, but \"affect the whole world.\"37 However, the Tribunal provided little guidance on the amount, duration and character of the force which must be deployed to constitute a war of aggression in violation of international law. It merely noted that the \"aggressive designs of the Nazi Government were not accidents arising out of the immediate political situation in Europe and the world; they were a deliberate and essential part of Nazi foreign policy.''38 Involvement in the planning, implementation and waging of a war of aggression or administration of occupied ter- ritories constituted liability under the aggressive war charge.9 The Tribunal rejected the contention that any significant partic- ipation in the affairs of the Nazi Party or Government was evidence of participation in a criminal plan or conspiracy to wage an aggressive war. It ruled that only those who participated in the formulation or refinement of a concrete plan to wage a war of aggression were liable criminal law of most nations, is not the existence of the order, but whether moral choice was in fact possible.

The Tribunal has decided that certain of the defendants planned and waged aggressive wars against twelve nations, and were therefore guilty of this series of crimes.

Only those acts committed following the beginning of the war in 1939 fell within the terms of the Charter.

The Tribunal rejected that Germany was no longer bound by the rules of land warfare in many of the territories occupied during the war because Germany had completely subjugated and incorporated them into the German Reich.

In any such case, Article 10 also provided that the criminal nature of the group or organization need not be provided de novo in subsequent war crimes trials.50 The Tribunal ruled that a criminal organization is analogous to a criminal conspiracy in that the essence of both is cooperation for criminal purposes. In order to be declared criminal, a group must have been formed or used in connection with the commission of crimes denounced by the Charter. The Tribunal determined that membership alone was not sufficient to impose criminal liability upon individuals. Any declaration of criminality would exclude persons who had no knowledge of the criminal purposes or acts of the organization and those who were conscripted into the organization, unless they were personally implicated in the commission of criminal acts.51 The Nuremberg trials provided the precedent relied upon by all subsequent post-World War II war crimes trials.52 III. THE OTHER NUREMBERG A second International Military Tribunal was anticipated for the purpose of prosecuting Nazi industrialists. However, it was determined that all subsequent proceedings would be heard by Allied national courts within occupied Germany.53 The Allied Control Council of Germany issued Control Council Law No. 10 which was intended to \"establish a uniform legal basis in Germany for the prosecution of war criminals and other similar offenders, other than those dealt with by the International Military 49.

Prosecution was also not barred by any amnesty, immunity or pardon which may have been granted by the Nazi regime.65 Other provisions dealt with arrangements for the extradition of offenders and witnesses.66 54.

A total of twelve indictments [were] filed. These may be classified as denoting the activities of (a) Industrialists, (b) Military Leaders, (c) The SS and its affiliates and (d) The Reich Ministries. Falling under group (a) and generally considered as the most politically significant cases, are the trials of the Directors and Officials of the I.G. Farben Chemical Trust, the Krupp Munitions Trust, and the Flick Combine which dominated the coal, iron and steel industries. In group (b), Field Marshal Ehrhart Milch, Goering's Deputy in charge of the German Luftwaffe, was tried for the use and misuse of slave labor and for inhumane medical experiments performed upon Jews and Poles. Also prosecuted were a group of military officers headed by Field Marshal Wilhelm List, charged with responsibility for the murder of hostages and civilians in the Balkans, and another group of Field Marshals and Generals charged generally with preparing, planning and waging aggressive war. Under group (c) are included the trials of medical doctors and surgeons for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the performance of so-called \"medical experiments\" upon human beings; the Main Economic and Administrative Department of the SS, commonly known as the W.V.H.A. which supervised the operations and administration of concentration camps; the R.S.H.A. or Race and Resettlement Division, and the Einsatz Commandos, who were special SS extermination units. Under group (d) or Ministries cases, a number of judges and prosecutors who were officials of the Ministry of Justice and the notorious People's court and Special Courts, were prosecuted in a single trial which resulted in significant convictions of lawyers and judges who committed miscellaneous war crimes by perverting the German legal and court system.

He was later named Plenipotentiary General for Armaments and a member of the Central Planning Board.69 The Tribunal acquitted Speer and ruled that Speer's activities in charge of German armament production were in aid of the war effort in the same way that other productive enterprises aid in the waging of war; but the Tribunal is not prepared to find that such activities involve engaging in the common plan to wage aggressive war.70 The Speer precedent guided post-Nuremberg tribunals in their adju- dication of. German industrialists.7 The Americans conducted three major trials of corporate leaders. These involved the executives of the chemical firm I.G. Farben,72 the steel and armament giant Krupp3 and the Flick conglomerate.74 The tribunals explicitly proclaimed that international criminal law bound both civilians and the military. It is asserted that international law is a matter wholly outside the work, interest, and knowledge of private individuals. The distinction is unsound. International law, as such, binds every citizen just as does ordinary municipal law. Acts adjudged criminal when done by an officer of the government are criminals also when done by a private individual. The guilt differs only in magnitude, not in quality. The offender in either case is charged with personal wrong and punishment falls on the offender in propria persona. The application of 69.

There is no justification for a limitation of responsibility to public officials.75 In the Farben Case, the defendants were indicted for conspiracy to wage and participate in the planning, preparation and waging of a war of aggression.76 I.G. Farben knowingly participated in a secret arma- ment program designed to \"achieve a degree of military might which would make Germany invincible.\" The firm cooperated with the Reich in developing a broad raw material base to permit the waging of aggressive war. It planned and operated huge plants and facilities for the production of synthetic gasoline, oil, buna rubber, nitrogen and light metals. However, the Tribunal ruled that participating in the rearmament of Germany was not a crime unless carried out, or par- ticipated in, with knowledge that it was part of a plan or was intended to be used in waging aggressive war.78 The Tribunal ruled that there was no general knowledge in Ger- many that Hitler was planning a series of aggressive wars. The de- fendants thus could not be presumed to have been aware of Hider's military aspirations.'9 The \"average citizen of Germany, be he pro- fessional man, farmer, or industrialist, could scarcely be charged by these events with knowledge that the rulers of the Reich were planning to plunge Germany into a war of aggression.''8 The Farben tribunal also rejected the argument that the defendants should have been alerted to Germany's military plans by the pace of German rearmament. The defendants were not military experts and could not be expected to distinguish between the amount of armaments required for a defensive as opposed to an aggressive war.81 The Tribunal thus concluded that the defendants did not possess \"specific knowledge\" of Hitler's plans:82 75.

The evidence falls far short of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that their endeavors and activities were undertaken and carried out with the knowledge that they were thereby pre- paring Germany for participation in an aggressive war or wars that had already been planned either generally or specifically by Adolf Hitler and his immediate circle of Nazi civil and military fanatics.83 The Farben panel commented that the International Military Tri- bunal fixed the \"standard of participation high among those who lead their country into war.''84 Consequently, it is not a crime under in- ternational law for ordinary citizens of a State which has launched an aggressive attack to support their country's military efforts. The Tri- bunal feared that extension of liability to ordinary citizens would \"lead far afield.\"'85 There would be no practical limitation on criminal re- sponsibility that would not include, \"on principle, the private soldier on the battlefield, the farmer who increased his production of foodstuffs to sustain the armed forces, or the housewife who conserved fats for the making of munitions.' '86 Under such a principle, \"the entire man- power of Germany could, at the uncontrolled discretion of the indicting authorities, be held to answer for waging wars of aggression. This would, indeed, result in the possibility of mass punishment.\"8 Once having initiated such prosecutions, \"it is difficult to find a logical place to draw the line between the guilty and the innocent among the great mass of German people.\"a Such a precedent would require ordinary citizens to comprehend the complexity of international law and to determine in the heat of moment whether their country was in violation Despite strong inferences to be drawn from much of the evidence as applied to some of the individual defendants, as to intent and knowledge, the extraordinary standard of proof which probably should be exacted in this stage of th development of the crime against peace is not clearly met and, for this reason, I concur in the acquittals under count one to charges of planning and preparation of aggressive war.

This would place individuals in the untenable position of choosing between patriotism and treason.89 Given that the Farben defendants did not participate in the planning nor knowingly participate in the preparation and initiation of the waging of a war of aggression, the Tribunal ruled they could not be held liable for involvement in a \"common plan or conspiracy to do these same things. \"90 Industrialists were also charged with plunder and spoilation of occupied territories in contravention of the laws of war.91 The Krupp panel noted that the laws of war place strict limitations on a belligerent's right to appropriate such private and public assets based on the rationale that a country's economic resources should not be used to assist the enemy.92 The existing property relations in a country must be re- spected.93 The major exception to this prohibition on the appropriation of resources of an occupied territory is that such resources may be seized to support the army of occupation. The requisition of goods such as houses and equipment, however, may not supersede the excess economic capacity of the occupied territory.94 An occupying power may also expropriate property in order to maintain public order and safety.95 In the Krupp Case it was noted that acts of plunder of the occupied territories were committed in various fashions. Many of the acts of plunder were committed in a most manifest and direct way, namely, through physical removal of machines and materials. Other acts were committed through changes of corporate property, contractual transfer of property rights, and the like. It is the results that count, and though the results in the latter case were achieved through \"contracts\" imposed upon others, the illegal results, namely, the deprivation of property, was achieved just as though materials had been physically shipped to Germany.96 89.

'99 The fact that Krupp claimed that it was acting as an agent of the German government, according to the Tribunal, did not absolve the firm from liability. 00 The concept relied upon by the defendants-namely: that an aggressor may first over-run enemy territory, and then after- wards industrial firms from within the aggressor's country may swoop over the occupied territory and utilize property there-is utterly alien to the laws and customs of warfare... and is clearly declared illegal by them because. ..requisitions may be made only for the needs of, and on the authority of, the army of occupation.'01 The Tribunal rejected the contention that these acts of spoilation could be justified as an emergency measure.

The inmates worked without any morning meal, and for 12 hours with only one bowl of soup which they received at noon. Their food was so poor that they sought remains of food and begged for scraps of food. They fought each other for the left-over soup, which the other foreign workers had left or rejected despite the limited amount of food made available to them .... The inmates were also beaten. because they did not properly perform the work to which they were assigned, as a result of not knowing how to work the machines.

Con- ferences were had between the competent plant managers and the members of the SS during which the matter of punishing the concentration camp inmates was discussed. The housing furnished to the concentration camp inmates was most in- adequate, and the lives of the inmates were in danger as the plant was not furnished with proper air raid shelters for the workers. During air raids, the concentration camp inmates had to remain in the plant while other employees were per- mitted to leave it.'9 103. Id.

The defendants in the Krupp Case contended that production quotas were established by the Reich and that given the labor shortage, they were forced to make use of prisoners of war, concentration camp inmates and involuntary labor from the occupied territories. They argued that had they \"refused to do so, they would have suffered dire consequences at the hands of the government authorities who exercised rigid super- vision over their activities, in every respect.\"10 The defendants in the Krupp Case unsuccessfully sought to rely on the defense of necessity to justify their use of forced labor.\"' The Tribunal ruled that the defendants were not acting under compulsion: \"the competent and credible evidence leaves no doubt that in com- mitting the acts here charged as crimes, the guilty individuals were not acting under compulsion or coercion exerted by the Reich authorities within the meaning of the law of necessity.\" The Krupp firm not only demonstrated a \"willingness but ... [an] ardent desire to employ forced labor.\" Its executives acted out of a patriotic \"sense of duty\" rather than out of \"necessity\"and made it clear to the Reich that Krupp was eager to deploy slave labor.\"' The Tribunal conceded that executives who regularly failed to meet their production quotas risked losing their position or industrial prop- erty.113 However, it noted that it was doubtful whether Krupp or his executives would have suffered such punishment. The Krupp firm was a vital factor in the war effort and Gustav Krupp was a personal friend of Hitler. He contributed large sums to the Nazi Party and persuaded other influential industrialists to support Hitler.\"'4 The Tribunal cited three instances in which Krupp was able to defy the Reich successfully: the firm's support for a doctor who refused to abort \"eastern work- ers,''115 its continued production of peacetime goods, 116 and its sale of war bonds.\"' In any event, the Tribunal questioned whether the fear 110.

If we may assume that as a result of opposition to Reich policies, Krupp would have lost control of his plant and the officials their positions, it is difficult to conclude that the law of necessity justified a choice favorable to themselves and against the unfortunate victims who had no choice at all in the matter. Or, in the language of the rule, that the remedy was not disproportionated to the evil. In this connection it should be pointed out that there is a very respectable authority for the view that the fear of the loss of property will not make the defense of duress available.\"\" Liability for the use of slave labor thus rested on the defendants' state of mind-whether they voluntarily complied with Nazi policies or were compelled to do so. Those viewed as having been forced to deploy slave labor were successful in invoking the necessity defense. A defendant's state of mind, of course, was difficult to determine. As a result, the tribunals litigating the culpability of German industrialists only denied the necessity defense to those who clearly took the initiative in deploying slave labor.\"9 For instance, plant managers who quiedy cooperated in the slave labor program invariably were determined to have acted out of necessity.20 The defendants in the Flick Case utilized workers from occupied territories and prison camps. Yet the Tribunal determined that the defendants did not want to employ such labor. Most of the firm's executives were portrayed as having no choice but to accept the use of such workers. The Tribunal emphasized that the defendants were keenly aware that it would be \"both futile and dangerous to object to the allocation of such labor. \"121 Any act that could be viewed as hindering or retarding the war economy programs of the Reich would be considered as \"sabotage and would be treated with summary and severe penalties, sometimes resulting in the imposition of death sentences.\" 122 118.

The defendants in Farben were also charged with War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity because the company provided large quan- tities of Zyklon B gas to concentration camps. This poison gas was used to exterminate those interned in the camp. The Tribunal deter- mined that there was no probable cause to believe that the members of the firm's executive board were aware of the deadly deployment of the gas. The industrialists reasonably could have believed the insecticide was used to maintain hygiene in the crowded camps.23 Moreover, the defendants in Farben were charged with providing various deadly pharmaceuticals for use in experimentation upon persons interned in concentration camps. Internees were deliberately infected with typhus. Then they were administered drugs produced by Farben to test the efficacy of the drugs. A substantial number died during these experiments. 24 The Tribunal failed to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were aware of this criminal practice.25 It noted that there is \"always danger of an epidemic of this disease where a large number of persons are thrown together amid unsanitary con- ditions, such as are frequently found on army fronts and in concentration camps. 126 The Tribunals also determined that Farben discontinued forwarding drugs to these physicians as soon as the doctors' \"improper conduct was suspected. \"127 Thus, as to the provision of both the Zyklon B and typhus vaccine, the Tribunal required the prosecution to meet a high standard of proof in order to prove guilty knowledge.

Id. 128. United States v. Brandt, II TRIALS OF WAR CRIMINALS BEFORE THE NUERN-[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG German doctors performed a number of medical experiments on concentration camp internees who were forced to participate in research trials. The tests were intended to have military applications such as determining how best to treat those exposed to infections and disease or sailors stranded in chilly ocean waters. Countless internees were injured and killed in the course of these scientifically dubious exercises.130 The high-altitude experiments were carried out in a low-pressure chamber in which the pressures prevailing at high altitudes were du- plicated. The simulated altitude gradually was raised to test the limits of human endurance. In the medical tests involving freezing temper- atures, the subjects were forced to remain in a tank of ice water for periods of up to three hours. In other instances, subjects were kept outdoors without clothes for many hours at below-freezing temperatures. Other experiments involved infecting internees with malaria, jaundice, spotted fever, poison and exposing them to mustard gas or subjecting them to phosphorus burns from incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of various vaccines and treatments then were tested. Another set of procedures involved the transplantation of bones, muscles and nerves from one subject to another.131 At the Ravensbrueck concentration camp, inmates were wounded and infected with streptococcus, gangrene and tetanus.

The in- fections were aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds. The infections then were treated with sulfanilamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.132 The Dachau concentration camp tests involved the study of various methods of making sea water drinkable. Subjects were deprived of food and were forced to subsist on chemically processed sea water. Between March 1941 and January 1945, sterilization experiments were conducted at Auschwitz and Ravensbrueck. The purpose was to develop a method of sterilization suitable for rendering millions of people sterile as effi- ciently and quickly as possible. In this process, thousands were sterilized by means of X-rays, surgery and various drugs.\"'3 Countless others were needlessly killed and tortured. One hundred and twelve Jews were selected to complete a skeleton collection for the Reich University of Strasbourg. Their photographs and anthropological measurements were taken and they were then murdered. The corpses later were sent to Strasbourg where they were defleshed. The euthanasia program involved the systematic execution of Germans in medical institutions-the aged, crippled, infirm, insane and incurably ill by lethal injection, gas and other means. These persons were regarded as '''useless eaters... and were considered a burden on the German war machine. Their relatives were told that they had died of natural causes. This program served as the first step towards the wholesale extermi- nation of Jews, Gypsies and Slavic populations. Between May 1942 and January 1944, tens of thousands of Polish internees who allegedly were infected with tuberculosis were executed in order to ensure the public health and welfare.134 The Tribunal ruled that medical experiments on human beings must conform to various ethical standards.135 Most importantly, the subjects must voluntarily consent to the procedure and there must be a reasonable belief that the experiment will contribute to the welfare of society.136 The Nazi experiments failed to satisfy any of the standards established by the Tribunal: 132.

The Tribunal listed ten ethical principles which must be observed in order to satisfy moral, ethical and legal requirements. These include: subjects must voluntarily consent to the experiment; the experiment should be expected to yield fruitful results for the good of society; the experiment should be based upon prior[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG In every single instance appearing in the record, subjects were used who did not consent to the experiments; indeed, as to some of the experiments, it is not even contended by the defendants that the subjects occupied the status of volunteers. In no case was the experimental subject at liberty of his own free choice to withdraw from any experiment. In many cases experiments were performed by unqualified persons, were conducted at random for no adequate scientific reason, and under revolting physical conditions. All of the experiments were conducted with unnecessary suffering and injury and but very little, if any, precautions were taken to protect or safe- guard the human subjects from the possibilities of injury, disability, or death. In every one of the experiments the subjects experienced extreme pain or torture, and in most of them they suffered permanent injury, mutilation, or death, either as a direct result of the experiments or because of lack of adequate follow-up care.137 The Tribunal ruled that those high medical officials who possessed both knowledge of the experiments and the authority to modify or halt them were criminally liable.'38 For instance, in the medical field, Karl Brandt was only subordinate to Hitler and he was aware of various experiments. The judicial panel in the Medical Case held that Brandt had a duty to intervene to ascertain whether those involved in the tests were being treated humanely. Yet, it concluded that Brandt failed to take any steps to check upon the medical experiments. Occupying the position he did, and being a physician of ability and experience, the duty rested upon him to make some adequate investigation concerning the medical experiments tests and existing scientific knowledge; the experiment should avoid all unnecessary pain, injury and death; the risk involved should not exceed the expected benefits; the experiment should be conducted by scientifically qualified personnel; the human subject and scientist should be at liberty to halt the experiment at any time if there is a risk of injury or death.

The Tribunal ruled that the \"Family of Nations is not obligated to give recognition to such legislation when it manifestly gives legality to plain murder and torture of defenseless and powerless human beings of other nations.\"140 Thus, those governmental officials with knowledge of the experi- ments and authority over the doctors conducting those procedures who failed to exercise control over their subordinates were charged with a duty to intervene. Had they fulfilled this responsibility, the Tribunal concluded, \"great numbers of non-German nationals would have been saved from murder.\" On the other hand, mere knowledge of these experiments was not sufficient to constitute criminal liability. Defendant Paul Rostock was Dean of the Medical Faculty of the University of Berlin and Brandt's deputy in charge of medical science and research. He coordinated research to avoid duplication and to ensure that vital problems were given priority. Nevertheless, the Tribunal determined that Rostock neither directed nor was directly involved in the medical experiments. Most importantly, \"[n]o experiments were conducted by any person or organization which was to the least extent under Rostock's control or direction.\"141 The defendants pointed out that only those condemned to death were subjected to the experiments. The implication was that those who died would have been killed in any event.142 This, however, was not invariably the case. Gypsies, for instance, often were promised that if they voluntarily transferred from Auschwitz to Dachau they would be able work in a labor battalion. However, when they arrived at Dachau, they were assigned to the seawater experimental station without their consent. 143 139. Id. at 193-95.

The Tribunal, however, refused to hold that the detainees' death sentence permitted the Germans to subject them involuntarily to medical testing. These individuals had not been subjected to a trial and it was not certain that they were guilty of capital offenses. In any event, the internees had not consented to participate in the experiments. In short, assuming for the moment that they had been condemned to death for acts considered hostile to the German forces in the occupied territory of Poland, these persons still were entitled to the protection of the laws of civilized nations. While under certain specific conditions the rules of land warfare may rec- ognize the validity of an execution of spies, war rebels, or other resistance workers, it does not under any circumstances countenance the infliction of death or other punishment by maiming or torture.)\"4 Nor was it recognized as a defense to act pursuant to superior orders. Wilhelm Beiglboeck was a captain in the medical department of the German Air Force and received orders to carry out seawater experiments at Dachau. Roughly, forty gypsies of various nationalities were deprived of water and then ordered to drink sea water. The Tribunal determined the subjects had been \"treated brutally\" and many had \"endured much pain and suffering.\" The Tribunal rejected Beiglboeck's superior orders defense, ruling that such a claim \"will be considered, if at all, only in mitigation of sentence.''45 Defendant Wolfram Sievers argued that his involvement in war crimes was justified by his involvement in an underground resistance movement. Sievers, who was not a doctor, served on Himmler's per- sonal staff. His main responsibility was to act as Reich Business Man- ager of the Ahnenerbe Society, which funded research on the culture and heritage of the Nordic race. He directly reported to Himmler and devoted his efforts to providing the funds, materials and equipment, and occasionally the subjects, required by researchers, and he monitored the research process and results.1' Sievers attempted to justify his actions insofar as he was a member of a secret resistance movement which plotted to assassinate Hitler and 144.

Sievers allegedly assumed and remained in his position in order to observe Himmler's movements and to obtain information of value to the resistance organization. The Tribunal, however, rejected the contention that \"a resistance worker can commit no crime, and least of all, against the very people he is supposed to be protecting.\" The fact remains that \"murders were committed with cooperation of the Ahnenerbe upon countless thousands of wretched concentration camp inmates.\" 47 It also was not a defense that a doctor proposed an allegedly more humane, but equally effective procedure to sterilize internees. Defendant Pokorny was a medical officer in the German army.'1 He wrote Him- mler suggesting that sterilization could be more efficiently carried out through drugs rather than through relying upon castration and other techniques. 149 The Tribunal rejected Pokorny's defense that his proposal was intended to sabotage rather than to further the sterilization program. However, he was acquitted because as \"monstrous and base as the suggestions in the letter are, there is not the slightest evidence that any steps were ever taken to put them into execution by human experimentation. We find, therefore, that the defendant must be ac- quitted-not because of the defense tendered, but in spite of it.\"'50 The companion case involved the prosecution of Field Marshal Erhard Milch, second in command to Herman Goering in the German Luftwaffe. Milch's prosecution grew out of his membership on the Central Planning Board which directed and controlled German war production.'5' He was charged with being a principal in, accessory to, ordering, abetting, and taking a consenting part in, medical experiments without the subjects' consent.'52 The Tribunal concluded that there was no evidence that Milch instituted the experiments or that they were conducted or continued under his specific direction or command.

It deter- mined that he actively encouraged and urged the procurement of ad- ditional labor. 56 Instances could be multiplied in which the defendant not only listened to stories of enforced labor from eastern civilians and other prisoners of war and thereby became aware of the methods used in procuring such labor, but in which he himself urged more stringent and coercive means to supplement the dwindling supply of labor in the Lutfwaffe.\"' Milch claimed he was told it was lawful to employ prisoners of war in armament industries. The Tribunal, however, ruled Milch, as an \"old and experienced\" soldier who was \"well acquainted\" with the provisions of the Geneva and Hague Treaties, should have had \"grave suspicions\" concerning this advice. The defendant's contention that many of the Russian prisoners of war volunteered to serve in the war 153. Id. at 776-77. 154. Id. at 783. 155. Id. at 785. 156. Id. at 787. 157. Id.1992] IND.

REv. industries, does not serve as a defense to the charge that \"hundreds of thousands of Polish prisoners of war were cast into concentration camps and parceled out to the various war factories, nor that thousands of French prisoners of war were compelled to labor under the most harrowing conditions for the Luftwaffe.\"158 Milch also pointed out that the French government agreed to provide workers to the Reich. He contended that any coercion was exerted by the French rather than by the Nazi government. According to the Tribunal, this argument overlooks that the Vichy government, a creation and creature of the Germans, took its orders from Berlin. The \"transports which brought Frenchmen to Germany were manned by German armed guards and that upon their arrival they were kept under military guard provided by the Wehrmacht or the SS.''159 The Tribunal further rejected the defendant's contention that the vast hordes of Slavic Jews who worked in German war industries were voluntary workers. These Jewish workers were \"slaves, nothing less- kidnapped, regimented, herded under armed guards, and worked until they died from disease, hunger, and exhaustion.\" The treatment of non-Jewish workers was only marginally better. They lived under the \"sign-marks of slavery, not free employment under contract.\" To the extent that \"any decent human consideration was shown these workers, it was merely to maintain their productivity and did not stem from any humanitarian considerations.\"160 On another count, Milch offered the defense that he was a German soldier who was complying with his obligation to follow the orders and policies established by Adolf Hitler. The Tribunal pointed out that Milch had joined the Nazi Party as early as 1933 and had been present at the meeting at which Hilter had outlined his plans for invading Poland. The defendant thus made his choice and \"elected to ride with the tyrant.''6' The Tribunal concluded that the defendant had an \"opportunity to join those who refused to do the evil bidding of an evil master, but he cast it aside and his professed repentance now 158.

The Tribunal further noted: Others with more courage and higher principles and with more loyalty to the ancient German ideals rebelled and withdrew from the brutal crew. ... [T]hese men in high positions had the character to repudiate great evil, and if in so doing they took risks and made sacrifices, nevertheless, they made their choice to stand with decency and justice and honor. Id. at 793.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG comes too late.'162 As determined by the Tribunal, Milch was aware of the requirements of the law of nations. Nevertheless, he urged his subordinates to ignore the requirements of international law and directed them to subject those forced to work in German armaments factories to brutal and harsh treatment.63 When foreign forced laborers refused to work, the defendant ordered that they be shot. When they attempted to revolt the defendant directed that some of their numbers be killed, re- gardless of their personal guilt or innocence. In the case of prisoners of war who attempted to escape, the defendant ordered that these prisoners be shot and later hanged in the factory for all to see.'6' The Tribunal also rejected the argument that the use of involuntary labor drawn from the population of occupied territories was justified on the basis of the Nazi theory of total warfare. It determined that while military necessity, at times, may justify the incidental victimization of noncombatants, it does not mean that an occupying power may strip the indigenous population of their civil rights and subject them to forced labor, torture and death.165 Even assuming that international law recognizes the concept of total war, it cannot be persuasively argued that this theory \"justifies the abandonment of every restriction and authorizes the combatants to use all manners and means to win the conflict. \" ' 66 In sum, there was clear evidence of Milch's involvement in the involuntary labor program. As Inspector General of the Air Force, Milch was in charge of the office which authorized research and medical experiments conducted on behalf of the Air Force. However, the Tri- bunal determined that he did not possess control or knowledge of the abuses which transpired during these procedures. There was a swirl of debate, discussion and memorandums concerning the use of human subjects in perilous high altitude experiments. However, the Tribunal was unable to find any concrete evidence of Milch's involvement or knowledge of what transpired during these medical trials and refused to find him guilty based upon circumstantial evidence. It concluded 162. Id. at 793. 163. Id. at 850 (Musmanno, J., concurring). 164. Id. at 873. 165. Id. at 849-50. 166. Id. at 850.19921 IND. INT'L & COMP. L.

It clearly was concerned with documenting the barbarities of the Nazi regime. The panel noted that no future German leader would be able to deny the justifiability of the Allied military effort or to portray Germany as a victim of a Western con- spiracy.1'a The Tribunal stressed that any compromise of due process principles would interfere with the Allies' goal of inculcating into the thinking of the German people an appreciation of, and respect for, the principles of law which have become the backbone of the democratic process .... If the level of civi- lization is to be raised throughout the world, this must be the first step. Any other road leads to tyranny and chaos.169 C. The Ethnic Cases In the so-called ethnic cases, the Court again addressed the abuse of individuals based upon their nationality and race.170 United States v. Pohl involved the prosecution of members of the Economic and Ad- ministrative Main Office (WVHA), one of the twelve main departments of the SS.m' The WVHA, in turn, was divided into several Amtsgruppen or office groups. WVHA was headed by defendant Oswald Pohl and his deputies, August Frank and Georg Loerner. 72 The latter, along with fifteen other high-level administrators, were charged with perpe- trating atrocities and offenses against persons and property.73 The 167.

The WVHA was involved in the construction and administration of concentration camps, the as- signment of labor and the administration of confiscated goods and industries within the occupied territories.174 The defendants were charged with acting as part of a common plan to perpetrate atrocities. Those who administered the camps were obviously guilty. According to the Tribunal, their guilt was shared equally by those who supplied, constructed and planned the death camps.175 The judicial panel stressed that: It is not claimed by the prosecution that ...any of the defendants in this case, physically manhandled Jews, or other detainees of the Reich. But it is maintained with reason that the systematic persecution, impoverishment, confinement, and eventual slayings of these persecutees [those in concentration and POW camps] could not have been possible without the vast machinery of the SS, of which the WVHA was one of the most important parts.176 The Tribunal rejected the contention by the defense that the commitment of individuals to the concentration camps was preceded by an informal trial conducted by the Gestapo. The detainment of individuals was not based upon individual conduct but was part of a broad \"categorical Nazi political policy.\" Villages and groups were deported en masse. The Tribunal sarcastically queried, \"[c]ould any rational person believe that this [a trial] or any comparable procedure accompanied the annihilation of the ghetto at Warsaw?\" Even accepting the dubious proposition that the roughly five million involuntary workers were treated well, the Tribunal observed that \"[t]here is no such thing as benevolent slavery. Involuntary servitude, even if tempered by hu- mane treatment, is still slavery. \"'177 There was no question that criminal medical experiments were performed in the camps. In addition, those who were \"economically valueless\" were arbitrarily executed. This program was gradually ex- panded to include the incurables, the elderly, the idle, habitual crim- inals, political dissidents and members of various ethnic and religious groups. The Jews, of course, were singled out and \"six million human 174. Id. at 966-67. 175. Id. at 993. 176. Id. at 1047. 177. Id. at 968-70.19921 IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. beings were deliberately exterminated by a civilized state whose only indictment was that its victims had been born in the wrong part of the world of forbears whom the murderers detested. Never before in history has man's inhumanity to man reached such depths.\" Following these killings, \"the victim's personal effects, including the gold in his teeth, were shipped back to the concentration camp, and a report of 'death from natural causes' was made out.\" Those who were spared death and who were forced to work may have come to envy the dead. The SS \"resorted to practices which would shame the most primitive race of savage barbarians.\" The \"endless hours of exhausting labor, the beatings and killings, the starvation, the degradation ...this has become stale from retelling.\" 178 The territories to be incorporated into the Reich were spared plunder. The others were stripped of agriculture, food, raw materials, cultural artifacts, manufactured goods and machinery. The indigenous population was left to starve.179 Action Reinhardt was a program in which the real and personal property of the Jews was seized and shipped to the WVHA warehouses where it was inventoried, appraised and distributed. 80 The defendant Frank listed as received as of April 30, 1943: 94,000 men's watches, 33,000 women's watches, and 25,000 fountain pens. Currency and precious metals seized reached a total value of 60,000,000 Reichsmarks. About 2,000 carloads of textiles reached Germany as a result of this plunder, and in all a grand total of over 1000 million Reichsmarks in personal property was acquired.18' The defendants advanced the defense that they were ignorant of the events which transpired behind the barbed wire and the factory walls. Hitler had ordained that complete secrecy should be maintained. The press was censored, it was illegal to listen to foreign broadcasts and those released from the camps were sworn to silence. The Tribunal accepted that millions of \"obscure and unimportant\" Germans may have been unaware of the Nazi barbarities. However, the fact that millions were being systematically murdered could not have been a surprise to these defendants who were so intricately involved in the functioning of the death camps. They witnessed the public rallies, read 178. Id. at 971-74. 179. Id. at 976. 180. Id. at 977. 181. Id. at 978.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG the publications denouncing the Jews, heard the stories told by those returning from Poland and the Soviet Union and must have seen and smelled the smoke wafting from the camps. The Tribunal thus was\"convinced that the ignorance professed by many of the defendants is the ignorance of convenience. \"182 Pohl's deputy, August Frank, also plead ignorance.183 He alleged that he believed that the property transported to WVHA warehouses came from Jews who had died from natural causes in the camps or from stockpiles seized during the invasion of European countries. 14 The Tribunal dismissed this as a fanciful notion: It is difficult to imagine a convoy of Jews from the East, packed so tightly into freight cars that many died, carrying with them for their comfort and convenience such items as electric razors, feather beds, umbrellas, thermos jugs, and baby carriages .... It is fair to assume that prisoners who froze to death or who died from exhaustion and exposure were not equipped with feather beds, quilts, and woolen blan- kets. Nor can it be believed that before being herded off to Auschwitz or Lublin they were given an opportunity to gather up their collections of old coins and stamps with which to amuse themselves during their idle time.185 Defendant Pohl was administrative head of the SS for eleven years, with authority over 1,700 employees. He directed and administered the fiscal affairs of the entire SS as well as the infrastructure and personnel of the concentration camps. He was head of the state-owned industries in the occupied territories. He was not involved in selecting, transporting or exterminating inmates.86 In all other matters, however, Pohl pos- sessed primary authority over twenty concentration and one hundred and sixty five labor camps. He established the hours of work for inmates, the extent and mode of punishment, and assigned commanders to the camps.87 The WVHA designed and constructed the crematories and 182. Id. at 978-80.

The Tribunal con- cluded that there was \"doubtless no other one person in Germany who knew as much about all the details of the concentration camps as Pohl.... Pohl stands ...as an admitted slave driver on a scale never before known.\"\"8 Nearly every ... chief ... reported frequently to Pohl, in person, concerning events and problems arising in his im- mediate sphere. According to his own testimony and corre- spondence, he kept a running inventory, classified as to nationalities, of the labor supply of inmates in every camp. He knew how many prisoners died; he knew how many were unfit for work; and he knew what mass transfers were made from camp to camp. ...Pohl knew that hundreds of thou- sands of men and women had been cast into concentration camps and compelled to work, without remuneration and under the most rigid confinement, for the country which had devastated their homelands and abducted them into bondage. When these slaves died from exhaustion, starvation, or from the abuse of the SS overseers, Pohl cannot escape from the fact that he was the administrative head of the agency which brought about these tragedies.'89 Pohl also provided inmates for medical experiments at Dachau.190 He visited Dachau, observed the high-altitude experiments and knew that roughly forty different experiments, including sterilization, which was his great passion, were being performed.'9' The WVHA also was the clearinghouse for property confiscated from the Jews. Pohl, according to the Tribunal, was aware of the source of this booty and distributed it to the appropriate agencies. Money, for instance, was routed to the Reich Bank, where it was deposited under the assumed name of Max Heiliger. Pohl did not actually remove or transport the stolen goods. However, his \"active participation even in the afterphases of the action make him particeps criminis in the whole affair.\" Pohl also was head of Eastern Industries 188. Id. at 984. 189. Id.

Josef Vogt was chief of the office of audits. He scrutinized and was aware of the type of activities which were being funded by the WVHA. Yet, he remained silent. Nevertheless, no evidence indicated that he took any affirmative acts in furtherance of these criminal activities and he was not held liable for taking a consenting part in or being connected to these illegalities.200 He did not furnish men, money, materials, or victims for the concentration camps.

Vogt was neither a principal in, or an accessory to, the actual mistreatment or enslavement of the concentration camp inmates. The most that was claimed is that because of his position he must have known about them and therefore took a consenting part in and was connected with them. The Tribunal, however, held that the phrase 'being connected with' a crime means something more than possessing knowledge. In the case of a person who has power or authority to either start or stop a criminal act, knowledge of the fact coupled with silence could be interpreted as consent. But Vogt was not such a person.

His work cannot be considered any more criminal than that of the bookkeeper who made up the reports which he audited, the typist who transcribed the audit report, or the mail clerk who forwarded the audit to the Supreme Auditing Court.201 Vogt possessed no authority over the camps and was not charged with an affirmative duty to intervene to prevent the commission of atrocities. Again, the Tribunal is impelled to ask, what should he have done? Unless we are willing to resort to the principle of group responsibility and to charge the whole German nation with these war crimes and crimes against humanity, there is a line somewhere at which indictable criminality must stop. In the opinion of the Tribunal, Vogt stands beyond that line.202 In the end, fifteen of the eighteen defendants in Pohl were convicted.203 United States v. Greifelt involved the prosecution of fourteen defen- dants who served as high-echelon bureaucrats in four organizations involved in the resettlement of ethnic populations-the Reich Com- mission for Strengthening Germanism, the Staff Main Office (Staff Main Office of RKFDV), the Repatriation Office for Ethnic Germans (VOMi), the SS Race and Resettlement Main Office (RuSHA) and the Well of Life Society (Lebensborn). These organizations were under the supervision and direction of Reich Leader SS Heinrich Himmler, who served as Reich Commissioner for the Strengthening of German- ism. The goal of these various organizations was to insure that those territories which had been incorporated into the Reich were inhabited by a racially pure population. The first territories subjected to the Nazis' population policies were the Incorporated Eastern Territories of Poland and the remaining Polish lands which were known as the Government General.204 201.

RuSHA Case, supra note 170, at 89-90.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG The Staff Main Office of RKFDV headed by Ulrich Greifelt was in charge of the Germanization program and coordinated the activities of the other agencies. Greifelt's responsibilities included overseeing the expulsion of populations; the Germanization of foreign nationals; the deportation of foreigners to Germany as slave labor; the kidnapping of children; and the plunder and confiscation of the property of enemy nationals. VOMi, headed by Werner Lorenz, was mainly involved with the expulsion, deportation and transfer of populations. RuSHA was involved in the racial examination and categorization of individuals. It was authorized to determine which individuals would be grouped as \"undesirable racial stock\" and subjected to expulsion, slave labor and abortions, and which would be entitled to German citizenship based upon their \"Aryan racial purity.\" The Lebensborn Society operated a maternity home which placed foreign children in foster homes in Germany.205 Nazi policy towards non-Aryans in the occupied territory was designed to harness the existing population as slave labor while limiting their reproduction and growth.206 These \"undesirables\" were to be evacuated into areas such as western Poland. Those territories which were incorporated into the Reich were to be resettled by foreign and indigenous ethnic Germans.207 The overall Nazi policy was set forth in a 1939 document which proclaimed the Nazis' intent to Germanize the eastern territories. Our Germanization policy has the aim to extract the Nordic groups from the remaining population and to Germanize them, and, on the other hand, to keep the racially foreign Polish strata on a low cultural level and to deport them from time to time to central Poland.20 This Germanization policy, according to the Tribunal, was implemented by \"drastic and oppressive measures,\" including: Deportation of Poles and Jews; the separation of family groups and the kidnapping of children for the purpose of training them in Nazi ideology; confiscation of all property of Poles and Jews for resettlement purposes; the destruction of the economic and cultural life of the Polish population; and the 205.

REv. hampering of the reproduction of the Polish population.\u00b09 This general policy was implemented in twelve of the countries overrun by the Reich.210 The most appalling aspect of Nazi policy in the occupied territory was an extensive campaign of kidnapping foreign children. Although initially confined to ethnic Germans, the program was extended to all children of \"good racial characteristics.'2\" Related to this program was a policy which encouraged and, in some cases required, abortions for so-called Eastern female workers. In cases where a racially \"valuable result\" was expected, the women were required to carry their child to term.212 These children were sent to Germany for adoption by Aryan foster parents.213 Strict rules were promulgated and enforced by RuSHA concerning intercourse between foreign workers employed in the Reich and Germans. For example, Soviet males were executed while the females were sent to concentration camps.214 Within Poland and other territories, the Reich developed a German People's List (DVL). The population was categorized according to their ethnic background and, in the case of Germans, based upon their cultural orientation. Marriage across categories was prohibited and marriage between Eastern workers was restricted by such measures as establishing a minimum marital age of twenty-five for women and twenty-eight for men.2135 The most far-reaching and perphaps most cruel policies involved the evacuation and resettlement of incorporated territories such as eastern Poland.216 By January 1944, hundreds of thousands of Poles had been involuntarily deported to the Government Territory in the West or to the Reich. As the Poles were deported, a corresponding number of resettlers were situated on the evacuated land.27 During this process, individuals were often expelled from their homes in the middle of the night and left to freeze to death on transport trains. Those who survived the trip West were interned in camps where they were separated from their families and forced to engage in manual 209. Id. at 96. 210. Id. 211. Id. at 102. 212. Id. at 109-10. 213.

However, the Tribunal refused to accept this contention in those cases in which \"the words of a defendant absolutely refute the contentions now urged.' '221 The Tribunal stressed that: It is no defense for a defendant to insist, for instance, that he never evacuated populations when orders exist, signed by him, in which he directed that the evacuation should take place. While in such a case the defendant might not have actually carried out the physical evacuation in the sense that he did not personally evacuate the population, he nevertheless is responsible for the action, and his participation by instigating the actions is more pronounced than that of those who actually performed the deed.222 The defendants also urged that certain territories, such as the Incorporated Eastern Territories of Poland and parts of Luxembourg, Alsace, and Lorraine were incorporated into the Reich and thereby became part of Germany. It was contended that these areas were part of Germany and were not subject to the laws and customs of war. The Tribunal, however, ruled that any purported annexation of the terri- tories of a foreign nation which occurred while opposing armies were still in the field was invalid and ineffective. Such territories, according to the Tribunal, never became part of the Reich and, as a matter of international law, remained under German occcupation. The Tribunal also noted that even if certain territories had been incorporated into the Reich this was largely irrelevant. \"[A]ctions similar to those oc- curring in the area attempted to be annexed also occurred in areas which Germany never professed to have incorporated into the Reich.\"223 218.

According to the Court, they were in \"the field actively superintending, controlling, directing, and taking an active part in the bloody harvest. \"227 If what the prosecution maintains is true, we have participation in a crime of such unprecedented brutality and of such in- conceivable savagery that the mind rebels against its own thought image and the imagination staggers in the contem- plation of a human degradation beyond the power of language to adequately portray.

As the German armies crossed the Polish frontier and charged into Russia, they were followed by a unique organization known as the Einsatzgruppen.

The four Ein- satzgruppen units, each comprised of between 800 and 1,200 men, were assigned to various geographic areas within the Soviet Union.231 In May 1941, Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Security Police and the SD (the party police) and head of the Einsatzgruppen, transmitted the infamous Fuehrer Order to the Einsatzgruppen commanders. Under the guise of insuring the political security of the conquered territories, the Einsatzgruppen were instructed to liquidate all the opponents of National Socialism.232 According to the Fuehrer's Order: Whole categories of people were to be killed without truce, without investigation, without pity, tears, or remorse. Women were to be slain with the men, and the children also were to be executed because, otherwise, they would grow up to oppose National Socialism and might even nurture a desire to avenge themselves on the slayers of their parents.233 Among the special targets were the Jews and other ethnic groups suspected of having \"Jewish blood,\" as well as gypsies, the \"insane\" (so-called useless eaters), Asians (so-called Asiatic inferiors), Communist functionaries and those designated as \"asocials.''234 A number of eu- phemisms were used to describe the execution of these people including \"rendered harmless,'\" \"special treatment,\" and \"appropriately treated.''235 When one of these phrases appeared in a report, \"only one person could be of service to the person taken care of, and that was the grave digger.''236 The Einsatzgruppen typically would enter a village and assemble a group of Jewish leaders who would be ordered to compile a roster of Jews in the vicinity.

They were then typically driven to the woods and shot. The last step was to return to the town and to kill the Jewish leaders.237 Others were ghettoized or fled into the hinterlands where they often died of exposure, malnutrition, star- vation, lack of medical care and exhaustion.23 Defendant Paul Blobel, whose unit killed between ten and fifteen thousand people, described how he divided his shooting squads into groups of thirty soldiers. Each squad took turns shooting for roughly an hour. A mass grave was dug in the woods and the victims were ordered to kneel at the edge or enter the grave. They were then shot at close-range in the head.239 Many of those involved in the shooting squads were unable to distance themselves from the execution of women and children and experienced emotional trauma. In order to eliminate their distress, gas vans were introduced. Women and children were lured into the vans with the promise of resettlement and eventual reunification with their husbands and fathers. Once inside the carbon trucks, the doors were sealed and as the trucks accelerated, monoxide gas from the engine streamed into the van. By the time the van had reached the burial ditch, the occupants were dead.240 The defendants offered a number of defenses: lack of jurisdiction, self-defense and necessity, selective prosecution, superior orders, non- involvement and reprisal.24' The defendants argued that Control Council Law No. 10 was void based on the argument that on August 23, 1939, Russia had signed a secret treaty with Germany agreeing to a division of Poland. Control Council Law No. 10, to which Russia was a signatory, was therefore irrevocably tainted and was a nullity. The Tribunal rejected this ar- gument and warned the defendants that Germany's aggression against Poland was not excused by the contention that \"someone else may also have been at fault.\" Most importantly, the defendants were ig- noring the determination of the International Military Tribunal that Germany had initiated an aggressive war against Russia. Russia thus was an aggrieved party and its \"participation in the Allied Council which formulated Law No. 10 was legal and correct and in entire accordance with international law. \"242 237.

This was not, as claimed by the defendants, a retrospective code. All nations recognized that they are bound by the rules or laws of war which, without exception, \"condemn the wanton killing of noncombatants.\" These defendants were charged with murder and \"[c]ertainly no one can claim with the slightest pretense at reasoning that there is any taint of ex post factoism in the law of murder.\" \"[I]t cannot be said that prior to Control Council Law No. 10, there existed no law against murder. The killing of a human being has always been a potential crime which called for explanation.' '243 According to the Court, the lack of a pre-existing Tribunal was not controlling. Rather, it queried whether the \"matter of some one million nonmilitary deaths [was] to be denied judicial inquiry because a Tribunal was not standing by, waiting for the apprehension of the suspects?\" The Court noted that nations historically had prosecuted enemy belligerents charged with war crimes before their own domestic military courts. It argued that \"if a single nation may legally take jurisdiction in such instances, with what more reason may a number of nations agree, in the interests of justice, to try alleged violations of the international code of war?\" Russia certainly had the right to try the alleged violations of the rules of war committed against her citizens on her territory: \"And if Russia may do this alone, certainly she may concur with other nations who affirm that right.' '24 The Tribunal also rejected as fallacious the proposition that in- ternational obligations apply only to the \"abstract entities called states.\"245 Nations can only act through \"human beings\" and each combatant is charged with an obligation to respect international law.24 According to the Tribunal, this was not a trial of the vanquished by the victors. In war there is no legal entity such as a \"defeated individual\" just as there is no concept of a \"victorious individual.\" The defendants are in court not as members of a defeated nation but because they are charged with crime. They are being tried 243. Id. at 457-59. 244. Id. at 460. 245. Id. 246. Id.19921 IND. INT'L & CoMP. L. REv. because they are accused of having offended against society itself, and society, as represented by international law, has summoned them for explanation. The doctrine that no member of a wronged community may try an accused would for all practical purposes spell the end of justice in every country. It is the essence of criminal justice that the offended community inquires into the offense involved.247 The defendants also claimed that they erroneously believed they were acting justifiably to protect Germany against the foreign threat posed by those executed. However, the Tribunal noted that the ar- gument that individuals are entitled to abrogate the law of war in order to safeguard the national interest would render the humanitarian law of war a nullity. That this \"astounding proposition is advanced in all seriousness demonstrates how desperate is the need for a further re- valuation of the sacredness of life and for emphasizing the difference between patriotism and murder. '24 The defendants maintained that the Jews were killed based on their adherence to and advocation of bolshevism. However, they made no attempt to demonstrate how the Jews they killed constituted an attack on Germany. Even if their contention that all Jews were bolsh- eviks were true, individuals cannot be executed for their political beliefs and opinions. The fact remains, however, that \"when it came to a Jew, it did not matter whether he was a member of the Communist Party or not. He was killed simply because he was a Jew.249 The defendants next raised selective prosecution. They 'claimed that they should be exonerated since the allies had arbitrarily killed civilians in their bombing attacks on German cities. The Tribunal, however, noted that the bombings of Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg, Co- logne and other German cities were in retaliation for the German bombings of London, Coventry, Rotterdam, Warsaw and other Allied cities. The Tribunal also contended that there was no \"parallelism\" between an act of legitimate warfare such as the bombing of a city and the premeditated killing of all of the members of certain groups within the civilian population of an occupied territory. A city is bombed for tactical purposes-to destroy communications, railroads, ammuni- tion plants and military facilities. During the course of these operations, nonmilitary persons inevitably are killed. These civilians, however, are 247. Id. at 462. 248. Id. at 463. 249. Id. at 464.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG not individually targeted. This is \"entirely different, both in fact and in law, from an armed force marching up to these same railroad tracks, entering those houses abutting thereon, dragging out the men, women, and children and shooting them.\" The purpose of a bombing attack is to effect the surrender of the bombed nation. Once a nation sur- renders, the bombing ceases and the killing is ended. In contrast, the Tribunal pointed out that the killing of the Jews by the Einsatzgruppen had nothing to do with achieving military victory. It was solely designed to exterminate the Jews as a race.250 Those defendants who admitted participation in the mass killings plead that they acted pursuant to military orders. They contended that they were trained to obey orders and that they merely were responding to the Fuehrer's command to kill. Therefore, they \"had no will of their own\" and lacked a criminal intent.25' The defendants argued they had no idea that these orders to kill were illegal.252 They pointed out that since 1920 they had been exposed to a steady barrage of Nazi propaganda directed against the Jews.251 They came to accept the Nazis' claims of Slavic and Jewish inferiority and pestilence.254 The Tribunal observed that the order to kill civilians was manifestly illegal and that the defendants certainly should have grasped its criminality. The Tri- bunal illustrated the fatuousness of the defendants' defense by analo- gizing the Jews to a hypothetical grey-eyed population which had been excoriated by the Nazi regime. The Tribunal observed that the defen- dants clearly would have considered a program of extermination directed against the grey-eyed population as misguided and wrong. Yet,\"how can they less denounce a slaughter which did occur and under circum- stances no less harrowing than the one pictured only for the purpose of illustration?'255 Analogous to the plea that they were just following orders, the defendants said they obeyed those orders under duress. The Tribunal agreed that no law required that an innocent forfeit his life or suffer serious harm to avoid committing a crime. The Tribunal, however, held that the threat must be \"imminent, real, and inevitable.\" The Tribunal determined that in this case the defendants did not confront an imminent threat of harm if they failed to execute the killing orders. 250.

The Nazis were primarily concerned with the efficient execution of their policies. As a result, the Tribunal concluded that it is likely that had they failed to carry out the order to kill, the Einsatzgruppen leaders would have been sent back to Germany and assigned to another task. The only conclusion is that the defendants voluntarily engaged in mass slaughter.256 Some defendants said that it was pointless to ask to be released and therefore, they did not even attempt to be excused. The Tribunal rejected this claim: \"Exculpation is not so easy as that. No one can shrug off so appalling a moral responsibility with the statement that there was no point in trying.\"'257 The Tribunal concluded that the defendants in making no attempts to withdraw suggest that they either endorsed the killings or that they were motivated by racial animus or by a desire to gain acceptance or to earn a promotion.\"\" The Tribunal also rejected the defendants' argument that had they failed to carry out the order to kill, others would have willingly taken their place. The Tribunal stressed that a defendant cannot know what others might do. Had they objected, the Nazi authorities may have reconsidered their program of extermination. At the very least, no execution would have taken place on the day that the defendants pronounced that they would not fire their weapons.259 In addition, the Tribunal held that a defendant may not plead duress if the illegal order was the logical and forseeable extension of the policy of an organization which the defendant had voluntarily joined. From 1920, when the Nazi Party's anti-semitic policy was announced, until 1941, \"when the liquidation order went into effect, the ever- mounting severity of Jewish persecution was evidence to all within the Party and especially to those charged with its execution.\" Once having embarked on the Nazi's criminal enterprise, the Tribunal held that the defendants certainly should have anticipated \"what the enterpise [would] logically lead to.'260 Nor was there any indication that an investigation, let alone a trial, was conducted prior to the executions.26' In fact, the Einsatz- gruppen leaders were \"not only empowered but encouraged to execute 256.

'262 The killing of individuals also could not be legitimized by labelling captives as partisans. Or- ganized partisans who wear fixed and distinctive emblems and who openly carry their arms were entitled to protection as combatants.263 If captured, they were required to be treated as prisoners of war.264 The Tribunal also rejected the defendants' plea that the killings were legitimate reprisals.265 While the persons who were victimized by reprisals were generally innocents who were not responsible for the initial illegality, there \"must at least be such close connection between these persons and these acts as to constitute a joint responsibility.' '266 Thus when, as one report says, 859 out of 2,100 Jews shot in alleged reprisal for the killing of 21 German soldiers near Topola were taken from concentration camps in Yugoslavia, hundreds of miles away, it is obvious that a flagrant violation of international law occurred and outright murder resulted. That 2,100 people were killed in retaliation for 21 deaths only further magnifies the criminality of this savage and inhuman so-called reprisal .267 Even if those shot were partisans, the Tribunal stressed that the de- fendants must demonstrate that the partisans were not engaged in legitimate acts of reprisal against the wrongs perpetrated by the Nazis. Under international law, as in domestic law, there can be \"no reprisal against reprisal. The assassin who is being repulsed by his intended victim may not slay him and then, in turn, plead self-defense.' '268 D. The Military Cases A Tribunal also adjudicated the criminal liability of various mem- bers of the German High Command in two related cases.269 262. Id. at 489. 263. Id. at 492. 264. Id. at 493. 265.

The defendants in the High Command Case were charged with participation in the planning, preparing, initiation and waging of ag- gressive wars.270 The Tribunal rejected the defendants' argument that only Hitler was responsible for launching a war of aggression. It emphasized that Hitler depended on others to formulate, prepare, plan and wage his wars of aggression .271 The Tribunal held that criminal liability required actual knowledge that an aggressive war was \"intended and if launched it .. .[would] be an aggressive war.\"272 It added that mere knowledge is not sufficient to constitute culpability. The defendant must also be in a position to shape or influence the planning, initiation or continuance of the war. The Tribunal ruled it immaterial whether a defendant gained knowledge of a conflict's illegality after the plans to initiate and wage the war were formulated. The focus was on whether the defendant could influence the course of events.2\"3 In order to avoid liability, those in positions of authority must have demonstrated their lack of criminal intent by presenting evidence that they attempted to hinder or prevent the war effort to the extent of their ability.274 Thus, it is a defendant's power to shape or influence State policy rather than rank or status which determines a defendant's criminality under the charge of Crimes Against Peace. International law condemns those who, due to their actual power to shape and influence the policy of their nation, prepare for, or lead their country into or in an aggressive war. But we do not find that, at the present stage of development, international law declares as criminals those below that level who, in the execution of this war policy, act as the instruments THE NUREMBERG MILITARY TRIBUNALS UNDER CONTROL COUNCIL LAW No. 10 462 (1950) [hereinafter High Command Case]; United States v.

Anybody who is on the policy level and participates in the war policy is liable to punishment. But those under them cannot be punished for the crimes of others.275 The Tribunal explained that the limitation of guilt to policy-makers rests on their ability to deploy the great mass of soldiers in support of their decisions. Those below this level, such as the field commanders in the High Command Case are legally obligated and trained to assist their country in time of war. Nevertheless, the Tribunal stressed that it would have been \"eminently desirable\" had the defendants refused to implement the policy of the Third Reich.276 This would have been the \"honorable and righteous thing,\" and had \"they done so they would have served their fatherland and humanity also.' '277 But however much their failure is morally reprimandable, we are of the opinion and hold that international common law, at the time they so acted, had not developed to the point of making the participation of military officers below the policy making or policy influencing level into a criminal offense in and of itself278 The defendants who were members of the German High Command were responsible for directing the military land forces of the Reich.279 They were involved in fulfilling Hitler's military ambitions by planning and waging military campaigns. They, however, were not on the highest policy level. Their role was to implement the plans formulated by others. According to the Tribunal, this did not \"constitute the planning, preparation, initiation, and waging of war or the initiation of invasion that international law denounces as criminal.' '28 The defendants were also charged with War Crimes including murder, torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war. The defendants' treatment of civilians allegedly was \"replete with horror.

REV. enslaved, starved, tortured, executed and had their property plundered and destroyed.28' The Tribunal first dealt with the superior orders defense. It ob- served beginning in 1938 that Hider was Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and was the supreme civil and military authority in the Third Reich whose personal decrees had the force and effect of law. As a result, the Court noted that to recognize superior orders as a defense to the crimes enumerated in Control Council Law No. 10 would be in \"practical effect to say that all the guilt charged in the indictment was the guilt of Hider alone .... [T]o recognize such a contention would be to recognize an absurdity.' '282 As soldiers, the defendants contended they were bound to obey the orders of their superior. However, the Tribunal reminded the defendants that they were not obligated to obey orders to commit illegal acts. The acts set forth in Control Council Law No. 10 are criminal\"not because they are therein set forth as crimes but because they then were crimes under international common law.\" The Tribunal stressed that international common law \"must be superior to and, where it conflicts with, take precedence over national law or directives issued by any national governmental authority.\" A directive to violate inter- national criminal law therefore is \"void and can afford no protection to one who violates such law in reliance on such a directive.'283 The purpose of international law is to control and direct the conduct of nations. Since nations act through individuals, the actions of nations can only be affected by the imposition of liability upon those individuals who shape and carry out State policies. It would be an \"utter disregard of reality and but legal shadow-boxing to say that only the state, the inanimate entity, can have guilt, and that no guilt can be attributed to its animate agents who devise and execute its policies.' '284 The Tribunal refused to permit Hider to be a \"scapegoat on whom the sins of all his governmental and military subordinates are wished\" and to rule that with his death \"all the sins and guilt of his subordinates shall be considered to have been destroyed with him.\" Hitler, of necessity, depended upon the cooperation of others. The defendants were placed in a difficult position, \"but servile compliance with orders clearly criminal for fear of some disadvantage or punishment not im- mediately threatened cannot be recognized as a defense.\" The defense 281. Id. at 491-96. 282. Id. at 507-08. 283. Id. at 508. 284. Id.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG of coercion or necessity requires that a reasonable person would \"ap- prehend that he was in such imminent physical peril as to deprive him of freedom to choose the right and refrain from the wrong.\" However, the Tribunal concluded that no such situation had been demonstrated.285 The novel issue presented by the High Command Case was whether various defendants were criminally liable for their role in drafting or transmitting the illegal orders of their superiors. The Tribunal held that the intermediate administrative function of transmitting an order directed by a superior authority to subordinate units does not constitute the implementation of an order and carries no criminal liability. Such transmittal is a routine function which in many instances is handled by a commander's staff.286 Military discipline depends upon obedience to orders. Without it, no army can be effective and, according to the Tribunal, it is not \"incumbent upon a soldier in a subordinate position to screen the orders of superiors for questionable points of legality.'287 He has the right to assume that the orders of his superiors are in \"conformity with international law.''2M In this case, many of the defendants were field commanders and were charged with heavy responsibilities in com- bat. They were not lawyers, but soldiers who, given the pressure that they were under, could not be expected to comprehend subtle points of law. The Tribunal thus concluded that military commanders in the field with military responsibilities ordinarily cannot be charged under international law with criminal participation in transmitting orders which \"they are not shown to have known to be criminal under international law.\" A field commander has the right to presume that the legality of such orders has been properly determined before their issuance. He cannot be held criminally responsible for a \"mere error in judgment as to disputable legal questions.' '289 However, liability was extended to commanders who passed on illegal orders which the Tri- bunal adjudged to be criminal on their face.290 285. Id. at 508-09. 286. Id. at 509-10. 287. Id. at 510-11. 288. Id. at 511. 289. Id. It is therefore considered that to find a field commander criminally re- sponsible for the transmittal of such an order, he must have passed the order to the chain of command and the order must be one that is criminal upon its face, or one which he is shown to have known was criminal. Id. 290. Id. at 512.1992] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. Certain orders of the Wehrmacht and the German army were obviously criminal. No legal opinion was necessary to deter- mine the illegality of such orders. By any standard of civilized nations they were contrary to the customs of war and accepted standard of humanity. Any commanding officer of normal intelligence must see and understand their criminal nature. Any participation in implementing such orders, tacit or oth- erwise, any silent acquiescence in their enforcement by his subordinates, constitutes a criminal act on his part.291 The Tribunal also extended criminal liability to those staff officers who prepared or directed the preparation of clearly illegal orders or who personally distributed illegal orders to subordinate units. If the basic idea is criminal under international law, the staff officer who puts that idea into the form of a military order, either himself or through subordinates 'under him, or takes personal action to see that it is properly distributed to those units where it becomes effective, commits a criminal act under internatonal law .292 The Tribunal stressed that Hilter, Keitel (the highest executive officer in the administration of the armed forces) and Jodel (the head of armed forces operations) depended upon others to draft and implement their orders. It noted that while many of the \"evil and inhumane acts\" committed during the war may have originated in the minds of these men, their staff officers were \"indispensable ...and cannot escape criminal responsibility for their essential contribution to the final ex- ecution of such orders on the plea that they were complying with the orders of a superior who was more criminal.\" Surely the staff officers of the military command did not hold their high ranks and positions and did not \"bask in the bright sunlight of official favor of the Third and Thousand Year Reich by merely impeding and annulling the wishes of the Nazi masters whom they served. \"293 Hitler issued a number of orders which were clearly illegal under international law. The Commissar Order called for the murder of captured Russian political functionaries. Hitler viewed these individuals as constituting an impediment to the pacification of conquered terri- tories. The defendants did not directly resist the order. Instead, they 291. Id. 292. Id. at 513. 293. Id. at 515.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG \"sought a surreptitious sabotaging and evasion of its enforcement.\" Nevertheless, the Tribunal observed that a large number of reports indicate that that commissars were executed by units subordinate to various of the defendants.294 Clearly, it was criminal for the defendants to pass the Commissar Order down to their subordinate units. The defendants knew or should have known that the order was being carried out. The Tribunal stressed that the superior \"cannot absolve himself by the plea that his character was so well known that his subordinates should have had the courage to disobey the order which he himself in passing it down showed that he lacked. Such a plea is contemptible and constitutes no defense.295 The so-called Barbarossa Jurisdiction Order was issued in 1941 by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Hitler's highest-ranking executive officer in the administration of the armed forces.296 The order permitted the punishment without trial of partisans, enemy civilians who attacked German forces and all other civilians. Where punishment was not immediately carried out, those suspected of such offenses were to be brought before an officer who was authorized to determine whether they should be shot.297 Collective punishment was to be meted out where the circumstances did not permit a quick identification of the perpetrators.298 The Barbarossa Jurisdiction Order also stated that it was not obligatory to prosecute members of the Wehrmacht for offenses committed against enemy civilians.299 The Tribunal recognized no rule of international law which re- quired that guerillas be brought to trial. However, the \"allowing of such summary proceedings in the discretion of a junior officer, in the case of the wide variety of offenses that were left open to him, is considered criminal.\" The broad authority to inflict collective punish- ment was also clearly illegal. The Tribunal added that the provision 294. Id. at 517-20. 295. Id. at 520-21. 296. Id. at 521. 297. Id. 298. Id. at 521-22. The laws, rights and duties of war apply to armies and to militia and volunteer corps who are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance; openly carry arms; and who conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war. The inhabitants of a territory which has not been occupied who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading troops without having had time to organize themselves shall be regarded as belligerents if they carry arms openly and if they respect the laws and customs of war. Id. at 529. 299. Id. at 522.1992] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. that those members of the German militia who were guilty of offenses against the enemy population were not to be prosecuted appears to violate the duty of a military commander to protect the civilian pop- ulation. While this protection may be provided by disciplinary measures short of formal prosecution, the order certainly \"opened the door to serious infractions of discipline.\"300 The Tribunal held the field commanders liable for the transmission of the Barbarossa order. It ruled that the defendants must accept criminal responsibility for the order's \"misapplication within subor- dinate units to which they transmitted it.\" They were liable, within the areas of their commands, for the summary punishment of persons who were \"merely suspects\" or those who were not terrorists such as the nineteen-year-old girl executed for writing a \"song derogatory of the German invader of her country.\"'301 The Court also held the so-called Commando Order criminal. The Order permitted the execution of uniformed and non-uniformed enemy troops on operations behind enemy lines. Another of Hitler's orders which the Tribunal adjudged to be illegal under international law was the Night and Fog Decree. This decree authorized the arrest, secret transport to Germany and execution without trial of those in the occupied territories suspected of resistance to the Reich.302 The defendants justified the legality of these orders on the grounds that they generally were applied against partisans who were not entitled to protection under the laws of war. However, the Tribunal concluded that the evidence suggested that Germans broadly interpreted the term partisan to justify the execution of all who opposed or in any way impeded the imposition of German rule. Uniformed members of the Red Army at times were labelled as partisans and executed, as were those who were considered \"partisan suspect[s].\"' The conclusion was inescapable according to the Tribunal that the label of partisan was \"a mere cloak under which innocent persons were eradicated.\" The Tribunal concluded that those who gave, drafted or passed down the orders which permitted such arbitrary and illegal executions must bear legal responsibility for the implementation of such orders by their subordinate units .303 The Tribunal confronted a daunting task in attempting to establish the knowledge, authority and actions of various German field com- 300.

He did not disseminate the order. He protested against it and opposed it in every way short of open and defiant refusal to obey it. If his subordinate commanders disseminated it and permitted its enforcement, that is their responsibility and not his.310 Von Leeb, however, was held liable for implementing the Bar- barossa order.

The record shows orders by the defendant, knowledge, ap- proval, and acquiescence in acts by troops under his authority, and by agencies within his area which violated the most elementary duty and obligations owed to prisoners of war and the civilian population by the commander of any occupying army, having command authority and executive power.312 In the Hostage Case, various field commanders were charged with unlawfully, willfully and knowingly committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The defendants allegedly were principals in and accessories to the murder of thousands of civilians in Greece, Yugoslavia, Norway and Albania between September 1939 and May 1945.3'3 The Court followed the other tribunals in rejecting the superior orders defense. It emphasized that the rule against using superior orders as a defense to a criminal act is a principle of fundamental criminal justice which has been overwhelmingly adopted by civilized nations and must be recognized as a rule of international law. The Tribunal observed that members of the militia are only bound to obey lawful orders and they are criminally liable for complying with orders which violate international criminal law. However, it noted that if a soldier did not know and could not reasonably have known that an order was illegal, that individual would be considered to lack criminal intent and not be held criminally liable.314 The Court recognized that it was placing a military commander in the position of choosing between \"possible punishment by his lawless government for the disobedience of the illegal order of his superior officer, or that of lawful punishment for the crime under the law of nations.\" However, \"[t]o choose the former in the hope that victory will cleanse the act of its criminal characteristics manifests only weakness of character and adds nothing to the defense.\" The Tribunal conceded that this rule places an officer in the position of risking the consequences of disobedience. Nevertheless, it was essential that the superior orders defense not be recognized. Otherwise, \"the opposing army would in 312. Id. at 632. 313. Hostage Case, supra note 269, at 1230. 314. Id. at 1236.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG many cases have no protection at all against criminal excesses ordered by, superiors.\"315 The Tribunal in the Hostage Case, like the other panels, emphasized that the defendants were not being subjected to retroactive punishment. Crimes charged and included in Control Council Law No. 10 were declared unlawful both under existing conventions and under the prac- tices of land warfare that have ripened into recognized customs that belligerents are bound to obey. The punishment of these offenses could not be left to the offenders' home state since it was not likely to punish those who were risking their lives in its defense. As a result, concurrent jurisdiction of necessity must be vested in the State where the crime was committed as well as in any belligerent State that has possession of the offenders. The Tribunal thus concluded that \"[i]t cannot be doubted\" that the occupying powers which defeated the Reich and whose belligerents were victims of war crimes possessed jurisdiction to prosecute these criminals for crimes against the law of nations.16 The central events in the Hostage Case occurred in the Balkans. By the end of April 1941, German troops had occupied and were in control of Yugoslavia and Greece. During that summer, partisan bands began to ambush, torture and kill German combatants. Following their attacks, the partisans retreated and melded into the population. While some of the partisans complied with the requirements of the law of war, qualified as lawful belligerents, and were entitled to prisoner of war status, most did not. They generally wore civilian clothes rather than military uni- forms; did not display fixed insignias which were distinguishable from a distance; did not openly carry their arms; and were not under a centralized command.317 The prosecution argued that since Germany had illegally invaded Yugoslavia and Greece, the German occupation troops were not entitled to the respect accorded to a military occupant under international law. The Tribunal ruled that international law does not distinguish between a lawful and an unlawful occupant in regard to the respective duties of the occupant and the population. As a result, those Yugoslav and Greek partisans who did not comply with the rules of the law of war were not entitled to the status of lawful belligerents.18 The major issue involved in the Hostage Case concerned the claim that the German armed forces were entitled to hold civilians hostage 315.

The Germans also claimed the right to execute hostages and captured members of the resistance forces in reprisal for armed attacks and sabotage 319 The Court condemned the law of hostages as a \"barbarous relic of ancient times.\" Nevertheless,, it recognized that hostages may be taken and executed in order to guarantee the peaceful conduct of the population of an occupied territory. The inhabitants owed a duty to cooperate with the occupying authorities and to refrain from attacks against the occupying forces. The utilization of hostages was justified as a mechanism for the occupying power to maintain security, law and order. 320 However, there must be some connection between the population from which the hostages are taken and the crime committed. Hostages may not be seized from a population which explicitly or tacitly lent support to an armed attack upon the occupying power. The occupying power must also issue a proclamation which recites the names and addresses of the hostages taken. The notice must alert the population that the reoccurrence of armed attacks will result in the execution of hostages. The number to be shot must be proportionate to the severity of the attack. In addition, hostages may only be shot as a last resort when all other measures have failed to quell the violence of insurgents. An order of a military commander to kill hostages must be approved by a competent court martial which will determine that all the necessary preconditions have been satisfied .321 The Tribunal also addressed the 319. Id. at 1248-49. A reprisal is a response to any enemy's violation of the laws of war which would otherwise be a violation on one's own side. It is a fundamental rule that a reprisal may not exceed the degree of the criminal act it is designed to correct. Where an excess is knowingly indulged, it in turn is criminal and may be punished .... For the purposes of this opinion the term \"hostages\" will be considered as those persons of the civilian population who are then into custody for the purpose of guaranteeing with their lives the future good conduct of the population of the community from which they were taken. The term \"reprisal prisoners\" will be considered as those individuals who are taken from the civilian population to be killed in retaliation for offenses committed by unknown persons within the occupied area.

In both cases, if the perpetrators are ap- prehended, there is no right to kill innocent members of the population. Excessive reprisals, like the killing of a disproportionate number of hostages, are criminal and guilt attaches to those responsible for their commission.324 The Tribunal observed that the Germans viewed \"terrorism and intimidation\" as the \"accepted solution\" to any and all opposition to the German will. The evidence recites a record of \"killing and de- struction seldom exceeded in modem history.\" Thousands of innocent inhabitants lost their lives by means of a \"firing squad or hangman's noose, people who had the same inherent desire to live as do these defendants.\"325 The defendants, as commanding generals of German field forces, were well aware of these activities. The reports of subordinate units almost \"without exception advised these defendants of the policy of terrorism and intimidation being carried out by units in the field.\" The Tribunal ruled that army commanders were charged with knowl- edge of reports sent to them at their headquarters. Commanders also were assumed to have knowledge of the criminal activities carried out by troops within the area of their command. Military commanders were also held responsible for events occurring in their absence resulting from their orders, directives and general policies.326 -The Tribunal rejected the notion that the rules of war had changed and that the wholesale execution of hostages and the arbitrary reprisals were part of the new concept of total war. The defendants contended tificates; the establishment of restricted areas; limitations of movement; the adoption of curfew regulations; the prohibition of assembly; the detention of suspected persons; restrictions on communication; the imposition of restricitons on food supplies; the evacuation of troublesome areas; the levying of monetary contributions; compulsory labor to repair damage from sabotage; the destruction of property in proximity to the place of the crime; and any other regulation not prohibited by international law that would in all likelihood contribute to the desired result.

It observed that the defendants cannot unilaterally alter the humanitarian law of war.327 Eight of the ten defendants in the Hostage Case were convicted.31 The lead defendant, Wilhelm List, was the fifth ranking field marshal in the German Army. He was the Commander in Chief of the Twelfth Army during the invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece. In addition, in June 1941, he became Armed Forces Commander Southeast with ju- risdiction over the Balkans.329 The Tribunal determined that there was \"conclusive\" evidence that within List's command a large number of reprisals against the populations of occupied territories were carried out on the ratio of one hundred-to-one for each German killed by insurgents and fifty-to-one in the case of each German wounded.330 For the most part, those who were shot were Communists,331 Jews, democrats and nationalists,332 and Gypsies.333 The Tribunal also found clear evidence that List distributed an order from Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces, which authorized the \"killing of hostages and reprisal prisoners to an extent not permitted by international law.\"334 The judicial panel in the Hostage Case ruled that there was little question that an order to take reprisals at an \"arbitrarily fixed ratio under any and all circumstances\" was illegal. Such practice was mo- tivated by revenge rather than by deterrence and was carried out even when the local population was not involved in supporting or shielding terrorists. Most of those executed were arbitrarily selected from in- ternment camps without judicial proceedings. Under these circum- stances, the Tribunal concluded that the Germans' actions were \"nothing less than plain murder.' 335 327. Id. at 1317. 328. Id. at 1318-19. 329. Id. at 1262-63. 330.

Certainly, a field marshal of the German Army with more than forty years of experience as a professional soldier knew or ought to have known that the execution of innocents under these circumstances was criminal. List claimed he was absent from head- quarters at the time the reprisals were reported. However, the Tribunal stressed that as the commanding general of an occupied territory, List was charged with the duty to protect the lives and property of the inhabitants. His own dereliction of duty or absence from headquarters did not relieve him of the responsibility for acts committed in accordance with a policy which he instituted or in which he acquiesced.336 List never condemned these reprisals as unlawful. His failure to terminate these illegal killings and to take adequate steps to prevent their recurrence constitutes a \"serious breach of duty and imposes criminal responsibility.\" According to the Tribunal, instead of taking corrective measures, List \"complacently permitted thousands of in- nocent people to die before execution squads of the Wehrmacht and other armed units operating in the territory.\" The primary responsibility for the prevention and punishment of such crimes lies with the com- manding general. List \"cannot escape responsibility by a claim of want of authority.\"337 The Tribunal rejected the defendants' claim that such actions were justified under the German theory of expediency and military necessity (Kriegsraeson geh vor Kriegsmanier) which superseded established rules of international law. It emphasized that international law must be followed even if this results in the loss of a battle or war. Expedience or necessity cannot justify the violation of the law of war. If adequate troops were not available to control the population and if all lawful measures had failed, List should either have limited his military operations or with- drawn, in whole or in part, from the occupied territories. As the Germans escalated their reprisals, they engendered a counter-reaction which initiated an escalating cycle of violence. The resulting chaos provided \"adequate proof for the necessity of enforcing the laws of war if torture and barbarity are to be restrained.338 In sum, the judges in the Hostage Case stressed that those convicted were guilty of blatant illegal activity.

Altstoetter, the so-called Justice Case, involved the prosecution of Nazi prosecutors, judges and officals in the Ministry of Justice.3\u00b0 The Tribunal initially ruled that its jurisdiction was based on the Allies' assumption of sovereign jurisdiction over Germany. It noted that Germany had unconditionally surrendered and that the Allies had completely occupied Germany and had assumed supreme governmental power.341 The Tribunal observed that this was distinct from an invading army's occupation of enemy territory during armed hostilities. In the latter case, the occupying power is subject to the limitations imposed by the laws and customs of war. The Allies were not subject to these limitations. By reason of the \"complete breakdown of government, industry, agriculture, and supply, they were under an imperative hu- manitarian duty of far wider scope to reorganize government and industry and to foster local democratic governmental agencies through- out the territory.

The rules of land warfare apply to the conduct of a belligerent in occupied territory so long as there is an army in the field attempting to resist the occupation.

The Court went on to argue that Control Council Law No. 10 explicitly authorized prosecution for Crimes Against Humanity directed \"against any civilian population.\"'348 The latter phrase, by implication, includes victims of German citizenship or nationality.349 Control Council Law No. 10 also explicitly anticipated that Allied courts would bring to trial German citizens or nationals accused of committing crimes against persons of German citizenship or nationality.35\u00b0 The Tribunal, however, clarified that Crimes Against Humanity did not encompass an \"isolated crime\" 344.

International law, according to the Court, protected individuals against gross atrocities committed by their own government. The force of circumstance, the grim fact of world-wide in- terdependence, and the moral pressure of public opinion have resulted in international recognition that certain crimes against humanity committed by Nazi authority against German na- tionals constituted violations not alone of. statute but also of common international law.353 The Tribunal rejected the defendants' contention that they were being subjected to retroactive punishment. It held that the prohibition on punishment of acts which were committed prior to the adoption of a criminal statute is not a barrier to prosecution in the international sphere. No world authority was authorized to enact statutes of universal application. International law is the product of multipartite treaties, conventions, judicial decisions and customs which have received inter- national acceptance or acquiescence. It is analogous to the common law which grows on a case-by-case basis. The application of the ret- roactive principle to judical decisions under Control Counicl Law No. 10 would \"strangle the law at birth.\" At any rate, the Nazi defendants certainly knew that their actions were wrong. They did not engage in atrocities because they believed that they were just, but because they believed that the strength of Germany insulated them from legal punishment.354 The essence of the charge in the Justice Case was that the Nazi regime converted the criminal justice system into an instrument of repression and terror. The defendants argued that they were required to obey German law, even when it conflicted with international law. The Tribunal rejected this contention.355 It held that 351. Id. at 973. 352. Id. 353.

Id. at 984.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG [t]he very essence of the prosecution case is that the laws, the Hitlerian decrees and the Draconic, corrupt, and perverted Nazi judicial system themselves constituted the substance of war crime and crimes against humanity and that participation in the enactment and enforcment of them amounts to com- plicity in crime.35 Under the Weimar Republic, the Germans developed a civilized and enlightened system of jurisprudence. The Constitution provided that international law was binding on German courts and provided for an array of civil liberties. Under the Nazi regime, \"substantially every principle of justice which was enunciated in the ...laws and consti- tutional provisions was after 1933 violated by the Hitler regime.\" On February 28, 1933, a decree was promulgated over the signature of President von Hindenburg and Chancellor Hitler which suspended most of the constitutional guarantees of civil and political liberties.357 A series of additonal enactments over the course of the next six years further centralized legal power in the executive. As a result, the entire judicial system was \"transformed into a tool for the propagation of National Socialist ideology, the extermination of opposition ...and the advancement of plans for aggressive war and world conquest.\" The defendants acted with \"knowledge, intent and motive ... in molding the judicial system which they later employed.\" Beginning in 1933, the Ministry of Justice and the courts were equipped for \"terroristic functions in support of the Nazi regime.\" Statutes were drafted which criminalized a broad range of seemingly innocent conduct and the \"power of life and death was ever more broadly vested in the courts.' '358 The Tribunal illustrated the broad discretion which was vested in the judiciary by pointing to the \"Law to Change the Penal Code,\" promulgated on June 28, 1935, by Adolf Hitler. This decree was a complete repudiation of the rule that criminal sanctions should be definite and certain. It directed that an act should be punished regardless of whether a specific penal law can be directly applied to the act so long as it \"deserves punishment according to the fundamental idea of a penal law and the sound concept of the people.\" According to the Tribunal, under this statute,\"[p]arty political ideology and influence 356.

The deliberate listening to foreign radio stations was punishable by hard labor. In- dividuals who intentionally spread reports from foreign radio stations with the intent of undermining German military efficiency were subject to punishment by hard labor and, in severe cases, by death.362 The Nazi regime also adopted a series of laws which discriminated against \"non-Aryans\" and political dissidents living within the Reich. These included restrictions on marriage, sexual relations, property ownership and employment .363 Such statutes were extended to the occupied ter- ritories where they were directed with particular harshness against Jews and Poles.364 Conversely, members of the Nazi Party were accorded favored treatment under the law.-65 The German legal system was based on the so-called \"Fuehrer principle.\" This rested on a view that Hitler had absolute and incon- testable power. Hitler not only was the \"supreme legislator, he also was the \"supreme judge.\" He claimed the right to remove from office or to punish those who failed to render unqualified obedience to the Reich .366 Judges were viewed as an extension of Hitler and were obligated to \"judge like the Fuehrer.''367 Hitler did not hesitate to intervene to dictate their decisions and sentences or to order the execution of those sentenced to prison.31 The Ministry of Justice also exerted \"constant pressure upon judges in favor of more severe or more discriminatory administration of justice. \"369 The Ministry called the judges' attention to their brethren's decisions which allegedly reflected undue solicitude 359.

Those who insisted on maintaining their judicial independence continued to administer justice with a \"measure of im- partiality and moderation.\" Their judgments were usually set aside on appeal by prosecutors. Those they sentenced were invariably turned over to the Gestapo on the completion of their prison terms and then were shot or sent to a concentration camp. These judges were subjected to criticism and threats and were eventually removed from office. In the other category were those judges who fanatically enforced the dictates of the Nazi Party.

It observed that it was \"unable to say ... that life imprisonment for habitual criminals is a salutary and reasonable punishment in America in peace times, but that the imposition of the death penalty was a crime against humanity in Germany when the nation was in the throes of war.\" The Tribunal observed that the same considerations applied in the case of looting and to a lesser extent to hoarders and violators of war economy decrees. Anyone who has ob- served \"the utter devastation of the great cities of Germany must realize that the safety of the civilian population demanded that the werewolves who roamed the streets of the burning cities, robbing the dead, and plundering the ruined homes should be severely punished.\" The Nazis' limitations on freedom of speech were characterized by the Tribunal as \"revolting.\" However, it noted that even under the Constitution of the United States, a citizen is not wholly free to attack the Gov- ernment or to interfere with the Government's military aims in a time of war. The Court queried: \"[clan we then say that in the throes of total war and in the presence of impending disaster those officials who enforced these savage laws in a last desperate effort to stave off defeat were guilty of crimes against humanity?\"'0 These statutes and decisions were not tainted by the fact that Germany was waging a war of aggression. There was no evidence that the defendants were aware that the war which they were supporting was in violation of international law. However, the extension of liability to judicial officials for waging a war of aggression would dangerously expand the scope of criminal liability.381 If we should adopt the view that by reason of the fact that the war was a criminal war of aggression every act which would have been legal in a defensive war was illegal in this one, we would be forced to the conclusion that every soldier who marched under orders into occupied territory or who fought in the homeland was a criminal and a murderer.

Id.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG of guilt in any case would become a mere formality.82 The Tribunal did condemn the action of Reich prosecutors who perverted the law to charge defendants with high treason for acts such as attempting to escape from the Reich. The indictments in the latter cases alleged that the defendants had attempted to detach the (illegally) annexed Polish territory from the Reich. Under such a theory, \"every Polish soldier from the occupied territories fighting for the restoration to Poland of territory belonging to it would be guilty of high treason against the Reich and on capture, could be shot. The theory of the Reich prosecutors carries with it its own refutation.\" The prosecution for high treason in such cases constituted a War Crime and a Crime Against Humanity. The wrong was not \"merely in misnaming the offense of attempting to escape from the Reich; the wrong was in falsely naming the act high treason and thereby invoking the death penalty for a minor offense.\" The defendants were also charged with partic- ipation in the execution of the Night and Fog Decree (Nacht und Nebd Erlass or NN). Under the Night and Fog program civilians in occupied countries who were allegedly involved in resistance activities against the German occupying forces were seized, furtively deported and secretly prosecuted before special courts. The location and fate of the deportees were kept secret. After serving their sentence, the deportees were handed over to the Gestapo and thousands were subjected to ill-treatment, murder and torture.383 The Night and Fog Decree was part of a plan by Hitler to combat resistance movements in the occupied territories. Its \"enforcement brought about a systematic rule of violence, brutality, outrage, and terror against the civilian. populations of territories overrun and occupied by the Nazi armed forces.384 A number of the defendants with full knowledge of the illegality of the plan or scheme under international law of war and with full knowledge of the in- tended terrorism, cruelty, and other inhumane principles of the plan or scheme became either a principal, or aided and abetted, or took a consenting part in, or were connected with the execution of the illegal, cruel, and inhumane plan or scheme .385 382.

They were secretly tried and denied the right to counsel of their own choice and occasionally were not provided with any counsel. In many instances, no indictment was served and the accused only learned of the nature of the charged offense a few moments prior to trial. The entire proceeding and record were secret.388 The Tribunal concluded that the evidence provides \"undeniable and positive proof\" of the \"ill-treatment\" of those seized under the Night and Fog Decree. It observed that those who respect human rights and dignity can \"hardly believe that the Nazi judicial system could possibly have been so cruel and ruthless in their treatment of the population of occupied areas and territories.'89 A further charge against the defendants was carrying out a Nazi plan for the persecution and extermination of Jews and Poles. Some of the defendants enacted laws and decrees which were intended to facilitate the extermination of Poles and Jews in Germany and through- out Europe. Others enforced these laws while those who served as judges \"distorted and then applied the laws and decrees against Poles and Jews as such in disregard of every principle of judicial behavior. \"390 Jews were excluded from every activity and their property was confis- cated.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal observed that legal personnel substantially contributed to the final solution. In 1942, for instance, over sixty thousand people were convicted under special procedures applicable to Poles and Jews.393 Judicial officials were aware that political prisoners sentenced to prison were transferred to the custody of the SS394 and interned in concentration camps where they were tortured and murdered.395 The defendants contended that they remained in the Ministry of Justice because they feared that if they resigned the judical system would be taken over by Himmler and the Gestapo. This defense, according to the Tribunal, could not have relieved the defendants of responsibility for having perpetrated war crimes in the occupied ter- ritories as well as crimes against humanity in Germany and abroad.396 Nine of the ten defendants were convicted.97 Defendant Franz Schlegelberger was a judge and later pursued a career in the Ministry of Justice. He was placed in charge of the Ministry in 1941.398 Schle- gelberger was an ardent proponent of the Reich legal theory that an act should be punished despite the fact that it was not legally proscribed so long as it was contrary to the \"basic concepts of criminal law and the sound instincts of the people.\"399 Under this conception of the law, the judge could exercise his discretion to decide what constituted a criminal offense. This \"destroyed the feeling of legal security and created an atmosphere of terrorism.\"40\u00b0 Schlegelberger signed the order of February 1942 under which the Ministry of Justice assumed responsibility for the prosecution, and disposition of the victims of Hitler's Night and Fog Decree.

He also quashed proceedings brought against government officials for misconduct.4\u00b0s Schlegelberger's defense was that he feared that if he resigned, a Nazi zealot was likely to be appointed as head of the Ministry of Justice. In fact, his fears were valid. His successor, Otto Georg Thireack permitted the police to \"usurp the functions of the administration of justice and murdered untold thousands of Jews and political prisoners.\" Nevertheless, the Tribunal rejected Schlegelberger's claim. Schlegel- berger and the other defendants who raised this defense \"took over the dirty work which the leaders of the State demanded, and employed the Ministry of Justice as a means for exterminating the Jewish and Polish populations, terorizing the inhabitants of occupied countries, and wiping out political opposition at home.\" This \"prostitution of a judical system\" involves an element of \"evil\" which is more damaging to the legitimacy of the State than results from \"frank atrocities which do not sully judicial robes. '\"\" In the end, Schlegelberger resigned his post. Despite his criminal activities, the Tribunal noted that he bore an \"unmerited reputation as the last of the German jurists.\" Although Schlegelberger \"loathed the evil\" for which he was responsible, the Tribunal castigated him for selling his intellect and ability to Hitler for a \"mass of political pottage and for the vain hope of personal security.\"45 The defendant Rudolf Oeschey was imprisoned for life.46 Oeschey joined the Nazi Party in 1931 and in 1939, he was appointed to the office of senior judge of the district court at Nuremberg. He was later appointed district court director of the same court and presided over the Special Court at Nuremberg.407 In February 1945, as Germany faced imminent defeat, a law was passed establishing civilian court martial within Germany.

At the time of his trial, Montgelas was in the sick ward and was being detained in solitary confinment. On April 5, Montgelas was summoned before a court martial, sentenced to death and was shot the next day. Montgelas' crime was that he allegedly remarked to a woman in a hotel that Hitler's name actually was Schickelgruber. Montgelas also purportedly expressed approval of the assassination attempt on Hitler's life. Despite assurrances that he would be informed of his client's trial, Montgelas' lawyer was not contacted. The woman with whom Montgelas conversed was not permitted to appear as a rebuttal witness on behalf of Montgelas. The only pros- ecution witness was an SS officer who had been shadowing the Count for several days in an attempt to secure evidence against him. The officer allegedly was able to overhear the conversation from an adjoining room through the use of a mechanical listening device.40 The Tribunal noted that Montgelas' prosecution for remarks hostile to the Nazi regime did not constitue a violation of Control Council Law No. 10. However, it observed that Montgelas was not convicted for undermining the security of the weakened Reich. Instead, the \"law was deliberately invoked ...and enforced by Oeschey as a last vengeful act of political prosecution.'\" This was only one of many instances in which Oeschey enforced the law in an \"arbitrary and brutal manner shocking to the conscience of mankind.\" Prosecutors characterized Oeschey as a brutal judge who was overtly discriminatory towards Poles. He frequently admonished Polish defendants during trial that they deserved to be exterminated.410 Oswald Rothaug was director of the district court in Nuremberg from April 1937 to May 1943. His rabidly anti-Polish and anti-Jewish attitudes were reflected in his decisions41' and he candidly encouraged judges to discriminate against such defendants.411 In the cases over which he presided, Rothaug interpreted the facts and flexibly applied procedures so as to insure the conviction of defendants.413 In 1942, Rothaug sentenced Leo Katzenberger, a sixty-eight year old Jewish merchant to death for racial pollution.

The photographer then was charged with perjury, which precluded her from continuing to testify in Katzenberger's defense.4\"4 A medical examiner failed to find evidence of sexual intercourse. Rothaug observed that this was irrelevant since it was sufficient that a German woman had sat on the defendant's lap. Based on this act alone the examiner stated that he planned to sentence Katzenberger to death.45 Rothaug also ruled, without supporting evidence, that Katzen- berger had visited the photographer during air raid blackouts while her husband was at the military front. This resulted in Katzenberger's conviction for exploiting the conditions of warfare.46 Based on Katz- enberger and other cases, the Tribunal concluded: From the evidence it is clear that these trials lacked the essential elements of legality. In these cases the defendant's court, in spite of the legal sophistries which he employed, was merely an instrument in the program of the leaders of the Nazi State of persecution and extermination. That the number the de- fendant could wipe out within his competency was smaller than the number involved in the mass perceptions and ex- terminations by the leaders whom he served, does not mitigate his contribution to the program of those leaders. His acts were more terrible in that those who might have hoped for a last refuge in the institutions of justice found these institutions turned against them and a part of the program of terror and oppression.417 By his manner and methods he made his court an instru- mentality of terror and won the fear and hatred of the pop- ulation. From the evidence of his closest associates as well as his victims, we find that Oswald Rothaug represented in Germany the personification of the secret Nazi intrigue and cruelty.

The Ministries Case The Ministries Case involved the prosecution of members of the German diplomatic corps and others involved in international affairs. 49 The Tribunal in the Ministries Case proclaimed that it was not organized for the purpose of \"wreaking vengeance upon the conquered\" by arbitrarily subjecting the defendants to a \"firing squad, the scaffold, or the prison camp.\" The Tribunal stressed that it intended to ad- judicate the defendants' guilt justly and that it would not hold the German defendants to \"standards of duty and responsibility which are not equally applicable to the officials of the Allied Powers and to those of all nations.\" Nor should the Germans be convicted for \"acts or conducts which, if committed by Americans, British, French, or Rus- sians would not subject them to legal trial and conviction.''2 Still, the Court, like the other post-Nuremberg war crimes tri- bunals, stressed that the contours of international law were broad and elastic. It stated that in formulating the relevant standards it would rely upon treaties, covenants, treatises and the principles which \"lie beneath and back of\" these documents. It stressed that it would not \"hesitate, after having determined what they are, to apply them to new or different situations. It is by this very means that all legal codes, civil or criminal have developed.' '421 The Tribunal initially addressed the justifiability of holding those who planned, initiated or waged an aggressive war criminally liable. Either this liability was consistent with the pre-existing principles of international law or it was a new and arbitrary innovation clearly intended to facilitate the prosecution and conviction of the Nazi de- fendants. The Tribunal stressed that monarchs and States who \"con- sidered themselves civilized, have for centuries recognized that aggressive wars and invasions violated the law of nations.' '422 418.

The initiation of wars and invasions with their attendant horror and suffering has for centuries been universally recognized by all civilized nations as wrong, to be resorted to only as a last resort to remedy wrongs already or imminently to be inflicted. We hold that aggressive wars and invasions have, since time immemorial, been a violation of international law, even though specific sanctions were not provided.423 Armed force, according to the Tribunal, was only justified in self- defense. This limited exception was necessary since the failure to offer resistance might result in a nation being overrun and occupied before the invasion could be condemned and countered by an international authority.44 The Tribunal stressed that once the attack was rebuffed, inter- national law permitted the prosecution of those responsible for initiating the aggression. It further stressed that such individuals no longer should be able to find shelter behind the discarded and disreputable theories that the \"King can do no wrong,\" and that \"war is the sport of Kings.\" In the case of Germany, the Tribunal observed that the guilt of Nazi leaders was not lessened by the fact that the German invasion of Poland was supported by the Soviet Union. It has \"never been suggested that a law duly passed becomes ineffective when it transpires that one of the legislators whose vote enacted it was himself guilty of the same practice or that he himself intended, in the future, to violate the law. '425 The Nazi Regime was charged with launching a series of aggressive wars between March 1938 and December 1941 .426 The defendants claimed that these invasions were not aggressive acts. Instead, they claimed that these were justified attempts to readjust the onerous terms of the Versailles Treaty. However, the Tribunal observed that at some point territorial boundaries must be considered as having been settled. It also noted that Hitler had informed the world that Germany had no claims on other nations and had entered into treaties of peace and 423. Id. at 319. 424. Id. 425. Id. at 321-23. 426. Id. These aggressive incursions include Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, United Kingdom and France, Denamark and Norway, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, Yugoslavia and Greece, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States. Id.[Vol. 3:1 OTHER NUREMBERG non-aggression with Austria, France, Czechoslovakia and Poland. The subsequent breach of these treaties constituted a violation of interna- tional law.421 No German could ...look upon war or invasion to recover part or all of the territories of which Germany had been deprived by the Treaty of Versailles as other than aggressive. To excuse aggressive acts after these treaties and assurances took place is merely to assert that no treaty and no assurance by Germany is binding and that the pledged word of Germany is valueless. It is therefore particularly unfortunate both for the present and future of the German people that such a defense should be raised as it tends to create doubt when, if at all, the nations of the world can place reliance upon German international obligations.428 The Tribunal dismissed the defendants' claim that Germany was acting in self-defense as disingenuous. The \"robber or the murderer cannot claim self-defense, in attacking the police to avoid arrest or those who, he fears, disapprove of his criminal conduct and hope that he will be apprehended and brought to justice.''4 29The panel observed that the invasions had transformed Germany into an \"international outlaw and every peaceable nation had the right to oppose it without itself becoming an aggressor, to help the attacked and join with those who had previously come to the aid of the Victim.\" 30 However, the Tribunal stressed that only those defendants who acted with the knowledge that Germany was acting illegally would be held liable under the aggressive war charge. Our task is to determine which, if any, of the defendants, knowing there was an intent to so initiate and wage aggressive war, consciously participated in either plans, preparations, initiations of those wars, or so knowing, participated or aided in carrying them on. Obviously, no man may be condemned for fighting in what he believes is the defense of his native land, even though his belief be mistaken. Nor can he be expected to undertake an independent investigation to deter- mine whether or not the cause for which he fights is the result of an aggressive act of his own government. One can be guilty 427. Id. at 324. 428. Id. at 324-25. 429. Id. at 336. 430. Id.19921 IND. INT'L & CoMP. L. REV. only where knowledge of aggression in fact exists, and it is not sufficient that he have suspicions that the war is aggressive .4 The Tribunal added that those who concealed criminal activity or destroyed or suppressed evidence or who manufactured evidence tending to prove their government's innocence would be considered an accessory to war crimes.432 The complete blame could not be fairly placed on Hitler. The elaborate and complex Nazi programs of aggression and ex- ploitation were not self-executing, but their success was de- pendent upon the devotion and skill of men holding positions of authority in the various departments of the Reich govern- ment. The defendants claim that they supported Hitler's pol- icies due to coercion or duress was not credible. They could have resigned their positions without suffering any repercus- sions. But, even when presented with the opportunity, the defendants chose to remain mute and did not express even mild dissent. The fact is, that for varying reasons each said as little as he could, and when he expressed dissent, did so in words which were as soft and innocuous as he could find.433 The Tribunal convicted those defendants who had assisted the Nazi Party in Austria to undermine the government,434 helped to formulate Hitler's aggressive war plans,435 and developed policies concerning the administration of the occupied territories.436 Defendant Paul Koerner, who was Goering's deputy in administering the Four Year Plan and a member of the Central Planning Board which directed the war effort between 1942 and 1945, was convicted of planning and preparing wars of aggression. According to the Tribunal, Koerner was aware that the Four Year Plan was intended to prepare Germany for war437 and was informed of Germany's specific plans to invade various countries.438 431. Id. at 337. Knowledge of the aggressive nature of Hitler's wars and invasions is an essential element of guilt under the charge of Crimes Against Peace.

Von Weizaecker entered the Foreign Office in 1920 and rose in 1938 to the rank of State Secretary. He was second only to Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop. Although von Weizaecker was not present at the confer- ences at which Hitler announced his plans for aggressive wars, for the most part, he was aware of the Fuehrer's intentions. Von Weizaecker contended that despite his apparent cooperation with the Nazi regime, he continuously opposed and undermined the Government which he served.49 According to von Weizaecker, he was convinced that Hitler's policies would lead to \"death, disaster and destruction.\"\"140 Despite the fact that the price of open opposition was likely to be death, the Tribunal rejected the defense that good intentions render innocent that which is otherwise crim- inal, and which asserts that one may with impunity commit serious crimes, because he hopes thereby to prevent others, or that general benevolence toward individuals is a cloak or justification for participation in crimes against the unknown many.4' The Tribunal determined that in some cases that von Weizaecker, in fact, was not informed of Hitler's aggressive plans.442 In other instances, von Weizaecker wrote memoranda to von Ribbentrop op- posing the invasions and warned the Allies of the need to act against Germany.\"3 However, in the case of Czechoslovakia, the Tribunal determined that he deliberately misled the Western Powers as to Ger- many's aggressive intent.\"4 Von Weizaecker was also aware of and opposed the plan to invade the Soviet Union. However, when he met with the Russian Ambassador, he did not inform the diplomat of Hitler's plans.

Consent was not required in occupied France, the Low Countries, Poland, the Baltic states, Denmark and the occupied Russian territories. In the latter areas, the Jews were merely seized and deported to the death camps. In these cases, the Foreign Office was responsibile for responding to inquiries and protests from the international community.451 Those prosecuted under this count participated in every phase of ethnic persecution yet tried to justify their acts as being motivated by lofty goals. These justifications, however, were unacceptable to the Tribunal. Both State Secretary von Weizaecker452 and Ernst Woermann, Under Secretary of State and head of the Political Department,453 approved the illegal deportation to Auchwitz of 6,000 \"stateless\" Jews living in France in 1942.454 The Tribunal ruled that the defendants had a duty to protest this action.455 Von Weizaecker explained that he remained in office in order to gather intelligence for opposition groups 445.

I It is asserted that international law is a matter wholly outside the work, interest, and knowledge of private individuals. The distinction is unsound. International law, as such, binds every citizen just as does ordinary municipal law. Acts adjudged criminal when done by an officer of the government are criminal also when done by a private individual. The guilt differs only in magnitude, not in quality. The offender in either case is charged with personal wrong and punishment falls on the offender in propria persona. The application of international law to individuals is no novelty. ...There is no justification for a limitation of responsibility to public officials.481 Thus, international law \"may ...limit the obligations which indi- viduals owe to their states, and create for them international obligations which are binding upon them to an extent that they must be carried out even if to do so violates a positive law or directive of state.'482 Although consistent with domestic law, medical experiments on con- centration camp inmates were adjudged to be contrary to the principles of the law of nations. In the Medical Case, the Tribunal convicted those responsible for subjecting inmates to medical experimentation involving brutalities, torture, disability, injury and death. Likewise, in the Justice Case, the Tribunal stressed that those judicial officials who participated in the enactment and enforcement of the Nazi decrees were guilty under international law for complicity in a crime against humanity.3 The prerogatives of members of the military also are restricted by inter- national law.

The Allies sought retribution for the deaths of those soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the war against fascism.486 The Einsatzgruppen Tribunal nevertheless stressed that the trial was not an exercise in \"victors' justice.\" According to the Tribunal, the defendants were \"in court not as members of a defeated nation but because they are charged with crime. They are being tried because they are accused of having offended against society itself, and society, as represented by international law, has summoned them for explanation. '\"I The Allies anticipated that the conviction of the German leadership would deter those who might contemplate lawless behavior in the future.4\" An equally important Allied goal was to educate the German people concerning the excesses of the Nazi regime so that they would appreciate the dangers of to- talitarianism. The hope was that this would heighten their vigilance against a repetition of such events.49 These trials are not only to render justice in acordance with the rules of law and humanity, but they are also to serve the purpose of acquainting the German people with the true char- acter of the false gods they idolized and blindly followed. The German people must be enlightened on all the arrogance, conceit, pusillanimity, and brutality which went into the SS uniform. The German people must learn what pigmies (sic) rattled about in the big black boots of the Rottenfuehrer, Hauptscharfuehrer, Sturmscharfuehrer, and Obergruppen- fuehrer. They will then demand in the future a show of worth, of religion, of honesty, of fundamental decency in a man before accepting him as a leader.49 At the conclusion of the WVHA Case, the Tribunal concluded with some optimism that \"[a]mid her sorrow and wreckage, Germany has learned her lesson never to trust again those who would lead her to felicity over the corpses of decency, dignity, justice, and equality be- tween man and man.'\"49 485.

Any other approach would make a mockery of international law and would result in wrongs quite as serious and fatal as those which were sought to be remedied.4 The tribunals adopted the guiding principle that in order to es- tablish individual criminal liability, the prosecution was required to demonstrate the intentional commission of a criminal act or the wanton failure to fulfill a legal duty. A defendant was not presumed to be culpable merely because those under his command engaged in criminal conduct. The prosecution was required to demonstrate \"personal der- ilection. That can occur only where the act is directly traceable to him or where his failure to properly supervise his subordinates constitutes criminal negligence on his part.\" In the High Command Case the Tribunal stated that \"[a]ny other interpretation of international law would go far beyond the basic principles of criminal law as known to civilized nations. \"91 Liability for a crime against peace was limited to those at the policy-level who knowingly participated in the preparation, planning, initiation, or waging of an aggressive war. High echelon officials \"use[d] the great mass of the soldiers and officers to carry out an international crime.\" Those below this level, on the other hand, did not possess the power to shape and influence policy. They were described as the mere \"instruments\" of the policy-makers who, in all fairness, should not be held criminally liable.494 The Farben panel expressed the fear that the extension of liability for waging a war of aggression below the policy level would inevitably lead to the mass punishment of the German 492.

REV. people.495 The punishment would extend to the \"private soldier on the battlefield, the farmer who increased his production of foodstuffs to sustain the armed forces, or the housewife who conserved fats for the making of munitions.\"4 The role of intent in determining the liability of decision-makers for Crimes Against Peace can be seen by contrasting the disposition of defendants Krauch and Koerner. Karl Krauch was one of the top executives in I.G. Farben and supervised the development of the Nazi regime's chemical production. Despite Krauch's involvement in rearm- ing the Reich, the judicial panel in the Farben Case determined that he lacked the criminal intent to prepare Germany for an aggressive war. He was not a military expert and, according to the Tribunal, may have believed that his activities were designed to help protect Germany against a possible attack by its European neighbors.497 The evidence is clear that Krauch did not participate in the planning of aggressive wars. The plans were made by and within a closely guarded circle. The meetings were secret. The information exchanged was confidential. Krauch was far beneath membership in that circle. No opportunity was af- forded to him to participate in the planning , either in a general way or with regard to any of the specific wars charged in count one.498 In contrast, in the Ministries Case, defendant Paul Koerner was convicted of preparing for a war of aggression. Koerner coordinated the Reich's economic Four Year Plan intended to ready the nation for war. The Tribunal emphasized that Koerner held several high governmental positions, participated in high-level discussions of Germany war plans and was aware that his activities were designed to permit the Reich to launch illegal wars of aggression.4 The intent requirement was less difficult to establish in the case of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity. The American War Crimes tribunals ruled that inhumane acts such as murder, deportation, enslavement and persecution on the basis of racial and religious grounds \"shock[ed] the conscience of every decent man\" and were obviously illegal. As a result, individuals who participated in such conduct cannot 495. Farben Case, supra note 72, at 1126. 496. Id. at 1124-25. 497. Id. at 1113. 498. Id. at 1110. 499.

Control Council Law No. 10, which purported to codify the existing principles of international law, extended culpability to individuals who acted as a principle or as an accessory or who ordered or abetted or who were connected with plans or enterprises involving the commission of such offenses.50' Liability thus attached to all those involved in furthering War Crimes and Crimes Against Peace. The Tribunal in the WVHA Case pointed out that: An elaborate and complex operation, such as the deportation and extermination of the Jews and the appropriation of all their property, is obviously a task for more than one man. Launching or promulgating such a program may originate in the mind of one man or a group of men. Working out the details of the plan may fall to another. Procurement of per- sonnel and the issuing of actual operational orders may fall to others. The actual execution of the plan in the field involves the operation of another, or it may be several other persons or groups. Marshaling and distributing loot, or allocating the victims, is another phase of the operation which may be entrusted to an individual or a group far removed from the original planners\u00b0.501 The tribunals thus broadly interpreted the scope of liability for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity. In the Flick Case, defen- dants Friedrich Flick and Otto Steinbrinck were convicted of being accessories to the crimes committed by the SS. Both were members of Himmler's \"Circle of Friends\" and voluntarily contributed substantial funds to the organization.503 The Tribunal determined that both Flick and Steinbrinck must have known of the organization's activities and that it is \"immaterial whether it was spent on salaries or for lethal gas.'\" '0Defendant Guenther Joel in the Justice trial was attorney general of the court of appeals in Hamm whose jurisdiction encompassed West- phalia.505 In this capacity, Joel supervised the prosecutors who handled 500.

[The] fact that Joel did not actually try the Night and Fog cases himself has no significance. He did supervise the men who tried and had executed some of them and imprisoned others and transferred others who were not guilty of any crime or who had served their sentence, to the Gestapo and con- centration camps.507 The tribunals also held the defendants liable for the independent actions of those under their command in those cases in which the panels determined that the defendants should have been aware of their sub- ordinates' actions. Karl Mummenthey was administrator of the com- mercial enterprises controlled by the SS which deployed concentration camp labor.5\u00b01 Mummenthey denied that he was aware of the harsh conditions in which the workers were forced to work. Nevertheless, he was convicted. The Tribunal ruled that Mummenthey's \"assertions that he did not know what was happening in the labor camps and enterprises under his jurisdiction does not exonerate him. It was his duty to know.\"509 For the most part, however, the tribunals were reluctant to attribute knowledge to defendants absent concrete proof. Farben executives were not held liable for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity for supplying large quantities of Zyklon-B gas to the SS concentration camps. The Tribunal noted that there was a need for insecticides wherever large numbers of displaced persons were confined in congested quarters which lacked adequate sanitary facilities.510 The panel in the Farben Case also determined that Farben executives were not aware that the vaccines that they provided were being used in medical experiments on concentration camp inmates .51 Those with authority and power who possessed actual or construc- tive knowledge of criminal activity committed by those under their command were charged with an affirmative duty to prevent such actions. Karl Brandt ranked next to Hider in the medical field and was in a 506. Id. at 1138. 507. Id. 508. WVHA Case, supra note 170, at 1051-52. 509. Id. at 1055. 510.

The Tribunal ruled that Brandt possessed a duty to intervene to halt such atrocities.512 It does not appear that at any time he took any steps to check medical experiments upon human subjects. During the war he visited several concentration camps. Occupying the position he did, and being a physician of ability and experience, the duty rested upon him to make some adequate investigation concerning the medical experiments which he knew had been, were being, and doubtless would continue to be, conducted in the concentration camps.513 In contrast, the tribunals ruled that staff officers lacked command authority over their subordinates and did not incur criminal respon- sibility for transmitting illegal orders. However, they were culpable if they drafted an illegal military order or made a special effort to insure that the order was distributed to those units who carried it out.514 Hermann Foertsch served as chief of staff to various generals during the Nazi invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece.515 In this position, Foertsch passed on various orders instructing subordinate units to take hostages and to exact reprisals.516 Nevertheless, the tribunal in the Hostage Case acquitted him of war crimes. That he had knowledge of the doing of acts which we have herein held to be unlawful under international law cannot be doubted .... The evidence fails to show the commission of an unlawful act which was the result of any action, affirmative or passive, on the part of this defendant. His mere knowledge of the happening of unlawful acts does not meet the require- ments of criminal law. He must be one who orders, abets, or takes a consenting part in the crime. We cannot say that the defendant met the foregoing requirements as to partici- pation. We are required to say therefore that the evidence does not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Foertsch is guilty on any of the counts charged.517 Thus, those who knew of illegal activity, but who lacked authority and power over such actions were not held criminally liable.

Erdmannsdorff was deputy chief of the Political Division in the Foreign Office under von Ribbentrop.18 The Tribunal in the Ministries Case ruled that von Erdmannsdorff was not liable for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity based upon his knowledge of the atrocities directed against the Jews.519 That von Erdmannsdorff had knowledge of the crimes against humanity committed against the Jews, and the persecution of the churches, we have no doubt. But a careful examination of the evidence reveals little or nothing more. It is far from enough to justify a conviction. The deputy chief of the Political Division, particularly under the von Ribbentrop regime, had little or no influence. He was subordinated to the Under Secretary of State of the Foreign Office, and he was little more than a chief clerk.520 Despite their failure to hold that individuals who lacked power and authority to influence and shape policy were under a legal duty to intervene, the American tribunals were not willing to exculpate such individuals from a moral duty to act: We do not hesitate to state that it would have been eminently desirable had the commanders of the German armed forces refused to implement the policy of the Third Reich by means of aggressive war. It would have been creditable to them not to contribute to the cataclysmic catastrophe. This would have been the honorable and righteous thing to do; it would have been in the interest of their State. Had they done so they would have served their fatherland and humanity also.521 The American war crimes tribunals made a major contribution to clarifying the concept of Crimes Against Humanity. Unlike the Nu- remberg Charter, Control Council Law No. 10 did not require that Crimes Against Humanity be \"in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiciton of the Tribunal.' '522 In the Justice Case, the Tribunal noted that this limitation had been \"deliberately omitted from the definition. \"523 The omission of this phrase permitted 518.

The judicial panel also noted that international concern with States' treatment of their own citizenry is not a recent phenomenon. The Tribunal cited precedents such as English, French and Russian intervention to halt the commission of atrocities during the Greco- Turkish war in 1827 and President Martin Van Buren's intercession with the Sultan of Turkey in 1840 on behalf of the persecuted Jews of Damascus and Rhodes.525 Crimes Against Humanity were limited to the \"wholesale and systematic violation of life and liberty.' '526 They were not interpreted as including isolated and sporadic acts for which a state's criminal code makes \"adequate provision.527 State involvement also was required. It is the \"indifference, impotency or complicity\" of the State which necessitates international jurisdiction .528 International jurisdiction over Crimes Against Humanity was also premised on the enormity of these offenses being such that they were considered to be directed against and pose a threat to humanity rather than against any particular country. The classic example is the crime of genocide529 and other large- scale and systematic governmental persecutions founded on poltical, racial, and religious grounds.53\u00b0 The defendants unsuccessfully proferred several theories to justify the commission of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.

As noted in the Hostage Case, \"international law makes no distinction between a lawful and an unlawful occupant in dealing with the respective duties of occupant and population in [an] occupied territory.\"'53' The Tribunal noted that: There is no reciprocal connection between the manner of the military occupation of territory and the rights and duties of the occupant and population to each other after the relationship has in fact been established. Whether the invasion was lawful or criminal is not an important factor in the consideration of this subject.532 The defendants also argued that the law of war had been rendered largely irrelevant by the new conception of total war. They argued that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the aerial raids upon Dresden in Germany \"afford[ed] a pattern for the conduct of modern war and a possible justification for the criminal acts of these defendants.' 53 However, the panel in the Hostage Case pointed out that Germany and its allies had first breached the limits of the law of war at Rotterdam, Warsaw, Belgrade, Coventry and Pearl Harbor. The defendants' unilateral decision to disregard the law of war did not establish a consensus that international legal restraints on the use of force should be relaxed.534 This would permit any State to claim that it was justified in disregarding international law.535 At any rate, the panel in the Einsatzgruppen Case noted that there is a significant difference between the incidental killing of civilians during a bombing attack and the deliberate and indiscriminate killing of Jews and Poles.536 Nor may a State claim that it may violate the humanitarian law of war based on the violations being necessary to subdue the enemy. \"[S]uch a view would eliminate all humanity and decency and all law from the conduct of war and it is a contention which this Tribunal repudiates as contrary to the accepted usages of civilized nations.'537 The tribunals also rejected the claim that Germany was acting in self- defense in exterminating the Jews who allegedly posed a bolshevist threat to Germany.

'538 A number of defendants claimed they were merely obeying the orders of their superiors in carrying out Germany's unlawful policies. The tribunals, however, emphasized that only lawful orders bind in- dividuals. No person may escape criminal liability by obeying a com- mand which a reasonable person would realize manifestly violates international law and outrages fundamental concepts of justice. Obe- dience to an order may mitigate, but cannot justify, the commission of a crime. It may only serve as a defense in those cases in which the defendant could not reasonably have been expected to know of the order's illegality. In such cases, the defendant is not deemed to possess the requisite criminal intent.539 Of course, this rule places the combatant in a difficult position, particularly when he is in an army headed by a ruthless dictator. He must make a choice \"between possible punishment by his lawless government for the disobedience of the illegal order of his superior officer, or that of lawful punishment for the crime under the law of nations.''540 Absent this rule, an \"opposing army would in many cases have no protection at all against criminal excesses ordered by super- iors. \"4' Recognition of the superior orders defense also would mean that only those at the top would be held criminally liable while those who carried out their leaders' criminal designs would escape punish- ment.

Any one ordered to perform a patently illegal and inhuman act is charged by law to protest the order to the extent of his ability, short of endangering his own security. If he fails to do so he will be required to answer for the execution of the illegal act. Whether it be an order calling for the killing of an innocent people or the taking of property from innocent proprietors, the rule is the same. By the promulgation and enforcement of this rule, some dignity is being restored to the human race.544 Defendants also were not entitled to pose as a defense the contention that others would have obeyed the illegal order had they refused to carry it out. A defendant must assume responsibility for his own actions and is not entitled to speculate as to the possible conduct of others.545 In addition, the tribunals found unconvincing the defendants' claims that they believed that the policies of the Reich were legal.546 Many were \"old and experienced\" soldiers who were \"well acquainted\" with the humanitarian law of war.5417 The tribunals also ruled that it is no defense to criminal activity that an individual was engaged in resistance activity against the Nazi regime. Defendant Wolfram Sievers was acting head of the Ahnenerbe Society which was devoted to research on racial questions.548 In this capacity, he funded and supplied those engaged in medical experi- mentation on concentration camp internees.549 Sievers claimed that he served as Reich Business Manager of the Ahnenerbe society so that he could be close to Himmler in order to help a secret resistance movement to plot the assassination of both Hitler and Himmleri. He allegedly remained in this position on the advice of his resistance leader in order to gain vital information which would hasten the overthrow of the Nazi government. The Tribunal rejected Sievers' contention that his resistance activity justified his criminal activity: \"It certainly is not the law that a resistance worker can commit no crime, and least of all, against the very people he is supposed to be protecting.\"550 Good 544.

The defendant had his opportunity to join those who refused to do the evil bidding of an evil master, but he cast it aside and his professed repentance now comes too late.552 The American war crimes tribunals also established the standard for the defense of necessity under international law. The defense may be invoked by an individual who commits a criminal act in order to avoid what they reasonably believe to be a threat of imminent bodily harm or death.553 This threat must overpower the will of the accused and compel him to commit a crime which he otherwise would not have committed. If the will of the accused is not overpowered, \"but instead coincides with the will of those from whom the alleged compulsion emanates, there is no necessity justifying the illegal conduct.'554 In the Krupp Case, the Tribunal determined that the firm's ex- ecutives who deployed slave labor \"acted not from necessity within the meaning of the rule invoked but from what they conceived to be a sense of duty.\"'55 At any rate, the panel ruled that the threat of losing a plant or a job does not outweigh and justify subjecting thousands of individuals to involuntary servitude under inhumane conditions. Such a crime was clearly disproportionate to the harm confronting the defendants.556 In the Flick Case, however, four of the defendants were permitted to invoke necessity as a defense to their utilization of slave labor. The Tribunal determined that the defendants confronted a \"clear and present danger.'557 The deployment of slave labor was essential to meeting their production quota.

Thus, it is too late for him now to say there was nothing for him to do. Not all the Germans in Germany are in prisoners' docks or felons' cells. The vast population is free. They stayed out of trouble, they did not commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. That possibility was open also to Baier, as it was open to all others, but he chose the fruits and the glory of National Socialism, and as a consequence he finds himself in his present position.562 The tribunals also rejected the defendants' contention that they were legally justified in taking and executing hostages from the innocent civilian populations in occupied territories. The defendants' claimed that this was necessary to deter attacks and acts of sabotage by unlawful resistance forces. The tribunals conceded that international law rec- ognized the taking of hostages and the exacting of reprisals could be relied on to ensure that the population of an occupied territory adhered to their obligation under international law to respect the safety of occupying forces. Before taking hostages, however, the occupying power was required to exhaust every other available method to secure order and tranquility. These steps may include the registration of inhabitants; the issuance of passes or identification certificates; the establishment of restricted areas; limitations on movement; the adoption of curfew re- gulations; the prohibition of assembly; the detention of suspected per- sons; restrictions on communication; the rationing of food supplies; the 558.

The hostages must be taken from the geographic area in which the attacks occurred. They may not be taken if the aggression was com- mitted by partisans who were not supported by the local population. Prior to executing the hostages, a proclamation must be issued. The proclamation must recite the hostages' names and addresses and notify the population that any future armed attack will result in the execution of a number of hostages which is proportionate to the severity of the attack. An order to kill hostages must be based upon the finding of a competent court martial that the necessary conditions have been met.5'6 A reprisal is an illegal act undertaken in response to an enemy's violation of the law of war and is designed to deter a repetition of such criminal acts.565 The tribunals ruled that the killing of innocents in reprisal for violations of the law of war is subject to the same limitations placed on the taking of hostages.566 The tribunals determined that the German forces failed to adhere to the limitations on the taking and execution of hostages and reprisal prisoners. Instead, they engaged in the indiscriminate killing of civilians in the occupied territories.567 The Tribunal in the Hostage Case concluded that \"[t]he guilt of the German occupation forces is not only proved beyond a reasonable doubt but it casts a pall of shame upon a once highly respected nation and its people.\"5 Walter Kuntze, who commanded one of the German armies in the Balkans in October 1941, was convicted of ordering and carrying out unlawful reprisals.569 Kuntze not only failed to take steps to prevent illegal reprisals, but he urged his subordinates to engage in even more severe acts against the local population.

The Tribunal in the Justice Case stressed that the prohibition against retroactive punishment was a \"prin- ciple of justice and fair play\" which would be given \"full effect.\" It ruled that, as applied in the field of international law, the prohibition against retroactive punishment requires proof before conviction that the accused knew or should have known that in \"matters of international concern he was guilty of participation in a nationally organized system of injustice and persecution shocking to the moral sense of mankind, and that he knew or should have known that he would be subject to punishment if caught.\" The Tribunal noted that no person who know- ingly comitted the acts made punishable by Control Council Law No. 10 may assert that he did not know that he would be brought to account for his acts. It was stressed that the Allies repeatedly proclaimed their intent to punish those Germans responsible for war crimes.572 The tribunals ruled that Control Council Law No. 10 merely codified existing international law.572 It was conceded that the law of nations had not explicitly criminalized the acts for which the defendants were prosecuted in the American post-World War II war crimes trials.573 The tribunals, however, stressed that it was not essential that an international crime be specifically set forth and punished in a particular \"ordinance, statute, or treaty if it [was] made a crime by international convention, recognized customs and usages of war, or the general principles of criminal justice common to civilized nations generally.\"574 The law of nations, like the common law, traditionally has evolved and adapted to meet the exigencies of the moment.575 Nor was it relevant that the panels which adjudicated the cases were not in existence at the time the offenses were committed.

It was observed that all nations have held themselves bound to obey the rules or laws of war as they evolved over time. Without exception, \"these rules universally condemn the wanton killing of noncombatants.... [Ilt cannot be said that prior to Control Council Law No. 10, there existed no law against murder. The killing of a human being has alway been a potential crime which called for explanation.'576 In fact, most of the offenses with which the defendants were charged were violative of the German penal code and it was viewed as ingenuous for the defendants to contend that they did not appreciate that they were engaged in criminal activity.577 The jurisdiction of the tribunals was variously based on the Allies' sovereignty over Germany58 and on the Soviet Union's ceding of its jurisdiction as an aggrieved belligerent to other States.579 The Tribunal in the Hostage Case rested its jurisdiction on what it considered to be the concurrent jurisdiction of States on whose territory German crimes had been committed and on the right of any belligerent to prosecute offenders over whom they had custody.2\"\u00b0 The latter theory firmly established that violations of the humanitarian law of war are a matter of multilateral concern and that belligerents may claim the right to prosecute enemy combatants charged with offenses against the human- itarian law of war. V. CONCLUSION Following the Nuremberg trial, the United States conducted twelve trials of German war criminals. These trials have received little attention in texts and monographs on international law. Yet, they made an important contribution by affirming that civilians, military officials and military leaders, no matter how exalted their status, are subject to criminal punishment for violations of international law. The trials clearly established that those who act behind the scenes and who draft and issue orders are as guilty as those who carry them out. The trials also demonstrated that international law provides definite standards of conduct which may be applied by courts in a calm, deliberate and consistent fashion.

Even the fate of enemy belligerents who have committed unspeakable horrors may be fairly adjudicated. Of course, it is true that the Allies did not subject their own combatants to prosecution. These post-Nuremberg trials focused on war crimes and on crimes against humanity and provide an important source of documentation and data on the Nazi horrors. They should serve as a constant reminder of the dangers and consequences of totalitarian rule. The trials also provide an example of America's continuing commitment to the rule of law in international affairs. The question for the future is whether we are willing to subject our own combatants as well as enemy bel- ligerents to the same high standards of conduct as were imposed upon the Germans. "}
