He has given numerous lectures on topics ranging from plant medicines, to consciousness, to spirituality, to pharmacology, and has authored or co-authored over 50 peer-reviewed scientific papers and written books, including \"The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss: My Life with Terence McKenna\", and \"The Invisible Landscape\" with his brother Terence. He has also organized conferences, served as principle investigator for various research projects related to ayahuasca and other plant medicines, served as professor of Botanical Medicines and Ethnopharmacology, and conducted extensive fieldwork in the Peruvian, Colombian, and Brazilian Amazon. You can read his full bio [here](https://soltara.co/dennis-mckenna/). Dr. McKenna's advisory role to Soltara and extensive knowledge of psychedelics and plant medicines has informed our mission of spreading high quality information about these healing modalities. As such, we are excited and honored to be hosting Dr. McKenna for a special week of integrative medicine work, November 11 - 18, 2018. Offering a series of lectures and workshops as adjuncts to ayahuasca ceremony, Dr. McKenna will weave his scientific and cultural understanding of ayahuasca, psychedelics, consciousness, science, and spirituality throughout the week, providing an opportunity for participants to dive deeply into the world of holistic healing, from both an objective and experiential perspective. Guests will embark on a journey of self- and world-discovery, as Dr. McKenna takes us through topics such as: - Climbing the Vine: 45 Years of Ayahuasca: Ayahuasca has been the focus of my professional research in Ethnopharmacology since I first came to Peru in 1981 to conduct fieldwork for my doctoral thesis at the University of British Columbia. Since then it has become integrated into my own spiritual practice while continuing to remain important to me as a subject for scientific investigation. I can honestly say that my most interesting travels and personal adventures as a scientist and human being have been due to ayahuasca. In this workshop, I will share some of these personal reminiscences plus a brief overview of some of the science behind this mysterious medicine. - Origins of the Imagination: Speculations on the Antiquity of Consciousness: No one knows for sure when consciousness first emerged in our species but we can speculate about the environmental and evolutionary forces that contributed to it. One major factor was the controlled use of fire, which stimulated the migration from arboreal to savannah environments, and vastly expanded nutritional options, contributing to omnivory. Fire also provided the fundamental tools needed for pharmacology and chemistry. Migration into savannah environments would also have brought ancient hominids into contact with Psilocybin mushrooms that co-existed in this environment as symbionts on ungulate species that were also major food sources for the hominids. Accidental or deliberate ingestion of these species may have been a catalyst for the emergence of cognition, symbolic thought, and language. The fossil record is incomplete, but we find evidence of human consciousness in the artifacts that show evidence of abstract thinking and internal visualization. - What is not Patented is Prohibited: The Exploitation, Ownership, and Criminalization of Nature: Indigenous people have accumulated an intricate and deeply-rooted knowledge of their biological environment. Historically, outside nations have come in and utilized this knowledge and plants for their own purposes, benefiting greatly from them but with little to no reciprocity for the indigenous stewards of such knowledge. As a result, there is a current cultural clash between modern nations and those who have maintained the ecological habitats and knowledge of these plants. This talk discusses the history, current issues and concerns surrounding indigenous knowledge, intellectual property rights, and \"biopiracy\" - the theft of indigenous knowledge and genetic resources. ...
