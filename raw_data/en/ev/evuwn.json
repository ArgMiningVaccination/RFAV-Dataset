In Chinese culture, there exist activities the mother should partake in order to ensure the health of the fetus. In recent years, western medicine has begun to embrace Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a successful treatment or adjunctive treatment for infertility and its associated gynecological issues. Many studies currently support how TCM greatly improves fertility. Dr. Jill Stape has taken extensive continuing education courses since 2008 to stay current on fertility treatment. Her extensive herbal and nutritional knowledge pairs perfectly with her specialized fertility acupuncture to give individuals the best chance to become holistically healthy and therefore fertile. Fertility Testimonials \"I came to see you for \"Pre-IVF\" acupuncture last July through September. I became pregnant with twins and after a tricky pregnancy, delivered in March. They were nine weeks early, but now 4 1/2 months later, are happy and healthy babies who are the lights of our lives! I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your care! This was over third (and last) cycle and I truly believe it would not have been success without your help. Thank you for helping our dreams to come true!\" \"We welcomed our daughter on September 23rd. I wanted to send you an announcement because I strongly feel that her conception and our healthy pregnancy were in part made possible by the care you gave me two summers ago.
