With Seija Zimmermann standing down at the same time, this raises serious questions for the remaining Execu - tive Council members, the Goetheanum Leadership and the Goetheanum as regards planned projects and developments and the distribution of tasks in Dornach as well as around the world. Consultations were held between Sep - tember and December 2017 within the Exec - utive Council, the Goetheanum Leadership and the Conference of General Secretaries, resulting in a joint proposal for reaffirma - tion. Paul Mackay has been a member of the Executive Council since 1996, Bodo von Plato since 2001. After an extensive and con - troversial debate at the agm the proposal was rejected by the majority of members present. We have to accept this decision. In addition, a number of general secretar - ies pointed out that many members who live at a greater distance from the Goethea - num are excluded from having their say in these situations because they are unable to attend for financial reasons. Proposals to this point are to be submitted for next year's agm to consult on. We now have to work intensively on the problems we are facing. Responsibilities need redistributing and we have to try and improve communication with the members even more. At the same time a new, strong will to work together has emerged in this cri - sis: in the Society worldwide, among many leading members, and the Goetheanum staff. We therefore ask you as members to help within your own context to ensure that our work can continue in a fruitful way. | With warm greetings: Justus Wittich, Joan Sleigh, Constanza Kaliks and Matthias Girke Anthroposophical Society The Executive Council at the Goetheanum after the motion to reaffirm Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato was rejected April 2018 N\u00b0 4 Anthroposophical Society 2018 Annual Conference and agm 1 Executive Council letter to members 2 agm minutes 6 Reflections 8 Reports 10 Address by Paul Mackay Address by Bodo von Plato 11 Outcome of ballot Seija Zimmermann: emerita status Spiritual Science 13 General Anthroposophical Section: Goetheanum Studies 14 Medical Section: Research congress Anthroposophic Medicine Anthroposophy Worldwide 15 Germany: Congress on vaccination 15 Germany: Rheumatoid Arthritis study 16 India, Nepal, Kenia, Namibia: from Joan Sleigh's travel log 17 Turkey: Calendar of the Soul in Turkish 17 Worldwide: Lemniscate Arts on tour Feature 20 Conference: Meditation as a Path to KnowledgeGeneral Anthroposophical Society Statement from the Executive Council at the Goetheanum The agenda of this year's Annual General Meeting of the General Anthroposophical Society included a motion to reaffirm Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato as Executive Council members. The majority of members present rejected this motion. The Execu- tive Council at the Goetheanum has responded with a letter to the members.2 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 The 2018 Annual General Meeting was em - bedded in the Annual Conference (\u00abWhat are we building on?\u00bb) which was held at the Goetheanum from 22 to 25 March 2018. As a trial, the meeting was planned as a three stage process with conscious judgment forming (with a night between the first and second and the second and third stage): 1 agm (part 1): information (22 March) 2 agm (part 2): discussion (23 March) 3 agm (part 3): decision (24 March) Georg Soldner (Goetheanum, Medical Section) chaired the meeting on 22 March, Florian Osswald (Goetheanum, Education Section) on 23 March, and Justus Wittich (Goetheanum Executive Council member and treasurer) on 24 March. Philip Jacobsen (Dornach/ ch) and his team (Stuart Chambers, votes; Oliver Con - radt (Goetheanum, Section for Mathemat - ics and Astronomy) took the minutes. All German contributions were simultaneously interpreted into English (Bernard Jarman) and French (Ren\u00e9 Becker). Thursday 22 March 2018 Location: Main Auditorium 5.15 p.m.: Beginning of agm Georg Soldner opens the meeting on behalf of the Executive Council and the Goethea - num Leadership, explains procedures and states that the invitation for the agm was announced properly and in good time in the Society's newsletter and that the meeting is therefore quorate. The agenda and mo - tions were published in Anthroposophy Worldwide 1-2/2018, the treasurer's report in Anthroposophy Worldwide 3/2018. At the doors to the Main Auditorium the following items were made available to the members.a) the pink 2018 agm booklet which includes, among other things, up-to- date versions of the motions b) Justus Wittich's written replies to 40 queries concerning agenda item 3 (2017 financial statement) from Diet - mar Ferger (L\u00f6rrach/de) and Leonhard Schuster (Rohrlack/de ), and c) four pages of information on the World Goetheanum Association. Ca. 650 members are present in the Main Auditorium. Executive Council Report Joan Sleigh (Executive Council at the Goetheanum) presents the Executive Coun - cil Report (documented on page 10). Presentation of the 2017 financial statement and Auditor's report Justus Wittich (treasurer at the Goethea - num) has unpleasant news: the financial year 2017 ends with a deficit of chf 960,000. This means that a total of chf 1,098,539 is not covered in the balance at the end of the year. For details of the annual accounts see the pink booklet. Justus Wittich explains how it has come to this deficit (continuation of Faust 1 and 2, performances of Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas, Goetheanum building deprecia - tion) despite the fact that the initiative of the treasurers in various countries raised an extra income of almost chf 400,000 world - wide. It is hoped that the annual accounts will be balanced again by 2020 at the latest. The plan is to make the transition period \u00abor - ganic\u00bb, so that staff members do not need to live in fear. Justus Wittich therefore takes responsibility for the deficit in the 2017 an - nual accounts and is supported in this by the Executive Council, the Goetheanum Leader - ship and the treasurers of the societies in other countries. The treasurers have agreed to meet in London in the autumn of 2018. Justus Wittich asks all the members to support the transition plans and the con - solidation of the budget. Georg Soldner asks for the audit report. Urs Santschi of Santschi & Partner Treu - hand ag (Reinach/ ch) refers to the audit report that is published in the pink booklet Anthroposophical Society General Anthroposophical Society Minutes of the 2018 Annual General Meeting Anthroposophy Worldwide appears ten times a year, is distributed by the national Anthroposoph - ical Societies, and appears as a supplement to the weekly Das Goetheanum Publisher General Anthroposophical Society, represented by Justus Wittich Editors Sebastian J\u00fcngel ( responsible for this edition ), Michael Kranawetvogl ( the M. respon - sible agency - work Anthroposophy ( nna ).

As recently as twenty years ago, the statements presented at the agm were documented in the Newssheet several weeks after the meeting took place; then the editors introduced quick reports to give members a first glimpse into the processes and \u00abresults\u00bb. Nowadays, the first issue of Anthroposophy Worldwide after the agm provides a first selection by publish - ing detailed reports on the meeting and documenting the contributions made. This is also the case in this issue. The 2018 An - nual Conference and agm will continue to be discussed in Anthroposophy Worldwide: we have already received the first letters with impressions from the meeting. We have barely had four days (and nights) to evaluate, write, correct, translate and print this issue. If you come across any mistakes or errors, we would ask you to be lenient, but also to let us know. I thank all the speakers for looking through the proofs of their contributions so quickly: mostly also within a few hours or overnight. | Sebastian J\u00fcngel Picture credits p. 1: S.

Editorial Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 | 3 (pages 25 to 32) and recommends that the Annual General Meeting accept the an - nual financial statement. The audit report includes a statement that underlines the fact that \u00abdue to the re-appreciation of the Weleda shares by chf 889,900 the ordinary result of the business year 2017 looks better than it actually is.\u00bb Georg Soldner asks Ju - lian Schily (treasurer of the Anthroposophi - cal Society in Germany) to speak about the work of the treasurer's advisory group. At present this group consists of Julian Sch - ily, Alexander Thiersch ( Mackay and Oliver Conradt (Goetheanum). Julian Schily thanks the societies in the various countries for their efforts in raising the additional sum of almost chf 400,000 in 2017. When the advisory group last met at the end of February 2018 and at the meet - ing of Councils and treasurers in the run-up to the agm the main topics were how the General Anthroposophical Society and the Societies in other countries can be put on a sound financial footing. The advisory group recommends that the Annual General Meeting adopts the annual financial statement.Motions and concerns to the 2018 agm (explanations) Georg Soldner reminds the agm of Article 8 of our Statutes: the reason for the division of motions into matters lying within the sphere of the members' rights (motions 1 to 4) and requests and wishes in the form of motions to the Executive Council, on which the agm can vote (motions 5 to 12). Justus Wittich explains Motion 1 , which proposes the reaffirmation of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato for a further term as members of the Executive Council at the Goetheanum (see also pages 15 and 16 in the pink booklet). He asks the members for their agreement regarding both persons. Thomas Heck (Dornach/ ch) presents Mo - tion 2 , which proposes that the 2018 agm rescinds the resolution taken by the agm on 14 April 1935 to exclude Ita Wegman and Elisabeth Vreede from the Executive Council. This would be an important step towards the reinstatement of both these members of the original Executive Council with regard to unjustly raised accusations (page 5 in the pink booklet). Gottfried Caspar (Dornach/ ch) presents Motion 3 to amend Article 12 of the Statutes. It proposes that a two-thirds majority is needed to appoint a member of the Execu - tive Council or extend his or her term in office (page 6 in the pink booklet). Heidrun Mathilde Scholze (Unterf\u00f6hring/ de) speaks to Motion 4 , proposing that Article 8 of our Statutes should specify with binding effect that the minutes of the agm must include processes rather than decisions only (pages 6f. in the pink booklet). Thomas Heck ex - plains Motions 5 to 8 (see pages 7 to 13 in the pink booklet), Eckhardt D\u00f6nges (Bern/ ch) Motion 9 (see page 13 in the pink booklet), Marek Majorek (Latterbach/ ch) Motion 10 (page 14 in the pink booklet) and Karin Lanz (Basel/ ch) Motions 11 and 12 (page 14 in the pink booklet). 6.45 p.m.: End of the agm (part 1): information Friday 23 March 2018 2.30 p.m.: Begin of agm (part 2): discussion Florian Osswald welcomes approximately 650 members in the Main Auditorium, ex - plains procedures and asks speakers for consideration of this special place when they make their contribution. Motions and concerns to the agm (discussion) The following members speak to Motion 1: Andreas Fischer (Rehetobel/ ch), Paul Chris - tiaan van Panhuys (Wijdewormer/ nl), Jaap Sijmons (Anthroposophical Society in the Netherlands, general secre - tary), Robert Jan ch) demands that the consultations on Motion 1 should not be concluded yet but that there should be time for conversation on the Executive Council's report and the financial state - ment . Florian Osswald consults the meet - ing and accepts the proposal. In the discussion on the Executive Council report and financial statement the follow - ing members speak: Jean Cousquer (Saint Cybranet/ fr), Thomas Heck, Georg Sold - ner, Peter Joachim Kn\u00f6rrich (Reutlingen/ de), Anthroposophical Society Around 940 members attended part 3 of the agm : decision-making4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. Chris - tine Untersulzner (Gorizia/ it). The discussion of Motion 1 then con - tinues. The following members speak: In - grid Caspar (Dornach/ ch), Marc Desaules (Anthroposophical Society in Switzerland, general secretary and treasurer), Wilfried Bohm (Anthroposophical Society in South Africa, representative), Wolfgang Tomas - chitz (Anthroposophical Society in - gen (Anthroposophical Society in Canada, general secretary), Sue Simpson (Anthro - posophical Society in New Zealand, general secretary) and Gerald H\u00e4fner (Goetheanum, Section for Social Sciences). 4.35 p.m. Break 5.15 p.m. Part 2 of the agm continues: discussion Florian Osswald asks Justus Wittich to make a suggestion as to how to continue the agm . After the reports on current de - velopments and projects in the Anthropo - sophical Society worldwide, around half an hour will remain for the discussion of Motion 2 , the reinstatement of Ita Wegman and Elisabeth Vreede. This motion is very important and needs enough time. Discus - sion of motions 3 to 12 would have to be postponed to 24 March.No members ask to speak to this proposal by Justus Wittich. Florian Osswald asks the members to vote. The agm accepts with a clear majority. Constanza Kaliks (Executive Council at the Goetheanum) chairs the session on \u00abWorld - wide Goetheanum. Reports, current devel - opments and projects in the Anthroposophi - cal Society around the world\u00bb. Introductions include Henri Murto as the new general secretary for Finland, Horacio M\u00fcller and Vlad Radu Popa as the new representatives for Argentina and Romania respectively. 6.10 p.m. Part 2 of the agm continues: discussion The speakers on Motion 2 are Peter Selg (Anthroposophical Society in Switzerland, Council), Gerald H\u00e4fner, Jaap Sijmons and Heidrun Mathilde (Unterf\u00f6hring/ de). 6.35 p.m. Part 2 of the agm concludes Saturday 24 March 2018 2.30 p.m. Part 3 of the agm begins: discussion and decision-making Justus Wittich welcomes almost 1000 members in the Main Auditorium, partic - ularly those who newly joined the meet -ing. Two sessions, one before and one after the coffee break, are available for part 3 of the agm . He explains the agenda for this meeting. Motions and concerns to the agm (decisions) Before the meeting Ingrid and Gottfried Caspar have submitted a procedural mo - tion to vote on Motion 3 before Motion 1 . Justus Wittich explains briefly that accord - ing to Swiss law, if Motion 3 is accepted, the amendment of Article 12 of the Stat - utes would become immediately effec - tive. In the following vote this procedural motion is accepted . Before the meeting, requests were also submitted to present before the voting a) an issue of concern raised in the Nordic countries regarding the voting procedure b) an issue of concern raised by the young people The agm agrees these requests in two separate polls. Niels Henrik Nielsen (Anthroposophical Society in Denmark, general secretary) presents an issue that has been discussed for many years in Denmark and is now - in a matured state - expressed at the agm of the General Anthroposophical Society. Every member has the right to participate Questions of organization Information stand of the Education Section Waiting for the doors to open before the ballot Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 | 5 in meetings of the Society and to cast a vote, if present. The long journey makes it impossible for most members of our Society to participate in general meet - ings. This problem applies to many mem - bers worldwide. The concern to find new forms of participation is shared by the Scandinavian countries. Ingrid Reistad (Anthroposophical So - ciety in Norway, Goetheanum contact person) adds that this concern is also sup - ported by Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Australia and New Zea - land. The meeting of general secretaries and representatives had consulted on this question with a view to submitting this proposal next year. Macarena Kralj from Argentina and Da - rina Evgrafova from Russia present the concern raised by the young people . They were shocked by the debate on Motion 1. Two individuals are being judged. How can one expect young people to join the Anthroposophical Society if they cannot participate in such meetings full-heartedly? The Council members represented anthro - posophy all over the world, not only at the Goetheanum. The Executive Council at the Goetheanum was not only there to admin - istrate but was also esoteric. Justus Wittich points out that the 2017 annual accounts and the Executive Coun - cil report had been presented and dis - cussed over the previous two days. It can therefore be voted on.Adoption of the 2018 financial statement The annual financial statement was adopted by a clear majority, with many abstentions. Election of auditors Justus Wittich as the treasurer proposes to commission Santschi & Partner Treuhand ag for a seventh and last time to audit the ac - counts. The proposal is accepted by the agm . Discharge of the Executive Council The agm discharges the Executive Council with a clear majority . Motions and concerns to the agm (decisions) Ingrid Caspar briefly introduces Motion 3 . During the debate the following members speak: Baker-Finch (An - throposophical Society in and Christoph Lukas (Otzberg/ de). Eduard Willareth (Arlesheim/ ch) proposes to postpone Motion 3 to the agm in 2019 . This procedural motion is clearly accepted . Confirmation of a further term in office Motion 1 was discussed yesterday. Before the poll Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato have opportunity to each make a statement (see pages 10f.). Dietmar Ferger (not present) and Jo - hannes Falk (Dornach/ ch) submit a proce - dural motion to postpone voting on Motion 1 by one year. A consultative raising of hands reveals that the agm is in favour of voting on Motion 1 now . Philip Jacobsen, head of the vote counting team, explains the separate and secret bal - lot. Ballot boxes can be found at the exits of the Main Auditorium. 4.05 p.m. break 4.45 p.m. Part 3 of the agm continues: discussion and decision-making Motions and concerns to the agm (decisions) The votes on Motion 1 are still being count - ed when the presentation of Motion 2 be- gins. Justus Wittich asks Thomas Heck to briefly outline this motion again. Gerald H\u00e4fner explains the motion seconding Mo - tion 2 submitted by the Executive Coun - cil at the Goetheanum, the Goetheanum Leadership and the Conference of General Secretaries (page 5 in the pink booklet). Ida- Maria Hoek (Amerongen/ nl) withdraws her wish to explain the concern she raised regarding Motion 2 . Since the vote-counters have still not returned to the Main Auditorium, Justus Wittich proposes to the agm that the min - ute-taker counts and assesses the votes for this motion. The audience agrees. Kristina Lucia Parmentier (Ledeberg/ be) and Gerald H\u00e4fner help with the counting. Motion 2 is agreed to by an overwhelm - ing majority, with three votes against and 17 abstentions. Justus Wittich thanks the meeting for this vote and reminds the members that this is only a step on the way to reinstating Ita Wegman and Elisabeth Vreede. The resolution of 1935 is rescinded with immediate effect. Heidrun Mathilde Scholze speaks to Mo - tion 4 . In the debate Jean Cousquer, another member, Henry Saphir (Dornach/ ch) and another person ask to speak. Georg Soldner submits a procedural motion to postpone voting on this motion by one year and to examine the issue in a wider context. The procedural motion receives clear support . Justus Wittich announces the result of the ballot on Motion 1 : The reaffirmation of Paul Mackay as a member of the Executive Council is rejected , with 408 votes in favour, 467 votes against and 62 abstentions (of a total of 937 valid votes). The reaffirma - tion of Bodo von Plato as a member of the Thomas Heck explains Motion 2 (reinstatement) 6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 It is true: reports of this annual conference need to focus on the non-confirmation. Again and again before, during and after the meeting it was pointed out that one could not possible heal the history of the Society by pursuing the reinstatement initiative on the one hand whilst causing new wounds on the other by refusing to reaffirm two cur - rent Executive Council members. Whether or not one sees parallels between the two situations is a question of perspective. Unlike Elisabeth Vreede and Ita Wegman in 1935, Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato were not excluded from the Executive Council. Their term came to an end and they were not reaffirmed. This decision taken by the agm illustrates that the express wish of the leading organs for continued cooperation and the concern of the majority of (voting) members pres - ent were not congruent on 24 March. To those who had a fruitful experience work - ing with Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato this came as a \u00abshock\u00bb, particularly because the mood in the Main Auditorium was not seen as reflecting the mood of the member - ship worldwide. The ballot was preceded by appeals to not reaffirm the two members in question. An interview published in the weekly journal Das Goetheanum was seen as propaganda to influence readers in fa - vour of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato. Yet despite all this, and despite the deficit in the annual accounts of almost a million Swiss Francs, the financial report was ad - opted and the Executive Council discharged, both with great majority. Avoiding the creation of legends and stigmatization Regarding the statement that the Council of the Anthroposophical Society in Switzer -Executive Council at the Goetheanum is rejected with 398 votes in favour, 486 votes against and 56 abstentions (of a total of 940 valid votes). A procedural motion from the room ask - ing for a break is rejected by the agm . Eckart D\u00f6nges (Bern/ ch) submits the pro- cedural motion to vote on Motions 5 to 12 consultatively so that the Executive Coun - cil gets an impression of the agm 's views. This motion is carried by a clear majority . Thomas Heck announces that the propos - ers withdraw Motion 5 because the basic orientation of the further work is suffi - ciently described in the pink booklet. Stefan Hasler (Goetheanum, Section for the Per - forming Arts) speaks of Andrea Pfaehler's deep devotion to the Goetheanum. He also reports that creative speech will play a major part and that Agnes Zehnter has been recruited to support this endeavour. Further descriptions of production issues will be published in the Society's organs. Economic circumstances clearly speak for a short trial phase for which public rehearsals and audience discussions are envisaged. Thomas Heck announces that Motion 6 has been rendered immaterial by the in - formation on the World Goetheanum As - sociation made available at the entrance to the Main Auditorium. Georg Soldner speaks of the developments regarding the World Goetheanum Association so far. Thomas Heck withdraws Motion 7 . Thomas Heck would like to see Motion 8 dealt with by the agm . During the debate Andreas Worel, Laurenz Kistler (Basel/ ch) and Gerald H\u00e4fner ask to speak. A consul - tative vote reveals that Motion 8 carries a clear majority . Eckhart D\u00f6nges explains Motion 9 again. A show of hands reveals a clear majority in favour of Motion 9 . Justus Wittich briefly mentions that the attitude among the edi - tors of the weekly journal (Das Goethea - num) was different, and that Mr D\u00f6nges and the editors will meet in Dornach or Bern. Majorek explains Motion Heidrun Mathilde Scholze speak to this motion. In the consultative vote Motion 10 is rejected . Moritz Christoph (Weil am Rhein/ de) presents Motion 11 . The picture arising from the consultative vote is that of a balanced result with a third of votes in favour, a third against, and a third abstaining. Justus Wittich announces that on 25 March, for about half an hour in the break, starting from 10.20 a.m., an image of the Representative of Humanity will be project - ed onto the stage. This meets the demands made in Motion 12 . Conclusion of agm Paul Mackay speaks to the agm after the result of the vote has been announced. He respects the decision that the majority of the agm does not support his reaffirmation and expresses his gratitude for 22 years of working together. He particularly thanks the General Secretaries and representa - tives, his colleagues in the Goetheanum Leadership and on the Executive Council. The audience rises and thanks Paul Mackay with extended, demonstrative applause. Bodo von Plato expresses his thanks and trust that what we are doing here for the good of humankind will continue. The audience rises a second time and thanks Bodo von Pla - to with extended, demonstrative applause. Ute Craemer (Anthroposophical Soci - ety in Brazil, general secretary) thanks Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato on behalf of the Society worldwide and Brazil in particular. Justus Wittich states that the Executive Council was in a difficult situation now and that it would consult with the Goetheanum Leadership, particularly since Seija Zimmer - mann was standing down now. Seija Zimmermann says her farewell to the Executive Council. Joan Sleigh and Con - stanza Kaliks thank her (page 11). Further departures follow from Lena Westergren as general secretary for Finland, and from Gheorghe Paxino and Rosa K\u00f6rte (absent) as representatives of Romania and Argentina respectively. Constanza Kaliks and Jaap Sijmons ad - dress the agm , Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato with a personal statement and thanks. All the representatives and general secre - taries come onto the stage to thank Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato. Long-lasting applause. Justus Wittich concludes the extraordinary general meeting at 6.53 p.m. | Society: 2018 Annual Conference Rich soul life The non-confirmation of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato and the contribu- tion to the reinstatement of Elisabeth Vreede and Ita Wegman were dominant themes in the final days of March. And yet, there was also a diverse and rich an - nual conference. The events unfolding between 22 and 25 March took place at various levels and require differentiated contemplation. Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 | 7 land had rejected the reaffirmation, Marc De - saules, the Swiss general secretary, said that this had happened internally, in a conversa - tion in reply to a question from the Executive Council at the Goetheanum, and that it had been reported among the general secretar - ies. When this grew into a public contro - versy, questions were addressed to the Swiss Council, and the Swiss Council responded by describing the process, not by explicitly recommending to members how to vote. Additionally, Marc Desaules pointed out that similar views had been expressed by So - cieties in other countries, not just Switzerland, who also wondered whether the sought-for renewal can come from those who have, over several seven-year periods, been instrumen - tal in bringing about the present situation. One member with whom I spoke at the agm had the impression that people had differing reasons for voting for or against the reaffirmation and that there were not just two opposing parties. I mention this because I see the danger that legends and stigmati - zations are being created, and because the Swiss writer Max Frisch's tragedy Andorra warns me not to assign roles to other people. How do ideals become binding without coercion? In spite of all this, I experienced a clash - ing of polar opposite views, for instance when it came to the question of ideal and principle. Given that members should be included more in Society matters and that the decision-making should not be left to two per cent of the 44,000 existing mem - bers, recording everything that happened in procedural minutes ( Motion 4 ) is a rea - sonable request, as is the aspiration that editorial actions should correspond to the truth (see Motion 8 ), even if one speaks, to my knowledge, more modestly of truthful - ness in journalism. What does a healthy relationship between warranted ideals and laid-down principles look like? A lofty ideal such as \u00abThe dignity of human beings is inviolable\u00bb becomes bind - ing when included in a constitution, as is the case in Germany. In a (fictitious) example such as \u00abEvery person is under an obligation to breathe\u00bb, a reasonable request is being made, because without breathing we can - not live. But does it make sense to declare something imperative because it is sensible? Various needs and experiences might be reflected in such a request: where do I need form, where do I need moments of freedom (by that I do not mean arbitrariness, wilful - ness, etc.)? And lastly: When do I postulate a truth in the form of a generally valid state - ment as opposed to speaking my own mind? Insight into the Goetheanum's activities A new format was given to this year's an - nual meeting and agm in order to provide the best possible opportunities for encoun - ters, sharing and for receiving substantial contents. The annual meeting in 2017 was, in continuation of the 2016 Goetheanum World Conference, a meeting of the anthro - posophical movement. It is also true to say that the annual confer - ence provided a diverse and rich programme. My impression was that the Goetheanum demonstrated widely what it can do and what it stands for: there were esoteric stud - ies and contemplation, the work of the sec - tions was presented (information stands and work groups); ideas on how to look at the Foundation Stone Mediation were woven like a thread through the meetings, illustrated also by eurythmy performances; and insights were given into the Anthropo - sophical Society's spheres of work at the Goetheanum and in the world. In addition, staff members at the Goetheanum opened up their work places, explained what they are doing, and answered questions. The Foundation Stone Meditation as self-education The Goetheanum Leadership has chosen the Foundation Stone Meditation as the community-building focus of the Society's endeavours. Diverse contributions cast a light on this meditation from different perspectives. Stefan Hasler and Margrethe Solstad used eurythmy demonstrations to inspire members to try and experience and understand what they saw - by actively par - ticipating in their seats. For instance, how do periphery and centre relate to each other? How do two groups of three relate to the direction each of them takes (fourth verse)? They take the cue from each other! And when leaving the stage, one group walks the path the other walked before, but backwards. Repeatedly we were encouraged to prac - tise the appeals made in the Foundation Stone Meditation in our everyday life or work. They aim, we are told, to transform the soul so that we can become \u00abtruly\u00bb hu - man. Self-perception is required for this, as well as connecting with the world - through our senses, for instance. If we then meet difficulties and trials, we can build on the balance we have achieved. Rhythm plays an important part in this, because rhythm connects different worlds and makes them interact without intermixing them. Anthroposophy is life-changing The presentations on the anthroposophi - cal work in the world illustrated where an - throposophy is being taken up actively and how it can give a new, hope-filled, future- oriented direction to a person's biography. This was particularly tangible in the example of a small farmer in India, whose family was threatened by ruin due to debt. He learned to prepare compost using biodynamic prep - arations and was able to turn around his eco - nomic situation: within three years his farm was debt-free, his parents had recovered from illness, and his sister, who had been cast out by her husband's family, was able to start a new life. Anthroposophy offers two ways - one of working, studying, sharing and one of practical involvement - which can change lives and destinies. Further examples of this are the work done at the hospital in Arlesheim (Klinik Arlesheim) and the development of anthroposophy in India and Sweden. An image emerged of a vibrant anthroposophical life in the world. The Goetheanum Leadership strives to see all these qualities implemented at the Goetheanum, too: to work profoundly, cre - ate possibilities for sharing experiences, ex - plore the esoteric dimensions of the practi - cal work, breathing between centre and periphery, between thinking and doing, in the rhythms of the feeling life. Tasks based on competence Several contributors spoke of an immaturity of the soul life and of the need to build on trust and love, with both qualities being seen as fruits of self-education. Justus Wit - tich asked, \u00abHow much of the competence necessary for the working together of the shepherds' and kings' streams have we al - ready acquired?\u00bb His impression was that we \u00abhave not yet arrived at the mystery site, at the Michael School.\u00bb And he described a vision: \u00abWe will increasingly come to a point that is not about voting and offices, but about competence: the competence from which responsibility and leadership will arise.\u00bb | Sebastian J\u00fcngel8 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 Executive Council at the Goetheanum Individual contribution and space for inspiration I will speak generally about our tasks in the Executive Council of the General An - throposophical Society. Because there are still so many items waiting on the agenda of the agm , I will focus on a few aspects and examples. The Executive Council and Goetheanum Leadership have fostered a culture of co - operation and participation in recent years. We practise this also in the Executive Coun - cil's extended meetings, in the general sec - retaries' conferences, and now also in the meetings with branch leaders, and with the representatives of the Christian Community. We are trying to develop a culture of working together, a culture of conver - sation. We therefore practise in each of these organs that each person makes their individual contribution and that we form a space together into which the light for a forthcoming decision can be received out of the whole. Constanza Kaliks has de - scribed the development of a new lead - ership culture as one of the tasks of the Goetheanum Studies. It is something that is being worked on in many places. Today's agm is also such an organ: everyone has something to contribute so that we can hopefully come to an overall picture, and from an overall picture to a shared decision. Questions that point beyond the An - throposophical Society The General Anthroposophical Society's esoteric work focuses on what is universally human. In the past year we co-organized two Class conferences, one in Stuttgart (de) and one in Dornach ( ch), for which Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato were co-re - sponsible. In addition there were two major conferences on current issues: \u00abLiving Con - nections\u00bb in July was a first open gathering on anthroposophically oriented meditation and on cultivating an inner culture. In De - cember we had the sixth conference on a culture of death and dying, in which we tried to come closer to an understanding of birth and death. These are areas, ques - tions, of life that do not only occupy the Anthroposophical Society, and to which we are able to make a contribution for humanity, on the basis of anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner. And finally, we have suggested moving from an annual theme to an annual motif, taking the Foundation Stone Meditation as our motif to work on. In the meeting of the general secretaries and representatives of the Societies in the world the Michael impulse and the Foun - dation Stone Meditation came together. While not planned, this was deeply moving. Perceptive, curious, relationship-forming The Anthroposophical Society is a global so - ciety which we are fostering by being inter - ested, perceptive and curious, and by form - ing relationships. We could tell you much about our diverse travels in the world. The Goetheanum Studies have created an inter - national learning landscape here in Dornach. This year, 40 people from 21 countries, speak - ing many languages, have come together here for a new study course. And we have international, cross-sectional conferences, for instance \u00abRudolf Steiner and the Mystery Dramas worldwide\u00bb from 21 to 25 July 2018. The Goetheanum is a place of encoun - ters, a place for meeting and perception. As a synthesis of the arts, the building and surrounding park form the centre of anthroposophical research and teaching, of art, speech and drama, all of which are authentically presented here. But by Goetheanum we also mean the Goetheanum in the world. The Goethea - num is everywhere where anthroposophical work is being done. To use an image: In the cardiovascular system the blood is enriched with oxygen in the heart, while nutrients are being absorbed in the periphery. Centre and periphery are being moved by the circu - lation, in a warming and nurturing activity. Each Goetheanum in the world is at the same time centre and periphery. At the Goetheanum in Dornach we are a centre; but this centre would not be viable if it was not nurtured by the periphery. And vice ver - sa: we are looking forward to see the work of those who form their own centre. | Joan Sleigh, Executive Council at the Goetheanum Goetheanum in Development Human dignity What are we building on? This question forms the theme of this annual conference. The Goetheanum in Development process is building on what many people all over the world have founded, achieved, developed; to what they have devoted their strength and time. It wants to be open to today's questions and make a contribution to a knowledge of the human being that is guided by human dignity. What emerges in human beings? This dignity of the human being, of human co-existence with nature and with the earth, is one of the concerns of the School of Spiritual Science, the School in which knowledge of the human being as a being of body, soul and spirit, is being sought and developed. This kind of knowledge, where something that is emerging is both starting point and goal, is new compared to the natural-scientific approach. It opens up new perspectives in many spheres of life: education, medicine, nursing, etc. Promoting and supporting this School of Spiritual Science and its Sections and the spheres of life connected with them is the task of the Anthroposophical Society. To make them visible and accessible to those who see spiritual knowledge as a necessary contribution to a time of great challenges is a task that the Goetheanum is taking on. We have chosen three wider areas, or tar - get images, for the Goetheanum in Develop - ment process. The first is the harmonization of the Anthroposophical Society, the School of Spiritual Science and the spheres of life. One of the projects is devoted to develop - ing the School, to working more intensively with its members and with those who are responsible for the Class Lessons, in order to work together towards a culture of talking about questions of inner development in the spheres of life and work. Another project refers to the research within the Sections, which relates to life in that every school or farm is a field of re - search that can contribute to gaining knowl - edge. The third project is concerned with the teaching, deepening and visibility of an - throposophy. We perceive a great need for further training when it comes to manage - ment: the question for many institutions is to what extent those in leading positions re - late to an anthroposophically oriented path of knowledge, and whether those who are looking for such a path, have the opportu - nity to undergo the corresponding training. The second target image is about coop - antroposophical society Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 | 9 eration and possibilities for developing a culture of agreements. The corresponding project focuses on the multiple layers of communication: with the members, within the societies in the various countries, with people who are interested, with the public. The third target image aims at viability, in general as well as financial terms. One project related to this sphere looks at the Goetheanum as a place, a campus: the Goetheanum park as well as the Docu - mentation department, the Archives and the works of art. A second project aims at forming a World Goetheanum Association, which will provide a network for enterpris - es, institutions and self-employed individu - als and the School of Spiritual Science and facilitate partnership and mutual support. A World Goetheanum Forum, open to ev - eryone interested, will be held from 28 to 30 September 2018. What lives in the various groups? A further aspect of the Goetheanum in De - velopment initiative is the increasing active cooperation with the general secretaries and representatives of the various coun - tries. In their meeting last week, as well as in their meeting with the Executive Coun - cil and the treasurers before the Annual Conference it became clear that we wish to work towards a Michael Festival, possi - bly in combination with the celebration of the Anthroposophical Society's centenary. In this respect we can build on the broad experience of the schools and special needs institutions: the Anthroposophical Society also works towards this now. We would like to see the annual theme transformed into an impulse, born from the wish to focus on a particular content together. We are particularly interested in the diverse ways of working and the ques - tions that arise from the reality of the in - dividual groups. I am pleased that the cooperation with the general secretaries, representatives and Council members ( Alma Humana! - Hu - man Soul!) has led to a first conference of Romance-speaking countries being orga - nized in July at the Goetheanum. In the Goetheanum Leadership we have looked at the achievements of the School of Spiritual Science in its 90-year history. The results of this study have been published in a book: Goetheanum - Freie (The Goethea - num - School of Spiritual Science. The His - tory and Development of the Sections.) The new structure of this year's Annual Conference, which encompasses the agm , is also an aspect of the Goetheanum in Development initiative. | Constanza Kaliks, Executive Council at the Goetheanum and Leader of the Youth Section Goetheanum in Entwicklung Inner work and vocation When we saw the eurythmy, we experi - enced in the fourth verse of the Foundation Stone Meditation how two groups come together, striving to look toward a com - mon goal. This has something to do with the work in the School of Spiritual Science I would like to tell you about. The Christmas Conference of 1923-24 saw the foundation of the General An - throposophical Society with the School of Spiritual Science at its heart. This school strives to conduct active research. In the Goetheanum Leadership we are concerned with the overall cohesion of the School, with the inner work on the mantras on the one hand, and with the work of the Sections and in the spheres of life on the other. There would be many experiences to report about! The question as to how the whole is held together remains open: how is it possible to feel that one is a part of a whole and to experience both areas? It would mean bringing the inner and outer life into harmony. Connecting with the spheres of life The relationship between the inner work on the contents of the Class Lessons and the spheres of life is beginning to change. We notice this in the conversations with Class holders, and we also see it in the institutions, schools and farms. It is im - portant that we are interested in one another. Leena Westergr\u00e9n related how the Anthroposophical Society in Finland has approached the school movement there suggesting that they organize an event together. J\u00f6rgen Smit, Heinz Zimmermann and others have cultivated new forms of talk - ing about the contents of the Class Lessons. Our task now is to connect this with the spheres of life, with the spheres where an - throposophy is applied in practice. The 1100 Waldorf Schools worldwide alone provide a rich stream of experiences and reflections. This is mainly about being active, about what one represents authentically - out of one's involvement with a practical task. But there is also the \u00abundercurrent\u00bb that goes through the night: we do our inner work, then we let go of that and focus on our daily outer work. The inner work streams into this outer work. And the outer work, in turn, affects our inner work, helping us, for instance, to deal with crisis situations. We have heard from Ueli Hurter, one of the leaders of the Section for Agriculture, about the challenges small farmers in India are struggling with because of the power wielded by large-scale enterprises and be - cause of the danger of accumulating debts. Spiritual questions from everyday life After the Christmas Conference of 1923-24 Rudolf Steiner said again and again that anthroposophy meant more than carry - ing the word into the world: it also meant putting the word into action. How does one deal with a situation where one has many professed anthroposophists in a col - lege of teachers and others who like work - ing in a Waldorf School but who have no direct connection with anthroposophy? They are also immersed in the spiritual - ity of this work when they meet, every day, that which strives to develop within the young people. How can a conversa - tion, an experience, between these two streams be initiated? These are the kinds of space we seek to establish. Again and again I notice on conferences or when I meet people that spiritual ques - tions arise in them on the basis of their experiences: what are dead concepts? Where do things begin to be alive? What conditions do young children find today for a healthy incarnation? What can we do to help and support young people in their development? In these conversational spaces questions emerge that relate to the School of Spiritual Science and therefore to the Anthroposophical Society. Life in itself is esoteric. We see this particularly in young people working in the various spheres of life: they are seeking human encounters with human beings. | Claus-Peter R\u00f6h, co-leader of the Education Section antroposophical society10 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 antroposophical society Address before the ballot Paul Mackay We are on a journey of de - velopment. In 1988 many of my friends came to the Goetheanum: Rolf Kerler, Christian Hitsch. When I was asked to join I said yes because I wanted to be an active part of this jour - ney of development. The section work was strengthened and as one example of this is that we have this auditorium now. In 1996 Johannes K\u00fchl joined us, in 2001 Ser - gei Prokofieff and Bodo von Plato, and in 2002 Cornelius Pietzner. The collaboration between the Executive Council members and the section leaders then led to the for - mation of the School of Spiritual Science Collegium, also in 2002 - with the shared wish to develop the School further. In 2011 a motion of no confidence was tabled against the Executive Council. At the AGM in that year we introduced the rule that Executive Council members have to be reaffirmed every seven years. In 2012 we formed the Goetheanum Leadership to which tasks were allocated that used to be reserved for the Execu - tive Council. The Goetheanum Leader - ship decides to whom it grants mandates, here and across the world. Forming the Goetheanum Leadership became pos - sible thanks to the help - for which I am very grateful - of Friedrich Glasl and the Executive Council's spokespersons at the time, Seija Zimmermann und Ueli Hurter. At the beginning of 2012 I was asked by the Executive Council to join the board of directors at Weleda. Weleda was in fi - nancial difficulties at the time, today it is healthy again. In the last seven years the Goetheanum's fa\u00e7ade and roof were renovated and the stage updated. The next step was the re - structuring of the ground floor which con - siders the building's east-west-orientation. In this context I would like to mention the immense commitment of Martin Zweifel, Susanne B\u00f6ttge and Marianne Schubert. Together with Christiane Haid, Constanza Kaliks and Ueli Hurter I was strongly in - volved in conceiving and organizing the 2016 Goetheanum World Conference. This was very important for me because we were looking for ways in which the Goetheanum can reach out to the world. The sections have developed well; a next step would be to develop the School of Spiritual Science as a whole. Before this conference we asked ourselves: who are the people who rep - resent anthroposophy, consciously or un - consciously, in enterprises, institutions, in the world? For us this was not a question of membership, of a pink or blue membership card, but we wanted to start from the fac - tual, from what is visible: People see people. I would like to see the forthcoming centenary of the Christmas Conference of 1923-24 not so much as a looking back but as a reviving of its original im - pulse. This includes enhanced coopera - tion between the School of Spiritual Sci - ence, the Society and the spheres of life/ or of the sections, so that this impulse can become more effective in the world. Now I am - with Christiane Haid, Mat - thias Girke and Ueli Hurter - part of the group that works on the Goetheanum in Development process. The Goetheanum Leadership has set itself several tasks. I would like to mention the two I am in - volved in: one of them is the Class work. As Virginia Sease's successor I am the con - tact person for the Class holders and for questions regarding the School of Spiritual Science. The special mantras of the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science are associated with the decision of Class members to be representatives of the an - throposophical cause in the world. These mantras enable us to be representatives. Promoting this work is important for me. The second task is the creating of a World Goetheanum Association for people who work out of anthroposophy in the world, in enterprises, institutions or as self-employed persons, and who seek others who think similarly. I expect that this could lead to a lively exchange and to new support for the School of Spiritual Science. This is necessary because we cannot leave the responsibil - ity for the School to the Societies of the various countries alone and ask them for new members. Membership is more than anything a question of destiny. With the centenary of the Christmas Con - ference approaching, I find it important to strengthen the ties between the School of Spiritual Science, the Society and the work of the sections.Address before the ballot Bodo von Plato Anthroposophy has evolved considerably in the last hun - dred years. To start with, one single person acquired the faculty to facilitate its arrival on earth: Rudolf Steiner. He called it \u00abawareness of our humanity\u00bb. Wherever people perceive with lively interest and with love, where they think with love and take responsibil - ity for the consequences, awareness of our humanity grows - and in this sense it has become part of today's culture. This awareness has grown considerably in the last hundred years; it has been tested and questioned; and the dignity of human beings was never as much under threat as it is today; and it has never lived as strongly as a yearning. The more this awareness of our human - ity grows, the more necessary it will be to have a place, a School, which is devoted to its practice and development: The School of Spiritual Science is destined to be this place - wherever in the world people are inspired to work out of spiritual science. The School of Spiritual Science is both a public and an esoteric institution; it is as practice-oriented as it is inward-looking. The rich experiences of years and decades of anthroposophical work in all spheres of life need to be processed and they need to receive new impulses in the sections of the School of Spiritual Science; the inner, spiritual path of experience gains orientation and deepening on the path of initiation of the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science. The more public the work of the Sections is the more important is the individual's free decision and com - mitment to the mantric path of initiation. The School of Spiritual Science, which combines the fullest exotericism with the deepest esotericism, becomes the Michael School. Since its inception in 1923-24 the An - throposophical Society's aim has been to facilitate the existence and freedom of \u00abthe Goetheanum as a School of Spiritual Science\u00bb - and it seeks to realize this task in an ever more enlivened way. The more effective and recognizable the fruits of the anthroposophical work become, the more urgent will it be to Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 | 11 antroposophical society Emerita status Seija Zimmermann Twelve years ago I was asked to join the Executive Council and I was confirmed in this task by you. Because of the situation of Anthroposophic Medicine in my coun - try, Finland, I will withdraw from this task today. The reasons for my decision were described in detail in Anthroposophy Worldwide 1-2/2017. Biographically, I look back on a period of twenty years, during which I was able to combine my work for the Anthroposophical Society with my work as a physician. In 1998 I was asked to join the Council of the Society in Finland, shortly after that I became general secretary and then I joined the Executive Council at the Goetheanum. Today I would like to share with you an inner question I have lived with for many years. From my daily occupation with the meditative path which was shared by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman, and which is described in Emanuel Zeylmans van Emmichoven's book Strengthening the Heart , the question arose: what spiri - tual space was created by this meditative path, shared by the spiritual scientist and the natural scientist, for the birth and development of the School of Spiri - tual Science? As personal and unique as this path of the two individualities appears to be at first glance - is there a level that transcends this, opening up new dimensions of which the School of Spiritual Science is only the very begin - ning? I would like to encourage you to continue working on this question. In practical terms, you will see me now and again in Dornach and Arlesheim in the future. I will continue to be a mem - ber of the board of directors at Klinik Ar - lesheim and I represent the Finnish physi - cians' association in the Medical Section. Joan Sleigh: I arrived at the Goethea - num just as Seija Zimmermann was reaf - firmed as an Executive Council member. The three qualities I appreciate most in you are that you have always brought the dimension of the big wide world to us. You have cast a scientific, medical, academic eye on our work, and you did all this with warm-heartedness and a sense of humour. We will miss you very much. We wish you all the best for your further work in Finland. Thank you for everything. Constanza Kaliks: There are many things one can learn from Seija Zimmer - mann, I would like to point out one of them: her orientation in reality - wheth - er it concerns everyday situations or areas that require the greatest sensitivity and inner awareness. Thanks to her we could address central questions, like those we dealt with recently in the Goetheanum Leadership, where a very fruitful coop - eration arose regarding the senses as a possibility of connecting with the world and developing our humanity. Seija is very good at differentiating, a strength that is sometimes just silently present while at others it is resolutely expressed. We are deeply grateful to her and wish her all the best for the tasks awaiting her in Finland.Spontaneous response after the non-confirmation Constanza Kaliks In September we started discussing the question of Paul Mackay's and Bodo von Plato's reaffirmation, in the Executive Council, in the Goetheanum Leadership, among the General Secretaries. \u00abWhat does the Anthroposophical Society aspire to be for the world?\u00bb is the question that formed the background to these conver - sations: an enhancement of the question that is always with us: How can we make anthroposophy so visible in the world that those seeking it can find it? From the many conversations and contempla - tions an image arose which was not merely an idea, but a resolution. What we con - sulted on and proposed is not to happen. I would like to share a thought by Han - nah Arendt. Because of her experiences in the twentieth century and the pain they caused her, she tried to understand what determines people's actions. People who take action face two big and ever-present challenges: the deed cannot be taken back and what will be is unforeseeable. Han - nah Arendt proposes a remedy for each of these challenges. The remedy for the irre - vocability of deeds, for that which weaves itself into the deeds and remains there, causing consequences in the world for de - cades to come, is forgiveness. When we forgive we can continue to act. The remedy for the unpredictability of what lies ahead is the ability to make promises and agree - ments, and abide by them. It is what gives certainty to our actions in the face of an ever uncertain future. We had made an agreement: in the Exec - utive Council, in the Goetheanum Leader - ship, with the general secretaries and repre - sentatives. A different agreement has now been made. That is a fact. On the basis of the responsibility we have taken on we will discuss, develop and take the next steps. | Constanza Kaliks, Executive Council at the Goetheanummake their origin in Rudolf Steiner's life and work accessible. A place is needed where this historical legacy can be adequately seen and expe - rienced, and where it can be exam - ined - this should become possible at the Goetheanum in Dornach, where at present it is hardly possible to maintain our art collection, let alone present or expand it. Looking back and ahead on my work I feel I am deeply connected with these visions. I would like to thank my colleagues on the Executive Council, in the Goetheanum Leader - ship and in the Conference of General Secretaries for the opportunity to critically reflect on these tasks and on my ability, or lack thereof, to deal with them. I regret that the greater part of the global Society is not able to participate in the decision on whether or not I should continue my work as a member of the Executive Council at the Goetheanum.12 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 antroposophical society Elisabeth Vreede The inner essence of the outer world At the beginning of his biographical outline, Frans Lutters reminds us of Rudolf Steiner's indication that Elisa - beth Vreede incarnated earlier than foreseen by her destiny - because of Rudolf Steiner. Thanks to Frans Lutters' warm interest in what lights up in a person and how relationships emerge, I formed an image of a harmonious, clearly thinking, self - less and kind person. Elisabeth Vreede was born in The Hague on 16 July 1879. Even as a child she lived in her thinking: a bright pupil with amazing memory forces. She founded a rowing club and studied math - ematics, astronomy and philosophy in Leiden. After graduating from university she taught Maths in a girls' school. Her parents had esoteric tendencies, lived close to a Freemason's lodge with Rosicrucian orientation, and were in contact with Henry Steel Olcott. They read theosophy together with Elisabeth. From 1903 onwards Elisabeth Vreede experienced Rudolf Steiner several times and became his esoteric pupil. She took part in the foun - dation stone ceremony for the first Goetheanum. Later she was called to Dornach by Rudolf Steiner as a member of the Executive Council at the Goetheanum and as the leader of the Section for Mathematics and Astronomy in Dornach. Living in and with cosmic rhythms Elisabeth Vreede activities included the publishing of calen - dars, astronomy newsletters and celestial maps. She saw stars as spiritual beings. In the movement impulses of the planets she recognized the movements of Thrones and an expression of Seraphim-love. Stars and human beings were one for her. She was interested in cosmic rhythms, in life between death and a new birth, in astrosophy. Elisabeth Vreede was a precise worker. People sought her advice and help. After her exclusion in 1935, she remained in her house in Arlesheim, fostered contacts and travelled frequently, for instance to Ireland and through Turkey (the latter for the solar eclipse). She was deeply affected by Ita Wegman's death. She herself died on 31 August 1943. Elisabeth Vreede's interests included not only mathematics and astronomy - through which she experienced the cosmic rhythms - but also foreign languages, such as French, Sanskrit and Bali. At the age of 16 she knew the entire Faust, parts 1 and 2, by heart. She had a deep connection with anthroposophy and she sought, and lived, an active relationship with the spiritual world. And yet, she saw herself as a student, for instance in her relationship with Rudolf Steiner's essays on the question of How to attain knowledge of higher worlds? Her work was often done quietly, and it persisted quietly. A fir tree can symbolize this: she took a fir tree home with her after the Christmas Conference and planted it close to her house (today it stands in a neighbouring garden). As Oliver Conradt pointed out earlier, her work has not been fully explored yet and her estate is spread across several locations. | Gabriela J\u00fcngel, Dornach ( ch)Ita Wegman Medicine as living practice Peter Selg was asked by Matthias Girke to speak on the topic of \u00abAnthroposo - phy as a medicine for the world - Ita Wegman\u00bb. He wove a complex picture based on the \u00abGoetheanum's medicine in practice\u00bb, contemplations on therapy and Ita Wegman's contribution - a picture that was at the same time an answer to the question as to how one needs to prepare oneself for the task of being a healer in the twentieth century, a therapist of individuals, of social communities, for and with them, and also for and with the Anthroposophical Society. Ita Wegman's personality went through an extended period of preparation for this work, through an extended destiny. Her's is a strong soul. If one looks, in the world of the Father, at what has become, at what has come from the past; if one is active, with the Son, in the present, and if one receives good, world-appropriate ideas from the healing spirit, the preconditions are met for the \u00abstrong heal - ing activity\u00bb that Ita Wegman fully embraced. She had courage for the truth; she tended to her patients with love, and she saw through the diagnosis, perceiving not only what was there but also what wanted to come. Ita Wegman had the strength for the future and she was prepared to deal with opposition. Breathing in the needs of the world, breathing out anthroposophy Ita Wegman had the courage to heal: for therapists face powerful forces that threaten the human being. Healing, in this context, also means being prepared to deal with the forces of destruction and death. Ita Wegman was born on 22 February 1876. She first trained as a Swedish massage therapist and studied medicine later. She founded institutions of healing. Her active commitment for a Michaelic centre in Great Britain was misunderstood as being in competition with the Goetheanum. She kept all the conflicts within the Society away from her institutions. Peter Selg described this by saying that her Christian work led to an active community. Ita Wegman was an active leader: she did what needed doing, independently of personal interests. The weaving between one's own work and the work in the world is a breathing process. Rudolf Steiner said to Ita Wegman that he was able to breathe when he was close to her. Sergei Prokofieff created the image of inhaling the needs of the world and exhaling anthroposophy. Confronted with the emerging crisis and the hatred that came towards her, Ita Wegman became seriously ill in 1934. A spiritual experience led her back to life. She travelled to Palestine and came back strengthened. She died on 4 March 1943. The image arising in me is that of a personality that was prepared to suffer so that the truth could shine through. Her relationship with Rudolf Steiner was profound; their cooperation and the goal of their working together were not understood, however, and could not ful - ly unfold. This tragic situation had come to an end in this life, he said to her. Two free personalities were working together: they did not depend on but inspired each J\u00fcngel, Dornach ( ch) 13 One of the Goetheanum's main tasks is the study of anthroposophy. The team in charge of the Goetheanum Studies find that this involves more than just getting to know other people's ideas. They aim at inspiring in students a clearer relation - ship with themselves \u00abin the present and future.\u00bb Edda Nehmiz, the coordinator of Goetheanum Studies, describes it like this: \u00abHow can I find orientation within myself at a time when everything is on the move? How can I get involved in building the world, take responsibility and yet remain in charge, free and unruffled? In a world that is constantly rebuilding itself this becomes an existential skill.\u00bb Relating to oneself and to the world Edda Nehmiz describes one of the special aspects of these studies: people from 21 na - tions in Europe, North and South America and Asia enrolled in the late summer of 2017. The students who come together share the same questions; they form friendships for life. Also, people from di - verse cultures come together in a narrow space. They learn a lot from this: in all these encounters one gains clarity about one's own condition, not from an individual but from a cultural perspective - one encoun - ters the world in individual human beings. Anthroposophy within This approach of gaining the ability for self-knowledge and active engagement is based on a change of method. The students are meant to experience that anthroposo - phy is not only Rudolf Steiner's work but that it comes out of them. Rudolf Steiner has provided the concepts and contexts that make anthroposophy accessible. In the study courses several works by Rudolf Steiner are studied in parallel - each book with a particular lecturer. This is to make sure that the question \u00abWhat is Anthropos - ophy?\u00bb is explored in diverse contexts and from different angles. In experiencing these diverse approaches the students become more independent in the way they deal with anthroposophy and they experience what it means to think for oneself. In the mornings the students study to - gether: spiritual science, artistic courses, as well as \u00abspecial themes\u00bb, where a particu - lar topic is presented and worked on. The topics relate to each other and enable a deepened understanding. The afternoons are free but optional study opportunities are available. This makes it possible for the students to reflect on what they have taken in, to study and practise, but also to ponder on what is involved in a study approach based on one's own inner activity. One of the optional choices, Anthro - posophy through Eurythmy', provides an artistic route to anthroposophy. The Art Workshops are a further, full-time, option. They, too, are about self-education - in this case based on an object the community of students are working on together. One of the preconditions is that whoever enters the workshop does so with their own ex - periences and questions. New in the programme is a postgraduate stage course for qualified eurythmists, of - fered as a cooperation of the Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensemble and Eurythmeum ch . This study year provides the possibility to gain stage experience and, beyond that, covers questions such as: how do I design an overall concept including rehearsals, costumes and make-up? How do I adapt my programme to differently sized stages? Orientation and sources of strength in everyday life People who lead a full professional or family life often have the need to deal with ques - tions that go beyond everyday life and that are intrinsically related to the question as to what it means to be human in our times. Stressful situations call for orientation and sources of strength. This is where the pro - gramme of part-time week-end courses comes in. They start with the phenomena of life, explored on the basis of works such as Rudolf Steiner's Theosophy or of Goethe's approach to natural science. The development of the Goetheanum Studies programme continues: after a first meeting of around 40 heads of anthropo - sophical trainings and institutions plans are afoot to set up a further training course for managers in businesses or training establishments. | Sebastian J\u00fcngelGeneral Anthroposophical Society: Goetheanum Studies Self-knowledge and active engagement The Anthroposophical Study courses at the Goetheanum have further evolved in recent years, with the focus now being more on developing studying skills. These courses, which are divided according to languages, have grown into a large English-speaking community. Rudolf Steiner's works are being studied in German, English and Spanish/Portuguese. Experiencing how anthroposophy arises from within Kaliks, Edda Bodo Sease, Joan Sleigh. Information/registration: studium-goetheanum.org School Of Spiritual Science14 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 School Of Spiritual Science When, in 2015, the dermatologist Christoph Schempp (Freiburg/ de) and his colleague Ute W\u00f6lfle published their discovery of a sense of taste for bitter substances in the human skin, it was like a tunnel break - through. Because around 90 years earlier Rudolf Steiner had said to physicians, \u00abThe entire organism is like a subtle organ of taste,\u00bb and he pointed out the importance of bitter substances which make \u00abthe ether body willing to absorb the astral body.\u00bb In a different context Rudolf Steiner explained that spiritual scientific and natural scientific research were working towards each other like the builders of the Gotthard Tunnel who, in 1880, cut through the mountain with a deviation of only 33 centimetres. Rudolf Steiner's research has today been verified by natural science: bitter recep - tors have been discovered in many organs. Christoph Schempp went on to develop an effective therapy for neurodermati - tis using an ointment containing bitters. Treatment from two sides The conference language at this interna - tional research congress was English and no interpreters were needed when Ivelisse Page from the United States related how she, as a young mother, overcame severe, metastasizing colon cancer, an illness her father died of at a young age. Excellent con - ventional treatment had been as essential for her recovery as the mistletoe therapy which she experienced as crucial. Ms Page told the audience how important the first meeting of her oncologist with the anthro - posophic physician Peter Hinderberger was for her, when two worlds that had been separate so far came together. Today the two are working together. Ivelesse Page and the \u00abBelieve Big\u00bb initiative she founded not only make it possible for poor patients in the US to receive mistletoe therapy, but ac - tively promote a clinical mistletoe study at the renowned John Hopkins Hospital - the first trial of its kind in the us . Good practice and good research Eran Ben-Arye represents integrative oncol - ogy at a big centre for cancer treatment in Haifa. He founded and works in a network called \u00abIntegrative Oncology\u00bb in the Middle East, with colleagues from Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and other countries that are separated by deep political gulfs. Eran Ben-Arye is a builder of bridges: in his contribution the vision shared by the 40 or so speakers became particularly clear: Anthroposophic Medicine is an integra - tive medicine and it is most effective when used in conjunction with conven - tional medicine, especially in severe cases. It is important that research becomes an integral part of the practice of An - throposophic Medicine. A striking ex - ample of this is the \u00abOncology Network\u00bb founded by the Havelh\u00f6he Research Institute in Berlin ( de), which can now demonstrate (based on 17,127 patients treated) that integrated mistletoe therapy significantly increases the life quality and life expectancy of patients with lung or pancreatic cancer. All forms of clinical studies are important. The gap between good practice and good research needs to be bridged. The future lies in the integration of An - throposophic and mainstream medicine, a step Rudolf Steiner worked towards from the start. Health - a subtle balance Great inner spiritual strength is needed for this, because it is not only a matter of integrating oneself, but also of chang - ing the image of the human being in medicine, as Peter Heusser pointed out. The human being is not a machine, and subtle impulses can have strong effects. A fascinating and accessible image arose from the contributions of Stephan Baumgartner, Torkel Falkenberg and Harald Matthes of a balancing act, in which a person's health depends on the balancing out of subtle influences. Once this is un - derstood, it becomes suddenly clear why a patient who is devastated, by a cancer diagnosis for example, does not necessarily need something \u00abstrong\u00bb at first, but rather a conversation with his physician that can help him find a new inner balance and step across the chasm caused by his illness. And indeed, six months later there is scientific proof that only two such \u00abelaborate life review consultations\u00bb can measurably sta - bilize a patient's health. Research can build bridges in the cross- cultural dialogue we not only need be - tween people in the Middle East but also in establishing an integrative medicine. The tunnel breakthrough can only be achieved with mutual awareness; and the bridge relies on strong and secure foundations on either side. | Georg Soldner, deputy leader of the Medical SectionMedical Section: International Research Congress on Anthroposophic Medicine Breakthrough and Bridge-building More than a hundred medical professionals came together for the international re- search congress on Anthroposophic Medicine, held at the Goetheanum from 9 to 11 March, in order to share their experiences of best practice in research and of the rela- tionship between main stream and anthroposophic medicine. It became clear that an integration of the two systems is needed.

This is a question that is being discussed in politics and in the media. Physicians who are critical of vaccination as well as the president of the permanent vaccination commission in Germany ( stiko ), Thomas Mertens spoke up against a legal obligation, contradicting Patrick Guidato, the head of the Young Liberals' federal committee for health and innovation. Acceptance of and belief and trust in the decision to vac - cinate, it was said, were essential factors that could not be achieved by imposing an obligation to vaccinate. The speakers in the lively panel discussion explained their differing aims, concerns and attitudes in dealing with immunization. In favour of individual consultations Representatives of the association of phy - sicians in favour of personal decisions on vaccination asked for individual unbiased consultations which they see as being threatened by the present practice. Pae - diatricians were often expected to apply the stiko recommendations invariably to every child. But the responsibility of the acting physician or of the parents could not be conceded to a universal recommenda - tion or the legal situation. Each child was different, as were people's situations, expe - riences and values. The speakers addressed the safety of vaccines as well as conceivable times for immunization, herd immunity and the potential endangerment of others. From the parental point of view differen - tiated consultations are essential. \u00abParents want to be respected by physicians\u00bb, said Angelika M\u00fcller, speaking of her experi - ences in a parents' organization that pro immunization ( f\u00fcr Impfaufkl\u00e4rung convincing data Thomas Mertens explained how stiko works and what its strategic goals are: in - dividual protection, herd immunity, and the global or regional eradication of certain diseases. A high immunization rate was desirable for epidemiological reasons. Rec - ommendations always had to be based on the best available evidence. But it was this argument in particular that many speakers questioned. \u00abWe often act blindly when we should have convincing data,\u00bb argued Wolf - gang Schneider-Rathert from the German Society for General and Family Medicine (Degam), where he is in charge of questions of immunization. Michael Friedl, president of the medical association for individual de - cisions on vaccination criticized that \u00abEven if there are scientifically valid findings, they don't apply to each person.\u00bb What helps many can be harmful for some children.\u00bb Openness and transparency about what we do and don't know are therefore an essential step on the way to creating trust among parents, physicians and scientists. Second requirement: open discussion The speakers also scrutinized the climate in society and the discussion culture among physicians. Discussing questions and ar - riving at different views was a given in a democracy but it did not yet apply to im - munization. \u00abHow do we come to a new culture of trust, even if our interests di - verge?\u00bb asked Stefan Schmidt-Troschke of the patients' organization Gesundheit activ . Conclusion: Dialogue and open discussions were essential, as was the avoidance of demagoguery and the stigmatization of those who think differently. Thomas Mertens favoured a broad dis - cussion on vaccination and many agreed that this would be a step in the right di - rection. \u00abI think it's great that stiko repre - sentatives and supporters of compulsory vaccination are here, too, even if I have a totally different opinion,\u00bb is how one audi - ence member summarized her impressions. | Sandra Markus, Berlin ( de)Germany: Congress on \u00abVaccination - personal decision or civic duty?\u00bb Towards a culture of trust and dialogue Around 250 people discussed the question of vaccination in Berlin (de) on 23 and 24 February, in a meeting initiated by the German patients' association Gesundheit activ and the association of physicians supporting individual decisions on vaccination. The congress was attended by parents, physicians, scientists, politicians and representa- tives of the German permanent vaccination commission stiko .Germany: rheumatoid arthritis study Fewer side effects Recently, Harald Hamre and col- leagues published a large study on anthroposophic vs conventional treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, initiated by Ludger Simon, who died in 2016. For patients with early rheumatoid arthritis ( era), Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs ( dmard s) are a mainstay of therapy. dmard s can slow down the disease progression but some patients do not tolerate them or refuse such treatment. In Anthroposophic Medicine ( am), a treatment strategy for era has been developed that does not include dmard s unless absolutely neces - sary. Instead, patients receive biographi - cal and nutrition counselling, use special medication such as herbs, and engage in special artistic or movement exercises. Satisfactory long-term results In this study, era patients receiving am treatment were compared to other era patients who used dmard s. Two other drugs for era , corticosteroids and Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs, were allowed in both groups, but were less used among am patients. After 4 years, rheumatic symptoms, inflammation in a blood test, and joint damage on x-ray were comparable in both two groups, while side effects were less frequent among am pa- tients. Eight in 129 am patients needed dmard s. The study results suggest that, for most era patients who are willing to engage in am treatment, satisfac - tory long-term results can be achieved without dmard s. | Hamre HJ et al.

Patient Preference and Ad - herence 2018;12:375-97 Anthroposophy Worldwide Connecting spheres of life India, 2 to 5 February: In India I meet people who work anthropo - sophically and who are well trained, some are graduates of the International Postgraduate Medical Training ( ipmt ) and teachers. India has well established institutions for curative education and social therapy, a teacher train - ing and the beginnings of a eurythmy training. Via mentors the country has good connec - tions with Europe and other continents. On my travels I often found that people wish to study the foundations of anthroposophy in a transdisciplinary way so as to have a shared basis of anthroposophical knowledge and experiences: for instance through events on meditation that foster the soul life; or by cre - ating spaces for encounters and conversations that bring the various spheres of life together. Awake to the surroundings Kathmandu, Nepal, 5 to 7 February: I notice that Nepalese people have com - prehensive social awareness. First I visited the Kevin Rohan Memorial Eco Foundation (krmef ) which strives to support the com - munity and its further development - in an environment where men and women are not considered equal, and where many lost their homes in the earthquake of 2015. With the funds it has raised, krmef has supported the reconstruction, built a library, and established a hospital, Waldorf school and Waldorf kin - dergarten. Additionally, a jewellery workshop was started for women to make and sell their products, and a restaurant with a garden that provides organic and biodynamic produce. Some work as volunteers, staying for longer or shorter periods of time. There is a great openness for socio-cultural initiatives and projects that generate a new quality of life. The steering group studies anthroposophy and tries to include the teachers in these studies. There is exchange, with a lecturer in Israel for instance, and people travel to India. They are keen to cultivate contact with the Goetheanum, through the Youth Section for example, because they would like to meet like-minded people and deepen their knowl - edge of anthroposophy. I also visited the Shanti Leprosy centre which looks after leprosy sufferers, provides places to live for them as well as for children and adults with disabilities, offers (lower school) teaching and craft activities. A carpen - try workshop produces furniture for the home, and a dressmaking workshop makes the clothes. At the Bud - dhist Temple close by the Shanti Centre pro - vides nutritious meals for the homeless on a daily basis. They not only feeding the poor but also create a new sense of quality in their lives, by provid - ing cushions to sit on, plates and cutlery, as well as kind words of support.Image-like insights Kenia, 15 to 21 February: there are three Waldorf schools in Nairobi now. When we celebrate 100 Years of Waldorf Education in 2019, the first school here will be thirty years old. The Mbagathi Rudolf Steiner School has 329 pupils, 120 of which are accom - modated and cared for in the hostel on the premises. Most of the children are from the poorer suburbs in the vicinity. The founda - tions of Waldorf Education come natural to people here; in conversation they reveal their own image-like insights. A teacher training course offers the opportunity for deepening anthroposophy. There is a wish to develop a vocational upper school. The Nairobi Waldorf School lies in the rich part of town, but has also a kindergarten in another part, with 120 children. They would like to build up an academic upper school. Here too, teachers and parents are very open to anthroposophy. I attended an evening meeting for parents and teachers. People asked themselves: How can Waldorf educa - tion become effective beyond the school? The new orientation of the education authorities has some Waldorf qualities, for instance its artistic approach and the fact that learning is seen as an artistic process. Travel log In February Joan Sleigh travelled, as a member of the Executive Council at the Goetheanum, to India, Nepal, Ke- nia and Namibia. Everywhere anthro- posophy is sought, and lived, because people long for spirituality, even where material resources are scarce and poverty widespread; and in the most diverse cultural conditions. Here are extracts from her travel log. Nepal: the KRMEF's school building Kenia: morning assembly at the Mbagathi Rudolf Steiner School Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 | 17 Understanding what is different Windhoek, Namibia, 21 to 28 February: Three different cultures in Namibia are a chal - lenge for the college of teachers and the school community of the Windhoek Waldorf School. But they also add a perspective of hope at the threshold to a cosmopolitical society. In the low - er school German is the teaching language (with support from Germany). Here too, Waldorf edu - cation and anthroposophy are received with in - terest and motivation. The artistic approach and experience-based teaching appeal to people. The view of life of white Namibians is still informed by the former South Africa and its apartheid system. There is a strong Christian influence that goes back to the missionaries. But the traditional culture also plays a part. Much attention is devoted to understanding what is different and this has a direct effect on the life of the school. What does discipline mean in the various \u00abexperiential landscapes\u00bb? Is half an hour's break enough or does it need an hour? Should there be homework? To what extent should the students be consulted on such questions? Or should they just be told? India, Nepal, Kenia or Namibia - people are interested in deepening their anthroposophical knowledge and in bringing it to life; and they seek to connect with the Goetheanum - on the basis of their own cultural background. | Joan Sleigh, Goetheanum Anthroposophy Worldwide Turkey: weekly verses in Turkish Spiritual seeds In the spring of 2018 the first Turkish transla- tion of Rudolf Steiner's Soul Calendar came out. Tarhan Onur is the translator. The word cemre has many meanings in Turkish. In Turkish folklore it describes the warming up of nature between 20 February and 6 March, first noticeable in the air, then in the water, and fi - nally in the earth. Rudolf Steiner was also able to look behind nature and perceive with his spiritu - al eye the forces that become visible in nature in spring and summer and that withdraw in the au - tumn and winter. As a result of his intense spiri - tual and sensory observation of nature he was able to create verses reflecting these processes in the perceiving soul's changing time rhythms. The 52 meditative weekly verses are a path to knowledge for the microcosmic human being as a mirror image of the macrocosm. They also begin with cosmic facts, but in a way that is different from what can be perceived in the \u00abcemre\u00bb state. The first verse always begins on Easter Sunday. Note that the verses mirror each other. One verse turns outward, while the one mirroring it focuses on the in - ner life. It is not enough to understand these verses; one needs to live with them in a spiritual, intimate, meditative way and with nature as it alternates between unfolding and withdrawing. | Roberto Pellacini, Hamburg ( de), and Tarhan Onur, the preface) Anthroposophy Worldwide Worldwide: Lemniscate Arts tour Storms of Silence Storms of Silence is a large-scale eurythmy programme directed by Carina Schmid and Benedikt Zweifel, which will start in No- vember 2018. Performances will be shown worldwide up until June 2019. Marke Levene founded Lemniscate Arts in 2005 for people all over the world who are working with Rudolf Steiner's artistic impulse. Carina Schmid (former director of the Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensemble) and Benedikt Zweifel (former head of the Stuttgart Eurythmeum) have been recruited by Lemnis - cate Arts as artistic directors for a new, English-language eurythmy programme. The ensemble will consist of 25 young eurythmists from Iran, Egypt, Israel, Romania, Russia, the United States, Columbia, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Gran Canaria ( es), Slovakia and Germany. As in the programme performed in the 2000s (Symphony/Eurythmy), the eurythmy will be accompanied by the Gnessin virtuosi (40 young mu - sicians) under the baton of Mikhail Khokhlov. The programme will include Ludwig van Beethoven's 5th Symphony, Arvo P\u00e4rt's fourth Symphony (first movement), texts by Dylan Thomas, David Herbert Lawrence as well as silent euryth - my. The first performances will be shown in Europe, followed by a tour of Israel, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. The ensemble will be in Hawaii and other us states from March, in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Canada in May, and the world tour will conclude in Europe in June 2019. | Eleni Prelorentzos ( 12/17 10. Januar 1941 2018 Vladimir Tichomirov Vladimir Gennadievich Ticho - mirov crossed the threshold of the spiritual world on 9 March. He was born in Pscov Oblast and was acquainted with the earliest anthroposophists in Moscow and Leningrad. Among those who helped him on his an - throposophical path were Alexei Dmitrievich Lebedev, whose ad - vice he valued highly, Maria Al - exandrovna Skriabina, in whose home he was a frequent visitor, and the translator Boris Deyev, whom he knew from Leningrad. Working with Sergei Prokofieff Sergei O. Prokofieff was a close friend. Up until the foundation of the Anthroposophical Society in Russia they attended anthro - posophical underground meet - ings, took part in productions of Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas, worked on the Stat - utes and held Class lessons in the School of Spiritual Science. After Sergei O. Prokofieff's pass - ing away in 2014, Vladimir Tcho - mirov assumed responsibility for events of the School of Spiritual Science in Russia. He was deeply devoted to anthroposophy and to Rudolf Steiner. For many years, Vladimir Ti - chomirov was a member of the council of the Anthroposophical Society in Russia; he arranged for the Russian Society's new legal registration in 1998 and was its representative. He took an active part in the Society's annual festivals and confer - ences - not only in Moscow, but also in other regions, and sup - ported the anthroposophists in St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Yekaterinburg. Vladimir Tichomirov was co-founder of Anthroposophia Press, the publishing firm of the Anthroposophical Society in Russia, which he managed up to the mid-1990s, determined to do something about the short - age of publications by Rudolf Steiner and other anthropo - sophical authors in Russia. As a board member of the Society's library he, together with Sergei O. Prokofieff, brought together an impressive collection of spiri - tually oriented books. Always ready to help Vladimir Tichomirov was al - ways ready to help others. For a period of time he was leader of the Society's youth group, which he had initiated and which was studying the Three - fold Social Organism. He not only answered the questions of Society members, but also those of people who had come across anthroposophy and he advised, for instance, the staff at the Andrei Bely Museum on the anthroposophical worldview of Andrei Bely and his circle. Since the foundation of the Anthroposophical Society in Russia, Vladimir Tichomirov has taken part in numerous drama productions, including Nikolai Leskov's God's Good Time and Goethe's Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily . | For the Council of the Anthroposophi - cal Society in Russia: Olga Korn - ienko, Yekatarinburg ( ru) (edited) 28 December 1921 4 February 2018 Lyda Br\u00e4unlich On 4 February Lyda Br\u00e4unlich passed away in her home in Cape Town, the city where she had founded the first Waldorf School in Africa. Born Alida Justina K\u00f6per on 28 December 1921 in Haarlem near Amsterdam ( nl), her fam - ily immigrated to South Africa in 1937, where she qualified as a teacher from Kindergarten to High School, specializing in Art Education. In 1950, Lyda met Rupert Br\u00e4unlich. The two were mar - ried on 22 December 1951. Founding Waldorf institutions Having observed the vicious dis - cipline and boring lessons met - ed out to children in South Afri - can schools, she determined to home school her own children. Then in 1954, the couple at - tended a talk by Willem Zeyl - mans van Emmichoven. He spoke of Waldorf Education and when they asked that he arrange for such a school to be started in South Africa replied simply: You will have to do that yourself! He put them in touch with Waldorf people in Britain and Holland and over the next years Lyda held talks at every possible women's group, social gather - ing and club, finding interested parents. In January 1959 she opened the first Waldorf Kin - dergarten and a year later the school opened its doors with four classes. Lyda continued as a class teacher until 1981, when she organized and ran the first train - ing course instituted since Max Stibbe's in the 1960s. After she retired in 1983, Christine M\u00fcller asked her to help in another venture, setting up a Kindergarten and school for the children of the farm labourers at her wine estate, Buitenverwachting. Miraculous flow of events With a remarkably lucid con - sciousness until the end, Lyda \u00abkept all these things and pon - dered them in her heart,\u00bb as is said of Mary in the Gospel of St Luke. Lyda had a special relation - ship with the Christmas Plays and often played the part of Mary. These plays were among the first initiatives of the school founding group. The magnificent Constantia School, the sixteen others in the country, the training col - lege, certified to grant Bache - lor's degrees in Education and Eurythmy and the fundamental changes in child rights through - out South Africa, seemed a mi - raculous flow of events in which she had been guided to contrib - ute and participate. | Eric Hurner, Dornach ( ch) Antroposophical Society English translation based on Russian-to-German translation Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 12/17 | 19 Antroposophical Society We have been informed that the following 84 members have crossed the threshold of death.

I can't remember the theme but I do re - member his refreshing, simple but deeply moving presentation of a pharmaceutic process. With his way of presenting an - throposophical spiritual science he helped many generations of young pharmacists and physicians, but al - so lay-persons, to find new inspira - tion for their diverse spheres of life. His presentations were as lively, artistic, yet scientifically precise as his entire work as a chemist for Weleda in Austria and worldwide. He was interested in the manu - facture of medicines with body and soul, heart and head, and produced many of them, collect - ing and preparing the substances in the Weleda laboratories in Vienna. What made his lectures so popular was his ability to speak out of his own experience of the pharmaceu - tical process. During conferences he always managed, with his concise com - ments, to bring the discussion back on track, always very politely, without any personal aggressive - ness, but with convincing and factual clarity. He was not only fully committed to Weleda but also very actively involved with the life of the Anthro - posophical Society in Austria, and even became its general secretary. We will miss Johannes very much, but also trust that he will exert his protecting influence out of the spiritual world. | Reinhard Schwarz, Graz ( at) Source Medical Section News- letter, Easter 201820 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/18 The question \u00abWhat is anthroposophical meditation\u00bb is not new. Many anthropo - sophical publications describe the inner practice set out in Rudolf Steiner's basic works. After the general view seemed to be for many decades that one should keep quiet about one's spiritual experiences, it now emerges that spiritual students need to share their experiences. Also, \u00abcompeti - tion\u00bb in the field of meditation has grown so much that anthroposophical medita - tion is quite far down on the list of known meditative approaches. But what is anthroposophical medita - tion? This was the question discussed dur - ing the meeting's concluding conversation of (almost) all the German-speaking leaders of anthroposophical meditation courses: more than 200 of them. Can such individu - alized course leaders have a fertile con - versation? Or will the attempt necessarily turn into an advertising of individual meth - ods? Yes, there was advertising, but there were also fruitful encounters. How to concentrate? The panel discussions were attempts to understand each other and ask questions about methods. Although many approaches struck many people as alien, there was a tangible endeavour to understand them. The questions discussed allowed for the individual methods to demonstrate their effectiveness. After a short introduction to the basics of higher knowledge acquisition given by Andreas Neider, the first conversation fo - cused on expanding the knowledge of na - ture. Dorian Schmidt first asked everyone present to concentrate on something. Then he asked everyone to concentrate on how everyone was concentrating. If one can muster that much awareness, one will also be able to discover things that modify our awareness when we receive impressions of nature. Dorian Schmidt suggested to \u00abfor - get about the unhelpful question of How do I know it is me who is concentrating?\u00bbLightness versus reflection Thomas Meyer suddenly stepped to the ros - trum on the side of the room and described how he felt \u00ablightened\u00bb there. He explained this with the presence of an elemental be - ing. Looking from a Goethean point of view, Christoph Hueck then questioned his cer - tainty of experience and interpretation. The second panel discussion was about knowledge of the human being. Differ - ent styles came to the fore. Frank Burdich, owner of a company for applied spiritual research, spoke with a certain lightness of the many stages he passed through in observing the constituent members of his organization, while the music therapist Gunhild von Kries spoke with deep reflec - tion about the spiritual and therapeutic dimension of time, intimating how to deal with this spiritually. Johannes Wagemann and Christoph Hueck then elaborated on the spiritual experience. The conversation on destiny revealed that the I learns through meditation that it extends beyond itself and that it prepares its destiny with the help of others; that it is therefore not only incarnated in the body but lives and is effective in the wider periphery. Between tied to and free from the body In the conversation about self-knowledge people observed how the self can experi - ence and lose itself in the present; and about the ways of self-education anthroposophy has to offer: from a conscious change of habits to thoughts on an introduction to psychology as a preparation for the path of inner development. What became clear is that self-knowledge, self-education and self-transformation need to become (and are becoming) cultural techniques. The concluding conversation focused on What is anthroposophical meditation? Anna-Katharina Dehmelt mentioned three aspects that everyone present could re - late to: the anthroposophical path of inner development or meditation leads via self- reflection and through imagination, inspira - tion and intuition not so much to a major, unique, life-changing experience of being one with the world, but to many small, in - termittent experiences of oneness that are therefore closer to everyday life. It is about keeping the balance between this world and the world beyond, between being tied to and free from the body. It involves con - stant encounters with the guardian of the threshold. And thirdly, anthroposophical meditation seeks the spirit in life, in the here and now, and finding it means ap - proaching the spiritual world responsibly. The intensity of this meeting is, in my view, indicative of the fact that anthro - posophical meditation is on the way to becoming more deeply rooted in today's cultural consciousness. | Andreas Heertsch, Arlesheim ( ch)Germany: Conference on Meditation as a Path to Knowledge Responsible approach to the spiritual Circa 200 people came together for the conference entitled Meditation as a Path to Knowledge - the Diversity of Anthroposophical Approaches, held at Rudolf Steiner Haus in Stuttgart (de) from 23 to 25 February.
