To avoid immune recognition and uncontrolled inflammation, nucleoside-modified mRNA is used. However, such modification largely abrogates the innate immune responses that are critical to orchestrating robust adaptive immunity. Here we develop an LNP component\u2014an adjuvant lipidoid\u2014that can enhance the adjuvanticity of mRNA-LNP vaccines. Our results show that partial substitution of ionizable lipidoid with adjuvant lipidoid not only enhanced mRNA delivery, but also endowed LNPs with Toll-like receptor 7/8-agonistic activity, which significantly increased the innate immunity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine with good tolerability in mice. Our optimized vaccine elicits potent neutralizing antibodies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus variants, strong Th1-biased cellular immunity, and robust B cell and long-lived plasma cell responses. Importantly, this adjuvant lipidoid substitution strategy works successfully in a clinically relevant mRNA-LNP vaccine, demonstrating its translational potential. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis with over six million casualties thus far (https:// coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html ). Vaccines have proved to be efficacious at reducing the morbidity and mortality of this infectious disease. Cur - rently, several vaccine modalities, including messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, antigen-expressing adenovirus, inactivated virus and subunit vaccines, are either approved or under clinical development1. Among the different platforms, mRNA vaccines not only demonstrate superior ability to elicit both neutralizing antibody (NAb) and T cell responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants2, but also offer low production costs with short development and manufacturing times3,4.Although mRNA was discovered in 1961 (ref. 5 ), due to its sus - ceptibility to enzymatic degradation, inefficient in vivo delivery and high innate immunogenicity, its use in vaccine development has been hampered until recently6. The first two challenges have been overcome by the incorporation of mRNA into a delivery system that can protect it from degradation and escort it across various biological barriers7-9. Notably, four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) comprising ioniza - ble lipid (or lipidoid), phospholipid, PEGylated lipid and cholesterol are the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery platform as exemplified by Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 and Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccines8. The last challenge is addressed through the incorporation of naturally occurring nucleosides such as 1-methylpseudouridine (m1) into the Received: 13 July 2022 Accepted: 17 April 2023 Published online: xx xx xxxx Check for updates A full list of affiliations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: DC2.4 den - dritic cells. Although free mLuc was LNP demonstrated dose-dependent transfection (Fig. 2b), - ing that adjuvant lipidoid can successfully deliver mRNA into cells. To further evaluate the potency of C12-TLRa, it was compared with a series of polyamine-derived lipidoids synthesized using the same chemistry (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5)25. It should be noted that some polyamine-derived lipidoids in this library exhibited potent RNA delivery in previous studies25,31. In vitro mLuc transfection results demonstrated that C12-TLRa had a relatively low transfection ability, especially when compared with the top performer C12-113 (Fig. 2d). Optimization and characterization of LNPs Since adequate antigen expression is favourable for mRNA vaccines, we decided to partially replace the ionizable lipidoid in C12-113 LNP with C12-TLRa to endow the LNPs with TLR7/8-agonistic properties without compromising mRNA delivery. Therefore, a series of C12-113/TLRa LNP with an increased C12-TLRa substitution (1-17.5mol%) was formulated and subjected to in vitro screening. Intererestingly, along with the increased substitution with C12-TLRa, the mRNA transfection effi - ciency of C12-113/TLRa LNP increased and then decreased (Fig. 2e). The highest transfection was achieved by C12-113/TLRa LNP with 5mol% of C12-TLRa, and this was chosen for subsequent studies. The adjuvant activity of mRNA-loaded C12-113/TLRa LNP was then verified in HEK-Blue reporter possessed no a dose-dependent manner, which significantly outperformed C12-113 LNP (Supplementary Fig. 6). To further confirm the general applicability of this strategy, DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) LNPs and is, SM-102/TLRa LNP) were formulated and (Supplementary Table 1). Consistently, MC3/TLRa LNP and SM-102/TLRa LNP, LNP, showed obvious TLR7-agonistic activity (Supplementary Fig. 7). These results suggest that the substitution of partial lipidoid with C12-TLRa can endow LNPs with adjuvant activity irrespective of LNP formulation. Next, the physicochemical properties of the C12-113/TLRa LNP were characterized. This LNP had a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 52nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.127 (Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, it had a neutral surface charge in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and its appar - ent pKa was determined to be 6.42 by conducting a 6-(p -toluidinyl) naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid (TNS) assay over the range of pH 2-12 (ref. 33), which meet the criteria for potent in vivo mRNA delivery34,35. The encapsulation >93%. After 1month of storage at 4\u00b0C, we observed minimal changes in all major LNP physicochemical parameters (Supplementary Fig. 8), indi - cating the good stability of this LNP. Representative transmission elec - tron microscopy (TEM) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images showed that C12-113/TLRa LNP had a uniform, compact spheri - cal structure (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 9a). C12-113 LNP without C12-TLRa substitution had very similar parameters and morphology (Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9), suggesting that substitution with 5% C12-TLRa does not alter the physicochemical properties or affect the stability of these LNPs. In vitro mRNA delivery and DC activation We next systematically investigated the in vitro mRNA delivery and adjuvant activity of C12-113/TLRa Fig. 2e, C12-113/TLRa LNP consistently outperformed C12-113 LNP at any mRNA dose tested. Similarly, in in vitro transcribed mRNA sequence to avoid its recognition by pattern recognition receptors10,11. Despite its improved tolerability and transla - tion, the use of nucleoside-modified mRNA largely compromises the innate immune responses and weakens the activation of dendritic cells (DCs, the major recipient cells of mRNA-LNP vaccines12), a process that is critical to mounting a strong adaptive immunity to vaccination3,13. Interestingly, we and others have found that certain LNPs possess intrinsic adjuvant activity that can promote the induction of cellular and humoral immune responses of mRNA and subunit vaccines14-16. However, the adjuvanticity of LNPs is variable based on the lipidoid used and is generally weak and non-specific14. Toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) are potent adjuvants, which activate DCs to present antigen, express co-stimulatory molecules and produce selective cytokines (for example, tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)) that effectively stimulate the transition from innate to adaptive immunity17. Several small-molecule TLRas with high specificity have been approved for immunomodula - tion18, including imidazoquinoline-based TLR7/8 agonists (for acid-modified TLRas in antigen-loaded liposomes or NPs has been demonstrated to enhance the magnitude and duration of adaptive immune responses20,21. We hypothesized that formulation of a rationally designed TLRa-derived ionizable lipidoid into LNPs could further augment the immunogenic-ity of mRNA-LNP vaccines due to the accessorial adjuvant properties. In this study, we chemically synthesized an LNP component\u2014an adjuvant lipidoid\u2014based on a TLR7/8 agonist. Unlike previous studies in which the TLRa was typically conjugated to macromolecules (for example, lipids, peptides and polymers) through acylation22-24, we applied the ring-opening reaction between an amine-bearing TLRa and an alkyl epoxide to yield a tertiary amine-containing ionizable lipidoid that can complex with and deliver negatively charged mRNA into cells25. We optimized the formulation of this adjuvant lipidoid-incorporated SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine and systematically evaluated its innate and adaptive immune responses (Fig. 1). Synthesis of adjuvant lipidoid and polyamine-based lipidoids Adjuvant lipidoid C12-TLRa (Fig. 2a)25. The purity and structure of C12-TLRa were verified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton NMR (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Structural simulation via computational analysis dem - onstrated that C12-TLRa could form multiple interactions with TLR7 receptor (for example, hydrogen bonding with Asp555 and Thr586 and - stacking with Phe408) at its first binding site that were similar to TLR7/8 agonist 1 (Supplementary Fig. 3)26,27, suggesting that such modification barely interrupts the agonist-receptor interaction. The TLR7-agonistic activity of C12-TLRa was further verified on HEK-Blue reporter cells sta - bly expressing the TLR7 receptor. As a positive control, TLR7/8 agonist 1 exhibited a biphasic dose-response profile of TLR7-agonistic activ - ity characterized by an initial dose-dependent increase followed by a decrease of analytes (Supplementary Fig. 4), which was also observed by others28,29. However, monotonically dose-dependent TLR7-agonistic activity of C12-TLRa was observed at the same dose range, indicating that C12-TLRa has a more predictable pharmaceutical property despite its reduced potency. Next, adjuvant lipidoid, phospholipid, cholesterol and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG) at a molar ratio of 35:16:46.5:2.5 were formulated into C12-TLRa LNP along with mRNA using microfluidic mixing (Supple - mentary Table 1)30. In this formulation, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-p hosphoethanolamine was used as it has generally exhib - ited greater mRNA delivery than other phospholipids such as 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine31,32. The mRNA encap - sulation efficiency was determined to be ~75%, suggesting that this adjuvant lipidoid is able to complex with and encapsulate negatively Nature Nanotechnology Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-023-01404-4primary murine bone LNP (Fig. 3b,c ). No obvious cytotoxicity towards these cells was observed at the dose tested for both LNPs (Supplementary Fig. 10). Moreover, MC3/TLRa LNP and SM-102/TLRa LNP significantly outper - formed their respective counterpart in terms of mLuc delivery (Sup - plementary Fig. 11). These results suggest that C12-TLRa substitution can increase LNP-mediated mRNA delivery in vitro irrespective of LNP formulation. To investigate the mechanism of enhanced mRNA transfection following C12-TLRa incorporation, we studied the Lipid-like fluorescent dye 3,3-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO)-labelled were used treat DC2.4 cells and their subcellular distribution was visualized after endo/lysosomes and nuclei were stained (Fig. 3d). In C12-113 LNP-treated cells, there were large yel - low spots, indicating severe entrapment of C12-113 LNP (green) inside endo/lysosomes (red). In contrast, C12-113/TLRa LNP-treated cells exhibited more diffuse green signal across the cytoplasm, suggesting its more efficient escape from endo/lysosomes. This observation was further supported by the quantification of LNP endosomal escape. Additionally, similar results were obtained when LNPs encapsulating Cy5-tagged mRNA were used for this endosomal escape study (Sup - plementary Fig. 12). These results suggest that C12-TLRa substitution enhances endosomal escape of LNPs, which could explain the enhanced mRNA transfection (Fig. 3a-c ). Since multiple interactions are pre - dicted between C12-TLRa and TLR7 based on the molecular simulation result (Supplementary Fig. 3), it is reasonable to assume that the strong affinity between the incorporated C12-TLRa and endosomal TLR7/8 could reinforce the physical interaction between LNPs and the endoso - mal membrane, which leads to enhanced endosomal escape (Fig. 3e). Next, we studied the the coding sequence of this nucleoside-modified mRNA is identical to the mRNA used in two US Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2)36. Since TLR7/8 agonist can stimulate proinflammatory release, we analysed matured DCs (CD80+CD86+) C12-113/TLRa markedly increased the percentage of matured DCs in DC2.4 cells, BMDCs and MoDCs (Fig. 3f-h and Supplementary Fig. 13). In contrast, C12-113 LNP only modestly induced DC maturation. Moreover, C12-113/ TLRa LNP stimulated a significant increase of TNF-, levels compared to BMDCs and MoDCs these results suggest that C12-TLRa substitu - tion can greatly enhance the adjuvanticity of LNPs and DC activation. In vivo mRNA transfection and innate immune responses We next explored whether increased mRNA transfection and innate immune responses by adjuvant lipidoid-substituted LNPs could be reproduced in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) immu - nized at the tail bases C12-113 or C12-113/ nescence at 24h post-treatment (Fig. 4a). Both LNPs mainly transfected injection sites, and could also transfect inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs). In line with in achieved greater mRNA both injection sites and iLNs (Fig. 4a). To avoid systemic toxicity, it is important to spatially restrict adju - vant activity and mRNA transfection to the sites of vaccine administra - tion and draining lymph nodes37. Therefore, we studied the distribution and transfection of LNPs in major organs and that no obvious accu- mulation and transfection in major organs (liver, heart, spleen, lung and kidney) were observed for either LNP (Fig. 4b ). Interestingly, although these two LNPs achieved comparable accumulation amounts in iLNs based on the fluorescence quantification CD4+ T cell NAbSARS-CoV-2 mRNA TLR7/8 Fig. 1 | Adjuvant lipidoid-substituted SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine and its proposed mechanism of action to elicit potent adaptive immunity. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine is formulated with adjuvant lipidoid, the diproline-modified spike glycoprotein. After injection, is internalized by DCs, where adjuvant lipidoid agonizes endosomally localized TLR7/8 to activate DCs and mRNA is translated into spike antigen that is processed and presented by DCs. After migration into the draining lymph node, activated DCs orchestrate robust adaptive immunity together with CD4 + T, CD8+ T and B cells, including NAb responses, Th1-biased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, B cell responses.Nature with in vivo ventral luminescence imaging (Fig. 4a). These results also vitro (Fig. 3a-c ). Moreover, C12-113/TLRa LNP-mediated enhanced mRNA expression at both the injection site and iLNs was highly reproducible from different LNP batches (Supplementary Fig. 14). Finally, the duration and trans - lational kinetics of LNP-formulated mRNA was investigated. C12-113/ TLRa LNP enabled more durable (over 14 days) and consistently stronger mRNA expression at the injection site than C12-113 LNP (Supplementary Fig. 15). Such long-lasting expression is attributed to the enhanced translational capacity and biological stability of mRNA as a result of nucleoside modification and LNP formulation38. Together, these results suggest that C12-TLRa substitution can greatly enhance the expression of LNP-formulated mRNA at both injection sites and draining lymph nodes with minimal systemic off-target distribution or expression. To assess in vivo innate immune responses, iLNs were harvested from mice at 24h post-immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-loaded LNPs, and cytom - etry. C12-113/TLRa LNP significantly increased the percentage of with C12-113 LNP (Fig. 4d,e 6 and 24h post-vaccination.

As expected, due to the minimal systemic exposure of LNPs (Fig. 4b,c ), these serum cytokine levels did not increase for either LNP (Supplemen - tary Fig. 17). To further assess and compare the tolerability of these two mRNA-LNP vaccines, we evaluated the serum levels of acute phase protein, haptoglobin, and two inflammatory chemokines, interferon--induced protein 10 (IP-10) and monocyte chemoattract - ant protein 1 (MCP-1), which have been demonstrated to be sensi - tive to s.c. injected mRNA-LNPs39. Both LNPs induced transient and comparable elevations of haptoglobin, IP-10 and MCP-1 levels (Sup - plementary Fig. 18). These results demonstrate that C12-TLRa substi - tution can greatly enhance the magnitude and duration of local innate immune responses without exacerbating systemic inflammation triggered by the pristine SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine.

Of note, neither skin abnormalities at the injection sites (Supplementary Fig. 19) nor body weight loss was observed after immunization (Supplementary Fig. 20). Two weeks after the boost dose, spleens from immunized mice were collected, and splenocytes were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) peptide pools. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Fig. 21). Both LNPs elicited CD4+ cells expressing Th1 cytokines (interferon TNF-); however, the effect elicited by C12-113/TLRa LNP was significantly higher than that elicited by C12-113 LNP (Fig. 5b ). Moreo - ver, neither vaccine formulation induced CD4+ T cells expressing type 2 (Th2) cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-17), supporting a Th1-biased T immune response. C12-113/TLRa LNP also elicited more RBD-specific CD8+ T results vaccines can induce stronger RBD-specific Th1 and CD8+ T cell immune responses. Polyfunctional T cells are generally considered immune corre - lates for protection against pathogens40-42. Next we examined the polyfunctionality of these RBD-specific T cell responses. C12-113/ TLRa LNP induced a significantly higher proportion of double- and triple-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared with C12-113 LNP (Fig. 5d).

Adjuvant lipidoid substitution enhances humoral responses Next, responses were analysed (Fig. from vaccinated mice was subjected to endpoint dilution ELISA to determine the total RBD-specific IgG titres. Both mRNA-LNP vaccines triggered high lev - els of RBD-specific IgG (Fig. 6b ); however, the IgG titre for C12-113/ TLRa LNP was almost one order of magnitude higher than that for C12-113 LNP (1.22\u00d7107 versus 1.35\u00d7106). Moreover, the showed higher IgG2c a higher IgG2c/IgG1 ratio compared with C12-113 LNP (Supplementary Fig. 22), further highlight - ing that adjuvant lipidoid-substituted LNPs tend to trigger stronger Th1-biased immune responses. Next, NAb levels were measured using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus neutralization assay (Fig. 6c both mRNA-LNP of against multiple SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus variants, includ - ing D614G-mutated and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, C12-113/TLRa LNP elicited more NAbs against all three pseudoviruses as demonstrated by the higher 50% foci reduction neutralization titres (FRNT50). To investigate the induction of B cell memory, we assessed splenic B cell responses using fluorescent RBD probes (Supplementary Fig. 23)14,43. C12-113/TLRa LNP vaccination significantly increased the number of RBD-specific B cells compared with C12-113 LNP (Fig. 6d), and these cells displayed a memory phenotype (CD38+GL7; Fig. 6e). The majority of RBD-specific B cells in C12-113/TLRa LNP-vaccinated mice co-expressed the memory markers PD-L2 and CD80 (Fig. 6e), consistent with a poten - tial for rapid differentiation into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) upon rechallenge44. Thus, C12-113/TLRa LNP vaccination generates a larger but phenotypically similar RBD-specific memory B cell pool. Finally, we analysed bone marrow-resident long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) 3months after the second vaccination, which can medi- ate durable protection from infection by persistently producing antigen-specific antibodies. Bone marrow from immunized mice was collected, and various subsets of RBD-specific these suggest that adjuvant lipidoid-substituted mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits stronger humoral immune responses and b c d7 RBD-speci/f.shortic T cell responsesPrime Boost Sacri/f.shortice 14 0.0329 = = 0.2746 = = 0.0225 immune responses induced by adjuvant lipidoid-substituted SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine. a, A scheme of the prime and boost vaccination strategy and analysis of the T cell responses.

In a pilot study, we noticed that SM-102/ TLRa LNP achieved greater mRNA transfection than SM-102 LNP after local injection as well, and both of them significantly outperformed C12-113 LNP or C12-113/TLRa LNP (Supplementary Fig. 24). To avoid the excessive expression of antigen, mice were vaccinated twice with SM-102 LNP or SM-102/TLRa LNP at a lower dose that achieved com - parable protein expression as that in the previous study (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 24). No skin abnormalities or body weight loss was observed during the experiment (Supplementary Figs. 25 and 26). Flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes from immunized mice showed that SM-102/TLRa elicited larger frac- tion with SM-102 LNP (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 27). Moreover, more RBD-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were induced by SM-102/TLRa LNP (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Further examination of these RBD-specific T cells showed that SM-102/TLRa LNP elicited a much higher proportion of double- and triple-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in comparison with SM-102 LNP (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Together, these results suggest that C12-TLRa substitution can enhance the Th1-skewed, antigen-specific T cell immune responses of clinically relevant mRNA-LNP vaccines.

Flow cytometry analysis of spleno - cytes showed that SM-102/TLRa LNP elicited more RBD-specific B cells than SM-102 LNP, and these cells typically exhibited a memory phenotype (CD38+GL7; Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Moreover, most RBD-specific B cells in SM-102/TLRa LNP-vaccinated mice were PD-L2 and CD80 double positive, and the proportion of these cells was larger than that in SM-102 LNP-vaccinated mice (Extended Data Fig. 2e). These results demonstrate that C12-TLRa substitution can increase antigen-specific antibody responses and B cell responses of clinically relevant mRNA-LNP vaccines. Together, all the above results confirm that adjuvant lipidoid substitution can enhance the immunogenicity of clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccines, which holds translational potential. Conclusions We developed a type of ionizable lipidoid\u2014an adjuvant lipidoid\u2014which serves not only as a structural component of LNPs to enhance mRNA delivery, but also as a functional moiety to increase the adjuvanticity of the LNPs. Adjuvant lipidoid-substituted SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine significantly enhanced intralymphatic DC activation and intranodal pro - inflammatory cytokine production with good tolerability in mice due to its exclusive distribution and transfection at the injection site and drain - ing lymph nodes. Due to the improved innate immunity, a more potent adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 was established after immuniza - tion with adjuvant lipidoid-substituted mRNA-LNP vaccine, including strong Th1-biased cellular immune responses, antibody responses, B cell responses and LLPC responses. Moreover, we confirmed that adjuvant lipidoid substitution could enhance the immunogenicity of clinically rel - evant mRNA-LNP vaccines. Our study provides a LNP formulation basis for introducing adjuvant lipidoid to improve the quality and magnitude of adaptive immune responses for mRNA vaccines.

Core 200 was customized from Enamine, and other polyamine cores were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and TCI. Anti-mouse TNF- LysoTracker Deep Red, LysoTracker Green, DiO and DiR were bought from Invitrogen. Mouse haptoglobin ELISA and mouse IP-10 ELISA were obtained Abcam. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1,2-distearoyl- mRNA was produced in house by incorporating Cy5-UTP (TriLink) into the in vitro transcription reaction. Synthesis of adjuvant lipidoid Adjuvant lipidoid C12-TLRa was synthesized by reacting epoxy - agonist dihydro - chloride was dissolved in 0.8ml of ethanol in a glass vial with a mag - netic stir bar. Then, 8l of triethylamine was added to neutralize the hydrochloride before adding 20mg of C12. The vial was sealed, and the mixture was stirred for 48h at 80\u00b0C. The crude product was purified by a NextGen chromatography The desired fraction was collected (yield, 44%). C12-TLRa was characterized by mass spectrometry 36H), for the synthesis of polyamine-derived lipidoids The polyamine cores were reacted with excess moles of C12 as needed to saturate the amines25,33. Taking C12-113 as an example, 113 core (1 equiv.) was mixed with C12 (4.8 equiv.) for 48h at 80\u00b0C in a neat con- dition. The crude product was used for the initial library screening. To purify the top-performing C12-113 lipidoid, the crude product was separated as described above, and the fully saturated product was collected and identified by mass spectrometry (calculated MS, 854.49; found [M+2H]2+, 429.13) and used for subsequent experiments. Structural simulation of agonist-TLR7 interaction The structures of TLR7/8 agonist 1 and C12-TLRa were first optimized by molecular dynamics simulation with the CHARMm force field45. The exact TLR7 protein crystal structure was derived from the structure of the TLR7/R848 complex (PDB ID, 5GMH), removing any ligands or solvent molecules26. Structural simulation between TLR7 dimer and agonists was carried out by CDocker docking simulation46 and in situ structural superimposition. Potential non-covalent interactions, bind - ing pockets and overviews of the binding sites between TLR7 dimer and the corresponding agonists were generated using BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2018.LNP formulation LNPs were formulated by microfluidic mixing30. Briefly, an ethanol phase containing lipidoid (with or without C12-TLRa substitution), phospholipid, cholesterol and DMG-PEG at a designated molar ratio (Supplementary Table 1) was mixed with an aqueous phase (10mM citrate buffer, pH3) containing mRNA at a flow rate ratio of 1:3 and at a lipidoid/RNA weight ratio of 10:1 in a microfluidic chip device. LNPs were dialysed against 1\u00d7 PBS in a 20kDa molecular weight cut-off cassette for 2h, sterilized through a 0.22m filter and stored at 4\u00b0C. DiO- or DIR-labelled LNPs were obtained by mixing DiO or DiR (1mol% of total lipids) with LNPs before dialysis. LNP characterization The hydrodynamic size, PDI and zeta potential of LNPs were measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments). JEOL encapsulation efficiency and the pK of LNPs were determined using a modified Quant-iT routinely the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test, and endotoxin levels were consistently found to be <1 endotoxin unit per ml. Cell culture and animal studies The HEK-Blue mTLR7 cell line was kindly provided by J. Shi at Harvard Medical School, who obtained it from InvivoGen (#hkb-mtlr7). These cells were maintained according to vendor's instruction. Murine mac - rophage DC2.4 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's cells at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2, and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. BMDCs were generated from C57BL/6 mice. Briefly, bone marrow cells were flushed from mouse femurs and tibias, lysed by ammo - nium-chloride-potassium (ACK) buffer to remove red blood cells and then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented (#315-03, PeproTech). On day 6, non-adherent and loosely adherent cells were collected for studies. MoDCs were generated from a 38-year-old healthy male volunteer donor. Monocytes were isolated from donated apheresis blood using the RosetteSep Human Monocyte Enrichment Cocktail (#15068, Stemcell Technologies), and provided by the Human Immunology Core at the Uni - versity of Pennsylvania. These cells were induced into MoDCs by cultur - ing in complete RPMI medium supplemented 20ngml1 human IL-4 (#574002, colony stimulating factor (#572902, Biolegend) for 6days. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania (#705906). Informed consent was obtained from the donor, who was compensated for this blood donation. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania (#806540), and animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide - lines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the University of Penn- sylvania. C57BL/6 female mice (6-8 weeks of age, 18-20g body weight) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. In vitro mLuc delivery DC cells, BMDCs or MoDCs were seeded onto a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 per well overnight and then mLuc-loaded LNPs were used to treat cells at the indicated doses for 24h. Luciferase expression was Nature Nanotechnology Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-023-01404-4evaluated by Luciferase Reporter 1000 Assay System (E4550, Promega), and cell viability was measured using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (G7572, Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The relative luciferase expression was reported as relative light units normalized to cell viability. Free mRNA was used as a control. TLR7 reporter assay The TLR7-agonistic activity of C12-TLRa was tested on HEK-Blue mTLR7 reporter cells using a HEK-Blue Detection Kit (#hb-det2, InvivoGen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HEK-Blue mTLR7 reporter cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 40,000 cells per well in HEK-Blue Detection medium containing different concentra - tions of C12-TLRa. After incubation for 24h, the absorbance at 650nm was measured using a plate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan) and data were normalized to untreated cells. TLR7/8 agonist 1 was used as a positive control. Similarly, the TLR7-agonistic activity of LNPs was measured. Cellular uptake DC2.4 cells were seeded into 35mm glass-bottom dishes for 24h and then Cells were sequentially stained with LysoTracker Deep (100nM) for 30min and Hoechst 33342 (10gml1) for 5min. Images were taken imme - a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 710, Zeiss). Analysis of DC maturation and cytokine production in vitro DC2.4 cells or BMDCs were seeded into a 12-well plate at a density of 1\u00d7106 cells per well overnight and then treated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-loaded LNPs (500ngml1) for 24h. Cell cultures were lected for ELISA of TNF-, IL-12p70 and IL-1. Cells were collected, blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody and stained with flow cytometry (BD, LSR II). Similarly, MoDCs were treated. Cell cultures were collected for ELISA of human TNF-, IL-12p70 and IL-1. MoDCs were antibody before analysis. Antibodies were used according the manufacturer's instruction with a typical dilution at 1:100. Analysis of DC maturation and cytokine production in vivo Two iLNs from each mouse of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-loaded LNPs (5g mRNA per mouse) at the tail base and were gently mechanically disrupted using sterile pestles in 0.1ml of RPMI complete medium in a 1.5ml tube. The resulting cell suspensions were collected, blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody and then stained with anti-mouse-CD80 antibody before being analysed by flow cytometry. Blood was collected into serum separator tubes (BD #365967) the retro-orbital route at 6 and 24h post-immunization. Serum was separated from blood following an incubation period of 30min at room temperature (r.t.), and samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5min. The serum was stored at 20\u00b0C until use. To analyse the intralym - phatic cytokine production, the resulting cell suspensions from iLNs were placed to a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per 100l per well and cultured for 8h. Supernatant was collected for ELISA of TNF-, IL-12p70 and IL-1 together with serum samples. Additionally, serum at 6, 24 and 48h post-immunization was collected for ELISA of haptoglobin, IP-10 and MCP-1. Distribution and transfection of LNPs in vivo Mice were s.c. injected at the tail base with mLuc-loaded LNPs at a dose of 5g mRNA per mouse. At 6 or 24h post-injection, mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with d -luciferin potassium salt (150mg per kg (body weight)), and bioluminescence imaging was performed on an IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer). To enable concurrent bio - luminescence and fluorescence imaging, DiR-labelled, mLuc-loaded LNPs were s.c. injected into mice. At 24h post-injection, mice were i.p. injected with d -luciferin potassium salt, and major organs and iLNs were collected for bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging. In vivo immunization Mice were s.c. immunized with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-loaded LNPs at a dose of 1 or 5g mRNA per mouse twice using a prime-boost strategy at a 3week interval. Body weight was recorded twice a week during the experiment. Serum was collected using serum separator tubes as described above, stored at 20\u00b0C and used for ELISA and virus neu - tralization assay. Two weeks after the boost vaccination, mice were anaesthetized and spleens were collected for flow cytometry analysis. Determination of anti-RBD antibody titres using ELISA Purified SARS-CoV-2 His tagged RBD (1gml1) (Sino Biological, #40592-V08H) was used to coat High Bind Stripwell Corning 96-well clear polystyrene microplates overnight.

(2% w/v washed three times, and mouse sera were serially diluted in the blocking solution and incubated for 2h at r.t. Plates were washed three times before adding horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody specific Plates were incubated for 1.5h and washed three times before the addition of 100l KPL 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine sub - strate per well for 8min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50l of 2N sulfuric acid, and the absorbance was measured the highest dilution of serum to give an optical density greater than the cut-off optical density value determined using the Frey method47. Pseudovirus neutralization assay A VSV pseudotype with SARS-CoV-2 S was first produced36. We per - formed an antibody neutralization assay using VSVG-RFP SARS-CoV-2. Vero E6 cells seeded in 100l DMEM at 2.5\u00d7104 cells per well in a 96-well collagen-coated plate. After 12h, twofold serially diluted with VSVG-RFP SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus (50-200 focus-forming units per well) encoding the spike of D614G, Beta or Delta variant and incubated for 1h at 37\u00b0C. A mouse anti-VSV Indiana G, 8G5F11 (#Ab01401-2.0, Absolute Antibody), was also included in this mixture to neutralize any potential VSV-G carryover virus at a concentration of 100ngml1. The antibody-virus mixture was then used to replace the media on Vero E6 TMPRSS2 cells. At 20h post-infection, the cells were washed and fixed with 4% PFA before visualization on an S6 FluoroSpot Analyzer (CTL). Individual infected foci were enumerated, and the values were compared with control wells without antibody. The focus reduction neutralization titre 50% (FRNT50) was measured as the greatest serum dilution at which focus count was reduced by at least 50% relative to control cells that were infected with pseudotype virus in the absence of mouse serum. FRNT 50 titres for each sample were measured in two technical replicates performed on separate days. Flow cytometry analysis of T and B cells T cell.

Plates were then washed five times with wash buffer, and 50l per well 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/ nitro blue tetrazolium chloride solution (Sigma, #B1911, 100ml) was added for ~10min or until spots developed at which time the reaction was quenched with 100l 1M sodium phosphate monobasic solution. After plates were rinsed with deionized H2O and dried overnight, they were scanned and counted using an S6 FluoroSpot Analyzer. Statistics and reproducibility All data followed by Tukey's test was applied for comparison between two groups or among multiple groups using Graphpad Prism 7.0, respectively. P <0.05 was considered to be sta- tistically significant. Each experiment is repeated at least three times independently with similar results, and the representative dataset is presented.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Port - folio Reporting Summary linked to this article.
