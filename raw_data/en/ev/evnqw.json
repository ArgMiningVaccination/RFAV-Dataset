Ehrenfeld, MD, MPH CV Page 72 Updated 2/25/2019 Narrative Report : I am a clinical anesthesiologist with strong interests in health care systems design, education, research, technology, and health policy. My time is split among teaching, r esearch and clinical practice. My clinical interests are anesthesia for neurosurgery. My research interests focus in two areas: (1) how we can leverage technology to improve learning and practice and reduce health disparities , and (2) how information technology can more effecti vely protect patients from harm and impact processes of care within the acute care environment s. For the past decade, I have advocated on behalf of LGBT Q patients, physicians, and trainees . Since I entered residency, I have conducted health services research focusing on education and biomedical informatics leadi ng to the presentation of over 225 abstracts at national/international meetings and the publication of over 180 manuscripts in high impact peer -reviewed journals. Additionally, I have co -authored seventeen clinical texts and over 50 book chapters . My interests within bioinformatics include: learning and perioperative systems design, real -time decision support via pragmatic applications of process monitoring & control, and the development/application of perio perative risk models and outcomes measures. I have received funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research, the Anesthesia Patient Saf ety Foundation Grant, and the Department of Defense. I also received two additional separate $100,000 grants to design and implement programs focused on education innovation. My recent work has focused on the development of new care delivery models, including a successful and sustained implementation of a Perioperative Surgical Home at Vanderbilt that led to marked reductions in hospital length of stay and improved patient outcomes. The unifying theme of my work has been to comprehend the science behind how information technology can educate trainees and provider s, reduce variability, and facilitate improved overall system reliability and performance . I have developed a reputation as a successful innovator, with surgeons, anesthesiologists, and educators inviting me to speak at national and international meetings. Since 2016, I have served as Director of Education Research for the Office of Health Sciences Education in the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. In this role, I work across the entire conti nuum of training in the health sciences (UME, GME & CME) to facilitate education research and scholarship initiatives by providing mentorship and oversight to junior faculty . I participate in didactic and clinical teaching across the entire educational con tinuum, from premedical students to advanced clinicians. I coordinate the monthly VUMC Education Works i n Progress Seminar Series, LGBTQ Health Grand Rounds, Anesthesia Informatics Journal Club, mentor Vanderbilt undergraduate students in a structured summ er clinical research program, precept medical students in the operating room, and lecture in several graduate and undergraduate courses across Vanderbilt University . I was selected to develop and serve as a course director for the Vanderbilt Foundations of Health Care Delivery Course - a comprehensive 4 -year required medical school course, which is designed to provide sustained experiential learning for students by integrating them into a clinic throughout their entire undergraduate medical training. I was a co -investigator on a $1,000,000 Accelerate Change in Medical Education Grant from the American Medical Association. I was named course director for a month -long 4th year medical student immersion course entitled \"Sex, Sexuality, and Sexual Health.\" I also created and now serve as rotation director for a required 2 week professional development rotation that is required of all of our trainees during their intern year. This rotation is now the highest rated rotation across the four year program. I have received several teaching award s, including the prestigious Excellence in Teaching Award from Harvard Medical School. My evaluations include comments such as \"Dr. Ehrenfeld seemed genuinely concerned with Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, MD, MPH CV Page 73 Updated 2/25/2019 making sure that we learned the material and that we en joyed tutorial\" and \"Dr. Ehrenfeld was a great tutorial leader and he went out of his way to make the sessions enjoyable for us. I learned a lot from him and truly enjoyed being in the group with him.\" Within my department, I am consistently rated a top ed ucator, and lecture in the core resident curriculum where my lectures routinely received some of the highest lecture rati ngs of the year (9.5 out of 10) and I have been one of a small number of faculty to receive perfect clinical teaching evaluations (5 ou t of 5 in all categories). My significant supporting activities are administration and institutional service. I have contributed a significant body of work through service on several distinguished national committees (ASA Standards & Practice Parameters Committee, New England Journal of Medicine Publications Committee ). I was elected to the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association in 2014, where I currently serve as Chair -Elect of the Board and have focused on policy issues related to education and health information tec hnology . In this role I have represented physicians in high -level policy discussions across multiple federal agencies, on Capitol Hill, and at the White House. These activities permit me to shape national healthcare policy through my advocacy for physician s and patients. I founded and serve as Director of the Office of LGBTQ Health at Vanderbilt University, as an advisor to the Vanderbilt LGBT MD student group, served as Chair of the Mass achusetts General Hospital LGBTQ employee resource group, Chair of the Massachusetts Committee on LGBTQ health, and was previously active as a member of the Board Committee on Quality and Compliance for Fenway Community Health. Additionally, I serve as a consultant to the Chancellor on LGBT Q issues. These activities have per mitted me to improve tolerance and care access for LGBTQ patients and physicians, through sponsorship of programs and CME lectures to support diverse patients, providers, and trainees. In recognition for my work in supporting equity and inclusion, in 2018 I was named the Joseph A. Johnson, Jr. Distinguished Leadership Professor and was selected to receive the inaugural NIH Sex and Gender Minority Research Award in 2018 from the NIH "}
