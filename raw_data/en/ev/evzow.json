When given alive, the organisms are weakened, or [attenuated](https://www.britannica.com/science/attenuation-immunization), by some laboratory means so that they still stimulate antibodies but do not produce their characteristic [disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/disease). However stimulated, the antibody-producing cells of the body remain sensitized to the infectious agent and can respond to it again, pouring out more [antibody](https://www.britannica.com/science/antibody). One attack of a disease, therefore, often renders a person immune to a second attack, providing the [theoretical](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/theoretical) basis for active immunization by vaccines. Antibody can be passed from one person to another, conferring protection on the antibody recipient. In such a case, however, the antibody has not been produced in the body of the second person, nor have his antibody-producing cells been stimulated. The antibody is then a foreign substance and is eventually eliminated from the body, and protection is short-lived. The most common form of this type of passive immunity is the transference of antibodies from a mother through the placenta to her unborn child. This is why a disease such as [measles](https://www.britannica.com/science/measles) is uncommon in babies younger than one year. After that age, the infant has lost all of its maternal antibody and becomes susceptible to the disease unless protective measures, such as measles vaccination, are taken. Sometimes antibody is extracted in the form of immunoglobulin from blood taken from immune persons and is injected into susceptible persons to give them temporary protection against a disease, such as measles or [hepatitis](https://www.britannica.com/science/hepatitis) A. Generally, active immunization is offered before the anticipated time of exposure to an infectious disease. When unvaccinated people are exposed to an infectious disease, two [alternatives](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternatives) are available: active immunization may be initiated immediately in the expectation that immunity can be developed during the incubation period of the disease, or passive immunity can be provided for the [interim](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interim) period and then active immunization given at an appropriate time. The [antigens](https://www.britannica.com/science/antigen) (foreign substances in the body that stimulate the immune defense system) introduced in the process of active immunization can be live [attenuated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attenuated) viruses or bacteria, killed microorganisms or inactivated toxins (toxoids), or purified [cell wall](https://www.britannica.com/science/cell-wall-plant-anatomy) products (polysaccharide capsules, protein antigens). There are five basic requirements for an ideal vaccine. The agents used for immunization should not in themselves produce disease. The immunizing agent should induce long-lasting, ideally permanent, immunity. The agent used for immunization should not be transmissible to susceptible contacts of the person being vaccinated. The vaccine should be easy to produce, its potency easy to assess, and the antibody response to it measurable with common and inexpensive techniques. Finally, the agent in the vaccine should be free of contaminating substances. It is also recognized, however, that vaccine transmissibility can be helpful\u2014e.g., in the case of live [polio vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/polio-vaccine), which can be spread from [vaccinated](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/vaccinated) children to others who have not been vaccinated. The route by which an [antigen](https://www.britannica.com/science/antigen) is administered frequently determines the type and duration of antibody response. For example, intramuscular injection of inactivated [poliomyelitis](https://www.britannica.com/science/polio) [virus](https://www.britannica.com/science/virus) ( [Salk vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/Salk-vaccine)) generates less production of serum antibody and induces only a temporary systemic immunity; it may not produce substantial local gastrointestinal immunity and, therefore, may not prevent the carrying of the virus in the [gastrointestinal tract](https://www.britannica.com/science/gastrointestinal-tract). Live, attenuated, oral poliomyelitis virus ( both local gastrointestinal and systemic antibody production; thus, immunization by mouth is preferred. The schedule by which a vaccine is given depends upon the [epidemiology](https://www.britannica.com/science/epidemiology) of the naturally occurring disease, the duration of immunity that can be induced, the immunologic status of the host, and, in some cases, the availability of the patient. Measles, for example, is present in many [communities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities) and poses a potential threat to many children over 5 months of age. A substantial number of infants, however, are born with measles antibody from their mothers, and this maternal antibody interferes with an adequate antibody response until they are between 12 and 15 months of age. Generally, the immunization of infants after the age of 15 months benefits the [community](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community) at large. In measles outbreaks, however, it may be advisable to alter this schedule and immunize all infants between 6 and 15 months of age. [Diphtheria toxoid](https://www.britannica.com/science/diphtheria-toxoid) The introduction of [diphtheria](https://www.britannica.com/science/diphtheria) toxoid in the early 20th century led to a dramatic reduction in the [incidence](https://www.britannica.com/science/incidence-epidemiology) of the disease in many parts of the world. Primary prevention programs consisting of communitywide routine immunization of infants and children have largely eliminated the [morbidity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/morbidity) and mortality previously associated with diphtheria. Although the reported annual incidence of diphtheria has been relatively constant since the 1960s, local [epidemics](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epidemics) continue to occur. A [complacent](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/complacent) attitude toward immunization in some nations largely reflects a lack of awareness of the [public health](https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-health) hazard that can arise if the proportion of susceptible individuals is significant enough to allow renewed outbreaks. Also, adequate immunization does not completely eliminate the potential for transmission of the bacterium [Corynebacterium diphtheriae](https://www.britannica.com/science/Corynebacterium-diphtheriae). Carriage of C. diphtheriae in the nose or throat has been well documented in fully immunized persons who clearly may transmit the disease to susceptible individuals. The vaccine\u2014prepared by the treatment of C. diphtheriae toxin with [formaldehyde](https://www.britannica.com/science/formaldehyde)\u2014is available in both fluid and adsorbed forms, the latter being recommended. Diphtheria toxoid is also available [combined](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/combined) with [tetanus](https://www.britannica.com/science/tetanus-disease) toxoid and pertussis vaccine (DPT), combined with tetanus toxoid alone (DT), and combined with tetanus toxoid for adults (Td). The Td preparation contains only 15 to 20 percent of the diphtheria toxoid present in the DPT vaccine and is more suitable for use in older children and adults. [Pertussis vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/pertussis-vaccine) The number of cases of pertussis ( [whooping cough](https://www.britannica.com/science/whooping-cough)), a serious disease that is frequently fatal in infancy, can be dramatically reduced by the use of the pertussis vaccine. The pertussis immunizing agent is included in the DPT vaccine. Active immunity can be induced by three injections given eight weeks apart. [Tetanus toxoid](https://www.britannica.com/science/tetanus-toxoid) The [efficacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficacy) of active immunization against [tetanus](https://www.britannica.com/science/tetanus-disease) was illustrated most dramatically during [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II), when the introduction of tetanus toxoid among military personnel virtually eliminated the occurrence of the disease as a result of war-related injuries. Since then, the routine immunization of civilian populations with tetanus toxoid has resulted in the decreased incidence of tetanus. In the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States), for example, 50 or fewer cases of tetanus are reported each year, the majority of deaths occurring in persons more than 60 years of age. In virtually all cases, the disease has been reported in unimmunized or inadequately immunized individuals. Because it provides long-lasting protection and relative safety in humans, tetanus toxoid has proved to be an ideal vaccine. Tetanus toxoid is available in both vaccine fluid and alum-precipitated preparations. Commercially, tetanus toxoid is available in DPT, Td, and T (tetanus toxoid, adsorbed) preparations. DPT is recommended for infants, while the Td form is recommended at 12 and again at 18 years of age and only once every 10 years thereafter. If a person [sustains](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/sustains) a [wound](https://www.britannica.com/science/wound) prone to tetanus (such as a puncture wound or a wound contaminated with animal excreta), Td is given along with tetanus immune globulin (TIG) to prevent occurrence of the disease.
