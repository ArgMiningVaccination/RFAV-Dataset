Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures / 65 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) ARTICLE 7. REQUESTING APPROVAL FO R COVERED SERVICES AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES. This Article 7 sets forth the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services from us as well as general Grievance procedures. In processing claims, we review requests for Precertification, Predetermination, and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to determine whether provided or proposed to be provided Health Care Services are Covered Services. Health Care Services must be Medically Necess ary for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests. (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review [your] [this] Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service or treatment meets our definition of Medical Necessity, or if it is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Contract. (c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are done for Health Care Services for which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. (2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertification or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. [Your] [The Covered Person's] Primary Care Physician and all other Participating Providers have received info rmation from us on the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Provider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination reviews (\"Requesting Provider\"). We will work directly with [your] [the] Requesting Provider regarding such review requests; however, [your] [the Covered Person's] Designated Representative may act on [your] [the Covered Person's] behalf throughout the review process. (3) We will utilize our clinical coverage guidelines, including internally developed guidelines, procedures, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to help us determine whether Health Care Services are Covered Services. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions Identified Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures / 66 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) as appropriate medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically.

(2) Pre-Service - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. (3) Concurrent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during an ongoing course of treatment or admission. If we have approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or a number of treatments, any reduction or termination by us of such course of treatment before the end of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute a benefit determination adverse to [you][the Covered Person]. We will notify [you] [the Covered Person] sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow [you] [the Covered Person] to appeal and obtain a determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. (4) Post-Service - A request for approval that is made after the service, treatment or admission has occurred.

Coordination of Benefits / 76 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) ARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply throughout this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits. In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Pl ans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the ot her Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other com pany will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaini ng expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions. (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessa ry, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a similar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of servic es through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) substantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employ er organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without considering the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment. When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Secondary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules. The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) primary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan. The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whether or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retiree or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) (4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree longer is Primary. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid if it had been Primary. E. Payment of the Benefit When This Plan is Secondary. (1) When this Plan is Secondary, the benefits of this Plan will be reduced so that the total benefits payable under the other Plan and this Plan do not exceed your expenses for an item of service. The difference between the benefit payments that this Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provi ded shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the Covered Person and used by the Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the Claim Determination Period. As each claim is submitted, this Plan will: (a) Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its Plan; (b) Determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Covered Person; and (c) Determine whether there are any unpaid Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. (2) If there is a benefit reserve, the Secondary Plan will use the Covered Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the Claim Determination Period. At the end of the Claim Determination Period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. (3) If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of serv ice by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, Coordination of Benefits shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. F. Payments to Others. We may repay to any other person, insurance company or organization the amount which it paid for your Covered Services and which we decide we should have paid. These payments are the same as benefits paid. G. Our Right to Recover Overpayment. In some cases, we may have made payment even though you had coverage under another Plan. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for you to refund to us the amount by which we should have reduced the Coordination of Benefits / 80 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) payment we made. We also have the right to recover the overpayment from the other health benefits plan if we have not already re ceived payment from that other Plan. You agree to sign any document that we deem necessary to help us recover any overpayment. Termination of Coverage / 81 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE A.

The purpose of this rate filing is to establish new product rates that are reasonable relative to the benefits provided and to demonstrate compliance wi th State of Indiana statutes and provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This memorandum documents the development of the Individual rates for Indiana University Health Plans, Inc. (IUHP). The rates will be in-force for effective dates on or after January 1, 2015. These rates will apply to plans offered bo th On-Exchange and Off- Exchange. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. This information is intended for use by the State of Indiana Department of I nsurance, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO ), and their subcontractors to assist in the review of IUHP 's Individual rate filing. However, we r ecognize that this certification may become a public document. PwC makes no representations or warranties regarding the contents of this memorandum to third parties. Like wise, third parties are instructed th at they are to place no reliance upon this actuarial memorandum prepared for IUHP by PwC that would result in the creation of any duty or liability under any theory of law by PwC or its employees to third parties. These results are actuarial projections. Actual experience is likely to differ for a number of reasons, including populatio n changes, claims experience, and random deviations from assumptions.

A summary of the major provisions of each plan are provided in Appendix A. Premium Guarantee Provision Premiums are guaranteed not to cha nge through December 31, 2015. Renewability The policy is renewable by paying the applicab le renewal premiums unl ess the policyholder no longer meets the eligibility requirements of the policy or the company decides not to renew all the policies in the state. Applicability The rates will apply to new business. Subsequent renewal business will be subject to rates filed for our 2016 rate development. Premium Modalization Premiums will be collected only on a monthly basis. Trend Assumption Rates are effective for calendar year 2015. Trend assumptions will be developed for future rating periods based on develo ping experience, and an ticipated changes in pro vider reimbursement. 2) Proposed Rate Increase(s) This is a new filing therefore no rate increase ass umption is included in this filing. Subsequent rate increases beginning with effective dates of January 1, 2016 will be filed in the future. 3) Experience Period Pr emium and Claims Not applicable. This is a new f iling based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 5 4) Benefit Categories The methodology used to determine benefit categories in Worksheet 1, Section II of the Unified Rate Review Template is as follows: Inpatient Hospital: Includes non- capitated facility services for medical , surgical, maternity, mental health and substance abuse, skilled nursing, and other services provided in an inpatient facility setting and billed by the facility. Outpatient Hospital: I ncludes non-capitated facility services for surgery, emergency room, lab, radiology, therapy, observation, and other services provided in an outpatient facility setting and billed by the facility. Professional: Includes non-capitated primary ca re, specialist, therapy, the professional component of laboratory and radiol ogy, and other professional se rvices, other than hospital based professionals whose payments are included in facility fees. Other Medical: Includes non-capitated ambulance, home health care, DME, prosthetics, supplies, and other services. Capitation: Includes capitated services for pediatric vision benefits. Prescription Drug: Includes dru gs dispensed by a pharmacy and rebates received from drug manufacturers. 5) Projection Factors Not applicable. This is a new f iling based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for detail s regarding the rate development process. 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development The PwC Rating Model was used as the basis to de velop the manual rates. Our model was developed using two primary sources: /g190 Commercial Truven Health MarketScan \u00ae Research Databases for U.S. members and providers. The database contains full enro llment and claims information with standard medical coding which allows for cost and utilization information by service category (inpatient, outpatient hospital, hospice, home health, professional, prescription drugs, etc.). The database consists of the experience from 53 million Commercial eligible participants. The data can be extracted down to the membe r's state and MSA leve l. For the Indiana Commercial market, there were approximately 1.5 million exposed life years' worth of data crossing all ages, genders and employment stat uses (active, COBRA, disabled and retired). Nationwide, the databases have ov er 100 unique data contributors so it is not skewed to any one payer. /g190 OptumInsight (Optum) Comprehensive Pricing Model\u00ae provides benchmark data and pricing capabilities for Commercial health plans. It factors in health plan features such as deductibles, copays, out-of-pocket maximums, covered services, etc. The model uses normative data and benefit detail s to arrive at an allowed cost per member per month. The 6 normative benchmarking utilization metrics within the model are developed from Optum's database of Commercial (under 65) health plan experience of approximately 20 million life years. The model experience was adjuste d to reflect the Indiana marketplace. Since both the Truven and Optum data sources represent fully-completed calendar year 2012 claims, allowed costs were trended to the midpoint of calendar year 20 15 using an annual trend rate of 7.4%. The allowed costs component of the manual rates was increased by 2% to account for expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential He alth Benefits (EHB) requirements. The following is not an all inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: /g190 Maternity and prescription drug coverage. /g190 State mandated benefits includ ed in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. /g190 Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. /g190 Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary signif icantly depending on the de finition of the benefit. /g190 Pediatric vision and dental mu st be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting costs of pediatric coverage. In our May 9, 2014 filing, we noted that the Indian a Department of Insurance (IDOI) was expected to provide additional information pertaining to the Medicaid Spend-Down population. IUHP also reserved the right to revise their initial filing to reflect any additional data. Subsequent to IUHP's May 9, 2014 filing, the IDOI released additional SFY 2013 information pertaining to the Medicaid Spend-Down population which included the following: /g190 Summary of unique individuals, Medicaid al lowed, Medicaid paid, and billed charges by age band, gender, and FPL % category /g190 Summary of the Medicaid allowed, Medicai d paid, and Billed charges for each unique individual /g190 Summary of unique individu als, Medicaid allowed, Medi caid paid, and billed charges by county The manual rates were increased by 5.2% to re flect the entrance of approximately 7,000 Medicaid Spend-Down beneficiaries into the Indiana Health Insurance Exchang e. This adjustment was based on the assumption that IUHP's penetration of the Medicaid Spend -Down population wo uld be similar to their assumed penetration of the general population for the counties included in IUHP's proposed service area. There will also be new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these peop le would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat min or health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. Pent up demand has been shown to increase costs in the first year of enrollment for those 7 previously uninsured. Based on analysis of pro grams serving a similar popu lation, it appears that the claims are higher in the first six to 12 months that an individual is newly insured. After this initial period, the claims ex perience tends to revert to the average le vel for the market. The total effect is uncertain and may be offset by some new enrollees having reduced utilization as they may not fully understand new or increased coverage. Therefore, we have included an ad justment within our manual rate development for pent up demand of 3.0%. The following adjustments were made to calibrate the pricing model to the expected population: /g190 Rating region /g190 Expected demographics /g190 Expected morbidity /g190 Contractual Agreements with healthcare providers /g190 Expected utilization management savings /g190 Benefit plan designs Some benefits will be reimbursed under a capitation arrangement. The provider reimbursement adjustment to the pricing model was developed to account for the cost of capitated services. The manual rates were also adjusted upward by a factor of 1.005 to account for the likelihood that some enrollees may not pay their pre miums due during the first mont h of the 90-day grace period. This was calculated assuming a 15% rate of non-payment on on e-twelfth of the annual premium due for 80% of the Individual population (those eligible for Ad vance Payments of a Premium Tax Credit). The amount of premium at risk is only on the portion that IUHP does not receive via direct subsidy, estimated to be 50% (0.15 x 1/12 x 0.80 x 0.50 = 0.005). The 15% represents our assumption regarding the small portion of enrollees th at we believe will knowingly take advantage of the grace period provision. The 80% represents the portion of enrollees in the 2015 Individual marketplace that we assume will be eligible for premium subsidies based on i ncome level. On May 1, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Servi ces reported that as of April 19, 2014, 89% of those enrolled in the Indiana exchange were eligib le for federal assistance. Our assumption is that this percentage will decrease during 2015. 7) Credibility of Experience IUHP has not previously operated in the individual market. As a result the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been po pulated. Similarly, the projection factors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Workshe et 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 8) Paid to Allowed Ratio The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Projection Period \" shown on Worksheet 1, Section II I of the URRT is developed by membership-weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership-weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan. The projected membership by plan is shown in Worksheet 2, Section II. 8 The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in th e 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM The Risk Adjustment program transfers funds from lower risk plans to high er risk plans in the Non- Grandfathered Individual and Small Group market. At this time, IUHP is assuming the risk for the plans in this filing are no better or worse than othe r plans in the market, resulting in no estimated risk transfer value. Therefore, no risk ad justment PMPM payment is assumed for 2015. Projected ACA Reinsurance Recoveries Ne t of Reinsurance Prem ium (Individual Market and Combined Markets Only) The Federal transitional reinsu rance program is a temporary ri sk mitigation program expected to reduce costs for insurance issuers. The 2015 reinsurance prog ram has an attachment point of $70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. The Department of Health and Human Services will reimburse insura nce issuers 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. Allowed claims were reduced by 7.0% to account fo r the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from this temporary program. This estimate was deve loped using projected paid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the expected average claim levels for the 2015 Individual market, and the federal program guidelines summarized above. The expected reinsurance reimbursements are $45.48 PMPM. Applying the 2015 transitional rei nsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of $41.81 PMPM. Projected Net Cost of Private Reinsurance The projected net cost of private reinsurance for 20 15 is $0.00 PMPM since IUHP does not intend to purchase private reinsurance. 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk Administrative Expense Load IUHP developed their expected administrative expenses based on: a) current administrative expenses for their Medicare line of business ad justing for any expected differences for their Commercial products, and b) a revi ew of 2014 Rate Filings for In dividual Exchange products. A summary of IUHP's assumptions is as follows: /g190 Administrative expenses (excluding Sal es and Marketing expenses): 10.50% of premium /g190 Sales and Marketing expenses (incl uding commissions): $6.18 PMPM These administrative expenses are allocated proportionally by plan. 9 Quality Improvement Expenses At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. Therefore, no explicit Quality Improvement expenses were assumed. Profit & Risk Margin The proposed rates reflect a profit & risk margin of 3.0% of premium. This load was applied to all products and plans. Taxes and Fees A summary of the assumed taxes and fees are summarized below: PMPM Basis /g190 Transitional reinsurance charge: $3 .67 PMPM Percentage of Premium Basis /g190 Health insurance exchange fee: 3. 15% of premium reflecting I UHP's assumption that 90% of their expected 2015 business w ill be sold through the exchange /g190 ACA issuer fee: 2.00% of premium /g190 Premium tax: 1.30% of premium 11) Projected Loss Ratio The overall projected medical loss ra tio for 2015 is 84.9%. This calculation excludes regulatory fees and taxes. At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expe nses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. As a result, we have not included an adj ustment in the MLR calculation for these expenses. It is IUHP's intent to identify their Quality Improvement expenses for purposes of submitting their MLR-related filings and calculating related rebates, if any. Th e following table shows the calculation. 10 a) Incurred Claims Net of Cost Sharing $439.86 b) Transitional Reinsurance Reimbursement ($45.48) c) Reinsurance Charge $3.67 d) Quality Improvement Expenses $0.00 e) Worksheet 1 Projected Incurred Claims (a+b+c+d) $398.05 f) Administrative Expenses $59.23 g) Profit & Risk Margin $15.16 h) Regulatory Taxes and Fees (excluding reinsurance charge) $32.84 i) Gross Premium (e+f+g+h) $505.27 j) Medical Loss Ratio (e/(i-c-h)) 84.9% 12) Single Risk Pool IUHP has not previously operated in the Individu al market and thus does not have any claims experience to develop its own Si ngle Risk Pool. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credib ility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 13) Index Rate This is a new filing based on manual rate pro jections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the Index Rate for the Ex perience Period has be en left blank. The Index Rate of $649.68 for the 2015 Proj ection Period represents the overall projected allowed costs PMPM for providing Essential Health Benefits for the Single Risk Pool. Since this is a new product, the index rate was developed based on a manual rate as de scribed above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section. Th e Index Rate will r emain unchanged until a renewal filing effective January 1, 2016. 14) Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market-wide modifiers defined in the market ratin g rules, 45 CFR Part 15 6, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market-wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowabl e under these rules: /g190 Federal reinsurance program (market-wide adjustment) /g190 adjustment (market-wide adjustment) /g190 Exchange user fee adjustment (market-wide adjustment) Similar to the Index Rate, the Market Adjust ed Index Rate reflects the average demographic 11 characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Market Adjusted Index Rate is not calibrated. The development of the Federal reinsurance pr ogram and risk adjust ments was described above in the Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance section. The development of the Exchange user fee adjustment was described above in the Non-Be nefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section. I n d e x R a t e $ 6 4 9 . 6 8 Reinsurance Reimbursements (7.0% of Allowed Claims - Index Rate) ($45.48) Reinsurance Premiums $ 3.67 Risk Adjustment $ 0.00 Exchange user fee (3.15% of average premium for Single Risk Pool) $ 15.92 Market Adjusted Index Rate $623.78 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rates The Plan Adjusted Index Rates are included in Worksheet 2, Section IV of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template in 2015. These Plan Adjusted Index Rates have been ad justed to remove the portion of the allowed cost that is expected to be recouped through the tobacco surcharge. The average tobacco surcharge for the Single Risk Pool is approximately 1.4%. The Plan Adjusted Index Rates reflect the average demographic characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Plan Adj usted Index Rates are not calibrated. The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the issu er Market Adjusted Index Rate adjusted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). The following adjustme nts are allowable under these rules: /g190 Actuarial value and cost sharing adjustment (plan adjustment) /g190 Provider network, delivery system and utilization management adjustment (plan adjustment) /g190 Adjustment for benefits in addition to the EHBs (plan adjustment) /g190 Impact of specific eligibility categories for the catastrophic plan (plan adjustment) /g190 Adjustment for distribution and ad ministrative costs (plan adjustment) Only the actuarial value and cost sharing & distri bution and admi nistrative costs adjustments were applicable to IUHP. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment This adjustment includes three components: /g190 Removal of tobacco surcharge - the average tobacco surcharge factor was applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool /g190 Benefit richness utilization adjustments - The re ference plan underlyi ng our pricing was a Silver plan. Benefit richness utilization adjustm ents were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge). These 12 adjustments were based on the values publishe d in the Federal Regi ster payment notice, normalized to the Silver plan level. The adjustments for each metallic tier are as follows: /g131 Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = = 1.00 / 1.00 = 1.0000 /g131 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 /g190 Cost Sharing - The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT was used to calculate th e cost sharing percentage for each plan. These cost sharing percentages were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of th e tobacco surcharge and applying the benefit richness utilization adjustments). The estimate d Cost Sharing Red uction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment P arameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). Adjustment for Distribution and Administrative Costs Fixed and variable costs as describe d in the Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section were included in this adjustment as follows: /g190 Fixed costs: Risk adjustment user fee, PC ORI fee, and sales & marketing expenses /g190 Variable costs (% of premium) : Administrative expenses, profit & risk margin, ACA issuer fee, and premium taxes. The percentages applied did not vary by plan. Appendix D shows the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 16) Calibration The Plan Adjusted Index Rates (w hich are based on the Single Risk Pool) were calibrated to apply the allowable rating factors in order to calculate Consumer Adjusted Premium Rates. The calibration by age and geography is described below. Age Curve Calibration The methodology employed in the calculation of the average age and the calibration to the age curve complies with the standard age curve meth odology and conforms with the rating rules specified in 45 CFR 147.102. The expected membership distri bution by age band was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by th e Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. A uniform distribution within each age band was also assumed. A weighted average age factor of 1.685 for the Single Risk Pool was also determined by applying the membership distribution to the Federal age curve. This represents a rounded weighted average age of 49. Appendix C shows the development of the weighted average age factor. The Plan Index Rates were calibrated by dividing by 1.685. This calibration factor does not vary by plan. 13 Geographic Factor Calibration A geographic factor calibration was not required since the weighted average of the geographic factors equals 1.0. The Geographic (rating area) factors were developed based upon the network characteristics for unit cost and utilization manage ment in each of the established rating areas. Based upon the expected di stribution of enrolment by area, the area factors reflect the Single Risk Pool results consistent with the URRT. Appendix D shows how the calibration adjustment s were applied to the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 17) Consumer Adjusted Prem ium Rate Development The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final prem ium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual, family, or small employer group utilizing the rating and premium adjustments as articulated in the applicable Market Reform Rating Rules. The Consume r Adjusted Premium Rate is developed by calibrating the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve as described above, calibrating for geography if necessary, and applying th e rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. The following adjustments are allowable under this rule: /g190 Whether the plan coverage covers an individual or family (issuers must cover any eligible individual and/or eligible family that re quests coverage per the guaranteed issue requirement of the ACA); this is further clarif ied in regulation that the premium for family coverage is determined by summing the premi ums for each individual family member, provided at most three child dependents under age 21 are taken into account; this adjustment does not result in a separate rating factor /g190 Rating area /g190 Age - reflecting the appl icable age curve /g190 Tobacco status The rating factors (shown in Appendix C) are ap plied at an individual level and added together to calculate the family rate, with the exception that no more than 3 covered children under the age of 21 are charged a rate. Adjustment for family size is in accordance with Federal rules. The examples in Appendix E show how th e rating factors are applied to the calibrated Plan Adjusted Index Rate. 18) AV Metal Values The Federal AV calculator was used without any mo difications to generate the Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the URRT. Please ref er to Appendix F for screen shots showing the AV calculations for each plan. 14 19) AV Pricing Values The Silver Value plan was selected as the fixed re ference plan and serves as the basis for the AV Pricing Values. Please refer to Ap pendix C for the AV Pricing Values for each plan which are also included in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT. The AV Pricing Value for each plan reflects the relative impact of the plan's cost -sharing amounts, expected impa ct on enrollee utilization due to benefit richness (excluding impact of morbidity), expected addi tional cost of non-EHB, and administrative expe nses (excluding health insu rance exchange user fees). This is a new filing based on manual rate pro jections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the PwC Ratin g Model as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section was used to develop the benefit relativities for the AV Pricing Values. 20) Membership Projections Membership projections were based on market pe netration assumptions provided by IUHP. These assumptions reflected the uninsured and indi vidual market populati ons by county, income level, and other characteristics su ch as the presence of IUHP faci lities and delivery system within a given county. The expected membership distribu tion by age band and metallic tier was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 repo rted by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. For the S ilver plans, the portion of the projected enrollment that will be eligible for CSR subsidies at each subsidy level was based on the income level detail in the market penetration analysis provided by IUHP. Summaries of the projected membership by age, m etallic tier, and CSR subsi dy level are shown in Appendix B. 21) Terminated Products Not applicable. IUHP do es not currently have Individual plans in the State of Indiana. 22) Plan Type All plans listed types in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT correctly describe IUHP's plans as \"HMO\" . 23) Warning Alerts There were no warnings generated on Worksheet 2 of in the URRT. 24) Company Financial Position Please see Appendix G for information regarding the capital and surpl us position of IUHP. 15 25) Reliance In the preparation of this filing, I have relied up on data provided by Eric Neuville (Vice President Product Development and Innovation), Connie Brown (CFO and COO), and IUHP management. I did not audit this data but did review it for re asonableness. This information includes but is not limited to the following items: /g190 Administrative expense projecti ons (including commissions) /g190 Provider reimbursement levels (including capitation arrangements) /g190 Projected enrollment /g190 Projected pharmacy discounts, unit costs and rebates /g190 Financial statement information 26) Actuarial Certification I, Robert Macagnano, FSA, MAAA, am affiliated with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).

I certify that the percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and IV is calculated in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. I certify that the Federal AV Calculator was used to determine the AV M etal Values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template for all plans. On/Off Exchange Attestation I certify that a single set of pr emium rates was submitted with this filing which is applicable for all plans offered both on and off the Exchange, and that this assures the same premium rate will be charged without regard to whethe r the plan is offered through the Exchange or whether the plan is offered directly from the Company or through an agent. QHP Off Exchange Premium Ta x Credit (PTC) Attestation To notify consumers that coverage purchased outsid e of the Exchange is not eligible for premium tax credit assistance, the Company wi ll include the following langua ge in their marketing materials: \"DISCLAIMER: The ACA includes provisions to lo wer premiums and reduce cost-sharing for individuals with low to modest incomes throu gh Advance Payments Premium Tax Credits and Cost-Sharing Reductions. Such affordability programs are availa ble only for qualif ying individuals who purchase health insurance coverage throug h the Indiana Marketplace . Please be advised that this Policy does not qualify for these affo rdability programs because it was not issued through the Indiana Marketplace. \" This disclaimer is loca ted on page 1 of the Company's policy form. The Part I Unified Rate Review Template does not demonstrate the process used by the Company to develop the rates. Rather, it represents info rmation required by Federal regulation to be provided in support of the review of rate increases, for certification of Qualified Health Plans for Federally Facilitated Exchanges and for certification that the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used con sistently and only ad justed by the allowable modifiers.

A summary of the major provisions of each plan are provided in Appendix A. Premium Guarantee Provision Premiums are guaranteed not to change through December 31, 201 5. Renewability The policy is renewable by paying the applicable renewal premiums unless the policyholder no longer meets the eligibility requirements of the policy or the c ompany decides not to renew all the policies in the state. Applicability The rates will apply to new business. Subsequent renewal business will be subject to rates filed for our 201 6 rate development. Premium Modalization Premiums will be collected only on a monthly basis. Trend Assumption Rates are effective for calendar year 201 5. Trend assumptions will be developed for future rating periods based on developing experience, and anticipated changes in provider reimbursemen t. 2) Proposed Rate Increase (s) This is a new filing therefore no rate increase assumption is included in this filing. Subsequent rate increases beginning with effective dates of January 1, 201 6 will be filed in the future. 3) Experience Period Premium and Claims Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 5 4) Benefit Categories The methodology used to determine benefit categories in Worksheet 1, Section II of the Unified Rate Review Template is as follows: Inpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for medical, surgical, maternity, mental health and substance abuse, skilled nursing, and other se rvices provided in an inpatient facility setting and billed by the facility. Outpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for surgery, emergency room, lab, radiology, therapy, observation, and other services provided in an outpatient facil ity setting and billed by the facility. Professional: Includes non -capitated primary care, specialist, therapy, the professional component of laboratory and radiology, and other professional services, other than hospital based professionals whose payments are included in facility fees. Other Medical: Includes non -capitated ambulance, home health care, DME, prosthetics, supplies, and other services. Capitation: Includes capitated services for pediatric vision benefits . Prescription Drug: Includes drugs dispe nsed by a pharmacy and rebates received from drug manufacturers. 5) Projection Factors Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development The PwC Rating Model was used as the basis to develop the manual rates. Our model was developed using two primary sources: Commercial Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases for U.S. members and providers. The database contains full enrollment and claims information with standard medical coding which allows for cost and utilization information by service category (inpatient, outpatient hospital, hospice, home health, professional, prescripti on drugs, etc.). The database consists of the experience from 53 million Commercial eligible participants. The data can be extracted down to the member's state and MSA level. For the Indiana Commercial market, there were approximately 1.5 million expos ed life years' worth of data crossing all ages, genders and employment statuses (active, COBRA, disabled and retired). Nationwide, the databases have over 100 unique data contributors so it is not skewed to any one payer. OptumInsight (Optum) Comprehensi ve Pricing Model \u00ae provides benchmark data and pricing capabilities for Commercial health plans. It factors in health plan features such as deductibles, copays, out -of-pocket maximums, covered services, etc. The model uses normative data and benefit details to arrive at an allowed cost per member per month . The 6 normative benchmarking utilization metrics within the model are developed from Optum's database of Commercial (under 65) health plan experience of approximately 20 million life years . The model experi ence was adjusted to reflect the Indiana marketplace. Since both the Truven and Optum data sources represent fully -completed calendar year 2012 claims, allowed costs were trended to the midpoint of calendar year 2015 using an annual trend rate of 7.4%. The allowed costs component of the manual rates was increased by 2% to account for expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential Health Benefits ( EHB) requirements . The following is not an all inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expec ted to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on cl aims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the re sulting costs of pediatric coverage. In our May 9, 2014 filing, we noted that the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) was expected to provide additional information pertaining to the Medicaid Spend -Down population. IUHP also reserved the right to revise their initial filing to reflect any additional data. Subsequent to IUHP's May 9, 2014 filing, the IDOI released additional SFY 2013 information pertaining to th e Medicaid Spend -Down population which included the follo wing: Summary of unique individuals , Medicaid allowed, Medicaid paid, and billed charges by age band, gender, and FPL % category Summary of the Medicaid allowed, Medicaid paid, and Billed charges for each unique individual Summary of unique individuals, Medicaid allowed, Medicaid paid, and billed charges by county The manual rates were increased by 5.2% to reflect the entrance of approximately 7,000 Medicaid Spend -Down beneficiaries into the Indiana Health Insurance Exchange. This adjustment was based on the assumption that IUHP's penetration of the Medicaid Spend -Down population would be similar to their assumed penetration of the general population for the counties included in IUHP's proposed service area . There will also be new enrollees in the indivi dual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. Pent up demand has been shown to increase costs in the first year of enrollment for those 7 previously uninsured. Based on analysis of programs serving a similar population, it appears that the claims are higher in the first six to 12 months that an individual is newly insured. After this initial period, the claims experience tends to revert to the average level for the market. The total effect is uncertain and may be offset by some new enrollees having reduced utilization as they may not fully understand new or increased coverage. Therefore, we have included an adjustment within our manual rate development for pent up demand of 5 .0%. The following adjustments were made to calibrate the pricing model to the expected population: Rating region Expected demographics Expected morbidity Contractual Agreements with h ealthcare providers Expected utilization management savings Benefit plan designs Some benefits will be reimbursed under a capitation arrangement. The provider reimbursement adjustment to the pricing model was developed to account for the cost of capitated services. The manual rates were also adjusted upward by a factor of 1.00 5 to account for the likelihood that some enrollees may not pay their premiums due during the first month of the 90 -day grace period. This was calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment on one -twelfth of the annual premium due for 80% of the Individual population (those eligible for Advance Payments of a Premium Tax Credit). The amount of premium at risk is only on the portion that IUHP does not receive via direct subsidy, estimated to be 50% (0.15 x 1/12 x 0.80 x 0.50 = 0.005). The 15% represents our assumption regarding the small portion of enrollees that we believe will knowingly take advantage of the grace period provision. The 80% represents the portion of enrollees in the 2015 Individual marketplace that we assume will be eligible for premium subsidies based on income level. On May 1, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that as of April 19, 2014, 89% of those enrolled in the Indiana exchange were eligible for federal assistance. Our assumption is that this percentage will decrease during 2015. 7) Credibility of Experience IUHP has not previously operated in the individual market. As a result the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection factors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 8) Paid to Allowed Ratio The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Proje ction Period \" shown on Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT is developed by membership -weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership -weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan . The projected membership by plan is sho wn in Worksheet 2, Section II. 8 The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsura nce Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM The Risk Adjustment program transfers funds from lower risk plans to higher risk plans in the Non - Grandfathered Individual and Small Group market. At this time, IUHP is assuming the risk for the plans in this filing are no better or worse than other plans in the market, resulting in no estimated risk transfer value . Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed for 2015. Projected ACA Reinsurance Recoveries Net of Reinsurance Premium (Individual Market and Combined Markets Only) The Federal transitional reinsurance program is a temporary risk mitigation program expected to reduce costs for insurance issuers. The 201 5 reinsurance program has an att achment point of $70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. The Department of Health and Human Services will reimburse insurance issuers 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. Allowed claims were reduce d by 7.0% to account for the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from this temporary program. This estimate was de veloped using projected paid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the expected average claim levels for the 2015 Individual market, and the federal program guidelines summarized above. The expected reinsurance reimbursements are $46.95 PMPM . Applying the 2015 transitional reinsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of $4 3.28 PMPM. Projected Net Cost of Private Reinsurance The projected net cost of private reinsurance for 2015 is $0.00 PMPM since IUHP does not intend to purchase private reinsurance. 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk Administrative Expense Load IUHP developed their expected administrative expenses based on : a) current administrative expenses for their Medicare line of business adjusting for any expected differences for their Commercial products , and b) a review of 2014 Rate Filings for Individual Exchange products . A summary of IUHP's assumptions is as follows: Administrative expenses (excluding Sales and Marketing expenses ): 10.50% of premium Sales and Marketing expenses (including c ommissions ): $6.18 PMPM These administrative expenses are allocated proportionally by plan. 9 Quality Improvement Expenses At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives . Therefore, no explicit Quality Improvement expenses were assum ed. Profit & Risk Margin The proposed rates reflect a profit & risk margin of 3.0% of premium . This load was applied to all products and plans. Taxes and Fees A summary of the assumed taxes and fees are summarized below: PMPM Basis Transitional reinsurance charge: $3.67 PMPM ($44.00 PCORI fee: $0.17 PMPM ($2.00 per member Percentage of Premium Basis Health insurance exchange fee: 3.15% of premium reflecting IUHP's assumption tha t 90% of their expected 2015 business will be sold through the exchange ACA issuer fee: IUHP will not be subject to this fee for 2015 Premium tax: 1.30% of premium 11) Projected Loss Ratio The overall projected medical loss ratio for 2015 is 85.2%. Th is calculation exclude s regulatory fees and taxes. At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. As a result, we have not included an adjustm ent in the MLR calculation for these expenses. It is IUHP's intent to identify their Quality Improvement expenses for purposes of submitting their MLR -related filings and calculating related rebates , if any. The following table shows the calculation. 10 a) Incurred Claims Net of Cost Sharing $455.1 4 b) Transitional Reinsurance Reimbursement ($46.95 ) c) Reinsurance Charge $3.67 d) Quality Improvement Expenses $0.00 e) Worksheet 1 Projected Incurred Claims ( a+b+c +d) $411.86 f) Administrative Expenses $59.70 g) Profit & Risk Margin $15.29 h) Regulatory Taxes and Fees (excluding reinsurance charge) $22.93 i) Gross Premium ( e+f+g+h) $509.79 j) Medical Loss Ratio ( e/(i-c-h)) 85.2% 12) Single Risk Pool IUHP has not previously operated in the Individual market and thus does not have any claims experience to develop its own Single Risk Pool . This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 13) Index Rate This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the Index Rate for the Experience Period has been left blank . The Index Rate of $670.70 for the 2015 Projection Period represents the overall projected allowed costs PMPM for providing Essential Health Benefits for the Single Risk Pool . Since this is a new product , the index rate was developed based on a manual rate as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section. The Index Rate will remain unchanged until a renewal filing effective January 1, 201 6. 14) Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market -wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market -wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowable under these rules: Federal reinsurance program adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Risk adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Exchange user fe e adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Similar to the Index Rate, the Market Adjusted Index Rate reflects the average demographic 11 characteristics of the Single R isk Pool. In other words, the Market Adjusted Index Rate is not calibrated. The development of t he Federal reinsurance program and risk adjustments was described above in the Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance section. The development of the Exchange user fee adjustment was described above in the Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section. Index R ate $670.70 Reinsurance Reimbursements (7.0% of Allowed Claims - Index Rate) ($46.95 ) Reinsurance Premiums $ 3.67 Risk Adjustment $ 0.00 Exchange user fee (3.15% of average premium for Single Risk Pool) $ 16.06 Market Adjusted Index Rate $643.47 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rate s The Plan Adjusted Index Rates are included in Worksheet 2, Section IV of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template in 2015. These Plan Adjusted Index Rates have been adjusted to remove the portion of the allowed cost that is expected to be recouped through the tobacco surcharge. The average tobacco surcharge for the Single Risk Pool is approximately 1. 4%. The Plan Adjusted Index Rates reflect the average dem ographic characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Plan Adjusted Index Rate s are not calibrated. The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the issuer Market Adjusted Index Rate adjusted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). The following adjustments are allowable under these rules: Actuarial value and cost sharing adjustment (plan adjustment) Provider network, delivery system and utilization management adjustment (pl an adjustment) Adjustment for benefits in addition to the EHBs (plan adjustment) Impact of specific eligibility categories for the catastrophic plan (plan adjustment ) Adjustment for distribution and administrative costs (plan adjustment) Only the a ctuarial value and cost sharing & distribution and administrative costs adjustments were applicable to IUHP. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment This adjustment includes three components: Removal of tobacco surcharge - the average tobacco surcharge factor was applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool Benefit richness utilization adjustments - The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. Benefit richness utilization adjustments were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge). These 12 adjustments were based o n the values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the Silver plan level. The adjustments for each metallic tier are as follows: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.00 / 1.00 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 Cost Sharin g - The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT was used to calculate the cost sharing percentage for each plan. These cost sharing percentages were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge and applying the benefit richness utilization adjustments). The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calcula ted using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). Adjustment for Distribution and Administra tive Costs Fixed and variable costs as described in the Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section were included in this adjustment as follows: Fixed costs: Risk adjustment user fee, PCORI fee , and s ales & marketing expenses Variable costs (% of premium): Administrative expenses, profit & risk margin, and premium taxes. The percentages applied did not vary by plan. Appendix D shows the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 16) Calibration The Plan Adjusted Index Rates (which are based on the Single Risk Pool) were calibrated to apply the allowable rating factors in order to calculate Consumer Adjusted Premium Rates. The calibration by age and geography is described below. Age Curve Calibration The methodology employed in the calculation of the average age and t he calibration to the age curve complies with the standard age curve methodology and conforms with the rating rules specified in 45 CFR 147.102. The expected membership distribution by age band was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. A uniform distribution within each age band was also assumed. A weighted average age factor of 1.685 for the Single Risk Pool was also determined by applying th e membership distribution to the Federal age curve. This represents a rounded weighted average age of 49. Appendix C shows the development of the weighted average age factor. The Plan Index Rates were calibrated by dividing by 1.706 which represents the st andard age factor of the rounded weighted average age of 49 . This calibration factor does not vary by plan. 13 Geograph ic Factor Calibration A geographic factor calibration was not required since the weighted average of the geographic factors equals 1.0. The Geographic (rating area) factors were developed based upon the network characteristics for unit cost and utilization management in each of the established rating areas. Based upon the expected distribution of enrolment by area, the area factors reflect the Single Risk Pool results consistent with the URRT. Appendix D shows how the calibration adjustments were applied to the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 17) Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate Development The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final premium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual, family, or small employer group utilizing the rating and premium adjustments as articulated in the applicable Market Reform Rating Rules. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is developed by calibrating the P lan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve as described above, calibrating for geography if necessary, and applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. The following adjustments are allowable under this rule: Whether the plan coverage covers an individual or family (issuers must cover any eligible individual and/or eligible family that requests coverage per the guaranteed issue requirement of the ACA); this is further clarified in regulation that the premium for family coverage is deter mined by summing the premiums for each individual family member, provided at most three child dependents under age 21 are taken into account; this adjustment does not result in a separate rating factor Rating area Age - reflecting the applicable age curve Tobacco status The rating factors (shown in Appendix C) are applied at an individual level and added together to calculate the family rate , with the exception that no more than 3 covered children under the age of 21 are charged a rate . Adjustment for famil y size is in accordance with Federal rules. The example s in Appendix E show how the rating factors are applied to the calibrated Plan Adjusted Index Rate. 18) AV Metal Values The Federal AV calculator was used without any modifications to generate the Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the URRT . Please refer to Appendix F for screen shots showing the AV calculations for each plan. 14 19) AV Pricing Values The Silver Value plan was selected as the fixed reference plan and serves as the basis for the AV Pricing Values. Please refer to Appendix C for the AV Pricing Values for each plan which are also included in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT. The AV Pricing Value for each plan reflects the relative impact of the plan's cost -sharing amounts , expected impact o n enrollee utilization due to benefit richness (excluding impact of morbidity), expected additional cost of non -EHB, and administrative expenses (excluding health insurance exchange user fees). This is a new filing based on manual rate pro jections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the PwC Rating Model as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section was used to develop the benefit relativities for the AV Pricing Values. 20) Membership Projections Membership projections were based on market penetration assumptions provided by IUHP. These assumptions reflected the uninsured and individual market population s by county, income level, and other characteristics such as the presence of IUHP facilities an d delivery system within a given county . The expected membership distribution by age band and metallic tier was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. For the Silver plans, the portion of the projected enrollment that will be eligible for CSR subsidies at each subsidy level was based on the income level detail in the market penetration analysis provided by IUHP . Summaries of the projected membership by age, metallic tier, and CSR subsidy level are shown in Appendix B. 21) Terminated Products Not applicable. IUHP does not currently have Individual plans in the State of Indiana. 22) Plan Type All plans listed types in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT correctly describe IUHP's plans as \"HMO\" . 23) Warning Alerts There were no warnings generated on Worksheet 2 of in the URRT . 24) Company Financial Position Please see Appendix G for information regarding the capital and surplus position of IUHP. 15 25) Reliance In the preparation of this filing, I have relied upon data provided by Eric Neuville (Vice President Product Development and Innovation ), Connie Brown (CFO and COO), and IUHP management .

The determination of Tiers is made by us based upon clinical information, and where appropriate the cost of the Prescription Drug relative to other drugs in its therapeutic cl ass or used to treat the same or similar condition; the availability of over-the-c ounter alternatives; and where appropriate certain clinical economic factors. (a) Tier 1 Prescription Drugs have the lowest Coinsurance or Copayment. This Tier will contain low cost and preferred generic medications as well as selected preventive medications that are covered with no Coinsurance or Copayment if the Covered Person m eets criteria set fo rth by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force A and B recommendations. (b) Tier 2 Prescription Drugs will have a higher Coinsurance or Copayment than those in Tier 1. This Tier will contain non-preferred generic medications. (c) Tier 3 Prescription Drugs will have a higher Coinsurance or Copayment than those in Tier 2. This Tier will contain preferred brand name medications. (d) Tier 4 Prescription Drugs will have a higher Coinsurance or Copayment than those in Tier 3. This Tier will contain non-pr eferred brand name medications. (e) Tier 5 Prescription Drugs will have a higher/comparative Coinsurance or Copayment than those in Tier 4. This Tier will contain medications that are considered Specialty Drugs. We have established a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, consisting of health care professionals, including nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. The purpose of this committee is to assist in determining clinical appropriateness of drugs; determining the tier assignments of drugs; and advising on programs to help improve care. Such programs may include, but are not limited to, drug utilization programs, Precertification cr iteria, therapeutic conversion programs, cross-branded initiatives, and drug profil ing initiatives. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee also determines, where appropriate, the cost of a Prescription Drug relative to other drugs in its therapeutic class or used to treat the same or similar condition; the availa bility of over-the-counter alternatives; generic availability, the degree of utiliza tion of one drug over another in our patient program, and, where appropriate, certain clinical economic factors. We retain the right at our discretio n to determine coverage for dosage formulations in terms of covered dosage ad ministration methods (for example, by Covered Services / 50 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) mouth, injections, topical, or inhaled) and may cover one form of administration and exclusion or place other forms of administration in another tier. (11) From time to time we may initiate various programs to encourage the use of more cost-effective or clinically-effective Prescription Drugs including, but not limited to, generic, mail service, over the counter or preferred products. Such programs may involve reducing or wa iving Copayments or Coinsurance for certain Prescription Drugs or preferred products for a limited period of time. (12) The amount of Benefits paid is based upon whether you receive the Covered Services from a Participating Pharmacy , including a Participating Specialty Pharmacy, a Non-Participating Pharmacy, or the PBM's mail service program. It is also based upon which Tier we have classified the Prescription Drug or Specialty Drug. (13) How you obtain your Benefits depends upon whether you go to a Participating or a Non-Participating Pharmacy.

Health Care Services must be Medically Necessar y for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review your Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested. If there is a rela ted clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service or treatment meets our definition of Medical Necessity, or if it is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Contract. (c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are done for Health Care Services for which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. (2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertificati on or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. Your Primary Care Physici an and all other Participating Providers have received information from us on t he procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Pr ovider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination reviews (\"Requesting Provider\"). We wi ll work directly with your Requesting Provider regarding such review requests; however, your Designated Representative may act on your behalf throughout the review process. (3) We will utilize our clinical coverage guidelines, including internally developed guidelines, procedures, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to help us determine whether Health Care Services are Covered Services. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions Identified Deleted: the claim review procedures for benefit determinations adverse to youRequesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures / 66 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) as appropriate medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically.

Review Request Categories . (1) Urgent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that in the view of your attending Provider, or any physician with knowledge of your medical condition, could seriously jeopardize your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function, or would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the Urgent Care Claim. (2) Pre-Service - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. (3) Concurrent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during an ongoing course of treatment or admission. If we have approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or a number of treatments, any reduction or termination by us of such course of treatment before the end of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute a benefit determination adverse to you. We will notify you sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow you to appeal and obtain a determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. (4) Post-Service - A request for approval that is m ade after the service, treatment or admission has occurred. Post-Service review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, accura cy of documentation, or coding or adjudication of payment. C.

Coordination of Benefits / 76 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) ARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply througho ut this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits . In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Plans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the other Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other company will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaining expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions . (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of serv ices, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opini ons, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred pr ovider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a simi lar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Pl an, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awar ded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the par ent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) substantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employer organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means t he Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benef its will be determined before those of the other Plan without consider ing the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's b enefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a re sult of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment . When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a prov ision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: co verage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provid ed by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Se condary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules : The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) primary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare benefic iary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or reti ree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan . The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whe ther or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint cust ody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthda y, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court de cree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retire e or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) (4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whos e coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or stat e law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary. If the other Plan does not have this rule, a nd if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree longer is Primary. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid if it had been Primary. E. Payment of the Benefit When This Plan is Secondary. (1) When this Plan is Secondary, the benefits of this Plan will be reduced so that the total benefits payable under the other Plan and this Plan do not exceed your expenses for an item of service. The difference between the benefit payments that this Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provided shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the Covered Person and used by the Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the Claim Dete rmination Period. As each claim is submitted, this Plan will: (a) Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its Plan; (b) Determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Covered Person; and (c) Determine whether there are any unpa id Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. (2) If there is a benefit reserve, the Se condary Plan will use the Covered Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the Claim Determination Period. At the end of the Claim Determination Period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. (3) If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, Coordination of Benefits shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. F. Payments to others . We may repay to any other person, insurance company or organization the amount which it paid for your Covered Services and which we decide we should have paid. These payments are the same as benefits paid. G. Our Right to Recover Overpayment . In some cases, we may have made payment even though you had coverage under another Plan. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for you to refund to us the amount by which we should have reduced the Coordination of Benefits / 80 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) payment we made. We also have the right to recover the overpayment from the other health benefits plan if we have not already received payment from that other Plan.

Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures / 65 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 7. REQUESTING APPROVAL FOR COVERED SERVICES AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES . This Article 7 sets forth the procedures for req uesting approvals for Covered Services from us as well as general Grievance procedures. In processing claims, we review requests for Precertification, Predeterminati on, and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to determine whether provided or proposed to be provided Health Care Services are Covered Services. Health Care Services must be Medically Necessar y for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review this Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested. If there is a rela ted clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service or treatment meets our definition of Medical Necessity, or if it is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Contract. (c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are done for Health Care Services for which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. (2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertificati on or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. The Covered Person's Primary Care Physician and all other Participating Providers have received information from us on the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Provider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination revi ews (\"Requesting Provider\"). We will work directly with the Requesting Prov ider regarding such review requests; however, the Covered Person's Designated Representative may act on the Covered Person's behalf throughout the review process. (3) We will utilize our clinical coverage guidelines, including internally developed guidelines, procedures, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to help us determine whether Health Care Services are Covered Services. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions Identified Deleted: the claim review procedures for benefit determinations adverse to the Covered Person .Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures / 66 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) as appropriate medical practice.

To request this information, please contact us at [toll free number]. B. Review Request Categories . (1) Urgent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that in the view of the attending Provider, or any physician with knowledge of the Covered Person's medical condition, could seriously jeopardize the Covered Person's life or health or the Covered Person's ability to regain maximum function, or would subject the Covered Person to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the Urgent Care Claim. (2) Pre-Service - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. (3) Concurrent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during an ongoing course of treatment or admission. If we have approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or a number of treatments, any reduction or termination by us of such course of treatment before the end of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute a benefit determination adverse to the Covered Person. We will notify the Covered Person sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the Covered Person to appeal and obtain a determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. (4) Post-Service - A request for approval that is m ade after the service, treatment or admission has occurred. Post-Service review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, accura cy of documentation, or coding or adjudication of payment. C.

Coordination of Benefits / 76 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply througho ut this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits . In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Plans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the other Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other company will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaining expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions . (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of serv ices, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opini ons, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred pr ovider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a simi lar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Pl an, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awar ded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the par ent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) substantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employer organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means t he Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benef its will be determined before those of the other Plan without consider ing the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's b enefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a re sult of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment . When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a prov ision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: co verage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provid ed by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Se condary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules : The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) primary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare benefic iary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or reti ree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan . The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whe ther or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint cust ody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthda y, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court de cree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retire e or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) (4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whos e coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or stat e law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary.

Providers shall use their best efforts to re nder all Medically Necessary and appropriate Health Care Services in a manner compatible with the Covered Person's wishes, insofar as this can be done consistently with the Pr ovider's judgment as to the requirements of proper medical practice. If the Covered Person refuses to follow a recommended treatment or procedure, and the Provider believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, the Covered Person will be so advised. In such case, the Provider and we, as applicable, may determine that neither this Contract nor the Provider shall have any further responsibility to provide care in the case of the Provider, and to arrange care in the case of this Contract for the cond ition under treatment or any complications thereof.

The assumed allowed claims cost by age band and gender inherent in the manual rate data sources were applied to both the base and projection period enrollment distributions. This resulted in a demographic adjustment of 1.2429. The manual data was normalized to the assumed average projection period benefit plan design. The PwC Rating Model developed benefit relativities using cost sharing values and expected changes in utilization due to differences in cost sharing. This resulted in an adjustment of 0.9062. The total normalization factor is a product of the demographic and benefit plan adjustments (1.1263 = 1.2429 x 0.9062). Benefit Changes: Represents the expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) requirements. Please see Section 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development, page 6 of the Actuarial Memorandum. Since IUHP has a capitated agreement with a third-party partner to provide Pediatric Vision services, the capitation amount was removed from the 2% EHB adjustment noted in the Actuarial Memorandum as follows: 1.0192 = 1 + [(($310.60 x 2%) - $0.24) / $310.60] Morbidity Changes: This adjustment reflects differences in morbidity between the Individual and Group markets, health status of the currently uninsured expected to enroll in 2015, and the impact of transitional (\"grandmothered\") policies. Trend factor: Three years of 7.4% assumed annual trend (1.2388 = 1.0743) Medicaid Spend Down: Please see Section 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development, page 6 of the Actuarial Memorandum as well as our response to IDOI Objection Letter Item 2 below. Pent Up Demand: Please see Section 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development, pages 6-7 of the Actuarial Memorandum as well as our response to IDOI Objection Letter Item 3 below. Bad Debt: Please see Section 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development, page 7 of the Actuarial Memorandum. 2.Also on Page 6, you mention increasing the manual rates due to the Medicaid spend- down, are there any risk adjustment considerations? Also, 15% seems higher than I would expect, do you anticipate any adjustments here? As noted above, IUHP submitted a rate filing amendment via SERFF on June 4, 2014 which reflected revised assumptions regarding the Medicaid Spend Down population. The 15.0% adjustment has been revised to 5.2%. As indicated in IUHP's SERFF submission, 2015 premium rates have been revised from the May 9thrate filing as follows: Medicaid Spend Down - using the additional information provided by IDOI on 5/14/2014 (\"Masked data_dual_eligible.xls\") and 5/20/2014 (\"Non-Dual Spenddown - By County.xlsx\"), the assumption for this item has been revised based upon IU Health Plans' service area and expected market penetration. This assumption is described in Section 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development, on page 6 of the Actuarial Memorandum.Page 3 of 93.Please provide additional documentation for the 5% increase due to pent up demand. This typically seems to be in the 0 - 2% range. In addition to the basis outlined in Section 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development, pages 6-7 of the Actuarial Memorandum, the following factors were also considered by IUHP in developing their assumption: The Indiana Marketplace enrollment of approximately 132,000 (as of April 19, 2014 per HHS) was less than half of the uninsured population of 276,000 expected to enroll on the Individual exchange per the SOA study performed by Optum/Lewin. It was assumed that most of the enrollment growth in the Indiana Marketplace for 2015 would derive from the remaining uninsured population who did not enroll for coverage in 2014. Since IUHP did not offer products on the Individual exchange during 2014, the majority of their 2015 membership was assumed to come from the previously uninsured population rather than retained business. Therefore, the durational impact of the pent up demand would be less prevalent for IUHP than carriers with much higher percentages of retained business. IUHP's status as a renowned teaching facility was also assumed to have an impact on pent up demand. In light of the 0 - 2% range mentioned above as well as the resulting higher hospital and professional charges noted in IDOI Objection Letter Item 16 below, IUHP has revisited this assumption and would like permission to submit a rate filing amendment with a revised pent up demand assumption of 3.0%. IUHP's assumption is slightly higher due to the factors above. 4.From Page 7, can you provide documentation around how the paid to allowed average was determined? Since IUHP did not have any actual base period experience, the PwC Rating model was used to develop the Paid to Allowed ratios. This model uses actuarially sound principles to evaluate the impact of the cost sharing parameters for each benefit plan. As noted in Section 8) Paid to Allowed Ratio, on pages 7-8 of the Actuarial Memorandum, the pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Projection Period\" shown on Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT is developed by membership-weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership-weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan. The projected membership by plan is shown in Worksheet 2, Section II. The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). The Paid to Allowed ratios for each plan are shown below in Exhibit II.Page 4 of 95.How was the $51.43 reinsurance reimbursement determined? IUHP submitted a rate filing amendment via SERFF on June 4, 2014 wherein the reinsurance reimbursement assumption was revised from ($51.43) to ($46.95) as a result of the changes in the Medicaid Spend Down assumption and Sales & Marketing expenses. Allowed claims (Index rate) were reduced by 7.0% to account for the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from the Federal transitional reinsurance program. This estimate was developed using projected paid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the average expected 2015 claim levels for IUHP, and the federal program guidelines summarized in Section 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance, on page 8 of the Actuarial Memorandum. To estimate the impact of the allowed versus paid basis, the Federal attachment point and maximum coverage limit were increased by the average IUHP out-of-pocket limit. The expected reinsurance reimbursements can be calculated as follows: ($46.95) = (7%) x $670.70 Applying the 2015 transitional reinsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of ($43.28) PMPM. 6.Please split out the intermediate pieces in the 10.5% administrative expenses. The intermediate pieces of the 10.5% administrative expenses were provided by IUHP and are shown below in Exhibit III.Plan Name Paid to Allowed Ratio IU Health Plans Gold Value 0.794 IU Health Plans Silver HSA 0.690 IU Health Plans Silver Value 0.696 IU Health Plans Silver Enhanced 0.702 IU Health Plans Bronze HSA 0.581 IU Health Plans Bronze Value 0.596 IU Health Plans Bronze Enhanced 0.603 Total 0.679Exhibit II Indiana University Health Plans, Inc. Paid to Allowed Ratios by PlanPage 5 of 97.What are the pieces in the 3.7% sales and marketing expense? As noted above, IUHP submitted a rate filing amendment via SERFF on June 4, 2014 which reflected revised assumptions regarding their Sales & Marketing expenses. As indicated in IUHP's SERFF submission, 2015 premium rates have been revised from the May 9thrate filing as follows: Sales & Marketing Expenses - following submission of the original rate filing on May 9th, IUHP has obtained additional information regarding the prevailing broker commission rates in the Indiana Individual market. As such, the rates have been revised with reduced Sales & Marketing expenses, reflecting IUHP's expected commission rates as well as the assumed distribution of brokered vs. non-brokered membership. The revised assumption is provided in Section 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk, on pages 8-9 of the Actuarial Memorandum. The table below summarizes the development of the revised Sales & Marketing expenses. (a) % of IUHP Individual Business Sold On -Exchange 90% (b) % of IUHP Individual Business Sold Off -Exchange 10% (c) %ofOn-Exchange Business Subject to Commissions 25% (d) Broker Commission Rates in Indiana Individual Market $19.00 PMPM (e) Overall Commission Assumption (e) = (a) x (c) x (d) + (b) x (d)$6.18 PMPM 8.Please provide information as to why IUHP is not subject to the ACA issuer fee. This assumption was predicated on the information available at the time of our May 9thinitial rate filing. At that time, it was anticipated that IUHP's Medicare Advantage business would be migrated to a separate non-profit entity in 2014. Upon completion of that migration process, the remaining non-Medicare written premium for IUHP would be less than the $25 million threshold for both 2014 and 2015, and therefore the ACA issuer fee would not apply.Billing and Collections 0.7% BPO (Claims Processing) and IT 2.8% 0.9% PBM Customer Service 1.3% Medical Management 0.6% Provider Contracting 0.6% Facility (Overhead) and Other 0.6% Legal and Compliance 0.4% Other Operations 0.3% Underwriting and Actuarial 0.6% Total Administrative Expenses * differences due to rounding10.5% *Exhibit III Indiana University Health Plans, Inc. Administrative Services BreakdownPage 6 of 9However, subsequent to the May 9thrate filing, IUHP has indicated that the current Medicare Advantage business would not be migrated to the new non-profit entity during 2014. IUHP now anticipates that their book of business (including the new Individual On- and Off-Exchange HMO product) will be subject to the ACA issuer fee. As a result, IUHP would like to request permission to submit a rate filing amendment to include an assumption of 2.0% in the 2015 individual rates for the ACA issuer fee. 9.It appears you are starting with 2012 allowed costs to get the index rate. Please provide the intermediate steps used to get to the $734.69 Index Rate in the URRT. IUHP submitted a rate filing amendment via SERFF on June 4, 2014 wherein the Index Rate in the URRT was revised from $734.69 to $670.70 as a result of changes in the Medicaid Spend Down assumption and Sales & Marketing expenses. Please refer to Exhibit I included in our response to IDOI Objection Letter Item 1 above. 10.Why is the exchange user fee not 3.5%? As indicated in our response to IDOI Objection Letter Item 7 above, as well as in Section 10) Non- Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk - Taxes and Fees, on page 9 of the Actuarial Memorandum, IUHP's rate filing submission encompasses both On and Off Exchange Individual products. IUHP expects 90% of their 2015 Individual business will be sold through the Indiana Marketplace. Since the exchange user fee only applies to the portion of business sold On Exchange, the exchange user fee was calculated as follows: (a) Initial Exchange User Fee 3.50% (b) % of IUHP Individual Business Sold On Exchange 90% (c) Final Exchange User Fee (c) = (a) x (b)3.15% 11.Please step me through the adjustments in getting from the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the Market Adjusted Index Rate with documentation for the pieces. Please refer to Appendix D of the Actuarial Memorandum. If additional information is required, please let us know. 12.Where is the calculation for the tobacco surcharge done? The tobacco surcharge impact was developed as follows: a. Calculated the weighted average tobacco surcharge of 1.205 by applying the membership distribution by age (please see Appendix B) to age-based tobacco factors (please see Appendix C) b. Based on our assessment of the Individual market, we believe that 5-10% of enrollees will self- report as tobacco users. IUHP selected 7% as their assumption. c. The calculation of the final tobacco surcharge of 1.014 is shown below. (a) Surcharge for Tobacco Users 1.205 (b) Surcharge for Non -Tobacco Users 1.000 (c) % Tobacco Users 7% (d) % Non -Tobacco Users 93% (e) Final Tobacco Surcharge (e) = (a) x (c) + (b) x (d)1.014Page 7 of 913.Please provide a numeric impact that the Cost Sharing Adjustment has on the Plan Adjusted Index Rate. A sample calculation for the IU Health Plans Gold Value plan is shown below in Exhibit IV. The crosswalk shows the steps from the Index Rate to the Market Adjusted Index Rate, and then to the Plan Adjusted Index Rate. The value of ($120.70) found in column (b) of Appendix D was calculated as $31.24 - $9.12 - $142.82. The value of $98.43 found in column (c) of Appendix D was calculated as $6.42 + $92.01. Exhibit IV - Notes: Rounding: There may be small differences in the values presented due to rounding. Index Rate: Please see response to IDOI Objection Letter Item 1 above. Net Reinsurance Reimbursement: Please see response to IDOI Objection Letter Item 5 above. Exchange User Adjustment Fee: This fee is developed by applying the assumed Exchange User Fee (please see response to IDOI Objection Letter Item 10 above) to the Single Risk Pool Gross Premium Average Rate PMPM (shown on Worksheet 1 of the URRT), and is calculated as follows: (a) Exchange User Fee 3.15% (b) Single Risk Pool Gross Premium Average Rate PMPM$509.79 (c) Exchange User Fee PMPM (c) = (a) x (b)$16.06 Adjustment for Induced Utilization: As noted in Section 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rates - Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment, on pages 11-12 of the Actuarial Memorandum, the Market Adjusted Index Rate was adjusted for the plan-specific Induced Utilization factor.

Please see Section 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk, on pages 8-9 of the Actuarial Memorandum for details on the Fixed and Variable costs.Page 9 of 915.With regard to the various metal levels, I think that as you go from bronze to gold, the benefits must be equal to or greater than the lower level metal level. It appears that your gold has lesser drug benefits than the silver plan. The gradation referenced in your question is a requirement when comparing Silver CSR plans to Silver Standard plans. Per HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2015 Final Rule - 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7 156.420(e): Decreasing cost sharing and out-of-pocket spending in higher AV silver plan variations. The cost sharing or out-of-pocket spending required of enrollees under any silver plan variation of a standard silver plan for a benefit from a provider (including a provider outside the plan's network) may not exceed the corresponding cost sharing or out-of-pocket spending required in the standard silver plan or any other silver plan variation thereof with a lower AV. However, it is our understanding that this gradation is a preference but not a requirement when comparing Gold and Silver Standard plans. This is validated by the Plan & Benefits Template validation process. 16.Please review the Hospital and Professional charges used in the URRT as they are much higher than the average. As noted above, IUHP submitted a rate filing amendment via SERFF on June 4, 2014 which reflected revised assumptions regarding the Medicaid Spend Down population. The Hospital and Professional charges in the revised URRT have been reduced from the initial May 9thrate filing due to the revision in this particular assumption. We believe that the mix of services for IUHP may also differ from other carriers due to IUHP's status as a renowned teaching facility, which could lead to higher Hospital and Professional charges. 13164.1-Indiv-App-Adult/Child (01/2015) Page 1 of 8 Individual/Family/Child-Only Co ntract Enrollment Application IMPORTANT: If you are a new applicant, a separate premium payment is required to be submitted with each application.

This Article 7 sets forth the procedures for req uesting approvals for Covered Services from us as well as general Grievance procedures. In processing claims, we review requests for Precertification, Predeterminati on, and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to determine whether provided or proposed to be provided Health Care Services are Covered Services. Health Care Services must be Medically Necessar y for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests. (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review [your] [this] Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service or treatment meets our definition of Medical Necessity, or if it is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Contract. (c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are done for Health Care Services for which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. (2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertificati on or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. [ Your ] [The Covered Person's] Primary Care Physician and all other Participating Providers have received information from us on the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Provider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination revi ews (\"Requesting Provider\").

(2) Pre-Service - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. (3) Concurrent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during an ongoing course of treatment or admission. If we have approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or a number of treatments, any reduction or termination by us of such course of treatment before the end of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute a benefit determination adverse to [you][the Covered Person].

Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) Deleted: -AdultARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply througho ut this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits. In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Plans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the other Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other company will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaining expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions. (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of serv ices, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opini ons, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred pr ovider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a simi lar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Pl an, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awar ded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the par ent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) Deleted: -Adultsubstantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employer organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means t he Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benef its will be determined before those of the other Plan without consider ing the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's b enefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a re sult of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment. When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a prov ision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: co verage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provid ed by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Se condary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules. The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) Deleted: -Adultprimary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare benefic iary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or reti ree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan . The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whe ther or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint cust ody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthda y, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court de cree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retire e or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 80 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) Deleted: -Adult(4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whos e coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or stat e law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary. If the other Plan does not have this rule, a nd if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree longer is Primary. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid if it had been Primary. E. Payment of the Benefit When This Plan is Secondary. (1) When this Plan is Secondary, the benefits of this Plan will be reduced so that the total benefits payable under the other Plan and this Plan do not exceed your expenses for an item of service. The difference between the benefit payments that this Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provided shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the Covered Person and used by the Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the Claim Dete rmination Period. As each claim is submitted, this Plan will: (a) Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its Plan; (b) Determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Covered Person; and (c) Determine whether there are any unpa id Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. (2) If there is a benefit reserve, the Se condary Plan will use the Covered Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the Claim Determination Period. At the end of the Claim Determination Period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. (3) If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, Coordination of Benefits shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. F. Payments to Others. We may repay to any other person, insurance company or organization the amount which it paid for your Covered Services and which we decide we should have paid. These payments are the same as benefits paid. G. Our Right to Recover Overpayment. In some cases, we may have made payment even though you had coverage under another Plan. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for you to refund to us the amount by which we should have reduced the Coordination of Benefits / 81 13164.1-Indiv-Policy (01/2015) Deleted: -Adultpayment we made. We also have the right to recover the overpayment from the other health benefits plan if we have not already received payment from that other Plan.

At this point, we expect less than 20% of the individual market to offer transitional policies. As we discussed, our response to Item 1 of the IDOI Objection Letter dated 5/27/2014 noted that the morbidity adjustment of 6.1% reflects differences in morbidity between the Individual and Group markets (since manual rates were based on Commercial experience), health status of the currently uninsured expected to enroll in 2015, and the impact of transitional (\"grandmothered\") policies. We estimate that the impact relating to transitional policies is less than 1 %. 2.In Exhibit I Notes, you show that the 1.0192 = 1 + [((310.60 x 2%)-0.24)/310.60], I may have missed it, but where does the 310.60 come from? As we discussed, the $310.60 may be found in row 3 of Exhibit I contained in our response to Item 1 of the IDOI Objection Letter dated 5/27/2014. 3.As a part of the plan adjusted index rate, the age calibration should be used as calculated and not rounded to the near age. Please revise the 1.706 with 1.685. As we discussed, the IDOI has given verbal approval to submit a rate filing amendment with a revised pent up demand assumption of 3.0% and a revised assumption of 2.0% for the ACA issuer fee. We will include this change as well once all remaining issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of the IDOI. 4.The percentage of tobacco users seems low compared to the population percentage of tobacco users in the state. As we discussed, we believe that 5-10% of enrollees will self-report as tobacco users given the minimal penalties for not reporting tobacco use. IUHP selected 7% as their assumption.Two files are attached IN SERFF: this is the submission document and have attached Cat & Class info. If column G is BLANK, then that RxCUI does not count toward any benchmark (it is zero category or class designation). Those RxCUIs were not counted in the tier counts. This file was used to created the other file. HIX IN Count by Tiers: this is the number of RxCUIs by tier for each category and class. The RXCUIs with blank Cat & Class info are found listed as OTHER on line 164 of this file with unique RXCUIs by tier broken out. Remember these 'OTHER' RXCUIs , since they do not have a Cat & Class do not count toward benchmark. On the second tab labeled OTHER RXCUIs you will see each unique RXCUI by each tier as reference only. Keep in mind: An RxCUI can be classified in more than one Cat and Class. Therefore, the tier count will have a larger RxCUI count than the actual number of counted RxCUIs on the submission file Not counted RxCUIs are not included in the totals on lines 162. There are 1506 UNIQUE RxCUIs that do not have a cat/class and are summarized by tier in row 164 as noted above.

Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures/ 65 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 7. REQUESTING APPROVAL FO R COVERED SERVICES AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES. This Article 7 sets forth the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services from us as well as general Grievance procedures. In processing claims, we review requests for Precertification, Predetermination, and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to determine whether provided or proposed to be provided Health Care Services are Covered Services. Health Care Services must be Medically Necess ary for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review this Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service or treatment meets our definition of Medical Necessity, or if it is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Contract. (c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are done for Health Care Services for which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. (2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertification or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. The Covered Person's Primary Care Physician and all other Participating Providers have received info rmation from us on the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Provider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination reviews (\"Requesting Provider\"). We will work directly with the Requesting Provider regarding such review requests; however, the Covered Person's Designated Representative may act on the Covered Person's behalf throughout the review process. (3) We will utilize our clinical coverage guidelines, including internally developed guidelines, procedures, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to help us determine whether Health Care Services are Covered Services. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions Identified Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures/ 66 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) as appropriate medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically.

To request this information, please contact us at [toll free number]. B. Review Request Categories . (1) Urgent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that in the view of the attending Provider, or any physician with knowledge of the Covered Person's medical condition, could seriously jeopardize the Covered Person's life or health or the Covered Person's ability to regain maximum function, or would subject the Covered Person to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the Urgent Care Claim. (2) Pre-Service - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. (3) Concurrent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during an ongoing course of treatment or admission. If we have approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or a number of treatments, any reduction or termination by us of such course of treatment before the end of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute a benefit determination adverse to the Covered Person. We will notify the Covered Person sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the Covered Person to appeal and obtain a determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. (4) Post-Service - A request for approval that is made after the service, treatment or admission has occurred. Post-Service review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, accuracy of documentation, or coding or adjudication of payment. C.

Coordination of Benefits / 76 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply throughout this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits . In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Pl ans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the ot her Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other com pany will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaini ng expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions . (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessa ry, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a similar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of servic es through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) substantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employ er organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without considering the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment . When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Secondary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules : The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) primary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan. The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whether or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retiree or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) (4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree longer is Primary. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid if it had been Primary. E. Payment of the Benefit When This Plan is Secondary. (1) When this Plan is Secondary, the benefits of this Plan will be reduced so that the total benefits payable under the other Plan and this Plan do not exceed your expenses for an item of service. The difference between the benefit payments that this Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provi ded shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the Covered Person and used by the Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the Claim Determination Period. As each claim is submitted, this Plan will: (a) Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its Plan; (b) Determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Covered Person; and (c) Determine whether there are any unpaid Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. (2) If there is a benefit reserve, the Secondary Plan will use the Covered Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the Claim Determination Period. At the end of the Claim Determination Period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. (3) If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of serv ice by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, Coordination of Benefits shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. F. Payments to others . We may repay to any other person, insurance company or organization the amount which it paid for your Covered Services and which we decide we should have paid. These payments are the same as benefits paid. G. Our Right to Recover Overpayment . In some cases, we may have made payment even though you had coverage under another Plan. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for you to refund to us the amount by which we should have reduced the Coordination of Benefits / 80 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) payment we made. We also have the right to recover the overpayment from the other health benefits plan if we have not already re ceived payment from that other Plan. You agree to sign any document that we deem necessary to help us recover any overpayment. Termination of Coverage / 81 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE A.

Each Covered Person enrolls in this Contract with the understanding that the Provider is responsible for determining the treatment appropriate for their care. The Covered Person may, for personal reasons, refuse to accept procedures or treatment by Providers. Providers may regard such refusal to accept their recommendations as incompatible with continuance of the physician-patient relationship and as obstructi ng the provision of proper medical care.

Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures/ 65 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) ARTICLE 7. REQUESTING APPROVAL FO R COVERED SERVICES AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES. This Article 7 sets forth the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services from us as well as general Grievance procedures.. In processing claims, we review requests for Precertification, Predetermination, and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to determine whether provided or proposed to be provided Health Care Services are Covered Services. Health Care Services must be Medically Necess ary for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review your Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service or treatment meets our definition of Medical Necessity, or if it is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Contract. (c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are done for Health Care Services for which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. (2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertification or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. Your Primary Care Physician and all other Participating Providers have received information from us on the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Pr ovider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination reviews (\"Requesting Provider\"). We will work directly with your Requesting Provider regarding such review requests; however, your Designated Representative may act on your behalf throughout the review process. (3) We will utilize our clinical coverage guidelines, including internally developed guidelines, procedures, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to help us determine whether Health Care Services are Covered Services. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions Identified Requesting Approval for Covered Services and Grievance Procedures/ 66 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) as appropriate medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically. (4) You are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to any documents relevant to your request. To request this information, please contact us at [toll free number]. B. Review Request Categories . (1) Urgent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that in the view of your attending Provider, or any ph ysician with knowledge of your medical condition, could seriously jeopardize your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function, or would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the Urgent Care Claim. (2) Pre-Service - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. (3) Concurrent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during an ongoing course of treatment or admission. If we have approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or a number of treatments, any reduction or termination by us of such course of treatment before the end of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute a benefit determination adverse to you. We will notify you sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow you to appeal and obtain a determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. (4) Post-Service - A request for approval that is made after the service, treatment or admission has occurred. Post-Service review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, accuracy of documentation, or coding or adjudication of payment. C.

Coordination of Benefits / 76 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) ARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply throughout this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits . In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Pl ans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the ot her Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other com pany will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaini ng expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions . (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessa ry, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a similar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of servic es through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) substantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employ er organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without considering the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment . When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Secondary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules : The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) primary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan. The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whether or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retiree or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) (4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree longer is Primary. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid if it had been Primary. E. Payment of the Benefit When This Plan is Secondary. (1) When this Plan is Secondary, the benefits of this Plan will be reduced so that the total benefits payable under the other Plan and this Plan do not exceed your expenses for an item of service. The difference between the benefit payments that this Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provi ded shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the Covered Person and used by the Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the Claim Determination Period. As each claim is submitted, this Plan will: (a) Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its Plan; (b) Determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Covered Person; and (c) Determine whether there are any unpaid Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. (2) If there is a benefit reserve, the Secondary Plan will use the Covered Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the Claim Determination Period. At the end of the Claim Determination Period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. (3) If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of serv ice by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, Coordination of Benefits shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. F. Payments to others . We may repay to any other person, insurance company or organization the amount which it paid for your Covered Services and which we decide we should have paid. These payments are the same as benefits paid. G. Our Right to Recover Overpayment . In some cases, we may have made payment even though you had coverage under another Plan. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for you to refund to us the amount by which we should have reduced the Coordination of Benefits / 80 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) payment we made. We also have the right to recover the overpayment from the other health benefits plan if we have not already re ceived payment from that other Plan. You agree to sign any document that we deem necessary to help us recover any overpayment. Grievance Procedures / 81 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE A.

No such statement shall void or reduce coverage under this Contract or be used in defense of a legal action unless it is contained in the application. B. No Assignment . The benefits provided under this C ontract are for your and your enrolled Dependents' personal benefit. You may not assign any of your rights to coverage. Any attempt by you to assign this Contract to any third party is void. Provided, however, that subject to our right to disapprove, you may assign your right to reimbursement for Covered Services to the Provider who provided such Covered Services. C. Notice .

The relationships between us and Participating Providers are solely contractual relationships between a payor and independent contractors. Non-Participating Providers have no contractual relationship with us, nor are they our independent contractors. Providers are not our agents or employees. We and our employees are not employees or agents of Providers. The relationship between a Provider and any Covered Person is that of Provider and patient. The Provider is solely responsible for the services provided to any Covered Person. E. Disagreement with Recommended Treatment . Each Covered Person enrolls in this Contract with the understanding that the Provider is responsible for determining the treatment appropriate for their care. You may, for personal reasons, refuse to accept procedures or treatment by Providers. Providers may regard such refusal to accept their recommendations as incompatible with continuance of the physician-patient relationship and as obstructing the provision of proper medical care. Providers shall use their best efforts to render all Medically Necessary and appropriate Health Care Services in a manner compatible with your wishes, insofar as this can be done consistently with the Provider's judgment as to the requirements of proper medical practice. If you refuse to follow a recommended treatment or procedure, and the Provider believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, you will be so advised. In such case, the Provider and we, as applicable, may determine that neither this Contract nor the Provider shall have any further responsibility to provide care in the case of the Provider, and to arrange care in the case of this Contract for the condition under treatment or any complications thereof. General Provisions / 86 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) F. Your Medical Records . As a condition precedent to the approval of claims hereunder, each Covered Person authorizes and directs any Provider that furnishes benefits hereunder to make available to us information relating to all Health Care Services, copies thereof and other records as needed by us for purposes of administering this Contract.

You must (a) contact us to obtain a list of Participating Providers who are authorized to render a second opinion, and (b) arrange a consultation with the second Provider. The second Provider will not be affiliated with the first Provider. You must obtain the second opinion within thirty-one (31) days of the first opinion or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Second opinions we have arranged as described above are provided at no cost to you. A second opinion may also be obtained at the request of a Covered Person, subject to separate benefit restrictions and/or Copay ments or Coinsurance described in this Contract. H.

Coverage under this Contract may be terminated by us if the Covered Person allows another person to wrongfully use the Identification Cards. K. Right to Develop Guidelines and Administrative Rules . We may develop or adopt standards that describe in more detail when we will make or will not make payments under this Contract. An example of the use of the standards is to determine whether care was Medically Necessary. These standards will not be contrary to the descriptions in this Contract. If you have a question about the standards that apply to a particular benefit, you may contact us and we will explain the standards or send you a copy of the standards. We may also develop administrative rules pertaining to enrollment and other administrative matters. We shall have all the powers necessary or appropriate to enable us to carry out our duties in connection with the administration of this Contract. General Provisions / 87 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) L. Non-Discrimination .

If we pay for Health Care Services that, according to the terms of the Contract, should not have been paid, we reserve the right to recover such amounts from whom they have been paid (including the Covered Person or Provider) or any other appropriate party. Q. Contract is not a Medicare supplement policy . Any Covered Services that are covered under both this Contract and Medicare will be paid according to Medicare secondary payor legislation, regulations , and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines. As a Medicare secondary payor, benefits under this Contract shall be determined after those of Medicare. For the purposes of the calculation of benefits, if the Covered Person has not enrolled in Medicare, we will calculate benefits as if they had enrolled. The benefits under this Contract for Covered Persons age 65 and older or Covered Persons otherwise eligible for Medicare do not duplicate any benefit for which Covered Persons are entitled under Medicare, except when federal law requires us to be Primary.

This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 5 4) Benefit Categories The methodology used to determine benefit categories in Worksheet 1, Section II of the Unified Rate Review Template is as follows: Inpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for medical, surgical, maternity, mental health and substance abuse, skilled nursing, and other se rvices provided in an inpatient facility setting and billed by the facility. Outpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for surgery, emergency room, lab, radiology, therapy, observation, and other services provided in an outpatient facil ity setting and billed by the facility. Professional: Includes non -capitated primary care, specialist, therapy, the professional component of laboratory and radiology, and other professional services, other than hospital based professionals whose payments are included in facility fees. Other Medical: Includes non -capitated ambulance, home health care, DME, prosthetics, supplies, and other services. Capitation: Includes capitated services for pediatric vision benefits . Prescription Drug: Includes drugs dispe nsed by a pharmacy and rebates received from drug manufacturers. 5) Projection Factors Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development The PwC Rating Model was used as the basis to develop the manual rates. Our model was developed using two primary sources: Commercial Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases for U.S. members and providers. The database contains full enrollment and claims information with standard medical coding which allows for cost and utilization information by service category (inpatient, outpatient hospital, hospice, home health, professional, prescripti on drugs, etc.). The database consists of the experience from 53 million Commercial eligible participants. The data can be extracted down to the member's state and MSA level. For the Indiana Commercial market, there were approximately 1.5 million expos ed life years' worth of data crossing all ages, genders and employment statuses (active, COBRA, disabled and retired). Nationwide, the databases have over 100 unique data contributors so it is not skewed to any one payer. OptumInsight (Optum) Comprehensi ve Pricing Model \u00ae provides benchmark data and pricing capabilities for Commercial health plans. It factors in health plan features such as deductibles, copays, out -of-pocket maximums, covered services, etc. The model uses normative data and benefit details to arrive at an allowed cost per member per month . The 6 normative benchmarking utilization metrics within the model are developed from Optum's database of Commercial (under 65) health plan experience of approximately 20 million life years . The model experi ence was adjusted to reflect the Indiana marketplace. Since both the Truven and Optum data sources represent fully -completed calendar year 2012 claims, allowed costs were trended to the midpoint of calendar year 2015 using an annual trend rate of 7.4%. The allowed costs component of the manual rates was increased by 2% to account for expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential Health Benefits ( EHB) requirements . The following is not an all inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expec ted to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on cl aims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the re sulting costs of pediatric coverage. In our May 9, 2014 filing, we noted that the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) was expected to provide additional information pertaining to the Medicaid Spend -Down population. IUHP also reserved the right to revise their initial filing to reflect any additional data. Subsequent to IUHP's May 9, 2014 filing, the IDOI released additional SFY 2013 information pertaining to th e Medicaid Spend -Down population which included the follo wing: Summary of unique individuals , Medicaid allowed, Medicaid paid, and billed charges by age band, gender, and FPL % category Summary of the Medicaid allowed, Medicaid paid, and Billed charges for each unique individual Summary of unique individuals, Medicaid allowed, Medicaid paid, and billed charges by county The manual rates were increased by 5.2% to reflect the entrance of approximately 7,000 Medicaid Spend -Down beneficiaries into the Indiana Health Insurance Exchange. This adjustment was based on the assumption that IUHP's penetration of the Medicaid Spend -Down population would be similar to their assumed penetration of the general population for the counties included in IUHP's proposed service area . There will also be new enrollees in the indivi dual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. Pent up demand has been shown to increase costs in the first year of enrollment for those 7 previously uninsured. Based on analysis of programs serving a similar population, it appears that the claims are higher in the first six to 12 months that an individual is newly insured. After this initial period, the claims experience tends to revert to the average level for the market. The total effect is uncertain and may be offset by some new enrollees having reduced utilization as they may not fully understand new or increased coverage. Therefore, we have included an adjustment within our manual rate development for pent up demand of 5 .0%. The following adjustments were made to calibrate the pricing model to the expected population: Rating region Expected demographics Expected morbidity Contractual Agreements with h ealthcare providers Expected utilization management savings Benefit plan designs Some benefits will be reimbursed under a capitation arrangement. The provider reimbursement adjustment to the pricing model was developed to account for the cost of capitated services. The manual rates were also adjusted upward by a factor of 1.00 5 to account for the likelihood that some enrollees may not pay their premiums due during the first month of the 90 -day grace period. This was calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment on one -twelfth of the annual premium due for 80% of the Individual population (those eligible for Advance Payments of a Premium Tax Credit). The amount of premium at risk is only on the portion that IUHP does not receive via direct subsidy, estimated to be 50% (0.15 x 1/12 x 0.80 x 0.50 = 0.005). The 15% represents our assumption regarding the small portion of enrollees that we believe will knowingly take advantage of the grace period provision. The 80% represents the portion of enrollees in the 2015 Individual marketplace that we assume will be eligible for premium subsidies based on income level. On May 1, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that as of April 19, 2014, 89% of those enrolled in the Indiana exchange were eligible for federal assistance. Our assumption is that this percentage will decrease during 2015. 7) Credibility of Experience IUHP has not previously operated in the individual market. As a result the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection factors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 8) Paid to Allowed Ratio The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Proje ction Period \" shown on Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT is developed by membership -weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership -weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan . The projected membership by plan is sho wn in Worksheet 2, Section II. 8 The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsura nce Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM The Risk Adjustment program transfers funds from lower risk plans to higher risk plans in the Non - Grandfathered Individual and Small Group market. At this time, IUHP is assuming the risk for the plans in this filing are no better or worse than other plans in the market, resulting in no estimated risk transfer value . Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed for 2015. Projected ACA Reinsurance Recoveries Net of Reinsurance Premium (Individual Market and Combined Markets Only) The Federal transitional reinsurance program is a temporary risk mitigation program expected to reduce costs for insurance issuers. The 201 5 reinsurance program has an att achment point of $70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. The Department of Health and Human Services will reimburse insurance issuers 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. Allowed claims were reduce d by 7.0% to account for the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from this temporary program. This estimate was de veloped using projected paid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the expected average claim levels for the 2015 Individual market, and the federal program guidelines summarized above. The expected reinsurance reimbursements are $46.95 PMPM . Applying the 2015 transitional reinsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of $4 3.28 PMPM. Projected Net Cost of Private Reinsurance The projected net cost of private reinsurance for 2015 is $0.00 PMPM since IUHP does not intend to purchase private reinsurance. 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk Administrative Expense Load IUHP developed their expected administrative expenses based on : a) current administrative expenses for their Medicare line of business adjusting for any expected differences for their Commercial products , and b) a review of 2014 Rate Filings for Individual Exchange products . A summary of IUHP's assumptions is as follows: Administrative expenses (excluding Sales and Marketing expenses ): 10.50% of premium Sales and Marketing expenses (including c ommissions ): $6.18 PMPM These administrative expenses are allocated proportionally by plan. 9 Quality Improvement Expenses At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives . Therefore, no explicit Quality Improvement expenses were assum ed. Profit & Risk Margin The proposed rates reflect a profit & risk margin of 3.0% of premium . This load was applied to all products and plans. Taxes and Fees A summary of the assumed taxes and fees are summarized below: PMPM Basis Transitional reinsurance charge: $3.67 PMPM ($44.00 PCORI fee: $0.17 PMPM ($2.00 per member Percentage of Premium Basis Health insurance exchange fee: 3.15% of premium reflecting IUHP's assumption tha t 90% of their expected 2015 business will be sold through the exchange ACA issuer fee: IUHP will not be subject to this fee for 2015 Premium tax: 1.30% of premium 11) Projected Loss Ratio The overall projected medical loss ratio for 2015 is 85.2%. Th is calculation exclude s regulatory fees and taxes. At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. As a result, we have not included an adjustm ent in the MLR calculation for these expenses. It is IUHP's intent to identify their Quality Improvement expenses for purposes of submitting their MLR -related filings and calculating related rebates , if any. The following table shows the calculation. 10 a) Incurred Claims Net of Cost Sharing $455.1 4 b) Transitional Reinsurance Reimbursement ($46.95 ) c) Reinsurance Charge $3.67 d) Quality Improvement Expenses $0.00 e) Worksheet 1 Projected Incurred Claims ( a+b+c +d) $411.86 f) Administrative Expenses $59.70 g) Profit & Risk Margin $15.29 h) Regulatory Taxes and Fees (excluding reinsurance charge) $22.93 i) Gross Premium ( e+f+g+h) $509.79 j) Medical Loss Ratio ( e/(i-c-h)) 85.2% 12) Single Risk Pool IUHP has not previously operated in the Individual market and thus does not have any claims experience to develop its own Single Risk Pool . This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 13) Index Rate This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the Index Rate for the Experience Period has been left blank . The Index Rate of $670.70 for the 2015 Projection Period represents the overall projected allowed costs PMPM for providing Essential Health Benefits for the Single Risk Pool . Since this is a new product , the index rate was developed based on a manual rate as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section. The Index Rate will remain unchanged until a renewal filing effective January 1, 201 6. 14) Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market -wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market -wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowable under these rules: Federal reinsurance program adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Risk adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Exchange user fe e adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Similar to the Index Rate, the Market Adjusted Index Rate reflects the average demographic 11 characteristics of the Single R isk Pool. In other words, the Market Adjusted Index Rate is not calibrated. The development of t he Federal reinsurance program and risk adjustments was described above in the Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance section. The development of the Exchange user fee adjustment was described above in the Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section. Index R ate $670.70 Reinsurance Reimbursements (7.0% of Allowed Claims - Index Rate) ($46.95 ) Reinsurance Premiums $ 3.67 Risk Adjustment $ 0.00 Exchange user fee (3.15% of average premium for Single Risk Pool) $ 16.06 Market Adjusted Index Rate $643.47 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rate s The Plan Adjusted Index Rates are included in Worksheet 2, Section IV of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template in 2015. These Plan Adjusted Index Rates have been adjusted to remove the portion of the allowed cost that is expected to be recouped through the tobacco surcharge. The average tobacco surcharge for the Single Risk Pool is approximately 1. 4%. The Plan Adjusted Index Rates reflect the average dem ographic characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Plan Adjusted Index Rate s are not calibrated. The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the issuer Market Adjusted Index Rate adjusted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). The following adjustments are allowable under these rules: Actuarial value and cost sharing adjustment (plan adjustment) Provider network, delivery system and utilization management adjustment (pl an adjustment) Adjustment for benefits in addition to the EHBs (plan adjustment) Impact of specific eligibility categories for the catastrophic plan (plan adjustment ) Adjustment for distribution and administrative costs (plan adjustment) Only the a ctuarial value and cost sharing & distribution and administrative costs adjustments were applicable to IUHP. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment This adjustment includes three components: Removal of tobacco surcharge - the average tobacco surcharge factor was applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool Benefit richness utilization adjustments - The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. Benefit richness utilization adjustments were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge). These 12 adjustments were based o n the values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the Silver plan level. The adjustments for each metallic tier are as follows: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.00 / 1.00 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 Cost Sharin g - The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT was used to calculate the cost sharing percentage for each plan. These cost sharing percentages were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge and applying the benefit richness utilization adjustments). The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calcula ted using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). Adjustment for Distribution and Administra tive Costs Fixed and variable costs as described in the Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section were included in this adjustment as follows: Fixed costs: Risk adjustment user fee, PCORI fee , and s ales & marketing expenses Variable costs (% of premium): Administrative expenses, profit & risk margin, and premium taxes. The percentages applied did not vary by plan. Appendix D shows the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 16) Calibration The Plan Adjusted Index Rates (which are based on the Single Risk Pool) were calibrated to apply the allowable rating factors in order to calculate Consumer Adjusted Premium Rates. The calibration by age and geography is described below. Age Curve Calibration The methodology employed in the calculation of the average age and t he calibration to the age curve complies with the standard age curve methodology and conforms with the rating rules specified in 45 CFR 147.102. The expected membership distribution by age band was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. A uniform distribution within each age band was also assumed. A weighted average age factor of 1.685 for the Single Risk Pool was also determined by applying th e membership distribution to the Federal age curve. This represents a rounded weighted average age of 49. Appendix C shows the development of the weighted average age factor. The Plan Index Rates were calibrated by dividing by 1.706 which represents the st andard age factor of the rounded weighted average age of 49 . This calibration factor does not vary by plan. 13 Geograph ic Factor Calibration A geographic factor calibration was not required since the weighted average of the geographic factors equals 1.0. The Geographic (rating area) factors were developed based upon the network characteristics for unit cost and utilization management in each of the established rating areas. Based upon the expected distribution of enrolment by area, the area factors reflect the Single Risk Pool results consistent with the URRT. Appendix D shows how the calibration adjustments were applied to the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 17) Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate Development The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final premium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual, family, or small employer group utilizing the rating and premium adjustments as articulated in the applicable Market Reform Rating Rules. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is developed by calibrating the P lan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve as described above, calibrating for geography if necessary, and applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. The following adjustments are allowable under this rule: Whether the plan coverage covers an individual or family (issuers must cover any eligible individual and/or eligible family that requests coverage per the guaranteed issue requirement of the ACA); this is further clarified in regulation that the premium for family coverage is deter mined by summing the premiums for each individual family member, provided at most three child dependents under age 21 are taken into account; this adjustment does not result in a separate rating factor Rating area Age - reflecting the applicable age curve Tobacco status The rating factors (shown in Appendix C) are applied at an individual level and added together to calculate the family rate , with the exception that no more than 3 covered children under the age of 21 are charged a rate . Adjustment for famil y size is in accordance with Federal rules. The example s in Appendix E show how the rating factors are applied to the calibrated Plan Adjusted Index Rate. 18) AV Metal Values The Federal AV calculator was used without any modifications to generate the Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the URRT . Please refer to Appendix F for screen shots showing the AV calculations for each plan. 14 19) AV Pricing Values The Silver Value plan was selected as the fixed reference plan and serves as the basis for the AV Pricing Values. Please refer to Appendix C for the AV Pricing Values for each plan which are also included in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT. The AV Pricing Value for each plan reflects the relative impact of the plan's cost -sharing amounts , expected impact o n enrollee utilization due to benefit richness (excluding impact of morbidity), expected additional cost of non -EHB, and administrative expenses (excluding health insurance exchange user fees). This is a new filing based on manual rate pro jections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the PwC Rating Model as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section was used to develop the benefit relativities for the AV Pricing Values. 20) Membership Projections Membership projections were based on market penetration assumptions provided by IUHP. These assumptions reflected the uninsured and individual market population s by county, income level, and other characteristics such as the presence of IUHP facilities an d delivery system within a given county . The expected membership distribution by age band and metallic tier was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. For the Silver plans, the portion of the projected enrollment that will be eligible for CSR subsidies at each subsidy level was based on the income level detail in the market penetration analysis provided by IUHP . Summaries of the projected membership by age, metallic tier, and CSR subsidy level are shown in Appendix B. 21) Terminated Products Not applicable. IUHP does not currently have Individual plans in the State of Indiana. 22) Plan Type All plans listed types in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT correctly describe IUHP's plans as \"HMO\" . 23) Warning Alerts There were no warnings generated on Worksheet 2 of in the URRT . 24) Company Financial Position Please see Appendix G for information regarding the capital and surplus position of IUHP. 15 25) Reliance In the preparation of this filing, I have relied upon data provided by Eric Neuville (Vice President Product Development and Innovation ), Connie Brown (CFO and COO), and IUHP management . I did not audit this data but did review it for reasonableness. This information includes but is not limited to the following items: Administrative expense projections (including commissions) Provider reimbursement levels (including capitation arrangements) Projected enrollment Projected pharmacy discounts, unit costs and rebates Financial statement information 26) Actuarial Certification I, Robert Macagnano , FSA, MAAA, am affiliated with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).

The purpose of this rate filing is to establish new product rates that are reasonable relative to the benefits provided and to demonstrate compliance with State of Indiana statutes and provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This memorandum document s the development of the Individual rates for Indiana University Health Plans, Inc. (IUH P). The rates will be in -force for effective dates on or after January 1, 201 5. These rates will apply to plans offered both On -Exchange and Off - Exchange. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. This information is intended for use by t he State of Indiana Department of Insurance, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and their subcontractors to assist in the review of IUHP 's Individual rate filing. However, we recognize that this certification may become a public document. PwC makes no representations or warranties regarding the contents of this memorandum to third parties. Likewise, third parties are instructed that they are to place no reliance upon this actuarial memorandum prepared for IUHP by PwC that would result in the creation of any duty or liability under any theory of law by PwC or its employees to third parties. These results are actuarial projections. Actual experience is likely to differ for a number of reasons, including population chang es, claims experience, and random deviations from assumptions. Company Identifying Information Company Legal Name: Indiana University Health Plan s, Inc . State: The State of Indiana has regulatory authority over these policies HIOS Issuer ID: 33380 Market: Individual Effective Date: January 1, 201 5 Company Contact Information Primary Contact Name: Eric Neuville , Vice President Product Development and Innovation Primary Contact T elephone Number: (31 7) 963-1835 Primary Contact Email Address: eneuville@iuhealth.o rg 4 Certifying Actuary Contact Information Primary Contact Name: Robert Macagnano, PwC Primary Contact Telephone Number: ( Primary Contact Email Address: robert.macagnano@us.pwc.com Benefit Summary IUHP will be offering three Bronze, three Silver, and one Gold HMO products. A summary of the major provisions of each plan are provided in Appendix A. Premium Guarantee Provision Premiums are guaranteed not to change through December 31, 201 5. Renewability The policy is renewable by paying the applicable renewal premiums unless the policyholder no longer meets the eligibility requirements of the policy or the company decides not to renew all the policies in the state. Applicability The rates will apply to new business. Subsequent renewal business will be subject to rates filed for our 201 6 rate development. Premium Modalization Premiums will be collected only on a monthly basis. Trend Assumption Rates are effective for calendar year 201 5. Trend assumptions will be developed for future rating periods based on developing experience, and anticipated changes in provider reimbursemen t. 2) Proposed Rate Increase (s) This is a new filing therefore no rate increase assumption is included in this filing. Subsequent rate increases beginning with effective dates of January 1, 201 6 will be filed in the future. 3) Experience Period Premium and Claims Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 5 4) Benefit Categories The methodology used to determine benefit categories in Worksheet 1, Section II of the Unified Rate Review Template is as follows: Inpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for medical, surgical, maternity, mental health and substance abuse, skilled nursing, and other se rvices provided in an inpatient facility setting and billed by the facility. Outpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for surgery, emergency room, lab, radiology, therapy, observation, and other services provided in an outpatient facil ity setting and billed by the facility. Professional: Includes non -capitated primary care, specialist, therapy, the professional component of laboratory and radiology, and other professional services, other than hospital based professionals whose payments are included in facility fees. Other Medical: Includes non -capitated ambulance, home health care, DME, prosthetics, supplies, and other services. Capitation: Includes capitated services for pediatric vision benefits . Prescription Drug: Includes drugs dispensed by a pharmacy and rebates received from drug manufacturers. 5) Projection Factors Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate d evelopment process. 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development The PwC Rating Model was used as the basis to develop the manual rates. Our model was developed using two primary sources: Commercial Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases for U.S. members and providers. The database contains full enrollment and claims information with standard medical coding which allows for cost and utilization information by service category (inpatient, outpatient hospital, hospice, home health, professional, prescriptio n drugs, etc.). The database consists of the experience from 53 million Commercial eligible participants. The data can be extracted down to the member's state and MSA level. For the Indiana Commercial market, there were approximately 1.5 million expose d life years' worth of data crossing all ages, genders and employment statuses (active, COBRA, disabled and retired). Nationwide, the databases have over 100 unique data contributors so it is not skewed to any one payer. OptumInsight (Optum) Comprehensiv e Pricing Model \u00ae provides benchmark data and pricing capabilities for Commercial health plans. It factors in health plan features such as 6 deductibles, copays, out -of-pocket maximums, covered services, etc. The model uses normative data and benefit details to arrive at an allowed cost per member per month . The normative benchmarking utilization metrics within the model are developed from Optum's database of Commercial (under 65) health plan experience of approximately 20 million life years . The model experience was adjusted to reflect the Indiana marketplace. Since both the Truven and Optum data sources represent fully -completed calendar year 2012 claims, allowed costs were trended to the midpoint of calendar year 2015 using an annual trend rate of 7.4 %. The allowed costs component of the manual rates was increased by 2% to account for expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential Health Benefits ( EHB) requirements . The following is not an all inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting costs of pediatric coverage. The manual rates were increased by 1 5% to reflect the entrance of approximately 7,000 Medicaid Spend -Down beneficiaries into the Indiana Health Insurance E xchange. This adjustment was based on the assumption that IUHP's penetration of the Medicaid Spend -Down population would be similar to their assumed penetration of the general population. Expenditure information for the Medicaid Spend -Down population was provided by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administ ration and contained in the April 21, 2014 study \"Spend Down Exchange Impact: Transition to the Indiana Health Insurance Exchange\" performed by Milliman, Inc. In addition, preliminary estimates provided by the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) during their May 2, 2014 Weekly ACA Rate & Form Filing Call Session indicate d that the inclusion of this population would increase premiums by 5% - 15%. We have been informed by the IDOI that additional information pertaining to this population will be made avail able. We reserve the right to revise our filing to reflect this data subsequent to this filing. There will also be new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying ou t of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. Pent up demand has been shown to increase costs in the first year of enrollment for those previously uninsured. Based on analysis of programs serving a similar populatio n, it appears that the claims are higher in the first six to 12 months that an individual is newly insured. After this initial period, the claims experience tends to revert to the average level for the market. The total effect is uncertain and may be offse t by some new enrollees having reduced utilization as they may not fully 7 understand new or increased coverage. Therefore, we have included an adjustment within our manual rate development for pent up demand of 5 .0%. The following adjustments were made to calibrate the pricing model to the expected population: Rating region Expected demographics Expected morbidity Contractual Agreements with healthcare providers Expected utilization management savings Benefit plan designs Some benefits will be reimbursed under a capitation arrangement. The provider reimbursement adjustment to the pricing model was developed to account for the cost of capitated services. The manual rates were also adjusted upward by a factor of 1.00 5 to account for the likelihood that some enrollees may not pay their premiums due during the first month of the 90 -day grace period. This was calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment on one -twelfth of the annual premium due for 80% of the Individual population (those eligible for Advance Pay ments of a Premium Tax Credit). The amount of premium at risk is only on the portion that IUHP does not receive via direct subsidy, estimated to be 50% (0.15 x 1/12 x 0.80 x 0.50 = 0.005). The 15% represents our assumption regarding the small portion of e nrollees that we believe will knowingly take advantage of the grace period provision. The 80% represents the portion of enrollees in the 2015 Individual marketplace that we assume will be eligible for premium subsidies based on income level. On May 1, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that as of April 19, 2014, 89% of those enrolled in the Indiana exchange were eligible for federal assistance. Our assumption is that this percentage will decrease during 2015. 7) Credibility of Experience IUHP has not previously operated in the individual market. As a result the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection factors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 8) Paid to Allowed Ratio The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Projection Period \" shown on Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT is developed by membership -weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership -weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan . The projected membership by plan is sho wn in Worksheet 2, Section II. The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 8 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM The Risk Adjustmen t program transfers funds from lower risk plans to higher risk plans in the Non - Grandfathered Individual and Small Group market. At this time, IUHP is assuming the risk for the plans in this filing are no better or worse than other plans in the market, resulting in no estimated risk transfer value . Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed for 2015. Projected ACA Reinsurance Recoveries Net of Reinsurance Premium (Individual Market and Combined Markets Only) The Federal transitional reinsuran ce program is a temporary risk mitigation program expected to reduce costs for insurance issuers. The 201 5 reinsurance program has an attachment point of $70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. The Department of Health and Human Servic es will reimburse insurance issuers 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. Allowed claims were reduced by 7.0% to account for the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from this temporary program. This estimate was de veloped using projected paid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the expected average claim levels for the 2015 Individual market, and the federal program guidelines summarized above. The expected reinsurance reimbursements of $51.43 PMPM are allocated proportionally by plan based on allowed claims. Applying the 2015 transitional reinsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of $47.76 PMPM. Projected Net Cost of Private Reinsurance The projected net cost of private reinsurance for 2015 is $0.00 PMPM since IUHP does not intend to purchase private reinsurance. 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk Administrative Expense Load IUHP developed their expected administrative expenses based on : a) current administrative expenses for their Medicare line of business adjusting for any expected differences for their Commercial products , and b) a review of 2014 Rate Filings for Individual Exchange products . A summary of IUHP's assumptions is as follows: Administrative expenses (excluding Sales and Marketing expenses ): 10.50% of premium Sales and Marketing expenses (including c ommissions ): 3.70% of premium These administrative expenses are allocated proportionally by plan. Quality Improvement Expenses At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives . Therefore, no explicit Quality Improvement expenses were assumed. 9 Profit & Risk Margin The proposed rates reflect a profit & risk margin of 3.0% of premium . This load was applied to all products and plans. Taxes and Fees A summary of the assumed taxes and fees are summarized below: PMPM Basis Transitional reinsurance charge: $3.67 PMPM ($44.00 PCORI fee: $0.17 PMPM ($2.00 per member Percentage of Premium Basis Health insurance exchange fee: 3.15% of premium reflecting IUHP's assumption that 90% of their expected 2015 bu siness will be sold through the exchange ACA issuer fee: IUHP will not be subject to this fee for 2015 Premium tax: 1.30% of premium 11) Projected Loss Ratio The overall projected medical loss ratio for 2015 is 82. 5%. Th is calculation exclude s regulatory fees and taxes. At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. As a result, we have not included an adjustment in the MLR calcu lation for these expenses. It is IUHP's intent to identify their Quality Improvement expenses for purposes of submitting their MLR -related filings and calculating related rebates , if any. The table below shows the calculation. a) Incurred Claims Net of Cost Sharing $501.10 b) Transitional Reinsurance Reimbursement ($51.43 ) c) Reinsurance Charge $3.67 d) Quality Improvement Expenses $0.00 e) Worksheet 1 Projected Incurred Claims ( a+b+c +d) $453.34 f) Administrative Expenses $82.21 g) Profit & Risk Margin $17.37 h) Regulatory Taxes and Fees (excluding reinsurance charge) $26.01 i) Gross Premium ( e+f+g+h) $578.92 j) Medical Loss Ratio ( e/(i-c-h)) 82.5% 10 12) Single Risk Pool IUHP has not previously operated in the Individual market and thus does not have any claims experience to develop its own Single Risk Pool . This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 13) Index Rate This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the Index Rate for the Experience Period has been left blank . The Index Rate of $7 34.69 for the 2015 Projection Period represents the overall projected allowed costs PMPM for providing Essential Health Benefits for the Single Risk Pool . Since this is a new product , the index rate was developed based on a manual rate as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section. The Index Rate will remain unchanged until a renewal filing effective January 1, 201 6. 14) Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market -wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market -wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowable under these rules: Federal reinsurance program adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Risk adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Exchange user fe e adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Similar to the Index Rate, the Market Adjusted Index Rate reflects the average demographic characteristics of the Single R isk Pool. In other words, the Market Adjusted Index Rate is not calibrated. The development of t he Federal reinsurance program and risk adjustments was described above in the Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance section. The development of the Exchange user fee adjustment was described above in the Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section. Index Rate $734.69 Reinsurance Reimbursements (7.0% of Allowed Claims - Index Rate) ($51.4 3) Reinsurance Premiums $ 3.67 Risk Adjustment $ 0.00 Exchange user fee (3.15% of average premium for Single Risk Pool) $ 18.24 Market Adj usted Index Rate $705.17 11 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rate s The Plan Adjusted Index Rates are included in Worksheet 2, Section IV of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template in 2015. These Plan Adjusted Index Rates have been adjusted to remove the portion of the allowed cost that is expected to be recouped through the tobacco surcharge. The average tobacco surcharge for the Single Risk Pool is approximately 1. 4%. The Plan Adjusted Index Rates reflect the average demographic characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Plan Adjusted Index Rate s are not calibrated. The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the issuer Market Adjusted Index Rate adju sted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). The following adjustments are allowable under these rules: Actuarial value and cost sharing adjustment (plan adjustment) Provider network, deliv ery system and utilization management adjustment (plan adjustment) Adjustment for benefits in addition to the EHBs (plan adjustment) Impact of specific eligibility categories for the catastrophic plan (plan adjustment ) Adjustment for distribution and admin istrative costs (plan adjustment) Only the a ctuarial value and cost sharing & distribution and administrative costs adjustments were applicable to IUHP. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment This adjustment includes three components: Removal of tobacco surcharge - the average tobacco surcharge factor was applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool Benefit richness utilization adjustments - The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. Benefit richness utilization adjustments were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge). These adjustments were based on the values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the Silver plan level. The adjustments for each metallic tier are as follows: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.00 / 1.00 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 Cost Sharing - The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT was used to calculate the cost sharing percentage for each plan. These cost sharing percentages were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge and applying the benefit richness utiliza tion adjustments). The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 12 Adjustment for Distribution and Administra tive Costs Fixed and variable costs as described in the Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section were included in this adjustment as follows: Fixed costs: Risk adjustment user and PCORI fees Variable costs (% of premium): Administrative expenses, sales & marketing expenses, profit & risk margin, and premium taxes. The percentages applied did not vary by plan. Appendix D shows the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 16) Calibration The Plan Adjusted Index Rates (which are based on the Single Risk Pool) were calibrated to apply the allowable rating factors in order to calculate Consumer Adjusted Premium Rates. The calibration by age and geography is described below. Age Curve Calibration The methodology employed in the calculation of the average age and the calibration to the age curve complies with the standard age curve methodology and conforms with the rating rules specified in 45 CFR 147.102. The expected membership distribution by age band was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. A uniform distribution within each age band was also assumed. A weighted average age factor of 1.685 for the Single Risk Pool was also determined by applying th e membership distribution to the Federal age curve. This represents a rounded weighted average age of 49. Appendix C shows the development of the weighted average age factor. The Plan Index Rates were calibrated by dividing by 1.706 which represents the standard age factor of the rounded weighted average age of 49 . This calibration factor does not vary by plan. Geograph ic Factor Calibration A geographic factor calibration was not required since the weighted average of the geographic factors equals 1.0. The Geographic (rating area) factors were developed based upon the network characteristics for unit cost and utilization management in each of the established rating areas. Based upon the expected distribution of enrolment by area, the area factors reflect the Single Risk Pool results consistent with the URRT. Appendix D shows how the calibration adjustments were applied to the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 17) Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate Development The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final premium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual, family, or small employer group utilizing the rating and premium adjustments as articulated in the applicable Market Reform Rating Rules. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate 13 is developed by calibrating the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve as described above, calibrating for geography if necessary, and applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. The following adjustments are allowable under this rule: Whether the plan coverage covers an individual or family (issuers must cover any eligible individual and/or eligible family that requests coverage per the guaranteed issue requirement of the ACA); this is further clarified in regulation that the premium for family coverage is determined by summing the premiums for each i ndividual family member, provided at most three child dependents under age 21 are taken into account; this adjustment does not result in a separate rating factor Rating area Age - reflecting the applicable age curve Tobacco status The rating factors (shown in Appendix C) are applied at an individual level and added together to calculate the family rate , with the exception that no more than 3 covered children under the age of 21 are charged a rate . Adjustment for family size is in accordance with Federal rul es. The example s in Appendix E show how the rating factors are applied to the calibrated Plan Adjusted Index Rate. 18) AV Metal Values The Federal AV calculator was used without any modifications to generate the Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the URRT . Please refer to Appendix F for screen shots showing the AV calculations for each plan. 19) AV Pricing Values The Silver Value plan was selected as the fixed reference plan and serves as the basis for the AV Pricing Values. Please refer to Appendix C for the AV Pricing Values for each plan which are also included in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT. The AV Pricing Value for each plan reflects the relative impact of the plan's cost -sharing amounts , expecte d impact o n enrollee utilization due to benefit richness (excluding impact of morbidity), expected additional cost of non -EHB, and administrative expenses (excluding health insurance exchange user fees). This is a new filing based on manual rate projection s. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the PwC Rating Model as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section was used to develop the benefit relativities for the AV Pricing Values. 20) Membership Projections Membership projections were based on market penetration assumptions provided by IUHP. These assumptions reflected the uninsured and individual market population s by county, income level, and other characteristics such as the presence of IUHP facilities and delivery system within a given county . The expected membership distribution by age band and metallic tier was based upon the Indiana 14 Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. For the Silver plans, the portion of the projected enrollment that will be eligible for CSR subsidies at each subsidy level was based on the income level detail in the market penetration analysis provided by IUHP . Summaries of the projected membersh ip by age, metallic tier, and CSR subsidy level are shown in Appendix B. 21) Terminated Products Not applicable. IUHP does not currently have Individual plans in the State of Indiana. 22) Plan Type All plans listed types in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT correctly describe IUHP's plans as \"HMO\" . 23) Warning Alerts Two warnings were generated in the URRT, both of which were due to adjustments to the Projected Incurred Claims between Worksheet 1 and Worksheet 2. The first adjustment was the removal of the impact of the tobacco surcharge of 1.4% as required in the reporting of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates and related items in Worksheet 2. This resulted in a decrease in Projected Incurred Claims of $10.00 PMPM between Worksheets 1 and 2. The second adjustment was the application of the induced utilization factors in the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rate for each plan. When aggregat ed, the impact was a reduction of 0.5% or $3.22 PMPM. 24) Compa ny Financial Position Please see Appendix G for information regarding the capital and surplus position of IUHP. 25) Reliance In the preparation of this filing, I have relied upon data provided by Eric Neuville (Vice President Product Development and Innovation ), Connie Brown (CFO and COO), and IUHP management . I did not audit this data but did review it for reasonableness. This information includes but is not limited to the following items: Administrative expense projections Provider reimbursement levels (including capitation arrangements) Projected enrollment Projected pharmacy discounts, unit costs and rebates Financial statement information 15 26) Actuarial Certification I, Robert Macagnano , FSA, MAAA, am affiliated with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).

Company Identifying Information Company Legal Name: Indiana University Health Plan s, Inc . State: The State of Indiana has regulatory authority over these policies HIOS Issuer ID: 33380 Market: Individual Effective Date: January 1, 201 5 Company Contact Information Primary Contact Name: Eric Neuville , Vice President Product Development and Innovation Primary Contact T elephone Number: (31 7) 963-1835 Primary Contact Email Address: eneuville@iuhealth.o rg 4 Certifying Actuary Contact Information Primary Contact Name: Robert Macagnano, PwC Primary Contact Telephone Number: ( Primary Contact Email Address: robert.macagnano@us.pwc.com Benefit Summary IUHP will be offering three Bronze, three Silver, and one Gold HMO products. A summary of the major provisions of each plan are provided in Appendix A. Premium Guarantee Provision Premiums are guaranteed not to change through December 31, 201 5. Renewability The policy is renewable by paying the applicable renewal premiums unless the policyholder no longer meets the eligibility requirements of the policy or the company decides not to renew all the policies in the state. Applicability The rates will apply to new business. Subsequent renewal business will be subject to rates filed for our 201 6 rate development. Premium Modalization Premiums will be collected only on a monthly basis. Trend Assumption Rates are effective for calendar year 201 5. Trend assumptions will be developed for future rating periods based on developing experience, and anticipated changes in provider reimbursemen t. 2) Proposed Rate Increase (s) This is a new filing therefore no rate increase assumption is included in this filing. Subsequent rate increases beginning with effective dates of January 1, 201 6 will be filed in the future. 3) Experience Period Premium and Claims Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 5 4) Benefit Categories The methodology used to determine benefit categories in Worksheet 1, Section II of the Unified Rate Review Template is as follows: Inpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for medical, surgical, maternity, mental health and substance abuse, skilled nursing, and other se rvices provided in an inpatient facility setting and billed by the facility. Outpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for surgery, emergency room, lab, radiology, therapy, observation, and other services provided in an outpatient facil ity setting and billed by the facility. Professional: Includes non -capitated primary care, specialist, therapy, the professional component of laboratory and radiology, and other professional services, other than hospital based professionals whose payments are included in facility fees. Other Medical: Includes non -capitated ambulance, home health care, DME, prosthetics, supplies, and other services. Capitation: Includes capitated services for pediatric vision benefits . Prescription Drug: Includes drugs dispensed by a pharmacy and rebates received from drug manufacturers. 5) Projection Factors Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate d evelopment process. 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development The PwC Rating Model was used as the basis to develop the manual rates. Our model was developed using two primary sources: Commercial Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases for U.S. members and providers. The database contains full enrollment and claims information with standard medical coding which allows for cost and utilization information by service category (inpatient, outpatient hospital, hospice, home health, professional, prescriptio n drugs, etc.). The database consists of the experience from 53 million Commercial eligible participants. The data can be extracted down to the member's state and MSA level. For the Indiana Commercial market, there were approximately 1.5 million expose d life years' worth of data crossing all ages, genders and employment statuses (active, COBRA, disabled and retired). Nationwide, the databases have over 100 unique data contributors so it is not skewed to any one payer. OptumInsight (Optum) Comprehensiv e Pricing Model \u00ae provides benchmark data and pricing capabilities for Commercial health plans. It factors in health plan features such as 6 deductibles, copays, out -of-pocket maximums, covered services, etc. The model uses normative data and benefit details to arrive at an allowed cost per member per month . The normative benchmarking utilization metrics within the model are developed from Optum's database of Commercial (under 65) health plan experience of approximately 20 million life years . The model experience was adjusted to reflect the Indiana marketplace. Since both the Truven and Optum data sources represent fully -completed calendar year 2012 claims, allowed costs were trended to the midpoint of calendar year 2015 using an annual trend rate of 7.4 %. The allowed costs component of the manual rates was increased by 2% to account for expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential Health Benefits ( EHB) requirements . The following is not an all inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting costs of pediatric coverage. The manual rates were increased by 1 5% to reflect the entrance of approximately 7,000 Medicaid Spend -Down beneficiaries into the Indiana Health Insurance E xchange. This adjustment was based on the assumption that IUHP's penetration of the Medicaid Spend -Down population would be similar to their assumed penetration of the general population. Expenditure information for the Medicaid Spend -Down population was provided by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administ ration and contained in the April 21, 2014 study \"Spend Down Exchange Impact: Transition to the Indiana Health Insurance Exchange\" performed by Milliman, Inc. In addition, preliminary estimates provided by the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) during their May 2, 2014 Weekly ACA Rate & Form Filing Call Session indicate d that the inclusion of this population would increase premiums by 5% - 15%. We have been informed by the IDOI that additional information pertaining to this population will be made avail able. We reserve the right to revise our filing to reflect this data subsequent to this filing. There will also be new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying ou t of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. Pent up demand has been shown to increase costs in the first year of enrollment for those previously uninsured. Based on analysis of programs serving a similar populatio n, it appears that the claims are higher in the first six to 12 months that an individual is newly insured. After this initial period, the claims experience tends to revert to the average level for the market. The total effect is uncertain and may be offse t by some new enrollees having reduced utilization as they may not fully 7 understand new or increased coverage. Therefore, we have included an adjustment within our manual rate development for pent up demand of 5 .0%. The following adjustments were made to calibrate the pricing model to the expected population: Rating region Expected demographics Expected morbidity Contractual Agreements with healthcare providers Expected utilization management savings Benefit plan designs Some benefits will be reimbursed under a capitation arrangement. The provider reimbursement adjustment to the pricing model was developed to account for the cost of capitated services. The manual rates were also adjusted upward by a factor of 1.00 5 to account for the likelihood that some enrollees may not pay their premiums due during the first month of the 90 -day grace period. This was calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment on one -twelfth of the annual premium due for 80% of the Individual population (those eligible for Advance Pay ments of a Premium Tax Credit). The amount of premium at risk is only on the portion that IUHP does not receive via direct subsidy, estimated to be 50% (0.15 x 1/12 x 0.80 x 0.50 = 0.005). The 15% represents our assumption regarding the small portion of e nrollees that we believe will knowingly take advantage of the grace period provision. The 80% represents the portion of enrollees in the 2015 Individual marketplace that we assume will be eligible for premium subsidies based on income level. On May 1, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that as of April 19, 2014, 89% of those enrolled in the Indiana exchange were eligible for federal assistance. Our assumption is that this percentage will decrease during 2015. 7) Credibility of Experience IUHP has not previously operated in the individual market. As a result the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection factors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 8) Paid to Allowed Ratio The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Projection Period \" shown on Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT is developed by membership -weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership -weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan . The projected membership by plan is sho wn in Worksheet 2, Section II. The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 8 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM The Risk Adjustmen t program transfers funds from lower risk plans to higher risk plans in the Non - Grandfathered Individual and Small Group market. At this time, IUHP is assuming the risk for the plans in this filing are no better or worse than other plans in the market, resulting in no estimated risk transfer value . Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed for 2015. Projected ACA Reinsurance Recoveries Net of Reinsurance Premium (Individual Market and Combined Markets Only) The Federal transitional reinsuran ce program is a temporary risk mitigation program expected to reduce costs for insurance issuers. The 201 5 reinsurance program has an attachment point of $70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. The Department of Health and Human Servic es will reimburse insurance issuers 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. Allowed claims were reduced by 7.0% to account for the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from this temporary program. This estimate was de veloped using projected paid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the expected average claim levels for the 2015 Individual market, and the federal program guidelines summarized above. The expected reinsurance reimbursements of $51.43 PMPM are allocated proportionally by plan based on allowed claims. Applying the 2015 transitional reinsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of $47.76 PMPM. Projected Net Cost of Private Reinsurance The projected net cost of private reinsurance for 2015 is $0.00 PMPM since IUHP does not intend to purchase private reinsurance. 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk Administrative Expense Load IUHP developed their expected administrative expenses based on : a) current administrative expenses for their Medicare line of business adjusting for any expected differences for their Commercial products , and b) a review of 2014 Rate Filings for Individual Exchange products . A summary of IUHP's assumptions is as follows: Administrative expenses (excluding Sales and Marketing expenses ): 10.50% of premium Sales and Marketing expenses (including c ommissions ): 3.70% of premium These administrative expenses are allocated proportionally by plan. Quality Improvement Expenses At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives . Therefore, no explicit Quality Improvement expenses were assumed. 9 Profit & Risk Margin The proposed rates reflect a profit & risk margin of 3.0% of premium . This load was applied to all products and plans. Taxes and Fees A summary of the assumed taxes and fees are summarized below: PMPM Basis Transitional reinsurance charge: $3.67 PMPM ($44.00 PCORI fee: $0.17 PMPM ($2.00 per member Percentage of Premium Basis Health insurance exchange fee: 3.15% of premium reflecting IUHP's assumption that 90% of their expected 2015 bu siness will be sold through the exchange ACA issuer fee: IUHP will not be subject to this fee for 2015 Premium tax: 1.30% of premium 11) Projected Loss Ratio The overall projected medical loss ratio for 2015 is 82. 5%. Th is calculation exclude s regulatory fees and taxes. At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. As a result, we have not included an adjustment in the MLR calcu lation for these expenses. It is IUHP's intent to identify their Quality Improvement expenses for purposes of submitting their MLR -related filings and calculating related rebates , if any. The table below shows the calculation. a) Incurred Claims Net of Cost Sharing $501.10 b) Transitional Reinsurance Reimbursement ($51.43 ) c) Reinsurance Charge $3.67 d) Quality Improvement Expenses $0.00 e) Worksheet 1 Projected Incurred Claims ( a+b+c +d) $453.34 f) Administrative Expenses $82.21 g) Profit & Risk Margin $17.37 h) Regulatory Taxes and Fees (excluding reinsurance charge) $26.01 i) Gross Premium ( e+f+g+h) $578.92 j) Medical Loss Ratio ( e/(i-c-h)) 82.5% 10 12) Single Risk Pool IUHP has not previously operated in the Individual market and thus does not have any claims experience to develop its own Single Risk Pool . This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 13) Index Rate This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the Index Rate for the Experience Period has been left blank . The Index Rate of $7 34.69 for the 2015 Projection Period represents the overall projected allowed costs PMPM for providing Essential Health Benefits for the Single Risk Pool . Since this is a new product , the index rate was developed based on a manual rate as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section. The Index Rate will remain unchanged until a renewal filing effective January 1, 201 6. 14) Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market -wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market -wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowable under these rules: Federal reinsurance program adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Risk adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Exchange user fe e adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Similar to the Index Rate, the Market Adjusted Index Rate reflects the average demographic characteristics of the Single R isk Pool. In other words, the Market Adjusted Index Rate is not calibrated. The development of t he Federal reinsurance program and risk adjustments was described above in the Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance section. The development of the Exchange user fee adjustment was described above in the Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section. Index Rate $734.69 Reinsurance Reimbursements (7.0% of Allowed Claims - Index Rate) ($51.4 3) Reinsurance Premiums $ 3.67 Risk Adjustment $ 0.00 Exchange user fee (3.15% of average premium for Single Risk Pool) $ 18.24 Market Adj usted Index Rate $705.17 11 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rate s The Plan Adjusted Index Rates are included in Worksheet 2, Section IV of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template in 2015. These Plan Adjusted Index Rates have been adjusted to remove the portion of the allowed cost that is expected to be recouped through the tobacco surcharge. The average tobacco surcharge for the Single Risk Pool is approximately 1. 4%. The Plan Adjusted Index Rates reflect the average demographic characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Plan Adjusted Index Rate s are not calibrated. The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the issuer Market Adjusted Index Rate adju sted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). The following adjustments are allowable under these rules: Actuarial value and cost sharing adjustment (plan adjustment) Provider network, deliv ery system and utilization management adjustment (plan adjustment) Adjustment for benefits in addition to the EHBs (plan adjustment) Impact of specific eligibility categories for the catastrophic plan (plan adjustment ) Adjustment for distribution and admin istrative costs (plan adjustment) Only the a ctuarial value and cost sharing & distribution and administrative costs adjustments were applicable to IUHP. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment This adjustment includes three components: Removal of tobacco surcharge - the average tobacco surcharge factor was applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool Benefit richness utilization adjustments - The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. Benefit richness utilization adjustments were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge). These adjustments were based on the values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the Silver plan level. The adjustments for each metallic tier are as follows: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.00 / 1.00 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 Cost Sharing - The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT was used to calculate the cost sharing percentage for each plan. These cost sharing percentages were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge and applying the benefit richness utiliza tion adjustments). The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 12 Adjustment for Distribution and Administra tive Costs Fixed and variable costs as described in the Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section were included in this adjustment as follows: Fixed costs: Risk adjustment user and PCORI fees Variable costs (% of premium): Administrative expenses, sales & marketing expenses, profit & risk margin, and premium taxes. The percentages applied did not vary by plan. Appendix D shows the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 16) Calibration The Plan Adjusted Index Rates (which are based on the Single Risk Pool) were calibrated to apply the allowable rating factors in order to calculate Consumer Adjusted Premium Rates. The calibration by age and geography is described below. Age Curve Calibration The methodology employed in the calculation of the average age and the calibration to the age curve complies with the standard age curve methodology and conforms with the rating rules specified in 45 CFR 147.102. The expected membership distribution by age band was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. A uniform distribution within each age band was also assumed. A weighted average age factor of 1.685 for the Single Risk Pool was also determined by applying th e membership distribution to the Federal age curve. This represents a rounded weighted average age of 49. Appendix C shows the development of the weighted average age factor. The Plan Index Rates were calibrated by dividing by 1.706 which represents the standard age factor of the rounded weighted average age of 49 . This calibration factor does not vary by plan. Geograph ic Factor Calibration A geographic factor calibration was not required since the weighted average of the geographic factors equals 1.0. The Geographic (rating area) factors were developed based upon the network characteristics for unit cost and utilization management in each of the established rating areas. Based upon the expected distribution of enrolment by area, the area factors reflect the Single Risk Pool results consistent with the URRT. Appendix D shows how the calibration adjustments were applied to the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 17) Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate Development The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final premium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual, family, or small employer group utilizing the rating and premium adjustments as articulated in the applicable Market Reform Rating Rules. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate 13 is developed by calibrating the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve as described above, calibrating for geography if necessary, and applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. The following adjustments are allowable under this rule: Whether the plan coverage covers an individual or family (issuers must cover any eligible individual and/or eligible family that requests coverage per the guaranteed issue requirement of the ACA); this is further clarified in regulation that the premium for family coverage is determined by summing the premiums for each i ndividual family member, provided at most three child dependents under age 21 are taken into account; this adjustment does not result in a separate rating factor Rating area Age - reflecting the applicable age curve Tobacco status The rating factors (shown in Appendix C) are applied at an individual level and added together to calculate the family rate , with the exception that no more than 3 covered children under the age of 21 are charged a rate . Adjustment for family size is in accordance with Federal rul es. The example s in Appendix E show how the rating factors are applied to the calibrated Plan Adjusted Index Rate. 18) AV Metal Values The Federal AV calculator was used without any modifications to generate the Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the URRT . Please refer to Appendix F for screen shots showing the AV calculations for each plan. 19) AV Pricing Values The Silver Value plan was selected as the fixed reference plan and serves as the basis for the AV Pricing Values. Please refer to Appendix C for the AV Pricing Values for each plan which are also included in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT. The AV Pricing Value for each plan reflects the relative impact of the plan's cost -sharing amounts , expecte d impact o n enrollee utilization due to benefit richness (excluding impact of morbidity), expected additional cost of non -EHB, and administrative expenses (excluding health insurance exchange user fees). This is a new filing based on manual rate projection s. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the PwC Rating Model as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section was used to develop the benefit relativities for the AV Pricing Values. 20) Membership Projections Membership projections were based on market penetration assumptions provided by IUHP. These assumptions reflected the uninsured and individual market population s by county, income level, and other characteristics such as the presence of IUHP facilities and delivery system within a given county . The expected membership distribution by age band and metallic tier was based upon the Indiana 14 Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. For the Silver plans, the portion of the projected enrollment that will be eligible for CSR subsidies at each subsidy level was based on the income level detail in the market penetration analysis provided by IUHP . Summaries of the projected membersh ip by age, metallic tier, and CSR subsidy level are shown in Appendix B. 21) Terminated Products Not applicable. IUHP does not currently have Individual plans in the State of Indiana. 22) Plan Type All plans listed types in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT correctly describe IUHP's plans as \"HMO\" . 23) Warning Alerts Two warnings were generated in the URRT, both of which were due to adjustments to the Projected Incurred Claims between Worksheet 1 and Worksheet 2. The first adjustment was the removal of the impact of the tobacco surcharge of 1.4% as required in the reporting of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates and related items in Worksheet 2. This resulted in a decrease in Projected Incurred Claims of $10.00 PMPM between Worksheets 1 and 2. The second adjustment was the application of the induced utilization factors in the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rate for each plan. When aggregat ed, the impact was a reduction of 0.5% or $3.22 PMPM. 24) Compa ny Financial Position Please see Appendix G for information regarding the capital and surplus position of IUHP. 25) Reliance In the preparation of this filing, I have relied upon data provided by Eric Neuville (Vice President Product Development and Innovation ), Connie Brown (CFO and COO), and IUHP management . I did not audit this data but did review it for reasonableness. This information includes but is not limited to the following items: Administrative expense projections Provider reimbursement levels (including capitation arrangements) Projected enrollment Projected pharmacy discounts, unit costs and rebates Financial statement information 15 26) Actuarial Certification I, Robert Macagnano , FSA, MAAA, am affiliated with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).

Professional: Includes non -capitated primary care, specialist, therapy, the professional component of laboratory and radiology, and other professional services, other than hospital based professionals whose pa yments are included in facility fees.

Prescription Drug: Includes drug s dispensed by a pharmacy and rebates received from drug manufacturers. 5) Projection Factors Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development The PwC Rating Model was used as the basis to develop the manual rates. Our model was developed using two primary sources: Commercial Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases for U.S. member s and providers. The database contains full enrollment and claims information with standard medical coding which allows for cost and utilization information by service category (inpatient, outpatient hospital, hospice, home health, professional, prescript ion drugs, etc.). The database consists of the experience from 53 million Commercial eligible participants. The data can be extracted down to the member's state and MSA level. For the Indiana Commercial market, there were approximately 1.5 million expo sed life years' worth of data crossing all ages, genders and employment statuses (active, COBRA, disabled and retired). Nationwide, the databases have over 100 unique data contributors so it is not skewed to any one payer. OptumInsight (Optum) Comprehens ive Pricing Model \u00ae provides benchmark data and pricing capabilities for Commercial health plans. It factors in health plan features such as 6 deductibles, copays, out -of-pocket maximums, covered services, etc. The model uses normative data and benefit detail s to arrive at an allowed cost per member per month . The normative benchmarking utilization metrics within the model are developed from Optum's database of Commercial (under 65) health plan experience of approximately 20 million life years . The model exper ience was adjusted to reflect the Indiana marketplace. Since both the Truven and Optum data sources represent fully -completed calendar year 2012 claims, allowed costs were trended to the midpoint of calendar year 2015 using an annual trend rate of 7.4%. The allowed costs component of the manual rates was increased by 2% to account for expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential Health Benefits ( EHB) requirements . The following is not an all inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental heal th and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the sta te, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting costs of pediatric coverage. The manual rates were increased by 1 5% to reflect the entrance of approximately 7,000 Medicaid Spend -Down beneficiaries into the Indiana Health Insurance E xchange. This adjustment was based on the assumption that IUHP's penetration of the Medicaid Spend -Down population would be similar to their assumed penetration of the general population. Expenditure information for the Medicaid Spend -Down p opulation was provided by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration and contained in the April 21, 2014 study \"Spend Down Exchange Impact: Transition to the Indiana Health Insurance Exchange\" performed by Milliman, Inc. In addition, preliminary estimates provided by the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) during their May 2, 2014 Weekly ACA Rate & Form Filing Call Session indicate d that the inclusion of this population would increase premiums by 5% - 15%. We have been informed by the IDOI tha t additional information pertaining to this population will be made available. We reserve the right to revise our filing to reflect this data subsequent to this filing. There will also be new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsure d. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, t here may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. Pent up demand has been shown to increase costs in the first year of enrollment for those previo usly uninsured. Based on analysis of programs serving a similar population, it appears that the claims are higher in the first six to 12 months that an individual is newly insured. After this initial period, the claims experience tends to revert to the ave rage level for the market. The total effect is uncertain and may be offset by some new enrollees having reduced utilization as they may not fully 7 understand new or increased coverage. Therefore, we have included an adjustment within our manual rate develop ment for pent up demand of 5 .0%. The following adjustments were made to calibrate the pricing model to the expected population: Rating region Expected demographics Expected morbidity Contractual Agreements with healthcare providers Expected utilization man agement savings Benefit plan designs Some benefits will be reimbursed under a capitation arrangement. The provider reimbursement adjustment to the pricing model was developed to account for the cost of capitated services. The manual rates were also adjuste d upward by a factor of 1.00 5 to account for the likelihood that some enrollees may not pay their premiums due during the first month of the 90 -day grace period. This was calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment on one -twelfth of the annual premium due for 80% of the Individual population (those eligible for Advance Payments of a Premium Tax Credit). The amount of premium at risk is only on the portion that IUHP does not receive via direct subsidy, estimated to be 50% (0.15 x 1/12 x 0.80 x 0.50 = 0.005 ). The 15% represents our assumption regarding the small portion of enrollees that we believe will knowingly take advantage of the grace period provision. The 80% represents the portion of enrollees in the 2015 Individual marketplace that we assume will b e eligible for premium subsidies based on income level. On May 1, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that as of April 19, 2014, 89% of those enrolled in the Indiana exchange were eligible for federal assistance. Our assumption is tha t this percentage will decrease during 2015. 7) Credibility of Experience IUHP has not previously operated in the individual market. As a result the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection f actors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 8) Paid to Allowed Rat io The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Projection Period \" shown on Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT is developed by membership -weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership -weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan . The projected membership by plan is sho wn in Worksheet 2, Section II. The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated u sing the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 8 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM The Risk Adjustment program tra nsfers funds from lower risk plans to higher risk plans in the Non - Grandfathered Individual and Small Group market. At this time, IUHP is assuming the risk for the plans in this filing are no better or worse than other plans in the market, resulting in no estimated risk transfer value . Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed for 2015. Projected ACA Reinsurance Recoveries Net of Reinsurance Premium (Individual Market and Combined Markets Only) The Federal transitional reinsurance program is a temporary risk mitigation program expected to reduce costs for insurance issuers. The 201 5 reinsurance program has an attachment point of $70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. The Department of Health and Human Services will reimburs e insurance issuers 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. Allowed claims were reduced by 7.0% to account for the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from this temporary program. This estimate was de veloped using projected p aid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the expected average claim levels for the 2015 Individual market, and the federal program guidelines summarized above. The expected reinsurance reimbursements of $51.43 PMPM are allocated proporti onally by plan based on allowed claims. Applying the 2015 transitional reinsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of $47.76 PMPM. Projected Net Cost of Private Reinsurance The projected net cost of private reinsurance for 2015 is $0.00 PMPM since IUHP does not intend to purchase private reinsurance. 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk Administrative Expense Load IUHP developed their expected administrative expenses based on : a) current administrative expenses for their Medicare line of business adjusting for any expected differences for their Commercial products , and b) a review of 2014 Rate Filings for Individual Exchange products . A summary of IUHP's assumptions is as follows: Administrative expenses (excluding Sales and Market ing expenses ): 10.50% of premium Sales and Marketing expenses (including c ommissions ): 3.70% of premium These administrative expenses are allocated proportionally by plan. Quality Improvement Expenses At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determi ne the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives . Therefore, no explicit Quality Improvement expenses were assumed. 9 Profit & Risk Margin The proposed rates reflect a profit & risk margin of 3.0% of premium . This load was applied to all products and plans. Taxes and Fees A summary of the assumed taxes and fees are summarized below: PMPM Basis Transitional reinsurance charge: $3.67 PMPM ($44.00 per member per year) PM PM PCORI fee: $0.17 PMPM ($2.00 per member per year) Percentage of Premium Basis Health insurance exchange fee: 3.15% of premium reflecting IUHP's assumption that 90% of their expected 2015 business will be sold through the exchange ACA issuer fee: IUHP w ill not be subject to this fee for 2015 Premium tax: 1.30% of premium 11) Projected Loss Ratio The overall projected medical loss ratio for 2015 is 82. 5%. Th is calculation exclude s regulatory fees and taxes. At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. As a result, we have not included an adjustment in the MLR calculation for these expenses. It is IUHP's intent to identify their Quality Improvement expenses for purposes of submitting their MLR -related filings and calculating related rebates , if any. The table below shows the calculation. a) Incurred Claims Net of Cost Sharing $501.10 b) Transitional Reinsurance Reimbursement ($51.43 ) c) Reinsurance Charge $3.67 d) Quality Improvement Expenses $0.00 e) Worksheet 1 Projected Incurred Claims ( a+b+c +d) $453.34 f) Administrative Expenses $82.21 g) Profit & Risk Margin $17.37 h) Regulatory Taxes and Fees (excluding reinsurance charge) $26.01 i) Gross Premium ( e+f+g+h) $578.92 j) Medical Loss Ratio ( e/(i-c-h)) 82.5% 10 12) Single Risk Pool IUHP has not previously operated in the Individual market and thus does not have any claims experience to develop its own Single Risk Pool . This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 13) Index Rate This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, th us the Index Rate for the Experience Period has been left blank . The Index Rate of $7 34.69 for the 2015 Projection Period represents the overall projected allowed costs PMPM for providing Essential Health Benefits for the Single Risk Pool . Since this is a new product , the index rate was developed based on a manual rate as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section. The Index Rate will remain unchanged until a renewal filing effective January 1, 201 6. 14) Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market -wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market -wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowable under these rules: Federal reinsurance program adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Risk adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Exchange user fee adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Similar to the Index Rate, the Market Adjusted Index Rate reflects the average demog raphic characteristics of the Single R isk Pool. In other words, the Market Adjusted Index Rate is not calibrated. The development of the Federal reinsurance program and risk adjustments was described above in the Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance section. T he development of the Exchange user fee adjustment was described above in the Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section. Index Rate $734.69 Reinsurance Reimbursements (7.0% of Allowed Claims - Index Rate) ($51.4 3) Reinsurance Premiums $ 3.67 Risk Adjustment $ 0.00 Exchange user fee (3.15% of average premium for Single Risk Pool) $ 18.24 Market Adjusted Index Rate $705.17 11 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rate s The Plan Adjusted Index Rates are included in Worksheet 2 , Section IV of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template in 2015. These Plan Adjusted Index Rates have been adjusted to remove the portion of the allowed cost that is expected to be recouped through the tobacco surcharge. The average tobacco surcharge for the Single Risk Pool is approximately 1. 4%. The Plan Adjusted Index Rates reflect the average demographic characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Plan Adjusted Index Rate s are not calibrated. The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the issuer Market Adjusted Index Rate adjusted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). The following adjustments are allowable under these rules: Actuarial value and cost sharing adjustm ent (plan adjustment) Provider network, delivery system and utilization management adjustment (plan adjustment) Adjustment for benefits in addition to the EHBs (plan adjustment) Impact of specific eligibility categories for the catastrophic plan (plan adju stment ) Adjustment for distribution and administrative costs (plan adjustment) Only the a ctuarial value and cost sharing & distribution and administrative costs adjustments were applicable to IUHP. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment This adjustmen t includes three components: Removal of tobacco surcharge - the average tobacco surcharge factor was applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool Benefit richness utilization adjustments - The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. Benefit richness utilization adjustments were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge). These adjustments were based on the values published in the Federal Register payme nt notice, normalized to the Silver plan level. The adjustments for each metallic tier are as follows: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.00 / 1.00 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 Cost Sharing - The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT was used to calculate the cost sharing percentage for each plan. These cost sharing percentages were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge a nd applying the benefit richness utilization adjustments). The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rul e (2015 Final Payment Notice). 12 Adjustment for Distribution and Administra tive Costs Fixed and variable costs as described in the Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section were included in this adjustment as follows: Fixed costs: Risk adjustment user and PCORI fees Variable costs (% of premium): Administrative expenses, sales & marketing expenses, profit & risk margin, and premium taxes. The percentages applied did not vary by plan. Appendix D shows the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 16) Calibration The Plan Adjusted Index Rates (which are based on the Single Risk Pool) were calibrated to apply the allowable rating factors in order to calculate Consumer Adjusted Premium Rates. The calibration by age and geography is described below. Age Curve Calibration The methodology employed in the calculation of the average age and the calibration to the age curve complies with the standard age curve methodology and conforms with the rating rules specified in 45 CFR 147.102. The expected membership distribution by age band was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. A uniform distribution within each age band was also assumed. A weighted average age facto r of 1.685 for the Single Risk Pool was also determined by applying th e membership distribution to the Federal age curve. This represents a rounded weighted average age of 49. Appendix C shows the development of the weighted average age factor. The Plan I ndex Rates were calibrated by dividing by 1.706 which represents the standard age factor of the rounded weighted average age of 49 . This calibration factor does not vary by plan. Geograph ic Factor Calibration A geographic factor calibration was not requir ed since the weighted average of the geographic factors equals 1.0. The Geographic (rating area) factors were developed based upon the network characteristics for unit cost and utilization management in each of the established rating areas. Based upon the expected distribution of enrolment by area, the area factors reflect the Single Risk Pool results consistent with the URRT. Appendix D shows how the calibration adjustments were applied to the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 17) Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate Development The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final premium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual, family, or small employer group utilizing the rating and premium adjustments as articulated in the applicable Market Reform Rating Rules. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate 13 is developed by calibrating the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve as described above, calibrating for geography if necessary, and applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. The following a djustments are allowable under this rule: Whether the plan coverage covers an individual or family (issuers must cover any eligible individual and/or eligible family that requests coverage per the guaranteed issue requirement of the ACA); this is further c larified in regulation that the premium for family coverage is determined by summing the premiums for each individual family member, provided at most three child dependents under age 21 are taken into account; this adjustment does not result in a separate rating factor Rating area Age - reflecting the applicable age curve Tobacco status The rating factors (shown in Appendix C) are applied at an individual level and added together to calculate the family rate , with the exception that no more than 3 covered c hildren under the age of 21 are charged a rate . Adjustment for family size is in accordance with Federal rules. The example s in Appendix E show how the rating factors are applied to the calibrated Plan Adjusted Index Rate. 18) AV Metal Values The Federal AV calculator was used without any modifications to generate the Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the URRT . Please refer to Appendix F for screen shots showing the AV calculations for each plan. 19) AV Pricing Values The Silver Value plan was selec ted as the fixed reference plan and serves as the basis for the AV Pricing Values. Please refer to Appendix C for the AV Pricing Values for each plan which are also included in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT. The AV Pricing Value for each plan reflects the relative impact of the plan's cost -sharing amounts , expected impact o n enrollee utilization due to benefit richness (excluding impact of morbidity), expected additional cost of non -EHB, and administrative expenses (excluding health insurance exchange user fees). This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the PwC Rating Model as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section was used to develop the benefit relativities fo r the AV Pricing Values. 20) Membership Projections Membership projections were based on market penetration assumptions provided by IUHP. These assumptions reflected the uninsured and individual market population s by county, income level, and other chara cteristics such as the presence of IUHP facilities and delivery system within a given county . The expected membership distribution by age band and metallic tier was based upon the Indiana 14 Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. For the Silver plans, the portion of the projected enrollment that will be eligible for CSR subsidies at each subsidy level was based on the income level detail in the market penetration analysis provided by IU HP. Summaries of the projected membership by age, metallic tier, and CSR subsidy level are shown in Appendix B. 21) Terminated Products Not applicable. IUHP does not currently have Individual plans in the State of Indiana. 22) Plan Type All plans liste d types in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT correctly describe IUHP's plans as \"HMO\" . 23) Warning Alerts Two warnings were generated in the URRT, both of which were due to adjustments to the allowed costs between Worksheet 1 and Worksheet 2. The first adjustment was the removal of the impact of the tobacco surcharge of 1.4% as required in the reporting of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates and related items in Worksheet 2. This resulted in a decrease in allowed claims of $xxxxx PMPM between Worksheets 1 and 2. The second adjustment was the application of the induced utilization factors in the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rate for each plan. When aggregat ed, the impact of ind uced utilization was a reduction of xxxx% or $ yyyyy PMPM. 24) Company F inancial Position Please see Appendix G for information regarding the capital and surplus position of IUHP. 25) Reliance In the preparation of this filing, I have relied upon data provided by Eric Neuville (Vice President Product Development and Innovatio n), Connie Brown (CFO and COO), and IUHP management . I did not audit this data but did review it for reasonableness. This information includes but is not limited to the following items: Administrative expense projections Provider reimbursement levels (including capitation arrangements) Projected enrollment Projected pharmacy discounts, unit costs and rebates Financial statement information 15 26) Actuarial Certification I, Robert Macagnano , FSA, MAAA, am affiliated with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).

Requesting Approval for Covered Services / 65 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 7. REQUESTING APPROVAL FOR COVERED SERVICES. This Article 7 sets forth the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services from us as well as the claim review procedures for benefit determinations adverse to the Covered Person . In processing claims, we review requests for Precertification, Predetermination, and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to det ermine whether provided or proposed to be provided Health Care Services are Covered Services. Health Care Services must be Medically Necessary for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review this Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service or treatment meets our definition of Medical Necessity, or if it is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Contract. (c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review. Post Service Clinical Claims Reviews are done for Health Care Services for which we have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us. (2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertification or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. The Covered Person's Primary Care Physician and all other Participating Providers have received info rmation from us on the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Provider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination reviews (\"Requesting Provider\"). We will work directly with the Requesting Provider regarding such review requests; however, the Covered Person's Designated Representative may act on the Covered Person's behalf throughout the review process. (3) We will utilize our clinical coverage guidelines, including internally developed guidelines, procedures, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to help us determine whether Health Care Services are Covered Services. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions Identified Requesting Approval for Covered Services / 66 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) as appropriate medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically. (4) The Covered Person is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to any documents relevant to your request. To request this information, please contact us at [toll free number]. B. Review Request Categories . (1) Urgent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that in the view of the attending Provider, or any physician with knowledge of the Covered Person's medical condition, could seriously jeopardize the Covered Person's life or health or the Covered Person's ability to regain maximum function, or would subject the Covered Person to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the Urgent Care Claim. (2) Pre-Service - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted before the service, treatment or admission. (3) Concurrent Care - A request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during an ongoing course of treatment or admission. If we have approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or a number of treatments, any reduction or termination by us of such course of treatment before the end of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute a benefit determination adverse to the Covered Person. We will notify the Covered Person sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the Covered Person to appeal and obtain a determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. (4) Post-Service - A request for approval that is made after the service, treatment or admission has occurred. Post-Service review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, accuracy of documentation, or coding or adjudication of payment. C.

Coordination of Benefits / 74 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply throughout this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits . In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Pl ans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the ot her Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other com pany will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaini ng expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions . (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessa ry, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a similar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of servic es through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 75 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) substantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employ er organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without considering the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment . When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Secondary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules : The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 76 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) primary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan. The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whether or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retiree or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) (4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree longer is Primary. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid if it had been Primary. E. Payment of the Benefit When This Plan is Secondary. (1) When this Plan is Secondary, the benefits of this Plan will be reduced so that the total benefits payable under the other Plan and this Plan do not exceed your expenses for an item of service. The difference between the benefit payments that this Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provi ded shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the Covered Person and used by the Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the Claim Determination Period. As each claim is submitted, this Plan will: (a) Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its Plan; (b) Determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Covered Person; and (c) Determine whether there are any unpaid Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. (2) If there is a benefit reserve, the Secondary Plan will use the Covered Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the Claim Determination Period. At the end of the Claim Determination Period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. (3) If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of serv ice by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, Coordination of Benefits shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. F. Payments to others . We may repay to any other person, insurance company or organization the amount which it paid for your Covered Services and which we decide we should have paid. These payments are the same as benefits paid. G. Our Right to Recover Overpayment . In some cases, we may have made payment even though you had coverage under another Plan. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for you to refund to us the amount by which we should have reduced the Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) payment we made. We also have the right to recover the overpayment from the other health benefits plan if we have not already re ceived payment from that other Plan. You agree to sign any document that we deem necessary to help us recover any overpayment. Termination of Coverage / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE A.

Providers shall use their best efforts to render all Medically Necessary and appropriate Health Care Services in a manner compatible with the Covered Person's wishes, insofar as this can be done consistently with the Provider's judgment as to the requirements of proper medical practice. If the Covered Person refuses to follow a recommended treatment or procedure, and the Provider believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, the Covered Person will be so advised. In such case, the Provider and we, as applicable, may determine that neither this Contract nor the Provider shall have any further responsibility to provide care in the case of the Provider, and to arrange care in the case of this Contract for the condition under treatment or any complications thereof. General Provisions / 87 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Child (01/2015) F. Your Medical Records .

If we pay for Health Care Services that, according to the terms of the Contract, should not have been paid, we reserve the right to recover such amounts from whom they have been paid (including the Covered Person or Provider) or any other appropriate party.

Any Covered Services that are covered under both this Contract and Medicare will be paid according to Medicare secondary payor legislation, regulations , and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines.

T. Typographical or Administrative Error . Typographical or administrative errors shall not deprive a Covered Person of benefits. Neither shall any such errors create any rights to additional benefits not in accordance with all of the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the Contract.

Requesting Approval for Covered Services / 65 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) ARTICLE 7. REQUESTING APPROVAL FOR COVERED SERVICES. This Article 7 sets forth the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services from us as well as the claim review procedures for benefit determinations adverse to you . In processing claims, we review requests for Precertification, Predetermination, and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to determine whether provided or proposed to be provided Health Care Services are Covered Services. Health Care Se rvices must be Medically Necessary for Health Care Services to be considered Covered Services. A. Covered Service Review Requests (1) Types of Covered Service Review Requests. (a) Precertification - A required review of a Health Care Service for a benefit coverage determination which must be done prior to the Health Care Service start date. (b) Predetermination - An optional, voluntary prior or concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a Health Care Service. We will review your Contract to determine if there is an Exclusion for the service or treatment requested.

(c) Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A retrospective review (Post- Service) for a benefit coverage determination to decide the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a Health Care Service that did not require Precertification and did not undergo a Predetermination review.

(2) Most Participating Providers know which Health Care Services require Precertification and will get Precertification or ask for Predetermination from us as needed. Your Primary Care Physician and all other Participating Providers have received information from us on the procedures for requesting approvals for Covered Services and are responsible for meeting the requirements under such procedures. Generally, the Participating Pr ovider ordering the service, treatment or admission will contact us to ask for Precertification or Predetermination reviews (\"Requesting Provider\").

Coordination of Benefits / 74 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) ARTICLE 9. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This Article applies only if you also have other health benefits coverage with another Plan. The Definitions contained in this Article apply throughout this Article 9 but do not apply to the rest of the Contract. A. When you have other health benefits . In the event that you are covered by two health insurance contracts, plans or policies (\"Pl ans\") providing similar benefits and you receive a Health Care Service that would be covered by both Plans, we will coordinate benefit payments with any payment made under the ot her Plan. One company will pay its full benefit as the Primary Plan. The other com pany will pay Secondary benefits if necessary to cover all or some of your remaini ng expenses. This prevents duplicate payments and overpayments. B. Definitions . (1) \"Allowable Expense\" means a necessa ry, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi- private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the Plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (2) \"Claim Determination Period\" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract, or any part of a year before the date this Coordination of Benefits provision or a similar provision takes effect. (3) \"Closed Panel Plan\" means a Plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of servic es through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the case of emergency or referral by a panel Covered Person. (4) \"Custodial Parent\" means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. (5) \"Plan\" means any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical treatment: (a) Any group or blanket insurance contract, plan or contract, except that blanket school accident coverage or such coverage offered to Coordination of Benefits / 75 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) substantially similar groups (e.g., Boy Scouts, youth groups) shall not be considered a health insurance contract, plan or contract. (b) Any self-insured or noninsured Plan or any other Plan arranged through an employer, trustee, union, employ er organization or employee benefit organization. (c) Any coverage under governmental programs or any coverage required to be provided by any statute. However, Medicaid and any Plan whose benefits are, by law, excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan shall not be considered health insurance policies. (d) Group or nongroup coverage through Closed Panel Plans or group type contracts. (e) Medical benefits coverage in group and individual mandatory automobile \"no fault\" and traditional \"fault\" type contracts. (6) \"Primary\" or \"Primary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Primary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without considering the other Plan's benefits. (7) \"Secondary\" or \"Secondary Plan\" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If the Plan is Secondary to another Plan, the Plan's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. C. Rules To Determine Payment . When two or more Plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payments are as follows: (1) The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist. (2) If the other Plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then it will be primary. There is one exception: coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. (3) A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefits only when it is Secondary to that other Plan. D. Order of Determination of Benefits Rules : The first of the following rules that describes which Plan pays its benefits before another Plan is the rule to use: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent is Primary, for example as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Coordination of Benefits / 76 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) primary and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is Secondary. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent; and Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a Dependent; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree is Secondary and the other Plan is Primary. (2) Child Covered Under More than One Plan. The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one Plan is: (a) The Primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: (a) The parents are married; (b) The parents are not separated (whether or not they ever have been married); or (c) A court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. (b) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary. (c) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to Claim Determination Periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree. (d) If the parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: (a) The Plan of the Custodial Parent. (b) The Plan of the spouse of the Custodial Parent. (c) The Plan of the non-Custodial Parent. (d) The Plan of the spouse of the non-Custodial Parent. (3) Active or Inactive Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an employee, who is neither laid off nor retired, is Primary. The same would hold true is a person is a Dependent of a person covered as a retiree or an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Coverage provided an individual as a retired worker and as a dependent of an actively working spouse will be determined Section (C)(1) of this Article 9. Coordination of Benefits / 77 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) (4) Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's Dependent) is Primary, and the continuation coverage is Secondary. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, subscriber or retiree longer is Primary. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid if it had been Primary. E. Payment of the Benefit When This Plan is Secondary. (1) When this Plan is Secondary, the benefits of this Plan will be reduced so that the total benefits payable under the other Plan and this Plan do not exceed your expenses for an item of service. The difference between the benefit payments that this Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provi ded shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the Covered Person and used by the Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the Claim Determination Period. As each claim is submitted, this Plan will: (a) Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its Plan; (b) Determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Covered Person; and (c) Determine whether there are any unpaid Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. (2) If there is a benefit reserve, the Secondary Plan will use the Covered Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the Claim Determination Period. At the end of the Claim Determination Period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. (3) If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of serv ice by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, Coordination of Benefits shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. F. Payments to others . We may repay to any other person, insurance company or organization the amount which it paid for your Covered Services and which we decide we should have paid. These payments are the same as benefits paid. G. Our Right to Recover Overpayment . In some cases, we may have made payment even though you had coverage under another Plan. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for you to refund to us the amount by which we should have reduced the Coordination of Benefits / 78 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) payment we made. We also have the right to recover the overpayment from the other health benefits plan if we have not already re ceived payment from that other Plan. You agree to sign any document that we deem necessary to help us recover any overpayment. Termination of Coverage / 79 13164.1-Indiv-Policy-Adult (01/2015) ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE A.

We may develop or adopt standards that describe in more detail when we will make or will not make payments under this Contract. An example of the use of the standards is to determine whether care was Medically Necessary. These standards will not be contrary to the descriptions in this Contract. If you have a question about the standards that apply to a particular benefit, you may contact us and we will explain the standards or send you a copy of the standards. We may also develop administrative rules pertaining to enrollment and other administrative matters. We shall have all the powers necessary or appropriate to enable us to carry out our duties in connection with the administration of this Contract.

The purpose of this rate filing is to establish new product rates that are reasonable relative to the benefits provided and to demonstrate compliance with State of Indiana statutes and provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This memorandu m document s the development of the Individual rates for Indiana University Health Plans, Inc. (IUHP). The rates will be in -force for effective dates on or after January 1, 201 5. These rates will apply to plans offered both On -Exchange and Off - Exchange. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. This information is intended for use by the State of Indiana Department of Insurance, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and their subcontractors to assist in the review of IUHP 's Individual rate filing. However, we recognize that this certification may become a public document. PwC makes no representations or warranties regarding the contents of this memorandum to third parties. Likewise, third parties are instructe d that they are to place no reliance upon this actuarial memorandum prepared for IUHP by PwC that would result in the creation of any duty or liability under any theory of law by PwC or its employees to third parties. These results are actuarial projection s. Actual experience is likely to differ for a number of reasons, including population changes, claims experience, and random deviations from assumptions. Company Identifying Information Company Legal Name: Indiana University Health Plan s, Inc . State: The State of Indiana has regulatory authority over these policies HIOS Issuer ID: 33380 Market: Individual Effective Date: January 1, 201 5 Company Contact Information Primary Contact Name: Eric Neuville , Vice President Product Development and Innovation Prima ry Contact T elephone Number: (31 7) 963-1835 Primary Contact Email Address: eneuville@iuhealth.o rg 4 Certifying Actuary Contact Information Primary Contact Robert Macagnano, PwC Primary Contact Telephone Contact Email Address: robert.macagnano@us.pwc.com Benefit Summary IUHP will be offering three Bronze, three Silver, and one Gold HMO products. A summary of the major provisions of each plan are provided in Appendix A. Premium Guarantee Provision Premiums are guaranteed not to change through December 31, 201 5. Renewability The policy is renewable by paying the applicable renewal premiums unless the policyholder no longer meets th e eligibility requirements of the policy or the company decides not to renew all the policies in the state. Applicability The rates will apply to new business. Subsequent renewal business will be subject to rates filed for our 201 6 rate development. Premiu m Modalization Premiums will be collected only on a monthly basis. Trend Assumption Rates are effective for calendar year 201 5. Trend assumptions will be developed for future rating periods based on developing experience, and anticipated changes in provid er reimbursement. 2) Proposed Rate Increase (s) This is a new filing therefore no rate increase assumption is included in this filing. Subsequent rate increases beginning with effective dates of January 1, 201 6 will be filed in the future. 3) Experience Pe riod Premium and Claims Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 5 4) Benefit Categories The methodology used to det ermine benefit categories in Worksheet 1, Section II of the Unified Rate Review Template is as follows: Inpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for medical, surgical, maternity, mental health and substance abuse, skilled nursing, and o ther services provided in an inpatient facility setting and billed by the facility. Outpatient Hospital: Includes non -capitated facility services for surgery, emergency room, lab, radiology, therapy, observation, and other services provided in an outpatien t facility setting and billed by the facility. Professional: Includes non -capitated primary care, specialist, therapy, the professional component of laboratory and radiology, and other professional services, other than hospital based professionals whose pa yments are included in facility fees. Other Medical: Includes non -capitated ambulance, home health care, DME, prosthetics, supplies, and other services. Capitation: Includes capitated services for pediatric vision benefits . Prescription Drug: Includes drug s dispensed by a pharmacy and rebates received from drug manufacturers. 5) Projection Factors Not applicable. This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 6) Credibility Manual Rate Development The PwC Rating Model was used as the basis to develop the manual rates. Our model was developed using two primary sources: Commercial Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases for U.S. member s and providers. The database contains full enrollment and claims information with standard medical coding which allows for cost and utilization information by service category (inpatient, outpatient hospital, hospice, home health, professional, prescript ion drugs, etc.). The database consists of the experience from 53 million Commercial eligible participants. The data can be extracted down to the member's state and MSA level. For the Indiana Commercial market, there were approximately 1.5 million expo sed life years' worth of data crossing all ages, genders and employment statuses (active, COBRA, disabled and retired). Nationwide, the databases have over 100 unique data contributors so it is not skewed to any one payer. OptumInsight (Optum) Comprehens ive Pricing Model \u00ae provides benchmark data and pricing capabilities for Commercial health plans. It factors in health plan features such as 6 deductibles, copays, out -of-pocket maximums, covered services, etc. The model uses normative data and benefit detail s to arrive at an allowed cost per member per month . The normative benchmarking utilization metrics within the model are developed from Optum's database of Commercial (under 65) health plan experience of approximately 20 million life years . The model exper ience was adjusted to reflect the Indiana marketplace. Since both the Truven and Optum data sources represent fully -completed calendar year 2012 claims, allowed costs were trended to the midpoint of calendar year 2015 using an annual trend rate of 7.4%. The allowed costs component of the manual rates was increased by 2% to account for expected changes in covered benefits due to the Essential Health Benefits ( EHB) requirements . The following is not an all inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental heal th and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the sta te, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting costs of pediatric coverage. The manual rates were increased by 1 5% to reflect the entrance of approximately 7,000 Medicaid Spend -Down beneficiaries into the Indiana Health Insurance E xchange. This adjustment was based on the assumption that IUHP's penetration of the Medicaid Spend -Down population would be similar to their assumed penetration of the general population. Expenditure information for the Medicaid Spend -Down p opulation was provided by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration and contained in the April 21, 2014 study \"Spend Down Exchange Impact: Transition to the Indiana Health Insurance Exchange\" performed by Milliman, Inc. In addition, preliminary estimates provided by the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) during their May 2, 2014 Weekly ACA Rate & Form Filing Call Session indicate d that the inclusion of this population would increase premiums by 5% - 15%. We have been informed by the IDOI tha t additional information pertaining to this population will be made available. We reserve the right to revise our filing to reflect this data subsequent to this filing. There will also be new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsure d. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, t here may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. Pent up demand has been shown to increase costs in the first year of enrollment for those previo usly uninsured. Based on analysis of programs serving a similar population, it appears that the claims are higher in the first six to 12 months that an individual is newly insured. After this initial period, the claims experience tends to revert to the ave rage level for the market. The total effect is uncertain and may be offset by some new enrollees having reduced utilization as they may not fully 7 understand new or increased coverage. Therefore, we have included an adjustment within our manual rate develop ment for pent up demand of 5 .0%. The following adjustments were made to calibrate the pricing model to the expected population: Rating region Expected demographics Expected morbidity Contractual Agreements with healthcare providers Expected utilization man agement savings Benefit plan designs Some benefits will be reimbursed under a capitation arrangement. The provider reimbursement adjustment to the pricing model was developed to account for the cost of capitated services. The manual rates were also adjuste d upward by a factor of 1.00 5 to account for the likelihood that some enrollees may not pay their premiums due during the first month of the 90 -day grace period. This was calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment on one -twelfth of the annual premium due for 80% of the Individual population (those eligible for Advance Payments of a Premium Tax Credit). The amount of premium at risk is only on the portion that IUHP does not receive via direct subsidy, estimated to be 50% (0.15 x 1/12 x 0.80 x 0.50 = 0.005 ). The 15% represents our assumption regarding the small portion of enrollees that we believe will knowingly take advantage of the grace period provision. The 80% represents the portion of enrollees in the 2015 Individual marketplace that we assume will b e eligible for premium subsidies based on income level. On May 1, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that as of April 19, 2014, 89% of those enrolled in the Indiana exchange were eligible for federal assistance. Our assumption is tha t this percentage will decrease during 2015. 7) Credibility of Experience IUHP has not previously operated in the individual market. As a result the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection f actors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 8) Paid to Allowed Rat io The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT calculates the PMPM costs on both an allowed and paid basis. The \"Paid to Allowed Average Factor in Projection Period \" shown on Worksheet 1, Section III of the URRT is developed by membership -weighted EHB paid claims divided by membership -weighted EHB allowed claims of each plan . The projected membership by plan is sho wn in Worksheet 2, Section II. The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated u sing the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule (2015 Final Payment Notice). 8 9) Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM The Risk Adjustment program tra nsfers funds from lower risk plans to higher risk plans in the Non - Grandfathered Individual and Small Group market. At this time, IUHP is assuming the risk for the plans in this filing are no better or worse than other plans in the market, resulting in no estimated risk transfer value . Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed for 2015. Projected ACA Reinsurance Recoveries Net of Reinsurance Premium (Individual Market and Combined Markets Only) The Federal transitional reinsurance program is a temporary risk mitigation program expected to reduce costs for insurance issuers. The 201 5 reinsurance program has an attachment point of $70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. The Department of Health and Human Services will reimburs e insurance issuers 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. Allowed claims were reduced by 7.0% to account for the anticipated 2015 reimbursements from this temporary program. This estimate was de veloped using projected p aid claims, a claims probability distribution calibrated to the expected average claim levels for the 2015 Individual market, and the federal program guidelines summarized above. The expected reinsurance reimbursements of $51.43 PMPM are allocated proporti onally by plan based on allowed claims. Applying the 2015 transitional reinsurance charge of $3.67 PMPM yields a net reinsurance cost of $47.76 PMPM. Projected Net Cost of Private Reinsurance The projected net cost of private reinsurance for 2015 is $0.00 PMPM since IUHP does not intend to purchase private reinsurance. 10) Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk Administrative Expense Load IUHP developed their expected administrative expenses based on : a) current administrative expenses for their Medicare line of business adjusting for any expected differences for their Commercial products , and b) a review of 2014 Rate Filings for Individual Exchange products . A summary of IUHP's assumptions is as follows: Administrative expenses (excluding Sales and Market ing expenses ): 10.50% of premium Sales and Marketing expenses (including c ommissions ): 3.70% of premium These administrative expenses are allocated proportionally by plan. Quality Improvement Expenses At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determi ne the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives . Therefore, no explicit Quality Improvement expenses were assumed. 9 Profit & Risk Margin The proposed rates reflect a profit & risk margin of 3.0% of premium . This load was applied to all products and plans. Taxes and Fees A summary of the assumed taxes and fees are summarized below: PMPM Basis Transitional reinsurance charge: $3.67 PMPM ($44.00 per member per year) PM PM PCORI fee: $0.17 PMPM ($2.00 per member per year) Percentage of Premium Basis Health insurance exchange fee: 3.15% of premium reflecting IUHP's assumption that 90% of their expected 2015 business will be sold through the exchange ACA issuer fee: IUHP w ill not be subject to this fee for 2015 Premium tax: 1.30% of premium 11) Projected Loss Ratio The overall projected medical loss ratio for 2015 is 82. 5%. Th is calculation exclude s regulatory fees and taxes. At the time of this filing, IUHP was unable to determine the proportion of their administrative expenses attributable to approved Quality Improvement initiatives. As a result, we have not included an adjustment in the MLR calculation for these expenses. It is IUHP's intent to identify their Quality Improvement expenses for purposes of submitting their MLR -related filings and calculating related rebates , if any. The table below shows the calculation. a) Incurred Claims Net of Cost Sharing $501.10 b) Transitional Reinsurance Reimbursement ($51.43 ) c) Reinsurance Charge $3.67 d) Quality Improvement Expenses $0.00 e) Worksheet 1 Projected Incurred Claims ( a+b+c +d) $453.34 f) Administrative Expenses $82.21 g) Profit & Risk Margin $17.37 h) Regulatory Taxes and Fees (excluding reinsurance charge) $26.01 i) Gross Premium ( e+f+g+h) $578.92 j) Medical Loss Ratio ( e/(i-c-h)) 82.5% 10 12) Single Risk Pool IUHP has not previously operated in the Individual market and thus does not have any claims experience to develop its own Single Risk Pool . This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. Please see the Credibility Manual Rate Development section for details regarding the rate development process. 13) Index Rate This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, th us the Index Rate for the Experience Period has been left blank . The Index Rate of $7 34.69 for the 2015 Projection Period represents the overall projected allowed costs PMPM for providing Essential Health Benefits for the Single Risk Pool . Since this is a new product , the index rate was developed based on a manual rate as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section. The Index Rate will remain unchanged until a renewal filing effective January 1, 201 6. 14) Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market -wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market -wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowable under these rules: Federal reinsurance program adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Risk adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Exchange user fee adjustment (market -wide adjustment) Similar to the Index Rate, the Market Adjusted Index Rate reflects the average demog raphic characteristics of the Single R isk Pool. In other words, the Market Adjusted Index Rate is not calibrated. The development of the Federal reinsurance program and risk adjustments was described above in the Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance section. T he development of the Exchange user fee adjustment was described above in the Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section. Index Rate $734.69 Reinsurance Reimbursements (7.0% of Allowed Claims - Index Rate) ($51.4 3) Reinsurance Premiums $ 3.67 Risk Adjustment $ 0.00 Exchange user fee (3.15% of average premium for Single Risk Pool) $ 18.24 Market Adjusted Index Rate $705.17 11 15) Plan Adjusted Index Rate s The Plan Adjusted Index Rates are included in Worksheet 2 , Section IV of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template in 2015. These Plan Adjusted Index Rates have been adjusted to remove the portion of the allowed cost that is expected to be recouped through the tobacco surcharge. The average tobacco surcharge for the Single Risk Pool is approximately 1. 4%. The Plan Adjusted Index Rates reflect the average demographic characteristics of the Single Risk Pool. In other words, the Plan Adjusted Index Rate s are not calibrated. The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the issuer Market Adjusted Index Rate adjusted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). The following adjustments are allowable under these rules: Actuarial value and cost sharing adjustm ent (plan adjustment) Provider network, delivery system and utilization management adjustment (plan adjustment) Adjustment for benefits in addition to the EHBs (plan adjustment) Impact of specific eligibility categories for the catastrophic plan (plan adju stment ) Adjustment for distribution and administrative costs (plan adjustment) Only the a ctuarial value and cost sharing & distribution and administrative costs adjustments were applicable to IUHP. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing Adjustment This adjustmen t includes three components: Removal of tobacco surcharge - the average tobacco surcharge factor was applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool Benefit richness utilization adjustments - The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. Benefit richness utilization adjustments were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge). These adjustments were based on the values published in the Federal Register payme nt notice, normalized to the Silver plan level. The adjustments for each metallic tier are as follows: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.00 / 1.00 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 Cost Sharing - The pricing model that developed the AV pricing values shown in Worksheet 2 of the URRT was used to calculate the cost sharing percentage for each plan. These cost sharing percentages were applied to the average allowed costs for the Single Risk Pool (after removing the impact of the tobacco surcharge a nd applying the benefit richness utilization adjustments). The estimated Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies were calculated using the new advance payment methodology which was finalized in the 2015 HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rul e (2015 Final Payment Notice). 12 Adjustment for Distribution and Administra tive Costs Fixed and variable costs as described in the Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk section were included in this adjustment as follows: Fixed costs: Risk adjustment user and PCORI fees Variable costs (% of premium): Administrative expenses, sales & marketing expenses, profit & risk margin, and premium taxes. The percentages applied did not vary by plan. Appendix D shows the development of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 16) Calibration The Plan Adjusted Index Rates (which are based on the Single Risk Pool) were calibrated to apply the allowable rating factors in order to calculate Consumer Adjusted Premium Rates. The calibration by age and geography is described below. Age Curve Calibration The methodology employed in the calculation of the average age and the calibration to the age curve complies with the standard age curve methodology and conforms with the rating rules specified in 45 CFR 147.102. The expected membership distribution by age band was based upon the Indiana Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. A uniform distribution within each age band was also assumed. A weighted average age facto r of 1.685 for the Single Risk Pool was also determined by applying th e membership distribution to the Federal age curve. This represents a rounded weighted average age of 49. Appendix C shows the development of the weighted average age factor. The Plan I ndex Rates were calibrated by dividing by 1.706 which represents the standard age factor of the rounded weighted average age of 49 . This calibration factor does not vary by plan. Geograph ic Factor Calibration A geographic factor calibration was not requir ed since the weighted average of the geographic factors equals 1.0. The Geographic (rating area) factors were developed based upon the network characteristics for unit cost and utilization management in each of the established rating areas. Based upon the expected distribution of enrolment by area, the area factors reflect the Single Risk Pool results consistent with the URRT. Appendix D shows how the calibration adjustments were applied to the Plan Adjusted Index Rates. 17) Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate Development The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final premium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual, family, or small employer group utilizing the rating and premium adjustments as articulated in the applicable Market Reform Rating Rules. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate 13 is developed by calibrating the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve as described above, calibrating for geography if necessary, and applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. The following a djustments are allowable under this rule: Whether the plan coverage covers an individual or family (issuers must cover any eligible individual and/or eligible family that requests coverage per the guaranteed issue requirement of the ACA); this is further c larified in regulation that the premium for family coverage is determined by summing the premiums for each individual family member, provided at most three child dependents under age 21 are taken into account; this adjustment does not result in a separate rating factor Rating area Age - reflecting the applicable age curve Tobacco status The rating factors (shown in Appendix C) are applied at an individual level and added together to calculate the family rate , with the exception that no more than 3 covered c hildren under the age of 21 are charged a rate . Adjustment for family size is in accordance with Federal rules. The example s in Appendix E show how the rating factors are applied to the calibrated Plan Adjusted Index Rate. 18) AV Metal Values The Federal AV calculator was used without any modifications to generate the Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the URRT . Please refer to Appendix F for screen shots showing the AV calculations for each plan. 19) AV Pricing Values The Silver Value plan was selec ted as the fixed reference plan and serves as the basis for the AV Pricing Values. Please refer to Appendix C for the AV Pricing Values for each plan which are also included in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT. The AV Pricing Value for each plan reflects the relative impact of the plan's cost -sharing amounts , expected impact o n enrollee utilization due to benefit richness (excluding impact of morbidity), expected additional cost of non -EHB, and administrative expenses (excluding health insurance exchange user fees). This is a new filing based on manual rate projections. IUHP did not have any base period experience, thus the PwC Rating Model as described above in the Credibility Manual Rate Development section was used to develop the benefit relativities fo r the AV Pricing Values. 20) Membership Projections Membership projections were based on market penetration assumptions provided by IUHP. These assumptions reflected the uninsured and individual market population s by county, income level, and other chara cteristics such as the presence of IUHP facilities and delivery system within a given county . The expected membership distribution by age band and metallic tier was based upon the Indiana 14 Exchange enrollment as of April 19, 2014 reported by the Department of Health and Human Services on May 1, 2014. For the Silver plans, the portion of the projected enrollment that will be eligible for CSR subsidies at each subsidy level was based on the income level detail in the market penetration analysis provided by IU HP. Summaries of the projected membership by age, metallic tier, and CSR subsidy level are shown in Appendix B. 21) Terminated Products Not applicable. IUHP does not currently have Individual plans in the State of Indiana. 22) Plan Type All plans liste d types in Worksheet 2, Section I of the URRT correctly describe IUHP's plans as \"HMO\" . 23) Warning Alerts Two warnings were generated in the URRT, both of which were due to adjustments to the allowed costs between Worksheet 1 and Worksheet 2. The first adjustment was the removal of the impact of the tobacco surcharge of 1.4% as required in the reporting of the Plan Adjusted Index Rates and related items in Worksheet 2.
