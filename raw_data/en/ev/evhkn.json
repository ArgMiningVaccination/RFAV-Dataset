I'm not having to drink as much coffee or nap during the day. It's great knowing that I'm actually absorbing the vitamins my body needs. Great value. When I consistently take this once a week, my B12 levels are at the very high end of the healthy range. I like that it doesn't contain alcohol, non-GMO, sugar, gluten and dairy free. All natural! A product that is possibly allergy free. I have used this product for over 6 months. This product is pricey BUT the quality is unmatched. Helps me with my energy levels, immune system and my memory. You get lots of benefits from it. Good product to use as recommended and tastes good! I've never taken supplements in liquid drop form before (I prefer gummies), and I was pleasantly surprised how quick and easy it is. 15 drops daily sounds like a lot on paper, but really it's a matter of seconds to take them. I can't speak to seeing any of the advertised effects of these drops, as it's only been a few days, but so far I'm enjoying the product and will continue to use them. It really absorbs well. Vit b-12 supplements usually don't agree with me most of the time but this doesn't make me sick and gives me energy. My body can easily tell the difference since I am not experiencing any side effects. I am happy now that I've found a products that suits my body. "}
