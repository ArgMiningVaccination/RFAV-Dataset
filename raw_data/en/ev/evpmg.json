Background Wild rue (P. harmala) occurrence and classification Medicinal plants have been used for many years as remedies for both human and animal ailments [ [1](#ref-CR1), [2](#ref-CR2), [3](#ref-CR3), [4](#ref-CR4), [5](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR5)]. Aromatic and medicinal plants as the key source of complementary and alternative medicine have been recently bring many hopes in alleviating of symptomatology and curing associated with so many diseases [ [6](#ref-CR6), [7](#ref-CR7), [8](#ref-CR8), [9](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR9)]. P. harmala, commonly called Esfand, Wild rue, Syrian rue, African rue, is a plant of the family Nitrariaceae [ [10](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR10)]. This plant is native from the eastern Iranian region west to India [ [11](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR11)]. P. harmala is a traditional medicinal plant which is used for many purposes, the aim of this review is to survey on some health benefits of this traditional medicinal plant. Scientific classification of harmal is shown in Table [1](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#Tab1). It is considered as one of the most important medicinal plant in Iranian traditional medicine, which has various benefits such as anti infection, anti inflammation, anti tumor and anti parasite. This important multipurpose medicinal plant has many phytochemical features, and contains a number of active alkaloids, particularly beta-carbolines such as harmalol, harmaline, and harmine. The plant is perennial which can grow to approximate 0.8 m tall, and the root can reach a depth of up to 6 m [ [12](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR12)]. This perennial herbaceous plant, branched into 5-13 stems, the leaves are palmatisected into 3-5 linear lobes which are 3-6 cms long and 1.5-3.0 mm wide. Flowers arise by 1-3 on apexes of branches which bear whitish-yellow petals in color, and the fruits are globular capsule with 3 chambers, 0.9-1.3 cm in diameter and containing 35-45 angular blackish seeds. Various parts of P. harmala (a) Leaves and Flowers, (b) Fruit, (c) Seeds are shown in Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#Fig1). P. harmala Nutritional Composition and Chemical Constituents The fruits digestive, hallucinogenic, diuretic, antipyretic, [ [13](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR13), [14](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR14)]. The leaves used in the treatment of asthma, colic, dysmenorrhea, hiccups, neuralgia, hysteria and rheumatism [ [15](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR15)]. Harmine was originally isolated from seeds of P. harmala in 1847 having a core indole structure and a pyridine ring [ [16](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR16)]. Faskhutdinov et al. [ [17](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR17)] isolated two alkaloids, 7-O-(2-O-rhamnosyl-2-O-glucosylglucoside), and the glycoflavone 2-O-rhanmosyl-2-O-glucosylcytisoside were found in the aerial parts of P. harmala [ [18](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR18)]. Massoud et al. [ [19](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR19)] expressed that present are harmaline, harmine, harmalol, and peganine. Lamchouri et al. [ [20](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR20)] also indicated that harmaline, the active principle of the seeds of P. harmala and its derivatives cause visual troubles, agitation, delirium, loss of coordination and it can produce paralysis at high doses. Faridi et al. [ [21](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR21)] showed that the major components of P. harmala smoke were -pinene (60.4 %), limonene (6.4 %0 and styrene (4.2 %) and those of the volatile oil were -pinene (72.6 %), trans-verbenole (3.9 %) and sabinene (2.6 %). Herraiz et al. [ [22](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR22)] stated that psychopharmacological and toxicological characteristics of P. harmala were attributed to quinazoline and -carboline alkaloids. They found three major quinazoline alkaloids, namely, peganine which appeared in flowers and leaves in high levels, high amounts of deoxypeganine and peganine which found in immature and green fruits, and high amounts of deoxypeganine and peganine which discovered in immature and green fruits, and also peganine and peganine glycoside accumulated in high amount in dry seeds, while roots and stems contained low amount of quinazolines. Alkaloids of Esfand can form dangerous reaction screening in the leaves presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, glycosides, terpenoids and steroids anthraquinone. Asgarpanah and Ramezanloo [ [26](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR26)] and Fatma et al. [ [27](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR27)] announced that the major alkaloids detected and quantified from the intensity of the fluorescence of P. harmala were harmine, harmaline, 2.3.5.6.7.8-hexahydro-9-amino-; Vasicinone (1H-Pyrrolo[2.1-b]quinazolin-9-one,3-hydroxy-2.3-dihydro) and harmine were isolated from cultivated plant of P. harmala. Farouk et al. [ [29](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR29)] and Khan et structures of harmala alkaloids are shown in Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#Fig1). Saturated fatty acids and their derivatives composition of P. harmala are tetradecanoic acid, 12-Methyl and octadecanoic acid, and unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives composition are (E)-9-dodecenoic acid, (Z)-9-Hexadecenoic acid, (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid and (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid [ [31](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR31), [32](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR32)]. Non-fatty acids compounds composition John [ [35](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR35)] concluded that the methanolic fraction of P. harmala found to be most effective against all tested microorganisms. Wang et al. [ [36](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR36)] discovered that methanol extracts from the seeds of P. harmala, namely, (S)-vasicinone-1-O--d-glucopyranoise and (S)-vasicinone exhibited moderate inhibitory activity. Phytochemicals detected in the crude extracts of P. are terpenoids and P. harmala H-NMR [40](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR40)]. Medicinal Uses and Potential Health Benefits in Traditional Medicine and Modern Medicine Industry The most important therapeutic effects of P. harmala potential, and pesticide effects [ [41](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR41), [42](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR42)]. The most important traditional uses of P. harmala are cardiovascular, gasterointestinal, nervous, endocrine, neoplasm and tumors, pain relieving, diabetes, respiratory diseases, disinfectant, anti-pyretic, skin and hair, ulcers, rheumatism, arthritis and inflammation [ [43](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR43), [44](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#ref-CR44)].

The most important health benefits of P. harmala are shown in Fig. [2](/articles/10.1186/s40816-021-00255-7#Fig2). Conclusions P. harmala is a perennial herbaceous, glabrous plant mainly found in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. The plant is not usually grazed by animals due to its bitter taste. Its seeds showed that alkaloids belonging to the -carboline family such as harmine, harmaline, harman, harmol and harmalol are responsible or a wide range of pharmacological effects. The main compounds from P. harmala effect, cancer effect, hepatoprotective effect, hypoglycemic effect, antibacterial effect, pesticide effect, antitumor effect, antinociceptive effects, haemosporidian infections effect and different unknown beneficial properties. This review article suggests the important potential of P. harmala to be employed in both new western and eastern therapeutic drugs. This review article emphasizes on the need of widespread researches and studies for covering the supplementary information and knowledge on the importance of medicinal crops. This review also suggests more evidences for other researchers to use P. harmala as an ancient efficacious natural drug. Availability of data and materials Not applicable.
