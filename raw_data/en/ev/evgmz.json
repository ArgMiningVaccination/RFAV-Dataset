It is characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin patches that can be red, scaly, and sometimes ooze or bleed. While there is no known cure for eczema, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a holistic approach that can help alleviate symptoms and prevent recurrences. TCM is a system of healthcare that has been used for thousands of years in China and other parts of Asia. It is based on the concept of Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), which is the life force energy that flows through the body. According to TCM theory, when Qi is imbalanced or blocked, it can lead to disease and illness. Therefore, the goal of TCM is to restore balance and harmony to the body, mind, and spirit. In TCM, eczema is believed to be caused by a combination of external factors such as dryness, wind, and heat, as well as internal imbalances such as weak digestion, stress, and emotional disturbances. TCM practitioners will diagnose eczema based on a combination of symptoms, medical history, and physical examination. They may also use diagnostic tools such as tongue and pulse diagnosis to assess the overall health of the patient. Treatment for eczema in TCM may involve a combination of acupuncture, herbal medicine, dietary therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate Qi flow and promote healing. Herbal medicine may include topical or oral preparations made from a variety of herbs that have anti- inflammatory and immune-boosting properties. Dietary therapy is an essential component of TCM treatment for eczema. TCM practitioners believe that certain foods can exacerbate eczema symptoms, such as spicy or greasy foods, alcohol, and dairy products. On the other hand, foods that nourish the blood calm the mind, and support digestion can help alleviate eczema symptoms. These may include foods such as green leafy vegetables, fish, and whole grains.Lifestyle modifications may also be recommended by TCM practitioners to help manage eczema. These may include stress reduction techniques such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi, as well as avoiding environmental triggers such as harsh soaps, detergents, and fragrances. Overall, TCM offers a holistic approach to the management of eczema that addresses the root cause of the condition rather than just the symptoms. By restoring balance and harmony to the body, TCM can help alleviate eczema symptoms and prevent recurrences.
