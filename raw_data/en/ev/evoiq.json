WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT: Whether there is a link between the traditional vaccine schedule and autism, and if administering vaccines over a longer period of time reduces instances of autism. ANALYSIS: The long-debated topic of vaccines' connection to autism made an appearance at CNN's GOP debate, sparking disagreement between two leading candidates and strong reactions from the medical community. It began when Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, responded to a question about Trump's assertion that there is a link between vaccines and autism. Carson said although there is no correlation between the two, doctors and parents should still use discretion when choosing vaccines. Trump responded, saying autism is an \"epidemic\" that's \"out of control.\" He cited a personal story about a co-worker whose 2 1/2-year-old came down with a \"tremendous fever\" after being vaccinated and was later diagnosed with autism, he said. Trump's comments set off a storm of news releases from medical organizations trying to set the record straight. \"Despite a wealth of scientific evidence debunking any link between autism and vaccinations, tonight's Republican primary debate featured prominent commentary from a leading candidate repeating inaccurate information suggesting a link,\" wrote the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a group that focuses on people with autism advocating for themselves. \"Claims that vaccines are linked to autism or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature,\" wrote the American Academy of Pediatrics, a professional membership organization for pediatric doctors. \"There is no 'alternative' immunization schedule. Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease for a longer period of time; it does not make vaccinating safer.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published a summary sheet listing 10 medical studies that show no link between autism and vaccines or a common vaccine preservative. The studies varied in location and method, with one following more than 500,000 children in Denmark over seven years to study the effects of the MMR vaccine, while another looked for connections between vaccinations and autism in Atlanta children. Additionally, the center said in an e-mail statement that the only side effects of getting multiple vaccines at once, fevers and febrile seizures, are temporary and mild. \"Scientific data show that getting several vaccines at the same time does not cause any chronic health problems,\" the statement read. \"... When every new vaccine is licensed, it has been tested along with the vaccines already recommended for a particular aged child.\" The idea of alternative vaccination schedules was popularized by Dr. Robert Sears in his 2007 book \"The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for your Child,\" in which he proposes two schedules that depart from traditional recommendations. In a phone interview with AZ Fact Check, Sears acknowledged there is no science to support the theory that spacing out vaccines is safer for children, but he said it's an effective tactic for increasing vaccination rates by convincing nervous parents to ease into the idea. \"(Vaccines are) a complicated medical process with both risks and benefits that everyone is entitled to make a free choice on,\" he said. \"It was exciting to see the Republicans acknowledge at least that aspect.\" Sears, who is now the founder of the non-profit Immunity Education Group, said he doesn't believe there is a correlation between vaccines and autism, but parents should still have discretion over their children's medical care, perhaps delaying \"less important\" vaccines. But Dr. Karen Lewis, medical director for Arizona Department of Health Services' immunization program, said all vaccines are crucial and postponing receiving them poses a greater threat to children's health. \"A more spaced-out immunization schedule leaves the child defenseless for a longer time,\" said Lewis, who was a pediatric doctor specializing in infectious diseases for 15 years. \"There are many infections that can cause severe disease, hospitalization, and death and that's why we give children immunizations so early.\" Lewis said just because a disease is considered rare in the U.S. doesn't mean there's not a risk. \"I've seen too many children die in infancy or get brain damaged from bacterial meningitis or die from pneumonia to want to delay any vaccine,\" she said. Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. BOTTOM LINE: Trump's claim is unsupported by scientific data and medical opinions. Even the originator of the delayed vaccine schedule acknowledges there is no known medical benefit of spacing out vaccines. The theory that vaccines cause autism has been widely debunked by many studies.
