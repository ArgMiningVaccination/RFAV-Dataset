A check off box on a prescription form is not acceptable certification and will be denied or subject to recoupment . For a telephone prescription requesting brand name necessary by the prescriber, the pharmacist shall indicate on the face of the prescription that a brand name was requested by the prescriber. The pharmacist must also indicate the time o f day the telephone order was taken on the face of the prescription. Claims submitted with a \"Dispense As Written = 2\" ( DAW2 ) will return a patient copay that includes the difference in price between the brand name drug and the generic equivalent.

Flavoring agents are not considered covered outpatient drugs and are not covered when submitted with a compound claim. Compound claims must be submitted using NCDP D Compound Claim standards. If a compound contains a brand ingredient the brand copay will apply. Day Supply Unless otherwise noted the maximum day supply allowed under Medicaid is 34 days. Products with unique package sizes (ex. creams, liquids, etc) may be subject to a day supply limit less than 34. Certain generic maintenance medications are eligible for 90 -day fills after a recipient has established compliance and tolerability by filling a prescription for the same drug and strength for three 30 -day fi lls withing the previous 100 days.

Patients with a cancer or terminal diagnosis on record with South Dakota Medicaid are exempt from all criteria except the refill threshold. Patients new to Medicaid may not have a drug or diagnosis history with Medicaid.

Preferred Drug List South Dakota Medicaid has a limited preferred drug list (PDL). The PDL can be found here. If a drug is not listed on the PDL that means it is not subjec t to the PDL. For example, ACE Inhibitors are not listed on the PDL. South Dakota Medicaid does not restrict which ACE Inhibitor can be prescribed. A pharmacy may dispense any ACE Inhibitor that is FDA approved and that has a federal rebate agreement. All drugs, whether on the PDL or not, may be subject to prior authorization criteria (PA). Drugs requiring PA can be found here. SOUTH DAKOTA MEDICAID BILLING AND POLICY MANUAL Pharmacy Services UPDATED June 23 PAGE | 5 Prior Authorizations Prior authorizations ( PAs) are processed by a contracted vendor. Most PA requests are adjudicated within 72 hours. A \"clean\" request is often adjudicated in less than 24 hours. A PA will have an end date, typically one year, after which a new PA must be submitted. PAs are not open ended. PAs will not be backdated, a prescription filled prior to a PA being obtained is the responsibility of the patient. Prior authorization form s are accessible on the South Dakota Medicaid Pharmacy Website . Emergency Fill An emergency claim of up to five days fill is allowed in cases where a delay in seeking a PA would negatively impact patient care and a PA cannot be obtained due to circumstances beyond the control of the pharmacy or patient (ex. holiday, prescriber not available). Approval of the five -day supply does not guarantee the PA will ultimately be approved. The pharmacy must submit the appropriate code in the Level of Service field (418 -DI). Refer to the South Dakota Medicaid Payer Sheets for code selection. Non -emergency claims subm itted with the emergency code are subject to recoupment . Prenatal Vitamins Prenatal vitamins are covered for pregnancy only. Claims submitted for non -pregnan t women may be subject to recovery.

South Dakota Medicaid does not pay for any prescription without an explicit request from a recipient or the recipient's responsible party, such as a care giver, for each refilling event. The pharmacy provider shall not contact the recipient in an effort to initiate a refill unless it is part of a good faith clinical effort to assess the recipient's medication regimen. The possession, by a provider, of a pre scription with remaining refills authorized does not in itself constitute a request to refill the prescription. Recipients or providers cannot waive the explicit refill request and enroll in an electronic automatic refill program. Any prescriptions filled without a request from a recipient or their responsible party may be subject to reco upment . Any pharmacy provider who pursues a policy that includes filling prescriptions on a regular date or any type of cyclical procedure may be subject to audit, claim re coupment or possible suspension or termination of their provider agreement. Claim Denials Claims denied for a non -covered product cannot be overridden. DESI Drugs The Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) was a program begun by the Food and Drug Admini stration (FDA) in the 1960s after the Kefauver -Harris Drug Control Act, which was passed in 1962, requiring all drugs be efficacious as well as safe. Drugs with a DESI designation are not covered by South Dakota Medicaid. Glucometers Glucometers are not c overed under the pharmacy benefit.

Physician administered drugs dispensed using the POS system are subject to recoupment. Vacation Supply Vacation supplies are not covered. Prescriptions filled as a vacation s upply are subject to recoupment. DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) requires that all state Medicaid programs include a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) program. The primary goal of DUR is to enhance and improve the quality of pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes by encouraging optimal drug use. The DUR program strives to ensure that prescribed medications are appropriate, medically necessary, and are not likely to result in adverse medical outcomes. The Medicaid DUR program includes both prospective and retrospective DUR activities. The retrospective DUR program involves reviews of patient drug history profiles generated from Medicaid paid claims data. The reviews are consistent with subsec tion 1927 of the Social Security Act and includes reviews for: Therapeutic appropriateness Overutilization and underutilization Therapeutic duplication Drug -disease contraindications Drug -drug interactions Incorrect dosage or duration of therapy Clinical a buse/misuse Prospective DUR requires the pharmacy provider to screen for drug therapy problems at point - of-sale or distribution before each prescription is filled or dispensed. In compliance with OBRA 90 DUR requirements, pharmacy providers must screen eac h prescription for certain therapeutic problems using the OBRA 90 defined standards. The pharmacy provider's prospective DUR program must be based upon predetermined standards, consistent with subsection 1927 of the Social Security Act.
