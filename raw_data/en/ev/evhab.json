This report aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a health technology assessment (HTA) of lon g- term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with multiple sclerosis (MS) , or with Parkinson's disease (PD) based on clinical, economic, legal, social, ethical and organisational data identified during the scoping phase. The comparison of interest to the policy question is long-term physiotherapy compared to short -term physiotherapy. Supplementary c omparisons between long- term physiotherapy and other comparators (i.e. placebo, sham, usual care and best possible care) were also sought. A literature search was conducted in seven biomedical databases and supplemented with searches of HTA databases and specialty websites. From the 14,878 search results , no systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials were identified that investigated the policy question (i.e. long versus short - term physiotherapy) . Twelve system atic reviews comparing long- term physiotherapy to any other long-term comparator were identified , of which 10 were conducted in stroke and 2 were in PD; no reviews on long- term physiotherapy for MS were identified. The searches also identified 13 social, 2 ethical and 3 organisational -related studies. Thirteen existing economic evaluations broadly matching the PICO criteria were identified; however, their applicability to the Swiss context was limited. No legal studies were identified. There is currently no available data to undertake an HTA on the effectiveness, safety and cost - effectiveness of long- term physiotherapy compared to short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS or PD.

Scoping Report x Objective of the HTA scoping r eport The objective of the scoping report is to conduct a systematic literature search and to synthesize the available evidence base addressing the main health technology assessment (HTA) domains, i.e., clinical effectiveness/safety, costs/budget impact/cost -effectiveness, legal/social/ethical and organisational issues. In the report the an alytical methods that are to be used when a HTA is pursued are described. Based on qua ntity and qual ity of the extracted evidence the feasibility of pursuing a HTA is judged. Analysis of the individual study outcomes is not the objective of the scoping rep ort. Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 1 1 Policy question and c ontext For patients after stroke, with multiple sclerosis (MS) , or with Parkinson's disease (PD) , best supportive care often includes long- term physiotherapy. In Switzerland, physiotherapy is covered via mandatory health insurance for up to 36 sessions . For any patient wish ing to continue physiotherapy beyond 36 sessions at the expense of mandatory health insurance, the treating physician must make a formal request for reimbursement to the medical officer of the patient's insurance company. According to the medical officers , these requests have been increasing in recent years. Studies investigating the additional benefit of extending physiotherapy from acute and subacute care into long- term care are rare , and thus evidence about t he efficacy and effectiveness for the treatment of patients after stroke or with MS or PD, is scarce. The planned HTA aims to give an overview of the existing evidence to determine whether long- term physiotherapy meets the effectiveness, appropriateness , economic efficiency (EAE) criteria required for reimbursement via mandatory health insurance in Switzerland. 2 Research q uestion(s) The scoping report aim s to estimate the quantity and quality of relevant literature addressing the following research question s: 1) What is the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost -effectiveness of long- term physiotherapy compared to short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS or PD? 2) What is the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost -effectiveness of long- term phys iotherapy compared to best supportive care, no care , interval therapy, and unsupervised home- based therapy in patients after stroke, with MS or PD? 3) Are there any social, legal, ethical or organisational issues associated with long- term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS or PD? Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 2 3 Medical background 3.1 Medical context and disease description 3.1.1 Stroke 3.1.1.1 Disease description According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is defined as: \" rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than of vascular origin and includes cerebral infarction, intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage .\"1 Stroke is classified major types based on aetiology: ischaemic and haemorrhagic.2 Ischaemic stroke is a neurological dysfunction episode caused by focal cerebral, spinal or retinal infarction, with symptoms persisting for more than 24 hours . Ischaemic cerebral infarction is commonly caused by atherosclerotic obstruction (i.e. main atherosclerotic lesion/thrombosis and embolism) of large cerebral and cervical arteries. Ischaemia can occur in all or part of the brain supplied by the occluded artery. Haemorrhagic stroke is caused by a rupture in the wall of blood vessels in the brain commo nly caused by aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation. Stroke is a heterogenous condition and establishing its risk factors and treatment depends on its pathogenesis . A comprehensive list of risk factors for stroke is presented in Table 1. Table 1 Risk factors for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke Ischemic stroke Haemorrhagic stroke Modifiable risk factors* Alcohol consumption Anticoagulation Cardiac disease Diet Cigarette smoking Heavy d rinking Diabetes Hypertension Diet Illegal drug use (especially cocaine and crystal methamphetamine) Hypercholesterolaemia Thrombolytic therapy Mitral stenosis modifiable either directly or through gene- environment modification Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 3 3.1.1.2 Incidence or prevalence of stroke The lifetime risk of stroke is higher among females (20- 21%) than males (14 -17%).4 As the elderly population continues to grow, i t is postulated that the incidence of stroke will increase significantly.5 Data showing the global burden of disease indicates that 24.9% of individuals aged 25 years and older carry a lifetime risk of stroke, with 18.3% at risk of ischaemic stroke and 8.2% at risk of haemorrhagic stroke.6 A representative population survey of 19,123 households in Switz erland conducted in 2005 reported that in the previous one to two years, 6.9% were affected by stroke.7 This imposes a high burden on health care costs, with the average cost of inpatient hospitalisation and rehabilitation estimated at CHF 62,139.7 3.1.1.3 Symptoms and diagnostic pathway The most common signs and symptoms associated with ischaemic stroke are presented in Table 2. Acute onset of symptoms upon waking, or otherwise, is the most common feature of ischaemic stroke, with unilateral weakness and speech disturbance the most common physical findings.8 Sudden onset of focal neurologic deficit is likely to worsen during the first 24 hours of the event, due to increased intracranial pressure. The diagnostic pathway for stroke typi cally involves neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) to differentiate ischaemic stroke from intracerebral haemorrhage.8 Table 2 Common signs and symptoms of stroke Symptoms Signs Acute onset Arm paresis Subjective arm weakness Leg par esis Subjective leg weakness Dysphasia or dysarthria Self-reported speech disturbance Hemiparetic or ataxic gait Subjective facial weakness Facial paresis Arm paraesthesia Eye movement abnormality Leg paraesthesia Visual field defect Headache Dyspha gia Non-orthostatic dizziness Source: Yew et al. 20158 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 4 3.1.2 MS 3.1.2.1 Disease description MS is a demyelinating, inflammatory , autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is a major cause of chronic neurological disability in young and middle- aged adults from 18 to 50 years old.9 10 The pathological process in the development and progression of MS is the damage or loss of axons due to immune- mediated destruction of the myelin sheath.11 Based on the new phenotypic classification for MS there are four main disease courses: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing- remitting MS (RRMS) , secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS).12 The updated MS disease course description is presented in Table 3. Table 3 Description of MS disease course Disease Course Description Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) The first episode of CNS inflammatory demyelination that may become MS if additional activity occurs Relapsi ng-remitting MS (RRMS) Episodes of acute deterioration of neurologic functioning (new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms) with total or partial recovery and no apparent progression of disease RRMS subtypes Active evidence of new relapses, new gadolinium enhancing lesions and/or new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI over a specified period Inactive no evidence of disease activity Worsening increased disability confirmed over a specified period following a relapse Stable no evidence of increasing disabi lity over a specified period following a relapse Primary progressive MS (PPMS) Steadily worsening neurologic function from onset of symptoms without initial relapses or remissions PPMS subtypes Active evidence of new relapses, new gadolinium enhancing lesions and/or new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI over a specified period Inactive no evidence of disease activity With progression evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change confirmed over a specified period, with or without relapses Without progression no evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change over a specified period Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) SPMS refers to the disease progressing steadily, with or without relapses, following an initial relapsing- remitti ng course SPMS subtypes Active evidence of new new gadolinium enhancing lesions and/or new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI over a specified period Inactive no evidence of disease activity With progression evidence of disease worsening on an objec tive measure of change, confirmed over a specified period, with or without relapses Without progression no evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change over a specified period Abbreviations : CNS = central nervous system, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, MS = multiple sclerosis, PPMS = primary progressive multiple sclerosis, RRMS = relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis, SPMS = secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Source: Lublin 201412 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 5 3.1.2.2 Incidence or prevalence of MS MS is the most common neuroimmunological disorder seen in young adults (average age of onset 30 years). The estimated number of people with MS increased from 2.1 million in 2008 to 2.3 million in 2013, with the global median prevalence increasing from 30 per 100,000 in 2008 to 33 per 100,000 in 2013.13 The overall prevalence of MS in Switzerland was estimated to be 150 per 100,000 in 2011 rising to 190 per 100,000 in 2015, which translates to an estimated 10,000 individuals with MS in 2011 and 12,600 in 2015.14 3.1.2.3 Symptoms and diagnostic pathway Symptoms of MS are highly variable and unpredictable depending on the degree and location of demyelination in the CNS. Common symptoms experienced by MS patients include discrete episodes of numbness, tingling, weakness, vision loss, gait impairment, loss of coordination, imbalance, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Patients may be stable between attacks but may experience fatigue and heat sensitivity.15 No single test can deter mine if a person has MS. The diagnosis process involves gathering evidence from clinical examination, medical history, lab tests and MRI of the brain and spinal cord.16 Diagnosis of MS relies on evidence of CNS lesions showing the twin tenets of dissemination in time, signifying that damage has occurred more than once, and dissemination in space, suggesting damage in more than one location in the nervous system . The lack of precision in diagnosing MS led to the development of the McDonald Criteria by the I nternational Panel on MS Diagnosis , which involves clinical, radiographic and laboratory data to diagnose MS. 17 3.1.3 PD 3.1.3.1 Disease description PD is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra located in the basal ganglia, and the presence of Lewy bodies.18 The risk factors associated with PD include elevated cholesterol , environmental toxins (carbon disulfide, cyanide, herbicides, methanol and organic solvents, pestic ides) , head trauma, h igh caloric intake, increased body mass index , inflammation associated with activation of microglia, m ethcathinone (manganese content) , methamphetamine/amphetamine oxide toxicity , oxidative stress (potent neurotoxins and formation of free radicals) , post-infection state and signal mediated apoptosis .18 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 6 3.1.3.2 Incidence or prevalence of PD The prevalence of PD is 100 to 200 per 100,000 people, with an annual incidence of 15 per 100,000. The disease is more common in males than females, with disease onset usually occurring between 65 to 70 years of age.19 In Europe, the estimated prevalence of PD is 108 to 257 per 100,000 , and the estimated incidence is 11 to 19 per 100,000 inhabitants per year.20 According to a Swiss population- based epidemiological study, PD in the canton of Geneva showed an age- adjusted prevalence of 114 (105.8 -122.2) per 100,000, while the age- adjusted incidence was 20.1 (16 -24.3) per 100,000 inhabitants between 2009 and 2012.20 From 1990 to 2016, deaths, prevalence and disability -adjusted life year s increased in Switzerland by 13.9%, 10.3% and 10.8%, respectively.21 3.1.3.3 Symptoms and diagnostic pathway The cardinal features of PD such as bradykinesia, rigidity and resting tremor are often reported as the first clinical findings of the disease and are classified as motor symptoms.22 Postural instability affects 50% of PD patients within five years of diagnosis. Other symptoms include freezing of gait, sialorrhea (drooling or excessive salivation), amimia (inability to express ideas through gestures or signs), depression, loss of taste and sense of smell, sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal complications, constipation, anxiety, pain, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hallucinations and psychosis, impulse control disorder, cognitive impair ment and dementia. 23 24 Parkinsonism is defined as bradykinesia in combination with either resting tremor, rigidity or both.25 Parkinsonism must be established before criteria from the Movement Disorder Society25 can be applied to determine whether the patient meets the criteria for PD as the cause. However, there is no reliable test to diagnose PD, making it difficult to distinguish from other conditions with similar presentations. Therefore, this condition is mainly diagnosed by a range of classical presentations only related to PD, such as hypokinesia, bradykinesia, postural insta bility, rigidity a rest 27 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 7 4 Technolog y 4.1 Technology description Physiotherapy is a mode of therapy that uses physical techniques to develop, maintain and restore movement and functional ability.28 In patients after stroke , or with MS or PD, physiotherapy is commonly performed over a long- term basis to assist in the treatment and management of these diseases through movement and exercise, manual therapy, and education . Due to the complexity of neurological diseases, physiotherapists often require additional training to specialise in the rehabilitation of patients after stroke, with MS or PD. 4.1.1 Physiotherapy for patients after stroke The care pathway for stroke patients often includes a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team with clear ly documented roles and duties. This team should work closely with the patient and the family/caregiver so that all important information can be gathered and full support to the patient and family can be provided.29 At the time of adm ission , patients should be screened across the following domains : orientation, positioning, mobility level (inc l. risk of fall), pressure area risk, swallowing, continence, communication , nutritional status and hydration. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale,30 and the Barth el Index31 or Extended Barthel Index32 are commonly used to assess functional abilities, psychological function, pain, activity restriction and other environmental factors at admission, and again at discharge. Physiotherapy can be implemented in the acute setting, at a rehabilitation centre, in an out-patient setting, and at home or in primary care cent res. The recommended tim ing for physiotherapy is at the very early stage of recovery, ideally within 24 hours of stroke onset , especially for patient s who are unable to maintain or change posture on their own.33 Table 4 lists physiotherapy interventions used to treat var ious stroke impairments .

Patients with MS may have problems with balance, strength, mobility and fatigue. The optimal type of physiotherapy intervention will vary according to an individual patient's needs, depending on the stage of MS and specific functional deficits. Table 5 shows the physiotherapy interventions used to treat functional defects in MS.

Various technologies can be offered as alternative or parallel treatment to physiotherapy, irrespective the length of physiotherapy treatment . For stroke, PD and MS patients , such therapies include biological therapies (e.g. stem cell treatments ), acupuncture, massage, herbal therapies , Alexander technique, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chiropractic treatment, diet, magnetic therapy , and yog a.41-49 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 11 5 PICO 5.1 Population The eligible patient population is defined as patients diagnosed with stroke, MS or PD. Patients with transient ischemic attack ( TIA), clinically and radiologically isolated MS syndrome, or juvenile onset PD were excluded . 5.2 Intervention Long- term physiotherapy is t he intervention under investigation. No definition of what constitutes \"long- term\" physiotherapy could be identified from existing literature and clinical practice guidelines. In Switzerland, physiotherapy is covered under mandatory health insurance for up to 36 sessions (four bouts of nine sessions each). If a patient's condition requires more than 36 sessions at the expense of mandatory health insurance, the treating physician must make a formal request for reimbursement to the medical officer of the patient's insurance company. Based on this information, long-term physiotherapy has been defined in this scoping report as continual or regular physiotherapy beyond 36 sessions for pat ients diagnosed with stroke, MS or PD, which translates to continuous or regular physiotherapy sessions >2 months in patients after stroke, and >6 months in patients with MS or PD. These thresholds were informed by a survey of S wiss physiotherapy practices . To allow for a degree of clinical variation, and due to the lack of certainty around this definition, these cut -offs were used as a guide rather than strict inclusion criteria. 5.3 Comparator The primary comparison of relevance to the policy question is shor t-term physiotherapy compared top long-term physiotherapy. In addition, lo physiotherapy w as compared to unsupervised home- based physiotherapy, no intervention, placebo/ sham, usual care and treatments other than physiotherapy (i.e. best supportive c are) including pharmacological treatments , cannabis, botulinum toxin, yoga and P ilates, in patients after stroke, with MS or PD. 5.4 Outcomes Limitations in functional capacity and mobility are primary concerns of patients after stroke, with MS or PD and their families. Mobility disability has a profound impact on everyday life and can affect emotional wellbeing, activities of daily living ( ADL), quality of life ( QoL) and autonomy . Some of the tools used to measure balance and mobility in stroke patients include the Berg's Balance Scale ( BBS),50 the Activities -Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale,51 the Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) ,52 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 12 the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) ,53 the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) ,54 and the Stroke Rehabilitat ion Assessment of Movement (STREAM ).55-58 Assessment tools used to measur e functional mobility and balance in PD include the Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test,59 the Functional Reach Test (FRT),60 the BBS,50 ABC Scale ,51 Mini-Balance Evaluation System Test ( Mini-BEST ),61 Functional Gait Assessment (FG A),62 and 5 T imes Sit to S tand (5TST ).63 64 As di sease progresses, the ability to perform ADLs is profoundly affected.65 ADLs are classified into personal, which includes toileting, dressing, eating, grooming, ambulation and bathing, and instrumental, which involves more complex task such as communication, shopping, transportation and domestic activities (cook ing, housekeeping, laundry). Validated tools used to measure ADL include the F unctional Independence Measure (FIM),66 the Barthel Index (BI),31 and the PD ADL Scale.67 68 Commonly used tools in assessing mobility disability among patients with MS include the E xpan ded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),69 and the MS Function al Composite (MSFC ).70 71 Assessment tools used to measure dexterity include the Nine- Hole Peg Test (9HPT),72 and the Box and Block Test (BBT),73 which are crucial to determine finger, hand and arm function. Walking ability is a key component of mobility , which is routinely assessed by standardi sed test s and scales to observe the progression of neurological conditions .74 Walking impairment places a great burden on patients after stroke, or with MS or PD. Validated c linician - and patient -driven instruments are available to evaluate walking performance ( i.e., Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25FW) ,75 10 Metre Walk Test (10MWT) ,76 and patient self -report ed 12-Item MS Walking Scale(MSWS -12)77) and speed ( i.e., assessment of velocity in m etres per second, cadence in steps per minute, stride length in m etres ), and to test other aspect s of mobility including balance ( i.e., Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) ,78 Timed Up and G o (TUG) Test,59 and Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)62), endurance or motor fatigue ( i.e., 2- or 6-Minute Walk Test79). The Freezing of Gait Questionna ire (FOGQ)80 is an additional tool for PD (score s range from 0 -24 with higher scores indicating more severe freezing of gait ). Clinician -rated impairment and disability measures describe disease progression over time as observed and rated by clinicians. This includes assessment on disability, disease severity and motor and clinical impairment. For stroke patients, Modified Rankin Scale (MRS)81 and the Glasgow O utcome Scale (GOS)82 are considered as the gold standard for stroke outcome assessment. MRS81 is a 6 -point ordinal scale that measures global disability (0=no symptoms to 6= Dead).83 GOS82 is an ordinal rating scale describing disability and handicap in patients with brain injury with scores ranging from 1 (death) to 5 (good recovery).84 The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)69 is considered the gold standard in the clinician rated comprehensive assessment of MS related disabili ty.85 The clinician- rated comprehensive assessment of Hoehn Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) ,87 Webster Rating Scale,88 and the Columbia U niversity Rating Scale (CURS)89 (higher scores indicat e greater disability ).64 Health -related QoL (HRQoL) is critical in patients after stroke, with MS or PD to provid e information on the progression of the disease, effectiveness of treatment and the management of care provided. HRQoL can be measured using a patient -reported assessment of physical, social, emoti onal and mental health. It also refers to the way health influences a person's ability to function, as well as their perceived physical, mental and social well -being.90 Examples of tools used to measure H RQoL in stroke patients include the Short Form-36 and -12 (SF-36/12) ,91 92 Short Form the Stroke- Specific QoL Scale (SS-QoL),95 the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) ,96 and the Quality of Wellbeing Scale (QWS ).97-100 HRQoL is commonly assessed using self -reported questionnaires validated for MS patients such as the MS 54-Item QoL Questionnaire (MSQoL -54),101 the Functional Assessment of MS (FAMS)102 Questionnaire, the Hamburg QoL Questionnaire in MS (HAQUAMS) ,103 the QoL Index - MS (QLI-MS),104 the Leeds QoL Scale,105 the 29-Item MS Impact Scale (MSIS -29),106 the Disability and I mpact Profile (DIP) ,107 the extension of measures of Q uality - adjusted Time Without Symptoms of Disease and Toxicity of Treatment ,108 and the MS International QoL109 Questionnaire.10 110 In PD, QoL is commonly measured using the 39 -Item PD Questionnaire (PDQ -39),111 the P D QoL Questionnaire (PDQoL) ,112 the PD Impact Scale (PIMS) ,113 and the SF-3691 or SF -12.64 92 Pain is a subjective experience and is often reported using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)114 and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)115 presented as mean differences across included patients. The VAS114 and NRS115 are recommended to assess pain in both stroke and MS patients. For patients with PD, the King's PD P ain Scale (KPPS)116 is recommended for rating pain intensity , due to the insufficient validation of the VAS115 and NRS115 in patients with P D.117 The KPPS Scale116 has 14 questions that investigate the frequency and severity of different pain syndromes frequently observed in PD patients.117 Items are scored by severity (0- 3) multiplied by frequency (0- 4), resulting in a subscore of 0- 12, with a total possible sc ore of 0- 168.116 117 Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating manifestation of MS that can significantly affect a person's functional ability at home and at work.118 It can have socioeconomic consequences involving loss of work hours and loss of empl oyment.119 120 Fatigue in MS is not clearly understood. Common definition of fatigue includes : 'a sense of exhaustion, lack of energy or tiredness ', and 'subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to inter fere with usual or desired activity. '119 121 122 The definition is open to a wide range of interpretation depending on the patient's cultural or educational background. Patient -reported questionnaires to quantify t he severity of fatigue are commonly used for MS patients. However, this outcome can be confounded by other Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 14 conditions associated with MS , such as depression and sleep disorders.123 Fatigue rating scales used are the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ11) ,124 the Krupps Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) ,125 the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS),126 and the N eurological Fatigue Index for MS (NFI-MS).119 127 Impaired cognition, muscle strength, muscle tone, sensation, coordination and gait , predispose patients after stroke, with MS or PD to increased risk of falls .128-130 The falls per person year , or the standardi sed measure of fall occurrence, is determined by dividing the falls rate by the length of follow -up.131-133 For patients after stroke, with MS or PD, the F alls Efficac y Scale-International (FES -I)134 has been used to measure the patient's confidence in performing ADL (scores ranging from 1 to 10 with higher scores signifying lower level s of confidence and a total score of 70 or more denoting that the patient has a fear of falling) .64 135 136 Poor compliance to physiotherapy and rehabilitation intervention can have a negative effect on overall health outcomes and on the long-term healthcare cost .137 Compliance with physiotherapy intervention, like adherence to physical activity , might be difficult since the symptoms and impairment in patient s after stroke, with MS or PD change ov er time.138 139 Compliance can be measured using adherence.140 Adherence is defined as: 'the degree to which the person's behavior corresponds with the agreed recommendation from a healthcare provider ,' and is calculated as the number of sessions the patient attended over the expected number of treatment sessions in a specific time period or duration.138 141 The concept of adherence in physiotherapy is multidimensional and could include appointment attendance, treatment fidelity and perform ance of the prescribed exercises (frequency and duration).142 The most frequently used adherence measurement methods were diaries and logbooks .139 Adverse events are critical safety outcomes in the management of patients after stroke, with MS or PD. An adverse event is defined as: 'an unexpected and undesired incident directly associated with the care or services provided to the patient .'143 Events that result in death, life threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of exi sting hospitali sation, disability, or permanent damage are categori sed as serious adverse events.10 Adverse events recorded include fracture, pain, muscle soreness, dizziness , and adverse reaction to exercise interventions such as pallor (skin becoming pale) ; excessive sweating or clamminess ; sudden or excessive shortness of breath unrelated to increased activity ; increased cough or wheeze; nausea or vomiting; confusion; chest heaviness, pain or tightness ; angina and rapid heart rate ; palpitations or irregular heartbeat .64 144 145 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 15 Table 7 Study selection for stroke P: Patients diagnosed with stroke Exclusion criteria: Patients with transient ischa emic attack Patients in the acute (1 to 7 days post -stroke) or sub- acute stage (7 days to 6 months post -stroke) of the disease146 I: Any long -term physiotherapy interventions given to chronic stroke patients , which includes: o Physiotherapeutic interventions: active and passive movement therapy, manual therapy, pelvic floor exercises, medical exercise therapy, movement therapy in water, cardiovascular physiotherapy, pelvic floor physiotherapy o Physical methods/m odalities: heat and cold therapy, muscle and connective tissue massage, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy o Other interventions: breathing (respiratory) and lymphological physiotherapy , light and ultrasound therapy C: Best supportive care, including pharmacologi c, cannabis, botulinum toxin, yoga, Pilates Interval therapy including short -term physiotherapy Unsupervised home- based physiotherapy No intervention Placebo/sham procedure O: Critical clinical outcomes Functional capacity and mobility (including activiti es of daily living, balance, gait) Walking Clinician -rated impairment and disability measures Health -related quality of life Important clinical outcomes Pain Falls Compliance Safety outcomes Adverse events Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 16 Table 8 Study selectio n criteria for MS P: Patients with MS (relapsing -remitting MS , which may convert to secondary -progressive MS, primary progressive MS, and progressive relapsing MS) Exclusion criteria: Study population with possible MS such as: o Clinically isolated syndrome o Radiologically isolated syndrome I: Any long -term physiotherapy interventions given to MS patients , which includes: o Physiotherapeutic interventions: active and passive movement therapy, manual therapy, pelvic floor exercises, medical exercise therapy, movement therapy in water, cardiovascular physiotherapy, pelvic floor physiotherapy, hippotherapy o Physical methods/modalities: heat and cold therapy, muscle and connective tissue massage, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy o Other interventions: breathing (respiratory) and lymphological physiotherapy , light and ultrasound therapy C: Best supportive care , including pharmacologic, cannabis, botulinum toxin, yoga, Pilates Interval therapy including short -term physiotherapy Unsupervised home- based physiotherapy No inter vention Placebo/sham procedure O: Critical clinical outcomes Functional capacity and mobility (including activities of daily living, balance, gait) Walking Clinician -rated impairment and disability measures Health -related quality of life Important clinic al outcomes Pain Fatigue Falls Compliance Safety outcomes Adverse events Abbreviation s: MS = multiple sclerosis .

Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 18 6 HTA k ey questions For the evaluation of the technology the following key questions covering the central HTA domains , as designated by the EUnetHTA Core Model (clinical effectiveness , safety, costs , cost-effectiveness, budget impact , legal, ethical and organis ational aspects ), are addressed: 1. Is long -term physiotherapy effective/efficacious compared to short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS , or with PD? a) Is long- term physiotherapy effective/efficacious compared to no treatment, placebo/sham, best supportive care, unsupervised home- based physiotherapy and interval therapy in patients after stroke, with MS, or with PD? 2. Is long- term physiotherapy safe compared to short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke , with MS, or with PD ? a) Is long-term physiotherapy safe compared to no treatment, placebo/sham, best supportive care, unsupervised home- based physiotherapy and interval therapy in patients after stroke, with MS, or with PD ? 3. What are the costs associated with long- term physiotherapy in patients after stroke , with MS, or with PD? 4. How cost -effective is long- term physiotherapy compared to other treatment s in patients after stroke, with MS, or with PD ? 5. What is the budget impact of limiting the indication of physiotherapy to 36 treatment sessions in patients after stroke, with MS, or with PD? 6. Are there legal, social or ethical issues related to limiting physiotherapy treatments to 36 sessions in patients after stroke, with MS, or with PD ? 7. Are there organi sational issues related to limiting physiotherapy treatments to 36 sessions in patients after stroke, with MS, or with PD? Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 19 7 Methodology literature search 7.1 Databases and search strategy A scoping search str ategy was created to identify published literature that addresses the research questions. Literature searches were conducted in seven biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, EconLit, University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination ( York CRD) , International HTA database (date limited from 2015- 2020)) , Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro )). Separate searches were conducted to identify systematic reviews (SRs) and economic evaluations up to 27 September 2020, randomised control trial s (RCTs) up to 22 October 2020, and evidence for the social, legal, ethical, and organisational auxiliary domains up to 13 November 2020. Details about the bibliographic database searches are available in Appendix A . Additionally, the websites of HTA agenc ies were searched to identify relevant HTA reports that included cost - effectiveness analyses ( Table 29). The search strings for RCTs and SRs were verified using known publications identified through targeted searches and were peer -reviewed by an independent reviewer not affiliated with the authors prior to the searches being conducted. The key search terms related to the population and intervention were combined with various methodological and topical search filters (SR and HTA, RCTs, cost-effectiveness, etc.), depending on the database and research question being addressed.147 The full search strateg ies for each database are reported in Appendix A. Owing to the br oad nature of the intervention keywords, clinical trials databases were not searched as the volume of hits could not be screened within the available time to produce this scoping report. Grey literature searches were conducted on specialty websites (Table 28) to highlight any relevant literature that may not have been otherwise identified. 7.2 Study selection Results from the literature search were imported into Rayyan (bibliographic management software). Rayyan functions similarly to EndN ote but all ows for easy blinding of reviewers and management of study inclusion conflicts.148 Study selection was limited to studies in English, French, German and Italian. French, German, and Italian are three of the four official languages of Switzerland. The fourth language of Romansh was not included because of the limited number of publications available.149 150 Only studies that met the population, i ntervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) criteria were considered eligible for inclusion. SRs and RCTs were considered as eligible study designs to address the policy question comparing long- versus short -term physiotherapy. In addition, SRs were also included to identify Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 20 literature for the supplementary comparison of long-term physiotherapy versus other long- term comparators. As this comparison was not the focus of the policy question, but can provide some indication of the benefit of long- term physiotherapy, only SR evidence was considered to be eligible for inclusion . Studies based in countries outside of WHO Mortality Stratum A were excluded during full-text screening because burdens of disease in these countries are not comparable to Switzerland. The following countries comprise WHO Mortality Stratum A: Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic (Czechia), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U nited Kingdom (U K) and United States of America ( USA) .151 Study selection was conducted independently by two reviewers in duplicate, in two phases. All records were screened by title and abstract. Conflicts between reviewers on study inclusion were settled via consensus. If consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer decided whether to include or exclude the study . Articles deemed potentially relevant were then reviewed in full text by both reviewers independently, with disagreements settled via the same procedure of consensus. Study characteristics (e.g. author details, country of publication, year, setting, length of follow -up, population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, sample size) were extracted for the included studies using piloted extraction tem plates. All data extractions were completed by one reviewer, then checked by a second reviewer for accuracy. Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 21 8 Synthesis of evidence b ase 8.1 Overall search results The results of the systematic literature searches are presented in Figure 1. Database searches (Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, York CRD, International HTA Database, PEDro, and EconL it) identified 14,878 studies. After the removal of duplicates, 10,309 studies were reviewed by title and abstract, of whi ch 40 1 were reviewed by full text. No publications were identified that compar ed long- term physiotherapy to short -term physiotherapy . Twelve publications152-163 were included which compared long-term physiotherapy to any other long- term comparator . The searches also identified 13 social, 2 ethical and 3 organisational -related studies. Thirteen existing economic evaluations164-176 broadly matching t he PICO criteria were identified. No legal studies were identified. A complete list of articles excluded at full text review is presented in Appendix D. 8.2 Evidence base pertaining to efficacy, effectiveness and safety 8.2.1 Search results No systematic reviews or RCTs were identified that investigated the policy question of long- term physiotherapy compared to short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS or with PD. Due to the absence of information addressing th e policy question, supplementary research questions were included comparing long- term physiotherapy to other alternative therapies. As this was not a focus of the scoping report, relevant evidence for these supplementary questions was limited to existing systematic reviews. For the supplementary comparison of long- term physiotherapy versus any other long-term comparators , 12 systematic reviews were identified,152-163 of which 10 were conducted in stroke and 2 were i n PD; no reviews on long- term physiotherapy for MS were identified. The included studies are as follows: Effectiveness o 0 SRs or RCTs compared long- term physiotherapy to short -term physiotherapy . o 12 SRs compared long- term physiotherapy interventions to sham , placebo or no intervention.152-163 Safety o 0 SRs or RCTs compared long- term physiotherapy to short -term physiotherapy . o 2 SRs compared long- term physiotherapy to sham, placebo or no intervention.161 162 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 22 Figure 1 PRISMA flow chart for study inclusion Abbreviations : RCT = randomised control trial, SR = systematic review . Note: a = A total of 12 SR s were included: 10 studies considered effectivenes s outcomes, two studies reported both safety and effectiveness data.

The l ong-term physiotherapy interventions include d electrical stimulation (k=4), constrained induced movement therapy (k=1), motor rehabilitation physiotherapy cardiorespiratory general physiotherapy interventions (k=1) compared with placebo or no intervention (k=10), sham (k=1), usual care (k=2) and treatments other than physiotherapy (k=3). Physiotherapy in stroke is aimed to maintain functional capacity and performance in ADL. Electrical stimulation , which includes functional electrical stimulation , was the most commonly studied physiotherapy intervention (k=4) specific to patients diagnosed with stroke among the SR s included i n this scoping report . The stroke population mo st commonly studied include d adults over 18 years of age, diagnosed at least 6 months prior to the study (k= 4) with arm function of the hemiparetic/hemiplegic status after stroke (k=3) . One SR included studies with participants 65 years of age (or mean age of participants required to be 65 years ) regardless of stroke aetiology, type or severity.157 The number of studies included in the SRs ranged from 9 to 75, with sample sizes ranging from 168 to 3,617. It should be noted, however, that in the study by Stewart et al .,157 only two of the 28 included RCTs compared electrical stimulation to sham, acupuncture or other physiotherapy interventions. There was considerable variability in the characteristics of the included SR s in terms of the type of stroke, age of the patients, and type and duration of physiotherapy interventions. For PD, t he primary goal of providing physiotherapy interventions is to e nable patients to maintain the utmost level of mobility, activity and independence. This will enhance their quality of life and may prevent problems associated with the progressive nature of the disease. The number of studies included in the SRs was 25161 and 76162, respectively , with sample sizes of 1,181 and 1,827, respectively . The included SRs did not discriminate on duration or severity of PD , medications, falls risk, age or any duration of physiotherapy intervention. No SR s were found that investi gated the effect of long- term physiotherapy in patients with MS. Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 24 Physiotherapy interventions were most frequently compared with placebo or no intervention (k=10). Other comparators include d usual care, sham and other physiotherapy interventions . It should be noted that not all of the studies included in the SR s had treatment durations greater than 2 months for stroke , or greater than 6 months for MS or PD. The duration of physiotherapy intervention ranged from 1 day to 12 months . Treatment duration, the presence of multiple physiotherapy interventions covered by the SRs and the restriction on physiotherapy intervention comparators, all limited the ability to include studies for this scoping report. Functional capacity and mobility were the most frequently st udied effectiveness outcomes (k=8 for stroke and k= 2 for PD). Five studies reported on HRQoL, four studies reported on walking and ambulation, three studies investigated falls, and one study explored the clinician- rated impairment and disability measure. In terms of safety, two SRs (one each for stroke and PD) reported on adverse events162 163 and mortality/death.163 Reported adverse events included recurrent non- fatal cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, altered muscle tone, training induced injury, pain, incidence of falls and incidence of fractures. Compliance was measured by one study on PD.162 A summary of the studies reporting the effectiveness and safety outcomes per population is provided in Table 10. 8.2.4 Quality of evidence assessment The methodological quality of the studies included in the SR s were assessed using the PEDro scale for rating quality of RCTs and the Cochrane C ollaboration 's tool for assessing risk of bias. The risk of bias of the included studies varied from low to high. Two SRs only included RCTs with moderate to high quality.154 161 One reason for the relatively low methodological quality scores relates to the difficulty i n blinding the therapist providing the treatment and, to some extent, blinding of the participants on the interventions they are receiving.

The study selection focused on cost s and economic evaluations in line with the PICO. For inclusion, the intervention needed to be delivered or supervised by a physiotherapist. Studies compar ing physiotherapy intervention s to usual care, no treatment placebo or relaxation were included. No restriction was placed on the duration of physiotherapy (long- or short -term) , as economic approaches relevant to the PICO could include short - Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 26 term physiotherapy interventions . Studies were excluded if they were protocols, SRs and conference abstracts, or if the inter vention included robotics or electronic games (i.e. exergaming) . Following full text study selection, 13 studies were considered relevant and the remaining 65 studies were excluded. 8.3.2 Evidence table A detailed extraction table reporting the characteristics of the thirteen included studies are outlined in Appendix C, Table 32. 8.3.3 Findings regarding costs, cost -effectiveness, and budget impact Physiotherapy intervention variations The thirteen economic studies164-176 identified in this review involved varying types of physiotherapy interventions. Ten of the studies involved physiotherapy intervention for less than three months.164 166- 168 170-174 176 Among the included studies, 11 tested the cost -effectiveness of physiotherapy against usual care,164 165 167 169 -176 one against no care,166 and one against relaxation.168 Two of the studies included three physiotherapy sessions per week over 10 to 12 weeks .168 174 One study compared higher - to lower -intensity physiotherapy .165, the more intensive intervention involved 23 hours of treatment for stroke rehabilitation, versus a lower intensity regimen of 9 hours . The physiotherapy interventions included a range of individual and group exercises. The longer -term study of Farag et al.169 had varying intensit ies of treatments, with the intervention group receiving between 2 and 4 home visits fr om a physical therapist over 6 months. In the study by Chan165 the clinical trial used for the analysis involved i ncreased intensit ies of physiotherapy for stroke rehabilitation compared to the standard level of physiotherapy. The Clarke et al.166 intervention was delivered by a therapist in 4 sessions of 58 minutes each over 8 weeks. The study by Collins et al.168 involved fitness classes of 1 hour and 15 minutes , held 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The interventions were delivered in many different settings including community care,164 168 169 171 175 176 acute care and inpatient delivery ,165 outpatient clinics ,166 173 174 and primary care facilities .172 Economic evaluation: populations and perspectives in the studies Six studies were associated with stroke r ehabilitation,164 165 167 168 170 171 one with MS,176 and the remainder with PD.166 169 172 -175 Most of the stroke studies included participants a ged 70-75 years . The MS study176 included participants aged 45-46 years and the PD study included participants aged around 70-71 years. Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 27 Most of the included studies were conducted in the UK ,164 166 -168 171 -173 175 176 and the remainder took place in Canada,165 Sweden,174 Australia,169 and New Zealand.170 Many of the UK studies used a National Health Service government perspective. The Aust ralian study169 took a health system perspective, and the Swedish study174 a societal p erspective for cost -effectiveness calculations, while the New Zealand study170 appeared to use hospital costs. Economic evaluation: approaches Seven of the included studies were trial -based cost -utility analyses .166 167 169 172 174 -176 Four were cost analyses ,164 170 171 173 and one a decision model .168 Chan165 developed a Markov state transition model as part of the Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series. The model had a lifelong duration and employed alive and dead states for recent stroke patients. Patients transitioned from one state to another using assumptions derived from peer - reviewed journals, government reports and expert opinion from members of the Canadian Stroke Network. Economic e valuation: costs Costs captured in the economic evaluations generally included physiotherapist time (i.e. duration costs) and hospital cost outcomes. The studies by Beech et al .,164 Hunter et al .,167 Fletcher et al.,172 Farag et al.,169 Xin et al.,175 Joseph et al. ,174 Tosh et al .,176 and Clarke et al. ,166 collected costs during trials. Fletcher et al.172 included resource use for physiotherapists involved in the delivery of the exercise. Costs of venue hire, equipment costs and travel costs incurred by physiotherapists and participants were also doc umented. Collins et al .168 used costs sourced from a local community group fitness provider. In the Chan study,165 conventional and high- intensity hours of physiotherapy duration for each arm of the model were estimated using expert opinion and the literature. Economic evaluation: outcomes Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY) was reported in nine studies. Five of the studies166 167 172 175 176 derived EQ -5D estimates of patient utility from questionnaires administered during trials, one study174 used the SF -36 questionnaire, and one study169 used the SF -6D questionnaire. One study171 used a WHO QoL Index approach to estimate QoL outcomes. The Markov model study of Chan165 sourced utility estimates from the literature, and the d ecision model of Collins et al.168 used the results of a previously conducted trial. Four studies164 170 171 173 were cost -per-patient analyses. Economic evaluation: sensitivity analysis The Markov modelling analysis of Chan165 included a probabili stic sensitivity analysis, and included uncertainty of model inputs as confidence intervals or standard deviations. Univariate analyses were Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 28 conducted for duration of effect, physiotherapist wage, physiotherapy assistant cost, mortality rate, discount rate , utility value and length of inpatient stay. There were some sensitivity analyses included with trial-based studies . Tosh et al.176 examined the impacts of differing costs of settings (private gyms or by third- party providers), disability sub- groups and wage costs, Hunter et al.167 presented scenarios where carer cost s were included and training costs excluded, F arag et al.169 outlined scenarios for a group based program and no hospital costs , and Xin et al.175 varied the time horizon, physiotherapist visits and numbers of sessions. The decision model of Collins et al.168 included scenarios of different comparators , classes for 12 months and less than 7 attendees per class. Existing systematic reviews Two SRs undertaken to support physiotherapy HTA and economic modelling studies were identified.177 178 Although th ey were not formally included in this review, their key findings are presented as back- ground prior to presenting results. The overarching conclusions of these two reviews were that there were limited studies that have evaluated the cost -effectiveness of ph ysiotherapy interventions for treat- ing neurological disorders. One study was conducted in Canada to support an HTA examining the effectiveness of continual long- term physiotherapy (more than 12 weeks) for patients after stroke. 177 The authors searched major databases in October 2018 and were unable to find published evidence on the clinical effectiveness of continual long- term physiotherapy for recovery post-stroke. They concluded there was a lack of available information, which prevented an assessment of cost - effectiveness. The review by Winser et al.178 undertook a broader systematic search of existing evidence to identify studies examining the cost -effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with neurological disorders including PD, stroke and MS. Major database searches up to July 2018 yielded 225 articles, of which 51 were duplicated studies. Foll owing the full text screening, 10 studies were included. Three of these are included in this scoping report . 167 169 176 The other seven were not applicable as they related to other conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease or c erebral palsy, and interventions such as WiiTM sports games or robot -assisted therapy. Summary Only a limited number of economic studies were identified to assess the cost -effectivenes s of physiotherapy to treat patients after stroke, with MS or PD. Most were related to stroke, and only one assessed an intervention of longer than six months. Most economic analys es were trial based. One Markov model was developed to evaluate the long- term benefit of physiotherapy; however, key Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 29 assumptions were based on limited literature which may not be relevant to Switzerland. No included study examined the cost -effectiveness of long- versus short -term physiotherapy , so as sumptions are of limited applic ability.

One study on MS examined differences in physiotherapy intervention application in the USA and Europe ( Czech Republic, UK, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Norway, Croatia, Germany, Spain, Greece, Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) .188 Eight studies sought to determine the influence of patient and physiotherapist factors on physiotherapy utilization,179 180 183 185 -189 four studies reported on adherence to physiotherapy management ,181 182 184 190 and one study described the factors influencing patient satisfaction of physiotherapy services .191 Long -term Physiotherapy Scoping Report 31 8.4.4 Ethical results Two case studies highlighting the ethical issues involv ed in therapeutic intervention in people after stroke in the right hemisphere, and the management of dysphagia in people after stroke were identified.192 193 While this occurred in an American context, many of the issues discussed are likely r elevant to the Swiss context. 8.5 Evidence base pertaining to o rganisational issues The literature search identified three studies regarding organisational issues associated with physiotherapy management. 8.5.1 Evidence table Relevant studies are summarised in Table 12.

The searches conducted in this scoping report did not identify any SRs or RCTs that have investigated this question direc tly. The absence of direct evidence comparing long- and short -term physiotherapy was anticipated, based on the pre- scoping report and preliminary scoping searches. As such, the PICO criteria in this scoping report w ere broadened to include evidence compari ng any long- term physiotherapy regime\u2014where long-term was defined according to the 36- session limit covered under mandatory health insurance \u2014to any other relevant long-term comparator. A total of 12 SR s were identified that measured the effects of long-term physiotherapy, of which 10 were on stroke and two were on PD. There were no reviews of long-term physiotherapy for MS. While this evidence provides some indication of the benefit of long- term physiotherapy, it does not inform the policy question directly . Furthermore, there is considerable heterogeneity in the type and duration of interventions reported in the existing SRs. Overall, the existing reviews can be considered to offer evidence supporting specific long- term physiotherapy subtypes, but do not cover the breadth of physiotherapy practice covered under mandatory health insurance in Switzerland. Economic evaluation In the absence of clinical evidence addressing the policy question, an economic evaluation of the policy question is not feasible at this time. It is technically feasible to undertake an economic analysis of long- term physiotherapy compared to other relevant long- term comparators in stroke and PD , noting that evidence exists for a range of heterogenous interventions and populations . Existin g models could be used to inform the evaluation structure ( most likely a decision model ), but are not directly applicable to the Swiss context. In order to conduct an evaluation within the scope of the HTA program, specific physiotherapy interventions and populations with adequate clinical data would need to be prioritised . Conclusion No SRs or RCTs were found that compared long- term physiotherapy to short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS , or with PD. As the primary focus of the policy question is the comparison of long- term physiotherapy versus short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS or PD, a full HTA report on this topic is not feasible. There is currently no available data to undertake an HTA on the effectiveness, s afety and cost -effectiveness of long- term physiotherapy compared to short -term physiotherapy in patients after stroke, with MS or PD.
