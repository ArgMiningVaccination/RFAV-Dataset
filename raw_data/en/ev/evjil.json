I could never recommend it enough. It is said to decrease stress, improve mental clarity and energy, and foster creativity. Some of the most successful innovators in history have been dedicated meditators. It is an excellent tool to incorporate into your daily routine, especially during times of distress. Whether you're going through a breakup, handling a work challenge, or dealing with a physical illness, meditation can focus your internal lens and bring you greater clarity and peace. Meditation has been scientifically proven to mitigate addiction, depression, anxiety and stress, cognitive function, and eating disorders. Thanks to the brain plasticity it can create new neurological pathways. The practice is also said to: improve cell health , balance hormone levels and reduce blood pressure. So How to meditate? Contrary to most beliefs, meditation is not about stopping your thoughts . The brain is made to think. So don't start thinking not to think or you gonna feel like you aren't able to meditate, when actually meditation is all about being the observer of those thoughts , watching them pass like the clouds in the sky without attaching to them. And because you might find yourself holding onto some thoughts , once you become aware of it just go back to you breathing, or mantra... Start in a confortable position, sitting on a pillow or lying down, and start to watch your breath. Even if meditation interests you, sitting down and confronting your thoughts can be intimidating. So how can you incorporate meditation into your lifestyle and reap all the wonderful benefits? 1| Identify your why.Why do you want to practice meditation? How do you want it to make you feel? What do you want to get out of it? If you're clear on your intentions, you're more likely to see the benefits. 2| Start small.Even just several minutes of meditation can have a great impact on your well-being. Start with a few minutes a day (3-5 minutes)and work your way up to 20-30 minutes if it suits you. 3| Pick a modality.Maybe you prefer a guided meditation to give you more structure or like to repeat a mantra in your head. Experiment to find out what works for you. Don't limit yourself to what's popular or what your friends are doing. My favourite apps are Insight timer, calm and headspace. 4| Commit to it.Even if you only choose to practice a few minutes per day, establish a routine. Consistency is key - a few minutes each day is more effective than an hour once a week. And as a practice, try to set a time or a habit , like straight after drinking your water first thing in the morning, or before bed... 5| Join your community.If you enjoy group settings, consider a group meditation class that may allow you to feel more connected and engaged. Still not convince meditation is for you ? Here are the effects of this practice on your body: Prefrontal Cortex This portion of the brain naturally thins with age. It has been proven that meditation can reverse this process, which would otherwise contribute to cognitive decline. Pain Response Meditation has been proven to strengthen your pain response. The practice of mindfulness improves the body's physiological response to pain as well as one's perception of pain. Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) This part of the brain governs perspective and empathy. A meditation modality called cognitively-based compassion training has been shown to improve the ability of subjects to read emotions on strangers' faces. Hippocampus This part of the brain shapes new memories from experiences. Stress hormones have a shrinking effect on the hippocampus, interfering with memory and navigation. Meditation can help maintain the size of this structure, which is pertinent to our mental resilience. Blood Pressure Meditation helps to dilate the blood vessels, improving blood flow and thereby lowering the pressure needed to pump blood throughout the body. Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) This region of the brain is associatedwith creativity and self-reflection. Research shows that meditation has beneficial effects on the density andstructure of this region. Amygdala This region of the brain is involved with experiencing emotions. Stress can increase the density of this region, altering the structure of the brain. Meditating can help reduce the density and maintain the brain's healthy structure. Immune System Meditation is linked to reduced inflammation and strengthened immunity. Heart Meditation may protect against heart disease by reducing inflammatory markers associated with its development. So "}
