An industrial research grant has been awarded to Swedish firm Intervacc AB, worth \u00a357,822, and expected to cover 70% of the cost of developing the vaccine. This follows a four-year project, involving Intervacc AB and Moredun Scientific in Scotland, which demonstrated \"significant levels of protection\" in four- and seven-week-old piglets.

Intervacc chief scientific officer Dr Andrew Waller said the news was another step on the path to easing the burden caused by the pathogen, and emphasised the importance of reducing antimicrobial use. A Moredun spokesman said: \"Conventional vaccines currently in use have shown limited effectiveness, failing to protect pig herds against all strains of the pathogen. \"This project aimed to create a transformative shift within "}
