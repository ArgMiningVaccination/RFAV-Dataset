The medical department is charged with the responsibility for the prevention and control of disease and injury, and the treatment of the sick and injured. The SMO must consult with and advise the CVN CO and the CSG commander in all matters affecting the health of the crew, embarked personnel , or others as the mission dictates. To accomplish this mission, medical personnel must keep themselves informed of planned operations and anticipate any demands that may be placed upon them. 2. Purpose . This is the third edition of the shipboard medical procedures manual. This guide is intended to serv e as basic information to standardize operations and provide a guide and planning tool during and beyond preparations for major deployments. It can also be used as a ready reference for situations encountered in the day -to-day function of a CVN's medical department. This instruction cannot cover every situation that may be encountered in a CVN or CSG medical department and therefore is considered a guideline that should be applied with common sense and real -time consultation as required. Type commander ( TYCOM) force medical departments are available, at all times, for consultation and assistance through the entire spectrum of operations. 3. Concept of Operations a. CVN medical departments are focused on the primary mission of providing routine, primary care and emergency response to the ship's crew. In addition, the evolving operational environment has necessitated a response to events outside normal operational boundaries (e.g. humanitarian assistance and disaster response). The introduction of joint force integration to include joint tactics, techniques, and procedures requires medical departments to adopt standardized practices and understand required capabilities across the operational spectrum. b. Medical departments must focus on OFRP requireme nts defined in COMNAVAIRFOR INST 3500.20E while executing medicine with the NAVMED P -117, and this instruction. Departmental training and preparation will culminate in a fully ready, joint force capable unit. Training and preparation are intended to prote ct the health of the crew, maintain individual medical readiness, provide primary care, and provide first response, forward resuscitation, and theater hospitalization. All duties are performed in accordance with required operational capability (ROC) and p rojected operational environment (POE). 4. Distance Support Concepts for Health Services . Distance support concepts will continue through direct care system support to units pierside and deployed (i.e. through consultation services provided by continent al United States (CONUS) and outside continental United States (OCONUS) military treatment facilities (MTF), digital radiography, and virtual reach back via the world wide web). COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 1-2 a. TMIP -M. The TMIP installed on all CVNs. This framework wi ll host the functionality of maritime medical modules (MMM). Pierside medical care is also enhanced through Citrix access to MTF Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and Composite Health Care Systems (CHCS). This capability wil l precede the eventual movement to an electronic medical record. b. Teleradiology . Teleradiology capability will continue as currently defined with radiology information systems and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). These systems are currently in place and allow radiology reports to be read and results fed back to the ship for disposition. 5. Acronyms . A list of definitions for acronyms contained in this instruction may be found in appendix A. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-1 CHAPTER 2 FORCE MEDICAL 2-1. Organization 1. Role of Force Medical a. COMNAVAIRFOR is responsible for standardized policy that prepares Naval Aviation units for deployments. The mission of COMNAVAIRFOR is manning, personnel, training, equipping, and inspecting units to ensure readiness. COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT medica l and dental personnel are combined at the force level for policy only. COMNAVAIRFOR Force Surgeon will represent COMNAVAIRPAC or COMNAVAIRLANT consensus medical or dental policy to Bureau of Medicine an d Surgery (BUMED); COMNAVAIRFOR; Commander , U.S. Pac ific Fleet (COMPACFLT) ; and Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) . Operational execution and title 10 responsibility flows through the line chains of command. b. TYCOM force surgeons and force dental officers are staff advisors to the li ne and are available for professional or administrative assistance to subordinate operating units. Force medical's role is to: (1) Ensure provision of well -trained, effective medical departments on board CVNs through medical and administrative supervis ion. (2) Provide coordination of staffing, training, and equipment for CVN medical departments, including technical review of the AMAL. (3) Review healthcare providers' credentials, clinical privileges, and provide guidance and oversight for qualit y assurance programs. COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT Force Surgeon s are the BUMED and COMUSFLTFORCOM designated privileging authority for their respective TYCOM. (4) Revise and implement health care services support instructions and directives. (5) Conduct medical readiness inspections (MRI), medical assist visits (MAV), individual medical readiness inspections (IMRI), and any other inspections required by higher authority. (6) Consolidate input on current and future issues facing the fleet and pr omulgate as required . (7) Provide oversight for aeromedical and other health service activities on board CVNs and facilitate coordination with supporting MTF in the provision of health care. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-2 2. Force Medical Staff . The optimal force medical staff may include the following personnel contingent on current staff funding: TITLE LOCATION COMNAVAIRFOR/COMNAVAIRPAC Force Surgeon San Diego, CA COMNAVAIRFOR Deputy Force Surgeon San Diego, CA COMNAVAIRLANT Force Surgeon Norfolk, VA COMNAVAIRLANT/PAC Medical Admin Officer Norfolk, VA COMNAVAIRPAC Force Nurse San Diego, CA COMNAVAIRLANT Force Nurse Norfolk, VA COMNAVAIRPAC Force Mental Heatlh Professional San Diego, CA COMNAVAIRPAC Force Radiation Health Officer San Diego, CA COMNAVAIRLANT Force Radiation Health Officer Norfolk, VA COMNAVAIRLANT/PAC Environmental Health Officer Norfolk, VA COMNAVAIRPAC Force Corpsman San Diego, CA COMNAVAIRLANT Force Corpsman Norfolk, VA Medical Services Professional San Diego, CA Squadron Readiness Corpsman San Diego, CA Logistics Readiness Corpsman San Diego, CA Logistics Readiness Contract Norfolk, VA In addition, depending on manning, the TYCOM may have other resources, which may be utilized by shipboard medical departments. These resources include: a. COMNAVAIR LANT . Aerospace Physiologist and Aero Medical Safety Officer (Code N453) and Industrial Hygiene Officer (Code N454). b. COMNAVAIRPAC . Industrial Hygiene Officer (Code N454) and Aerospace Physiologist (Code N453, additional duty from BUMED M3B 3). 3. Force Medical Points of Contact . Communication between CVN medical departments and the TYCOM force surgeons is essential. TYCOM force surgeons and members of their staff can be contacted via phone, e -mail, or fax at any time. Current telephone and e -mail addresses for staff members are promulgated quarterly. 4. Chain of Command . Medical department administrative and operational control relationships clearly follow those of the ship or line. The administrative connection to COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT force medical continues throughout the deployment cycle. 5. Force Medical Publications . COMNAVAIRFOR force medical publishes periodical newsletter for aeromedical professionals entitled BONES. The newsletter is an official COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-3 publication and contains articles of interest to the aeromedical community written by the TYCOM staff and selected guest authors, content from Naval messages and other items of interest, reference materials, and contact lists. Copies of BONES must be maintained for refer ence by each shipboard medical department. 2-2. Credentials Review and Privileging 1. Privileging Authority . To practice in the Navy, health care providers must be privileged according to current Defense Health Agency (DHA) policy for all DoD components and Military Health System (MHS). The Director of DHA has the ultimate responsibility in the establishment, direct implementation of, and ensure compliance with standards and procedures required by the DHA Procedure Manual (PM) 6025.13. The p rivileging authority remains delegated to each service leadership, DHA Market Director for the Navy is the Surgeon General of the Navy, until full functionality of the DHA is established. Privileging authority for the operational forces has been delegated to the force surgeon, COMUSFLTFORCOM and again one level lower to COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT Force Surgeons. Credentials review and privileging are according to DHA -PM 6025.13, COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLTINST 6320. 2 and as directed by COMUSFLTFORCOM/ COMNAVAIRPAC/COMNAVAIRLANT Force Surgeons. Once a medical staff appointment with clinical privileges is granted by a privileging authority, a provider is eligible to request to provide health care services at all other DON and DoD medical commands using the inter -facility credentials transfer brief (ICTB). 2. Credentials Review Committee (CRC) . The role, responsibilities, and membership of the CRC are outlined in the DHA -PM 6025.13 volume 3, 3, COMUSFLTFORCOMINST/ COMPACFLTINST 6320.2A, and COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.2. The CRC provides a review of the credentials prior to privileging, q uality assurance of the medical records, and case review as required. Recommendations for privileging from the CRC are forwarded to their respective, COMNAVAIRPAC or COMNAVAIRLANT Force Surgeon for action. The CRC also has a role to enhance medical care by developing clinical practice guidelines, evaluating, and improving the processes of delivering medical care in the operational environment. 3. Medical Executive Committee (MEC) . COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLTINST 6320.2A outlines the responsibilities of t he COMUSFLTFORCOM MEC. MEC oversees the credential review and privileging process, provides support to TYCOM surgeons to include TYCOM specific policy and procedure review, and reviews and provides recommendations to the COMUSFLTFORCOM Fleet Surgeon on ad verse privileging actions. MEC will also review privileging applications for TYCOM surgeons and numbered fleet surgeons. 4. Clinical Privileging Requirements a. All licensed clinical providers reporting for permanent duty to COMNAVAIRFOR commands must apply for privileges in accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.2. After COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-4 receipt of the provider's application, the electronic individual credentials file (e -ICF) and all supporting documents, the medical service professional (MSP) reviews and verifies the applicant's credentials. The MSP will then, forward the electronic application package to the assigned levels of credentials reviewer committee and then to the privileging authority for final approval. Notification of privileges granted is sent to the pr ovider through the Joint Centralized Credentialing Quality Assurance System (JCCQAS) and the provider replies by acknowledging the approval. The MSP forwards a copy of the approved privileges to the unit SMO for notification and to include in the provider 's command activity file (CAF). b. Temporary additional duty (TAD) personnel will be granted permission to exercise their clinical privileges using an ICTB, as stated in paragraph 6 of this chapter. For providers under the same privileging authority, i n the case of squadron flight surgeons of COMNAVAIRFOR units, a copy of their current privileges will be provided to the SMO of the receiving unit to include in their temporary CAF. c. Operational Medicine Training Requirements (1) All active medical and allied health providers are responsible for maintaining current basic life support (BLS) certification in accordance with the current military training network (MTN), DoD, and BUMED standards. (2) Prior to arrival at an aviation unit or command, adv anced life support (ALS) training is required of all medical corps officers, physician assistants (PA), nurse corps (NC) officers, and independent duty corpsmen (IDC). Subject to operational commitments, medical officers reporting without ALS or BLS certi fications are required to obtain training at the earliest opportunity. Continued currency or re -certification of ALS is required in accordance with BUMEDINST 1500.15F. (3) Advanced trauma life support (ATLS) training is required of all shipboard medica l corps officers and PAs. Medical providers reporting without ATLS training are required to attend a local ATLS program or the combat casualty care course (C -4) at the earliest opportunity. Continued currency and re -certification of ATLS is required in ac cordance with BUMEDINST 1500.15F. 5. Electronic -Individual Credential File (e -ICF) a. e-ICFs are maintained at COMUSFLTFORCOM for COMNAVAIRLANT -based units and at COMNAVAIRFOR for COMNAVAIRPAC -based units. An electronic copy of all credentials is maintained in JCCQAS, a web -based credentialing database. A duplicate hard copy of the entire file is no longer required and maintained on board. H owever, credential ing CAF will be maintained by the unit SMO, or by his designated credentials coordinator, for each COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-5 provider on board. The file will contain a copy of the electronically approved application for privileges (snapshot) to include a list of core and non -core privileges granted and other requirements listed in paragraph 7 of this chapter. It is the responsibility of each provider to apply for privileges and forward to the MSP any updated, new , or changed documents, and certifications during their assignment to a COMNAVAIRFOR unit. The provider is responsible for providing accurate and current evidence of professional qualifications. The MSP's mailing address is: (1) For COMNAVAIRLANT -based units: Commander, U .S. Fleet Forces Command (N01H) 1562 Mitscher Ave STE 250, Norfolk, VA 23551 MSP can be reached at DSN commercial (757) 836 -5929. (2) For COMNAVAIRPAC -based units: Commander, Naval Air Force s (N01H) Box 357051, NAS North Island San Diego, CA 92135 -7051 The MSP can be reached at DSN 735-1148 or commercial (619) 545 -1148. 6. Inter -facility Credential Transfer Brief (ICTB) . Providers from other privileging authorities must be privileged by their parent command. A document containing the information required in granting privileges in accordance with DHA -PM 6025.13 must be forwarded from the permanent command to COMUSFLTFORCOM (N01H) for COMNAVAIRLANT units and COMNAVAIRFOR (N01H) for COMNAVAIRPAC units for processing and referral to the appropriate privileging authori ty for granting of clinical privileges (see paragraph 5a (1) and (2) of this chapter for the appropriate addresses). The MSP will request an ICTB for reserve component providers from the Centralized Credentialing and Privileging Directorate of the Bure au of Medicine and Surgery Detachment (BUMED -CCPD), Jacksonville, F lorida . The TYCOM privileging authority is tasked with the responsibility of granting clinical privileges based on the information provided in the ICTB. When approved, the staff appoint ment letter and supporting privileging documents will be forwarded , granting permission for the provider to exercise privileges during their assignment to a COMNAVAIRFOR unit. 7. Submission of Performance Appraisal Report (PAR) and Compliance with Professional Practice Evaluations . A PAR is required upon renewal of privileges every two years, renewal after year of initial appointment with privileges, detachment from COMNAVAIRFOR, and for all periods of clinical care exceeding four days for TAD or d eployed providers. Clinical competency must be addressed on the PAR in Section 9 for core privileges and each supplemental privilege granted in section 10. The PAR must be submitted as soon as possible to the appropriate MSP (COMNAVAIRLANT to COMUSFLTFOR COM and COMNAVAIRPAC to COMNAVAIRFOR), prior to the departure of the provider being evaluated and 45 days prior to privilege expiration. The PAR becomes part of the e -ICF by uploading a complete signed copy in the documents section. Failure to submit PAR s in a timely manner may result in a delay COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-6 of privileges. Focused professional practice evaluation (FPPE) and ongoing professional practice evaluation (OPPE) will be completed and maintained on each provider aboard CVNs in the CAF. A n FPPE is required fo r all privileged providers new to COMNAVAIRFOR units and should be completed within three months but not to exceed six months. An OPPE must be completed o n each provider at least every six months on the first of October and first of April for the precedin g six months period not to exceed eight months. FPPE and OPPE compliance will be evaluated during MRI. Note: SMO PAR, FPPE, and OPPE must be forwarded to their respective TYCOM, COMNAVAIRLANT or COMNAVAIRPAC Force Surgeon, for signature. 2-3. Inspections, Certifications, and Assist Visits (ICAV) 1. Crew Certification . Crew certification is the process by which the CSG commander or immediate superior in command (ISIC), supported by COMNAVAIRPAC, COMNAVAIRLANT, and the Afloat Training Group (ATG), ensures a ship is ready to proceed safely to sea with a qualified crew. At the ISIC's request, force medical will assist with crew certification visits. Crew certifications (phases 1, 2, and 3) are conducted on board all COMNAVAIRFOR ships upon completion of new construction or after a maintenance period, as required. Chapter 3 of COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E provides additional information regarding crew certification. Training assessment cards (TAC) provide a checklist and scoring tool that iden tifies specific criteria for medical department crew certification visit. 2. Medical Readiness Inspection (MRI) a. The MRI is a comprehensive, formal administrative and material inspection conducted by force medical to determine the readiness (C -status) of the medical department. It is intended to assess whether the medical department is manned, equipped, and trained to carry out its assigned functions and tasks, and whether it is \"ready for tasking or deployment.\" It includes a determination of whether the medical department is responsively complying with directives from higher authority. The MRI occurs at least onc e in accordance with OFRP and is usually conducted approximately 3 months prior to deployment. The periodicity of MRIs will be adjusted based on changes in the OFRP. In accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E and COMNAVAIRFORINST 1650.15N, the MRI is p art of the Blue \"M\" and Battle Effectiveness (Battle \"E\") awards. b. Force medical will conduct an MRI of each COMNAVAIRFOR CVN. A standardized assessment guide used by inspection teams to conduct the MRI is updated annually and can be obtained from the ir respective TYCOM. The checklist is comprised of six sections: (1) Section A - Administration and Training (2) Section B - Supplies and Equipment COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-7 (3) Section C - Emergency Medical Preparedness (4) Section D - Ancillary Services (5) Section E - Force Health Protection (6) Section F - IDC Program Management c. Each section, as well as the overall inspection, will be assigned a C -status based upon the following criteria: (1) Section grading is generally based upon the percentage of satisfact ory subsections. (2) Overall MRI C -status is determined by averaging the percentage scores of sections A through F. C -status assignment is as follows: (a) C-1 Fully Ready >=90% (b) C-2 Substantially Ready >=80% (c) C-3 Marginally Ready >=75% (d) C-4 Not Ready <75% d. The senior evaluator will verbally debrief both the SMO and the CO at the conclusion of the inspection. A final written report containing the MRI checklist and written comments from the inspection team will be f orwarded to the ship's CO from the TYCOM. Items identified as C - 3 or C -4 in the report will be followed up by the inspection team to ensure they are corrected prior to deployment. 3. Individual Medical Readiness Inspection (IMRI) a. The purpose of this inspection is to determine and validate the level of medical rea diness of the ship's personnel and to evaluate the effectiveness of the periodic health assessment (PHA) program and birth month recall program. Force medical will conduct th is inspection on an annual basis aboard each CVN. This inspection may be conducted concurrent with a regularly scheduled MRI. If no MRI is scheduled for the calendar year, a separate IMRI will be conducted. The inspection will consist of a review of a m inimum of 120 randomly selected records (TMIP and hard copy medical records). Areas to be reviewed and scored include the PHA, dental readiness, medical readiness immunizations, medical readiness laboratory studies, individual medical equipment, and deplo yment limiting conditions. Other areas to be reviewed at the force surgeon's discretion include audiograms, occupational health physicals, women's COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-8 health exams, and annual health record verification. The current IMRI checklist is attached as appendix B. This checklist is updated annually. Check with TYCOM for the current version. b. Medical department shall assess all personnel annually. In addition, personnel checking in and out of a command must process through the medical department. The IMRI has been proven to be effective in maintaining and monitoring overall medical readiness. The program requires command -wide support. c. To facilitate annual assessments, all personnel must report to medical annually during their respective birth month. SECN AVINST 6120.3A details IMR and the PHA process. See chapter 2, section 3, paragraph 4 of this instruction for information regarding the PHA. d. The ship is considered medically ready when the crew reaches the cumulative percentage of 90 on the IMRI , as determined by the percentage of fully medically ready Sailors. e. Department heads will be notified prior to the beginning of each birth month of personnel requiring annual medical readiness verification. Department heads will also be notified of perso nnel failing to complete their birth month medical evaluation and verification. Each department aboard the ship must appoint a birth month recall liaison representative to facilitate the completion of all medical requirements. f. The TMIP must be used to track and manage all medical readiness and immunization requirements for all command personnel. Using the IMR, PHA, and basic medical requirement indicators (e.g., immunizations, tuberculin skin test, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), deoxyribonuclei c acid, audiogram, PHA, and annual record verification), a monthly summary of the overall crew medical readiness will be generated and reported in the monthly medical quality assurance report. g. Pre-deployment health assessment, post -deployment health a ssessment, and post - deployment health reassessment will be conducted in accordance with current directives and instructions (DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health, 11 Aug 06) or any updated version. 4. PHA a. According to DoDI 6025.19, the PHA is one of six components of IMR. The Navy supporting directives are detailed in SECNAVINST 6120.3A. b. The purpose of the PHA is to consolidate medical, occupational health, and risk screening services; medical recor d review; preventive counseling; and risk communica tion under one annual assessment for all active duty service members. c. All service members will receive their PHA on an annual basis preferably during their birth month. Commands may elect to follow another mechanism of assuring annual assessment. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-9 d. Documentation of the PHA will be placed on the DD Form 2766 and NAVMED Form 6120/4. Units are encouraged to utilize programs to populate an electronic version of DD Form 2766. Additionally, program guidance or best practice examples are available from t he Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center website , https://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/epi - data-center/Pages/periodic -health -assessment.aspx . 5. Site Visit . A site visit request is an informal readiness assessment , which focuses on a specific area or areas for improvement in preparation for an MRI. The subject matter expert (SME) usually conduct s the site visits in the specific areas requested. An informal debrief will be provided to the SMO. A site visit can be requested at any time. Arrangeme nts may be made by e-mail to the COMNAVAIRPAC or COMNAVAIRLANT force surgeon s, or to the assigned TYCOM's SME s. A site visit may be conducted at the discretion of the COMNAVAIRPAC or COMNAVAIRLANT force s urgeon s at any time. 6. Medical Assist Visit (MAV) a. This form of readiness assessment focuses on identifying areas for improvement in preparation for an MRI. A written debrief will be provided to the SMO. The CO or executive officer (XO) may also be provided a verbal or written debrief if des ired, or if the inspecting senior evaluator deems it necessary. The MAV should be scheduled no more than 90 days prior to an MRI. Arrangements may be made, with the appr oval of the ship's CO, by e -mailing COMNAVAIRPAC or COMNAVAIRLANT force surgeon s. b. Individual sub -sections of the MAV that are fully ready (C -1) may, at the discretion of the respective force surgeon, count toward the MRI and not be re -inspected. Sections, which are not fully ready, will be inspected during the subsequent MRI. 7. Battle \"E\" Required Sub -Event a. The COMNAVAIRFOR CVN Battle \"E\" competition is designed to measure and recognize the level of battle eff ectiveness through superior performance and readiness by each carrier and its respective departments. The competition is based on a calendar year. Eligibility for the overall Battle \"E\" and departmental awards demands demonstrated operational excellence in addition to superior achievement during inspections, certifications, assessments, and qualifications, and training events conducted throughout the competitive cycle. See COMNAVAIRFORINST 1650.15N for explanation of calculation. b. Ships should coordinate with T YCOM and ATG teams to take advantage of SMEs to grade Battle \"E\" required sub -events during training or assessment visits. Additional instructions of a general nature follow: (1) Battle \"E\" required sub -event grading must be graded by ATG or an externa l agency approved by the TYCOM in accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E. Observers COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 2-10 must be carefully chosen based on seniority, technical background, and experience and must not be assigned to the ship or its associated air wing. (2) Battle \"E\" req uired sub -event scoring for all Battle \"E\" events must be conducted per applicable TACs to the major combat operations (MCO) standard. Battle \"E\" required sub - events will be calculated using the most recent 'P' score reported by an authorized external assessment agency (e.g. ATG or CSG (if authorized by the TYCOM)). Completion of Battle \"E\" required sub -events must be reported to the TYCOM via naval message. (3) Ships in an operational status for 180 days or more must complete all required exercises. Battle \"E\" required sub -events not completed during the competitive cycle will be scored \"zero\" unless waived by the TYCOM. A request for waiver must not be submitted prior to the fourth quarter of the competitive cycle and will require justification tha t all means were exhausted in accomplishing the requirement. CSG endorsement will indicate efforts expended to assist the ship in obtaining opportunity, observers, or services to meet the requirement. If the TYCOM grants the waiver, the event will be com puted as an average of the grade submitted by other competitors (fleet average). If the event is not waived, it will be considered incomplete and will be scored \"zero\" and counted accordingly in the computation for relative standing. Except in unusual cir cumstances, waiver request received by the TYCOM later than 15 days after completion of the competitive cycle will be disapproved. (4) Carryover of Unit Level Training (ULT) Events and ICAV Scores . Due to the structure and timing of the OFRP, ships wi ll not always conduct ULT events or receive inspections and certifications (not counting re -inspections) normally factored into calculations each calendar year. In these instances, scores from the previous cycle completion will be carried over provided the y remain within the periodicity specified in the training and readiness (T and R) matrix and applicable governing instructions. 8. Other Major CVN Inspections and Assessments . The following lists other inspections , or assessments conducted during the OFRP for all CVNs: Inspection or Assessment Inspectors Directives Command Assessment of Readiness and Training (CART) CART I - Conducted prior to ship's return from deployment.

It is awarded each calendar year based upon prior fiscal year data. Multiple recipients are possible. The Blue \"M\" is one of the departmental awards that count towards the overal l CVN Battle \"E\" award. 2. Blue \"M\" CVN Award Computation . Criteria for determining awarding of the Blue \"M\" can be found in COMNAVAIRFORINST 1650.15N. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 3-1 CHAPTER 3 AIRCRAFT CARRIER CYCLE 3-1. Background 1. OFRP . The OFRP was designed to meet the requirements of the fleet training continuum. The OFRP is a flexible and scalable approach to training, which is managed by TYCOM during the maintenance and basic phase and by COMUSFLTFORCOM and COMPACFLT during the integrated and sustainment phases. The OFRP aligns Navy capabilities and missions, in support of combatant commander and Navy requirements. OFRP requirements are defined through fleet training instructions. The OF RP ensures naval capabilities are aligned with mission essential tasks and potential operational tasking. A complete explanation of the OFRP, including diagrams that explain the OFRP events, is outlined in COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E, chapter 3. 2. Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) . The ORFP ensures naval capabilities are aligned with mission essential tasks and potential operational tasking. By nature of location, the FDNF CVN has different training opportunities available compared to CONUS units. For ward deployed operations tempo (OPTEMPO) affords opportunities to maintain tactical proficiency through dedicated training events in conjunction with regional and exercise commitments. Therefore, the FDNF CVN remains within the sustainment phase and compli es with the requirements of this phase as specified in T and R matrix in support of the overarching Commander, U.S. SEVENTH Fleet training plan. FDNF training is discussed in detail in chapter 8 of COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E. 3-2. Maintenance 1. Guideli nes for Depot Level Maintenance Availability a. Introduction . Availability periods for maintenance and modernization are a routine experience for the ship. A short (three to six months) shipyard period poses a significant distraction to the function of the medical department. A long (one to three years) shipyard period may necessitate relocation of the medical department off -ship to a floating accommodation facility (FAF) and result in the complete redesign or reconstruction of departmental spaces. Th e preparation requirements for shipyard periods begin long before the ship conducts a berth sh ift to the shipyard. Planning 6 to 12 months ahead of time (three or more fiscal years in the case of complex over -haul or refueling complex over -haul (RCOH) due to the requirement for early dedication of significant financial and material resources) is essential for a successful availability period. Advance liaison with the ship's maintenance manager is essential to ensuring the inclusion and prioritization of m edical department deferred maintenance and alteration actions in the current ship's maintenance project. Refer to OPNAVINST 4790.4F for guidance on the submission of deferred maintenance actions via the ship's maintenance action form, OPNAV Form 4790/2K. Medical department planning personnel must be knowledgeable COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 3-2 with the Organizational Maintenance Management System -Next Generation (OMMS -NG). The work package is derived from this system and it tracks all work during the yard period. b. Unique Challenge s of Shipyard Periods . Shipyard periods constitute a significant change in the routine and emphasis of the medical department. Demands significantly increase for the medical department leadership. The challenge is to plan ahead, manage resources success fully, and ensure maintenance actions remain on schedule. The absence of a well -planned employment schedule can lead to shortsighted goals and ultimately cause severe morale problems. A shipyard period tends to be more difficult on the medical department than a major deployment. As for many other departments, these periods can afford individuals the time necessary for more extensive off -ship training. c. Medical Surveillance Programs (1) General . During any shipyard period, there will generally be an increase in personnel placed in the hearing conservation, sight protection, and respiratory protection programs. The industrial hygiene officer (IHO) should identify personnel that, due to yard status, may fall into a different or additional occupation al health surveillance programs. Personnel should receive appropriate physical examinations prior to arriving in the shipyard. Personnel requiring specific physical examinations must be identified by the IHO, based on their evaluation of work center functions and process data. Most medical surveillance programs will continue during the yard period as identified in the industrial hygiene baseline survey. However, special or additional physical examinations may be required for unique overhaul requirements such as asbestos rip outs and gasket repairs, lead -based paint removal, ventilation duct cleaning, void rehabilitation teams, fire watch teams, and habitability improvement. Good communication between departments is essential, both at the leading chief p etty officer (LCPO) and department head levels. Department organization must identify Sailors exposed to hazards and referred or recalled by the medical department for care. Continuous monitoring by birth month recall and keeping TMIP rosters and follow -up of \"no -shows\" are essential for maintaining a successful program. (2) Hearing Conservation . The ship's audiometric booth should be certifiable for in port, flight operations and \"at -sea\". Usually, the ship's audiometric booth is not certifiable w hile in the shipyard. Excessive noise on the hangar bay makes it almost impossible to perform audiograms. If possible, arrangements should be made with shipyard personnel to avoid noisy or vibrating machinery from being placed directly over medical space s. Refer to the IHO or the local MTF for support services. (3) Collecting Holding and Transfer (CHT) and Potable Water Supply Problems . CHT and potable water services are occasionally interrupted. It is wise to have a contingency plan if these servic es are disrupted, such as, a plan for the availability and access to water from other locations for proper hand washing. If accessible, the potable water tank located in the main battle dressing stations (BDS) can also be utilized. Potable water supplied onboard should COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 3-3 continue to be tested for halogen residual and bacterial contamination by preventive medicine technicians. (4) Preventive Medicine Inspections . The CO and department heads should be advised that certain sanitation and habitability inspe ctions might be reduced or not conducted as spaces are being reworked or are inaccessible. (5) Pest Control . Pest infestation may increase during the beginning of the shipyard period. Prior to entering the yards, all personnel should be educated conce rning the correlation between food debris and pest infestation. This education can be accomplished through training classes or plan of the day notes. 2. Healthcare During Availability a. Continue to provide the full range of health care for ship's company, except for inpatient care. Medical sick call, routine appointments, and physical examinations continue, and may increase, due to the stress of the shipyard environment. Consultations to MTFs continue to require management and may be more difficu lt, since shipyards may be far from the supporting MTF. The medical response teams (MRT) continue to be important for crew and worker safety, but patients will usually be turned over to shore facilities for treatment. Advance liaison with any shipyard he alth care assets should include discussions about maintaining medical control of medical emergencies on the ship and procedures for turning over a patient to responding medical personnel. Advance liaison with the local MTF for ancillary services support s hould also be considered if necessary. b. Keep Medical Close to the Ship . Keep the commitment to providing the highest quality care as close to the ship as possible. While all care might be able to be referred to the local MTF, such a practice would wa ste work hours by ship 's force members. The CO will be concerned about the work accomplished by the ship's force and every additional hour of work counts. Expect a lot of command scrutiny about medical TAD for treatment, personnel losses from medical boa rds, and status of inpatient care at shore MTFs. c. Yard Period Effects on Medical Complaints . Orthopedic, respiratory illness, and communicable diseases tend to increase during the yard period. The incidence of psychiatric patients with suicidal ideat ion, stress, and occupational problems also tend to increase significantly. d. MRT Emergencies and Deep Extrications . Most deep rescue victims provide unique rescue circumstances. Coordination with the damage control assistant (DCA) to obtain deep rescue drill training prior to entering the shipyard is prudent. A team, as designated by the ship's standard organization regulations manual (SORM), must be formed with the necessary expertise, to include riggers, and other required personnel according to ch apter 14, section 2, paragraph 7d. Each medical department watchstanding team must have one staff member trained to provide COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 3-4 medical support and assistance in the event of a deep rescue extrication. Additional coordination will need to be established with the local emergency medical system. e. Reactor Work and Effect on Main Medical and Dental . During reactor refueling, the entire health service department will be completely removed to allow access to the reactors. Health care will be provided onboard t he FAF. Extra effort may be required to maintain IMR, occupational health surveillance programs, and ship -wide support programs. The shipyard has teams that respond to nuclear contamination incidents. Ship's force will need to coordinate efforts with th e shipyard's response teams. f. Medical Department Maintenance and Modernization (1) Shipyard Liaison and Tracking of Maintenance Actions . Establish liaison with the availability project team and work centers performing ship's force maintenance actio ns in medical spaces. Interface, on a regular basis, with shipyard personnel who are performing maintenance and alterations. Ensure accurate tracking and timely follow -up of all medical department maintenance actions. Even with persistent daily tracking , be prepared for numerous delays. Ensure maintenance actions have been screened for accuracy and reviewed by the medical department representative (normally the departmental Material and Maintenance Management (3M) system assistant) prior to close -out or acceptance. Once accepted, any further action to repair or replace faulty equipment or perform additional work will, most likely require additional expenditure of scarce funds. Any action that causes a work stoppage may have similar effects. (2) Medi cal Personnel Performing Maintenance or Rehabilitation . If rehabilitation of medical spaces is performed by medical personnel (lagging, painting, tiling, terrazzo), teams must be established to ensure that they are properly trained to perform the task. T he teams must be dedicated to rehabilitation duties if the work is to be completed on time. These personnel will usually not be available to assist in daily patient care. If available, utilize ship's teams (e.g. paint team, etc). This process will free up medical personnel to perform other rehab duties in the medical spaces. (3) Impact on Patient Care . If the medical department remains on the ship during the yard period, changes and moves should be expected to perform any rehabilitation of medical spaces. This requirement may necessitate a change in sick call hours and create numerous difficulties for ensuring efficient patient flow and effective patient privacy. (4) Anticipating Potential Problems . Anticipating work in other areas of the ship may impact work done (or not done) in medical department spaces (e.g., hot work being done in spaces above, below, or adjoining medical spaces could cause resulting damage to existing decks, paint, equipment, etc.; or work being done by shipyard personnel in medical spaces may delay medical department rehabilitation efforts until completed). Equipment not properly prepared or protected for storage or subjected to unexpected environmental conditions may COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 3-5 become irreparably damaged and require force medical a ssistance for emergent procurement action. This equipment damage should be preventable if proper inactive equipment maintenance (IEM) procedures are followed, in accordance with OPNAVINST 4790.4F, and the equipment is properly secured or protected. Unexp ected shipyard delays may result in medical moving back on board the ship immediately preceding the ship's departure from the yards. This delay may allow little time for spaces to set up, cleaned, and stocked for return to sea. Also, anticipate the poten tial for the AMAL to become severely depleted during an availability period, especially if supplies are moved off the ship and expired shelf life items have not been routinely surveyed and reordered. A complete AMAL will be required when the ship leaves t he shipyard and returns to normal operations. g. Ship Coordinated Offload and Outfitting Plan (SCOOP) . Applies only to CVNs immediately preceding RCOH. The purpose of SCOOP is to make preparations for RCOH. Equipment is removed from the ship, sorted a nd designated for either disposal or retention. Offload plan may include redistribution with TYCOM coordination. (1) Equipment and Supplies . In preparation for going into the shipyard for RCOH, the medical department will be required to package, inven tory, sort, and remove all equipment and supplies for storage, redistribution, or disposal. The majority of the medical department will be required to conduct this event. Equipment and supplies will be transferred to temporary storage (if pending FAF ava ilability), long term warehouse storage (anything that will be returned to the medical spaces when the department is put back together at the end of RCOH), or Defense Reutilization Management Office (DRMO) for disposal. Ensure proper IEM procedures are followed, in accordance with OPNAVINST 4790.4F, for equipment that will be inactivated for periods of prolonged idleness (i.e., equipment designated for long -term storage). Ensure proper accounting for all emergency supplies distributed throughout the ship such as first aid boxes (FAB), mass casualty boxes, and report on the monthly quality assurance report as directly by TYCOM. (2) Medical and Dental Care (a) Sick Call . If the FAF is not immediately available at the time of SCOOP, arrangements shall be made with the local MTF to provide space for the medical department to provide basic sick call for the ship's crew. This problem frequently occurs based on the facts that this event occurs prior to entering the shipyard where the FAF is located. If s uch arrangements are made, some supplies and equipment may need to be transferred to the MTF to support this interim period. Lab, pharmacy, and x -ray services will be maintained to the maximum extent possible. (b) Emergency Care . At least one MRT will be maintained on board for the provision of emergency care. Emergency care will be coordinated with the shipyard and regional emergency medical system. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 3-6 (c) Transportation . Transportation to the sick call site (if relocated to the local MTF) will need to be provided for the ship's crew. Separate transportation (duty van) may also be required for transport of lab samples, x -rays, or to complete other medical related errands. h. Preparation Timeline Guide . The following guide should be used in a nticipation of a yard period: (1) 12 Months Prior to Entering the Yard (a) Establish rapport with the IHO and agree on strict criteria for placing personnel on medical surveillance programs. (b) Thoroughly review OPNAVINST 5100.19F and OPNAVINST 5100.23G CH -1 requirements for the hearing conservation program, respiratory protection program, lead medical surveillance, isocyanates, CHT systems and spills, heat stress program, asbestos medical surveillance program, polychlorinated biphenyls, and oth er programs. (c) As appropriate be involved in overhaul issues. (2) 9 to 12 Months Prior to Entering the Yard (a) Provide in -depth on -the-job training using occupational health assets. (b) Provide in -class training using current Chief of Nav al Operations ( OPNAV ) instructions, The Navy Occupational Safety and Health (NAVOSH) program manual , and local command instructions. (c) Train LCPOs, division officers ( DIVO ), and department heads in the requirements for different occupational health p rograms. (d) Identify specific personnel who will be assigned to the habitability team. (3) 6 to 9 Months Prior to Entering the Yard (a) A major part of the medical department's shipyard period may revolve around coordinating space allocation or moving off the ship. Spaces must be identified well in advance to avoid disruption. (b) Local MTF and related service support must be identified. Medical support may be required from other DoD services or civilian hospitals. These facilities must b e prepared to accept a large influx of Navy active duty personnel. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 3-7 (c) Safety department will assist other departments by augmenting their personal protective equipment needs. Safety equipment must be ordered by the safety department, including respir ators, respirator cartridges, Tyvek coveralls, goggles, gloves, eye and hearing protection. (4) 3 to 6 Months Prior to Entering the Yard . Construct database for assigned personnel. (5) 0 to 3 Months Prior to Entering the Yard (a) Physical examinations and routine follow -ups are required for crewmembers conducting maintenance and modernization of the ship. Examples of systems that may require monitoring during overhaul are steam systems, CHT systems, fuel tanks, catapult system s, removal and replacement of lagging, surface restoration, gasket repair and replacement, brake maintenance, and vent cleaning. (b) Personal protection equipment training must be conducted in advance for the use of Tyvek coveralls, gloves, eye protect ion, hearing protection and all respirators. (c) Training must be provided to medical department personnel if they will be required to use fire extinguishers (e.g., water, CO 2, and PKP), fire hoses and nozzles, pneumatic grinders, sanders, and deck cra wlers. (d) Try to arrange \"one stop\" occupational health physical examinations and ensure that the medical officer is allotted adequate time to see personnel using appointments. 3. Crew Certification . Crew certification is the process by which the sh ip's ISIC, supported by the TYCOM and the ATG, ensures the crew is qualified and the carrier is ready to proceed safely to sea following a maintenance or new construction. Crew certification, fast cruise, sea trials, and shakedown evolutions are outlined in chapter 3 of COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E . COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-1 CHAPTER 4 ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL 1. Medical Department Organization a. The ship's medical department organization must be documented in the ship's SORM or in a departmental SOP and must delineate the organization, chain of command, duties, and responsibilities of each functional area or significant position within the medical department. This document will include job descriptions for all medical department personnel. b. All medical department personnel must familiarize themselves with the contents of the medical department's organization instruction. c. The ship's medi cal department organization guidance should contain a diagram outlining the organizational relationships that exist within the department and the chain of command. Figure 4 -1 shows a recommended medical department organization chart. Medical providers performing patient care services have responsibility for the work done in their sections; however, the coordination of watch bills, training and disciplinary functions necessitates coordination between the various divisions. The medical administrative offic er and department leading chief petty officer (DLCPO) generally accomplish this coordination. The DLCPO, as the senior enlisted member of the department, remains as the de facto primary mentor and career counselor to all enlisted assigned to the medical d epartment. It is important for supervisors to work together to ensure the efficient, effective deployment of staff and to contribute to fitness reports and evaluations. Figure 4 -1 Recommended Medical Department Organization. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-2 2. Manning . Manning for e ach ship's medical department may be found within the activity manning document (AMD). This document lists all billets and associated subspecialty codes and Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) codes for both officer and enlisted personnel. A listing of typical billets authorized for CVN medical departments may be found in appendix C. All unplanned losses of medical department personnel must be reported to the TYCOM force medical office (refer to section 7 of this chapter) for requesting TAD medical person nel support). A monthly review should be completed and any shortfalls should be reported to TYCOM force medical the third week of each month. This will allow TYCOM force medical to prioritize billets with TYCOM N1. 3. Duties, Cognizance, and Qualific ations a SMO and Carrier Strike Group Surgeon . The head of the medical department aboard a CVN must be a designated flight officer preferably board -certified in aerospace medicine and a designated naval flight surgeon. In addition to those general duti es prescribed by Navy Regulations for a department of the crew, conducting inspections incident thereto and advising the CO as to the hygiene, habitability, sanitation, and safety matters within his or her purview which affect the command. SMO must additi onally be responsible for the administrative and material readiness of the medical department. The SMO reports to the CO in matters related to the health or well -being of the crew, keeping the XO appropriately informed. The SMO reports to the XO in matte rs related to the administration of the medical department and reports to the embarked flag or chief of staff in health matters of CVN strike group cognizance. The SMO must: (1) Supervise and direct the department to provide medical services for person nel of the ship, all embarked military personnel, and all other authorized personnel. (2) Report to the CO any condition within the command or community that may endanger the health of either. In this regard, the SMO must fully cooperate with local hea lth authorities. (3) Conduct physical examinations and advise the CO as to the health of personnel. (4) Ensure that the crew is adequately trained in the techniques of basic first aid, radiation health, use of litters, and the handling of multiple c asualties. (5) The medical department will ensure that supplies and equipment are ordered, inspected, and accounted for. (see chapter 11, which outlines these responsibilities) (6) Conduct aviation physical and psychological examinations as necessary to determine the fitness of flight personnel and recommend to the CO the grounding of flight personnel found not qualified or not aeronautically adapted for duty involving flying. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-3 (7) Ensure compliance with all pertinent quarantine regulations and assi st local health authorities as necessary. (8) Report to the embarked flag or chief of staff for additional duties as CSG surgeon.

Additional training guidance is pr ovided in chapter 13, section 2, paragraph 6, of this instruction. 4. Watchstanding a. In homeport, a BLS medical response capability is the minimum medical capability that must be maintained on board the ship at all times. The duty medical officer (physician) may be ashore on weekends, or after normal working hours, but must be in contact via telephone or any other available communication means at all times. Significant cases should be discussed by telephone with the duty medical officer and all pa tient treatment entries must be cosigned on the next working day. Each CVN medical department must have a written protocol that defines \"significant\" cases that require contact with the duty medical officer. Emergency cases may warrant immediate referral to the nearest emergency room if the duty medical officer cannot be reached in a timely manner. b. In ports other than homeport, the CVN medical department must maintain the capability to provide all of its usual medical services. Specifically, the dep artment must maintain routine outpatient, inpatient and advance life support (ALS) medical response capabilities on board. A duty medical officer must be on board at all times, unless a waiver of this requirement has been specifically granted by the TYCOM . Except in emergencies, all medical department officers will only stand duty in the medical department. This policy does not interfere with standing watches to achieve warfare qualifications or competitive fitness report ranking as long as the COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-15 medical o fficer can be released immediately to respond to an emergency, and they are not assigned as the primary duty medical officer. c. Except in emergencies, all HMs should perform medical duties and watches strictly within the confines of providing medical ca re. d. During flight quarters, the flight deck BDS must be manned by two \"flight deck - qualified\" HMs at all times. During underway periods, this responsibility must be shared equitably by the organic medical department HMs and the CVW HMs. 5. Watch Q uarter and Station Bill (WQSB) . A current WQSB must be conspicuously posted within the medical department. The bill must identify assignments for conditions of normal operations, general quarters, mass casualty, MRTs, sea and anchor, contaminated injured sailor, abandon ship, and man overboard. All medical department personnel and personnel assigned to medical watch stations (including stretcher -bearers and phone talkers specified in chapter 14, section 1, paragraph 1, of his instruction) must be listed on the WQSB. 6. Medical Personnel from Embarked Units a. Flight Surgeons (1) Embarked CVW . Whenever a CVW is embarked, all air wing flight surgeons will accompany the wing aboard and report to the SMO upon arrival for duty in accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.2. CVW flight surgeons remain under the primary administrative and operational control of the CVW commander but are responsible to the SMO and strike group surgeon for medical matters. Flight surgeons will stand duties and watches a s assigned by the SMO. (2) Carrier Qualifications . The ship's complement will be augmented with at least one flight surgeon in support of each CVN qualification period. Under normal conditions, flight surgeons from units participating in CVN qualifica tions will embark with their respective units. When squadrons cannot provide the required flight surgeons, the appropriate COMNAVAIRLANT or COMNAVAIRPAC force surgeon's office will be informed in time to institute appropriate action. COMNAVAIRPACINST 130 1.9A/COMNAVAIRLANTINST 1301.6G apply. b. Hospital Corpsman (HM) . Whenever a CVW is embarked, all CVW squadron HMs will accompany their respective squadrons aboard. In accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.2, they will report to the CVW senior flight su rgeon. Squadron HMs are expected to work with the CVN medical department in a mutually supportive manner, assist with departmental duties and be integrated into the medical department watchbill. Squadron HMs will continue to fulfill their responsibilitie s to their parent squadron for various operational, medical, dental, and administrative matters (i.e. squadron readiness meetings or functions). When embarked, COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-16 squadron HMs must store all squadron personnel medical records in the medical department's medi cal records room and the squadron HMs will be responsible for maintaining their respective squadron's readiness. The ship's medical DLCPO may provide performance evaluation input to the CVW flight surgeon or LCPO for squadron HMs. Search and rescue (SAR) medical technicians will remain assigned to squadrons, thus allowing them to stand ready -duty SAR alert, medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), aircrew duties, and maintain squadron readiness. c. CSG HM . The CSG HM reports directly to the CSG staff. While emba rked, the CSG HM will coordinate with the medical DLCPO and MAO to manage medical movement and plans operations and medical intelligence officer (POMI) activities within the CSG. CSG HM will conduct renewal of performance assessments during sustainment in accordance with COMNAVAIRFOR 3400.20E. 7. TAD and Temporary Additional Duty (TEMADD) Medical Personnel Support . Active duty support is occasionally needed for short -term coverage. Support for a longer term may also be necessary to bridge a gap between an unplanned loss and the arrival of a permanent replacement. Except in emergencies, a three -month advance notice is required. TAD support may also be available through the use of reserve component assets. Requests for reserve component support must be submitted as far in advance as possible. Requests for TAD or TEMADD medical support must specify a required onboard arrival time of no later than 24 hours prior to the ship getting underway to allow for unexpected travel delays. Medical providers must e nsure an ICTB is forwarded to appropriate TYCOM force surgeon's office. a. Anesthesia and General Surgeon . During every underway, according to the required operational capabilities (ROC) and projected operating environment (POE), general surgeon and anesthesia coverage is required, unless assigned on the AMD. Anesthesia support is provided by a designated anesthesia department at a specific BUMED MTF, according to BUMED (Code M3/5 C) with the exception of the Ford class who are permanently assigned on A MD. A general surgeon is permanently assigned on the CVN AMD. General surgery coverage is via permanent change of station orders to each operational CVN. Because some surgeons do not have the opportunity to complete boards before arriving to the CVN, a planned absence of the ship's surgeon may be necessary. Surgical specialty boards usually occur during the August time frame and oral boards are usually in October. A proactive inquiry should be made before a new surgeon reports aboard to determine if th ey will need to take their boards. If confirmed, a request for TAD support must be initiated, as far in advance as possible, to ensure general surgery coverage during all underway periods. (1) Three months prior to a desired coverage period, the CVN wi ll send an unclassified Naval message (i.e., not mentioning ship's movement, specific underway periods, or other operational security information) to COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT, as appropriate, identifying the required specialty, dates of coverage need ed, and ship's point of contact. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-17 (2) Annual coverage for anesthesia during planned absences is coordinated via unclassified naval message to COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT, as appropriate, indicating anticipated dates of TAD coverage due no later than 1 July of each year. (3) COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT will coordinate with COMUSFLTFORCOM and BUMED, via the appropriate chain of command, to ensure that each CVN has anesthesia coverage during all required periods. (4) The responsible MTF will su pply and fund TAD anesthesia support to the homeport of the designated CVN. (5) Close follow up of all requests will ensure that anesthesia support personnel are identified well in advance of each underway period. (6) It should be noted that new gene ral surgeons may come directly from civilian residencies and will need significant transition support to include military identification issuance and in -processing support. (7) Appendix D provides sample TAD support request message templates. b. Reque st for Support (RFS) . Medical department support (other than general surgery and anesthesia) is requested via the TYCOM. Direct requests to MTFs are not authorized. Requests should be initiated at a minimum of three months prior to the dates required (e xcept in the case of an emergency or unplanned loss). See appendix D for sample messages. When available, contact via phone or e -mail must be made with force medical prior to initiating any request to allow TYCOM to utilize internal resources, if availab le. Requests for TAD support to cover planned absences must be submitted with as much lead time as possible. Significant advance notice also improves the opportunity to utilize reserve assets to support the identified requirement. Note: If a reservis t is identified to fill the requirement, ensure coordination with the ship's reserve liaison officer (RLO) for logistics requirements and the assignment of a billet control number (BCN) as well as the credentialing staff at their respective TY COM MSP. The requesting CVN will be responsible for providing funding data to the supporting command. c. Enlisted (1) Permanent Loss (a) Notification of enlisted requirements as a result of unplanned loss is accomplished through the submission of the enlisted manning inquiry report (EMIR). EMIR guidance is delineated in the MILPERSMAN 1306 -108. This article establishes a Navy -wide EMIR for COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-18 personnel shortages having a significant effect on unit readiness. Units will submit an EMIR message report to Navy Personnel Command (NAVPERSCOM), Enlisted Personnel Readiness and Support Branch (PERS -4013) on the occasion of an enlisted personnel manning concern meeting the criteria outlined below. To qualify for submission as an EMIR, the personnel shortage sho uld meet one of the following criteria: 1. Current on board or projected on board manning in the applicable rating or closed loop and transitory NEC is below Navy Manning Plan or billets authorized, whichever is less. 2. Personnel in the followin g categories: careerist not re -enlisting, personnel being administratively separated, death, humanitarian reassignment, non -volunteers removed from duty involved with flying, diving, explosive ordinance disposal, pregnancy, HIV, and immediate availabiliti es. 3. In the opinion of the CO, the personnel shortage has a significant effect on unit readiness. (b) The EMIR is not to be used to report general manning problems, or for reporting unplanned loss of personnel who do not have significant effect on unit readiness. Do not submit an EMIR until the member is a permanent loss from the command. (c) Ensure submission of an EMIR is coordinated with the ship's personnel office. EMIR messages are submitted to COMNAVPERSCOM MILLINGTON TN//PERS -4013XX with information addressee copy to the TYCOM (Personnel and Force Medical) COMPACFLT PEARL HARBOR HI, and COMCOMUSFLTFORCOM NORFOLK VA. (2) Temporary Loss . Before RFS messages are forwarded to COMUSFLTFORCOM or PERS 4013 for action, notification of enl isted requirements as a result of a temporary unplanned loss will be made via message to the TYCOM (personnel and force medical). When available, contact via phone or e -mail must be made with force medical prior to initiating any request. Other TYCOM ass ets will be utilized whenever possible. d. Reserve . Medical department personnel reservists may be available to provide fleet support. Any requirement for reserve support must be coordinated with the ship's RLO prior to submitting a request via TYCOM t o BUMED. The RLO needs to be aware of all embarked reservists and has the responsibility for coordinating logistics and the assignment of a BCN for each requirement. Requests for reserve support will be submitted to BUMED (code M3F and M10) with informat ion addressee copy to the TYCOM (force medical and reserve liaison). 8. Off-duty COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 4-19 a. MILPERSMAN 5370 -010 establishes policy for all members of the Naval service with regard to off -duty or outside employment. b. Privile ged 6025.13, -050 and 97 -019 MANMED article 1 -22 (22 Aug 1998) provide policy for off -duty remunerative professional civilian employment, including self-employment, of active duty Navy medical department officers. No Navy medical department officer on active duty may engage in any off -duty remunerative employment without first obtaining the endorsement of the CO and approval from COMNAVAIRPAC or COM NAVAIRLANT Force Surgeon. The local command has the primary responsibility for control of off -duty employment by Navy medical department officers. Appendix E must be used to submit requests to the privileging authority for approval and submit quarterly r eports. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-1 CHAPTER 5 ADMINISTRATION 5-1 Records, Reports, and References 1. Manuals, Documents, and Instructions a. Organizational Document . According to chapter 4, section 1, paragraph 1, the organization of each medical department must be documented in a ship's SORM or in a departmental SOP. The document must define the chain of command and delineate duties and responsibilities of each fu nctional area or significant position within the medical department. b. SOP Manuals . Work centers within the medical department must establish an SOP manual providing detailed step by step information on the daily routine and how to conduct each proced ure or function. The cognizant work center supervisor must review the SOPs annually, updated as necessary, submitted to the MAO for review, and submitted to the SMO for approval. SOPs are a valuable tool to initially provide medical department staff with pertinent information to successfully complete medical department training requirements , and for periodic review thereafter , for refresher training. The SMO must approve each SOP by signature on the cover page; the SMO and each member assigned to that wo rk center must review the SOP annually and document said review by their signature and date on the signature page in the SOP. SOPs are to be used as references and not as a substitute for training. SOPs are required, at a minimum, for the following work centers: Administration Radiology Clinical Psychology SARP Laboratory and Blood Bank Training Operating Room (including Anesthesia) Treatment Room Pharmacy and CSIB Ward and ICU Physical Examinations Birth Month Recall and IMR Physical Therapy Sick Call Radiation Health Force Health Protection Defense 2. Records and Logs . Records and logs may be in an electronic, book, or log form and in sufficient detail to serve as a complete and permanent historical record for actions, incidents, and other recorded data. Electronic logs are permitted only if daily, weekly, and monthly backup copies are maintained in order to minimize the chance of data loss. The following records and logs must be maintained within the medical d epartment: a. Medical Department Daily Journal (Duty Log) . Each ship must maintain a medical department daily journal. The journal will contain a complete history of the medical department. It must indicate personnel admitted to or discharged from the ward, reports of perso nnel casualties, injuries, and deaths, inspection of fresh provisions, ship drills, brig visits, sanitation COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-2 inspections, and all other occasions of medical significance. The journal must be routed through the DLCPO, reviewed daily by the MAO, and signed b y the SMO. If the journal is maintained electronically, a hard copy will be printed daily and signed by the SMO. The journal is a permanent record and must be retired in accordance with SECNAVINST 5210.8E. b. Statistical Data Log (Sick Call Log) . A daily statistical data , or sick call log must be maintained. The log must contain the date and time reported, the individual's name, rate, division (or ship if different from treating facility), complaint, diagnosis, treatment, disposition, and time when patie nt departed sick call. The purpose of the log is to provide an audit trail for medical care provided to each patient. The TMIP medical encounter module is the preferred method to record sick call log data. Each patient's diagnosis will be coded with th e most specific available diagnostic code. To protect patient confidentiality, this log must not be available for other patients to see. c. Consult Log . A consult log must be kept to track the specialty consult process. Follow - up is needed to ensure p atients receive appointment The ordering provider needs to review the completed SF -513 (military), DD Form 2161 (civilian), or documented in Composite Health Care System (CHCS). The following tracking elements will be incorporated in the log: patient name, last four, division, consulted specialty and working diagnosis, date submitted, consult date, consult returned and reviewed by the ordering provider. d. Pathological and Biopsy Specimen Log . A pathological and biopsy specimen log is to be maintaine d with documentation that all patients have been notified of their pathology results, and that the ordering provider has reviewed the results and the results are filed in the patient's medical record. This log is to be maintained for two years and retired in accordance with SECNAVINST 5210.8E. e. Operating Room Log . An operating room log is to be maintained with documentation for each surgery performed in the operating room. This log will contain the patient's name, date, procedure, surgeon, anesthetis t, type of anesthesia, pre -op or post -op diagnosis, and pathology specimens obtained. f. Training Log . A training log is to be maintained to document all lectures and training periods conducted in accordance with the training program for ship's company and medical department personnel. All drills are to be documented in this log. A muster sheet is to be maintained on file for each lecture given. If training is documented in the ship's Relational Administration Data Management Application (R -ADM) database, this will suffice for this requirement. g. Bulk Controlled Medicinals Record . The bulk custodian will maintain and retain the bulk controlled medicinal record, with a copy kept in the medical department. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-3 h. Working Stock Controlled Medicinals Record . The working stock custodian will retain and maintain the controlled medicinal record, with a copy kept with the bulk controlled medicinal custodian. i. Potable Water Log . Daily chlorine water testing as wel l as weekly bacteriological water testing is required to be recorded in the log. The potable water log in TMIP will be used to meet this requirement. j. Pest Control Log . A pest control log must be maintained, containing the date, time, and location of areas surveyed or sprayed aboard the vessel. The TMIP pest control log will be used to meet this requirement. k. Ancillary Service Logs . Records of all laboratory tests and x -ray studies performed and prescriptions dispensed (including over the counte r medications) must be maintained in accordance with chapter 8, section 1, paragraphs 1 -5; section 2, paragraph 4 (a -b); and section 3, paragraph 1 (a -d), of this instruction. l. Sterilization Log . A sterilization log must be maintained in accordance wi th chapter 8, section 5, paragraph 2 (a -f), of this instruction. m. Medical Waste Disposal Log . A medical waste log must be maintained to include the following elements: date, type of waste, amount (number of boxes, volume or weight), storage location, method of disposal, date of disposal, tracking number, and receiving activity with signature of recipient. Ensure use of DD Form 1348 -1A for transfer of waste to shore facilities. Refer to chapter 17 for additional information. n. Sexually Transmitte d Disease (STD) Log . A current STD log will be kept using the TMIP format or equivalent. o. Equipment Maintenance Record . A NAVMED Form 6700/3 will be maintained on all medical and dental equipment. All equipment will also be included in the Organizat ional Material Management System -Next Generation (OMMS -NG) system. 3. Health Records a. Privileged Communication . The health record is a legal document, containing an individual's past and present medical history. The health record is the property of the U.S. Government, not the individual. The manner of custody will be such as to protect its personal nature. Administration and management of health records will be in accordance with MANMED, chapter 16. The Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Insurance P ortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, and SECNAVINST 5211.5F govern release of health records information. MANMED, chapter 23, section III, sets forth release guidelines. The service treatment records (STR) should not be allowed to leave the medical department, except COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-4 as needed to facilitate consultative medical care. Medical department personnel have a legal responsibility to secure protected medical and personally identifiable information and to ensure that any dissemination of that inform ation is made in accordance with applicable law and regulations. b. Verification . Health records must be maintained according to chapter 16 of the MANMED and other relevant directives. They must be verified annually, during the annual PHA, and upon rec eipt or transfer of ships personnel. Deficient items should be corrected or be marked to identify the need for completion. Upon verification, the appropriate block will be marked on the health record jacket. A biannual physical audit of health records ( wall-to-wall inventory) shall be conducted to ensure each crew members' records are on board. This verification must also include verification that TMIP or medical readiness reporting system (MRRS) data accurately reflects the health status of the crew. c. Sick Call Entries . Medical record entries will be prepared for each patient reporting to sick call. The importance of proper record keeping cannot be overemphasized. A properly maintained health record is of great value to the government and to a member in establishing entitlement to pension benefits for a service -connected disability. Medical entries in the health record must contain the date, name of ship, vital signs, complaint, and treatment rendered in the following format: (1) S - SUBJECT IVE COMPLAINT (Patient's complaints and history). (2) O - OBJECTIVE SIGNS (Exam findings). (3) A - ASSESSMENT (Diagnosis). (4) P - PLAN (Treatment, disposition, follow -up, and patient education). The PLAN section of a note will include the specific follow -up time. d. All signatures in the hard copy health record will be in black ink. The name, rank or rating, profession or corps (e.g., MC), and service of the medical department representative making entries in the health record will be ty ped, neatly printed, or stamped under the signature. Stamped facsimile signatures will not be used on any medical form in the health record. In signing, the individual assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the entry. Electronic hea lth record (EHR) entries will be in accordance with provided templates. e. Charge -out Control of Military Health Records . Health records will be controlled in accordance with MANMED, Article 16 -10. The TMIP master tickler transfer record or equivalent may be used in lieu of retaining the NAVMED Form 6150/7 (pink card). 4. Filing and Records Retirement . Correspondence and files should be complete, orderly, and in compliance with SECNAVINST 5210.8F. Records, logs, and correspondence should be COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-5 dispose d of in accordance with SECNAVINST 5210.8F. Supporting homeport MTF should be consulted in order to appropriately retire an STR. Supplemental information can be found in BUMED notice 6150 dated 12 October 2018, NAVADMIN 187/14, and ALNAV 066/16 or latest iterance. 5. Reports . a.

TMIP data is automatically uploaded to Navy Medicine Online at least weekly or manually as needed. c. Monthly Reports (1) TYCOM Quality Assurance Report . The TYCOM quality assurance report is a required monthly report. Each month's report must be submitted to the TYCOM no later than the 15th of the following month. The CO's signed copy must follow no later than the last working day of the month. d. Quarterly Re ports . Controlled substances inventory report; the CSIB must conduct an inventory at least every 90 days, in accordance with current BUMEDINST 6710.70 series, MANMED article 21 -24, and controlled substances SOP. The inventory will be unannounced and a c ontrolled substances inventory report must be submitted to the CO for approval. The controlled substances inventory report must be prepared and submitted by the senior member of the CSIB after each inventory. This report must list each item in stock, tog ether with its strength and unit of issue. The report must show the amount on hand from the previous report, quantity received, quantity expended, and balance on -hand. The audit will include cross -checking a representative sample of health records to ens ure orders for controlled substances are properly documented in the visit note. e. Situational Reports (1) Medical Event Report (MED Form 6220 -3). In accordance with BUMEDINST 6220.12C, medical event reports will be created and submitted via TMIP or equivalent. Reportable medical events and specific time frames for reporting are listed in enclosure (2) of BUMEDINST 6220.12C. (2) Summary Record of Tuberculosis (TB) Contact Investigation . The command initiating the contact investigation must pre pare and maintain summaries of the investigation. Summary records are required for the initial investigation and the three -month follow -up investigation. Records must be retained on file for at least three years and in accordance with enclosure (3) of BU MEDINST 6224.8C. (3) Reporting and Processing Defective or Unsatisfactory Medical Material . For reporting defective or unsatisfactory medical material, refer to 6710.63C.

(5) Department turnover report must be provided as delineated by the command or higher authority. 6. Cruise Report and Lessons Learned Brief a. Cruise Report . Upon the completio n of a deployment of 90 days or greater, a cruise report must be submitted to the force surgeon using the template provided in appendix F. This report must be submitted no later than 30 days after return from deployment. (1) The cruise report is an im portant document to record unusual, unplanned, and non - routine events that occurred before and during a deployment. This information is valuable to assess operational readiness and those support personnel who have not deployed to a particular area of oper ation. Succinct, worthwhile observations that can be submitted to the Navy Lessons Learned System is the intent of this report. Items that may warrant mention include: port calls, available medical facilities, significant incidence of disease, equipment maintenance, supply lag time, etc. (2) While a narrative format is acceptable to capture individual staff experiences, appendices summarizing recommended AMAL change requests (ACR), inpatient admissions, MEDEVACs, and key lessons learned must be includ ed in the report. At a minimum, the top 5 lessons learned must be submitted in the following format : (a) Topic. (b) Observation. (c) Discussion. (d) Recommendation. b. Observations must be approved by the cognizant commander (i.e. CVN, CSG issues etc.) and submitted to TYCOM force surgeon electronically . 7. Injury Reporting a. The Manual of the Judge Advocate General (JAGMAN), part E of chapter 2, requires a line of duty determination in every injury resulting in physical inability of a member of the naval service to perform his or her duties for a period in excess of 24 hours or where a permanent disability may result. Refer to the ship's legal officer and the JAGMAN for specific guidan ce. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-8 Completion of the line of duty determination is not normally a medical department function unless the injury occurred within medical department spaces or involved a member of the medical department. b. Medical department personnel must initiate a lo cal injury report upon initial notification or treatment of any injured crewmember. This report must include the diagnosis, treatment, circumstances and disposition of the patient. The original report must be forwarded to the CO via the safety department , with additional copies to those departments and divisions as directed. c. For personnel casualty reporting messages, refer to MILPERSMAN 1770 -030 and BUMEDINST 5360.1 (Decedent Affairs Manual). 8. Books, Publications, Instructions, and Notices a. Since the ship's medical library must function as a reference source for operational physicians as well as a source of specialty consultation and continuing medical education for the medical officers deployed, it is imperative that library maintenance receive t he same attention given to other areas of the medical department. b. An inventory of the ship's medical library must be accomplished annually. Medical references (textbooks and CDs) must be replaced as new editions or more relevant volumes are published . c. For assistance in locating additional subject titles or publisher addresses, the medical librarian at any MTF may be contacted. d. In addition to the references required in COMUSFLTFORCOMINST 6820.1, the following references are required to be hel d by medical departments aboard CVNs: (1) Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine (current edition) by DeHart. (2) U.S. Naval Flight Surgeon's Manual (Out of print. Retain if onboard). (3) Normal Radiological Variants (current edition) by Keats. (4) Current AMAL and formulary. (5) Military Radiobiology edited by James Conklin and Richard Walter, Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute, Bethesda, MD, Academic Press, Inc. (6) Digital reference material as provided by BUMED and/or TYCOM . (7) Current issue of BONES. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-9 9. Medical Research Aboard Aircraft Carriers a. All requests to conduct medical research onboard COMNAVAIRFOR vessels, or utilizing COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT personnel, must be referred to the cognizant force surgeon for review after approval of the research protocol by an institutional review board (IRB). IRB approval for COMNAVAIRPAC CVNs will normally be granted through the Naval Health Research Center or Naval Medical Center San Diego. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for COMNAVAIRLANT CVNs will be granted through Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. A copy of the research proposal and documentation of IRB approval must accompany all requests to conduct research. Requests will also include the following: (1) Brief description of the research proposal. (2) IRB approval. (3) Source of funding for the research. (4) Dates the research is to be conducted. (5) Extent of support requested from ship (i.e. recruitment of subjects, advertising, space needed, staff support, etc.). (6) Any expenses that may be incurred by the ship to support the study. (7) Statement indicating that subjects' privacy will be protected. (8) Research point of contact information. b. Once TYCOM force medical has reviewed the research proposal, an endorsement will be drafted and forwarded to the ship's CO for review. TYCOM endorsement implies the research proposal has been reviewed and the IRB has been approved. In addition, the TYCOM must believe that the proposal resea rch has potential value to the future health and welfare of the operational forces. See appendix G for a sample research request and endorsement. c. Upon receipt of the research request and TYCOM endorsement, the SMO, in coordination with the principal investigator (PI), will brief the CO regarding aspects of the study and its impact on the ship. Once permission has been granted by the CO, the medical department may liaise directly with the PI to conduct the research study. d. No medical research may be conducted without specific written approval of the research protocol by the TYCOM. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-10 5-2. Off-ship Medical Care 1. Senior Officer Present Afloat and Ashore (SOPA) Instruction. SOPA instructions are delineated in each ship's homeport. The SMO must review and ensure compliance with the medical section of the local SOPA instruction. 2. TRICARE . Under TRICARE active duty personnel are assigned to a primary care site according to their unit identification codes (UIC ) and duty station location. Active duty personnel stationed on board naval vessels are assigned to their ship as their primary care site. The primary care manager (PCM) will provide all routine care. PCMs will direct active duty members to a military or, in rare instances a civilian hosp ital or clinic, when specialty care is needed. It is important to keep the crew informed of TRICARE rules and regulations as well as how to access medical care while traveling on authorized leave or TAD. 3. Medical Consultations a. Medical Consultation s Ashore for Personnel Afloat . Medical consultations for shipboard personnel must be scheduled as far in advance as practical. Advance notice will facilitate the reservation or adjustment of appointments by the shore facility to accommodate fleet personn el requiring medical consultation during a limited in port period. Consultation at a civilian medical facility may be obtained in an emergency. Except for bona fide emergency care cases, all active duty personnel reporting to military or government medic al facilities for consultations must be in the prescribed uniform of the day. b. Request for Consultation . Patients requiring additional consultation services at other medical facilities will be referred using either a SF -513 (military), DD Form 2161 (c ivilian), or electronic referrals such as the CHCS. The medical department will maintain a tickler system to track the status of all off -ship consultations. The following guidelines are general in nature and the consultation process may vary depending on the policies of the MTF in each geographic area. (1) Each ship will develop and implement a comprehensive program for tracking and managing off -ship consultations. The process must include informing the patient of appointment scheduling and consultati on procedures and ensure patients make required appointments in a timely manner. In addition, the process will include informing the patients' chain of command of scheduled appointments to ensure they are kept, facilitate transportation if required, and consultation results are received back to the ship and are reviewed by the ordering provider. (2) Whenever possible, an electronic consultation should be used. An authorized CHCS or AHLTA remote connection can be used to request consultation services; o therwise a properly prepared consultation sheet (SF -513) will accompany each patient referred for consultation. Contact the supporting Navy MTF's operational forces medical liaison office for local policy. The request for consultation must include a summ ary of the patient's history (i.e. condition, complaints, treatment administered to date, and results of the regimen) and any other information COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-11 that may be of value to the provider completing the consultation. X -rays, laboratory reports, and other pertine nt information should also accompany the patient. (3) Coordination with operational forces medical liaison officers (MLO ) at medical and dental treatment facilities is mandated by COMNAVAIRFOR to ensure proper, adequate, and timely resolution of medical support problems. (4) In general, except in emergencies or when a provider is not available and delay might jeopardize t he welfare of the patient, patients should not be referred to a hospital for consultation with a specialist without first having been seen by a privileged provider. If operating conditions dictate, direct transfer of the patient should be affected without delay. c. Post-Medical Consultation . When crewmembers return from off -ship medical consultations, the consultation and their medical record must be reviewed by the referring provider who must determine further medical care requirements (e.g., medicatio ns, physical therapy, follow -up appointments, etc.). d. Cancellation of Appointments . If the operating schedule of the ship changes or other unforeseen incidents occur whereby appointments for consultations cannot be kept, appointments must be cancelled or rescheduled expeditiously and as far in advance as possible. 4. Non-military Outpatient Health Care a. When non -emergent civilian health care is required, it must be pre -arranged by the military in accordance with TRICARE policy for access to care. Active duty members who receive non -emergency medical treatment from a civilian provider without prior approval will be responsible for all costs incurred. Active duty members considering civilian care on their own must receive counseling from their PCM p rior to seeking civilian care. b. All non -military rendered care must be documented in the member's medical record. Additionally, military commands are not obliged to recognize a civilian physician's \"orders\" for sick leave, etc. 5. Claims for Treat ment of Military Personnel in Non -Federal Medical Facilities . The process for submitting claims for payment of civilian health care bills varies by the location of the ship. The following paragraphs define the various processes based on geographic locati on: a. At Homeport . When bills are incurred for civilian care of active duty members while in homeport, the bills are to be forwarded to the designated active duty claims representative for the TRICARE region where the ship is homeported. The claim for m, DD Form 2642, must be completely filled out and accompanied by an itemized bill from the treating provider(s) or medical facility. Reasons for not utilizing military medical facilities should be indicated on the DD Form 2642. Data on this form must be clear and contain sufficient information upon which COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-12 to make a decision regarding payment of the claim. If necessary, attach a memorandum explaining in detail why federal facilities were not used. If the care was for an injury that was from an accident o r was related to off -duty employment, a \"statement of personal injury - possible third party liability\", DD Form 2527, must be submitted as well. Contact information can be located online https://www.tricare.mil. Current TRICARE contact information shoul d be available during underway periods. b. Away from Homeport but not Deployed . When civilian medical bills are incurred by active duty members away from homeport, but not deployed (underway for less than 30 days), those bills should be collected and sub mitted to the TRICARE region processing office for the geographic region in which the ship is homeported. c. Deployed . When deployed for greater than 30 days, the TRICARE region at the ship's homeport is no longer responsible for paying for required medical care. When care is required, where the ship is located and what method is used to obtain the necessary care will determine who is responsible for payment. (1) Deployed to an Area with No MTF Support . The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Heal th Affairs has awarded the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP) to International SOS to assist with foreign payments for urgent or emergent medical care and MEDEVAC assistance in areas without host nation TRICARE contracts. When operating in areas supported by the TOP contract, this should be used as the primary method of obtaining required civilian care. When such care is coordinated through International SOS, there will be no billing to the ship. The TRICARE Global Remote Overseas (TGRO) contract is limited to urgent or emergent care and should not be used for routine consultations. If it is necessary to get a routine consultation in an area supported by the TOP contract, International SOS can provide recommended sources to receive care, even if that care is not covered under the contract. In those cases, the ship is responsible for paying any associated bills. Contact information can be located online https://www.tricare -overseas.com. Current TRICARE Overseas and International SOS contact information shou ld be available during underway periods (2) Deployed to an Area with MTF Support . When operating in an area served by a MTF, the MTF should be the first source for needed care. If the MTF does not have the requisite service and it becomes necessary to refer patients directly to civilian care, a provider from the MTF's preferred provider network should be used whenever possible. Close coordination with the MTF is necessary to ensure that bills from network providers are forwarded to the ship in a timel y manner for payment. Bills for civilian medical care for ship's company personnel will be paid using the ship's OPTAR . Theater specific reporting or payment requirements and variations should be researched during pre -deployment briefings and may be cont ained in the theater in - chop message or by reviewing the Annex Q of the respective numbered fleet surgeon's homepage. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-13 6. Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) a. General (1) The fleet concept of medical care requires the full utilization of all resources \"organic\" to the command and task force prior to transfer ashore. However, since treatment capability afloat is often constrained by ship design and manning, patient transfer may be necessary and plans and procedures must exist to accomplish this procedur e safely. Transfer of casualties or patients is an inherently dangerous procedure. In all cases, a risk to benefit ratio must be determined to decide the best course of action to serve the patient under the present operational, geographic and environment al factors. The transfer of a patient has two major components; uninterrupted continuity of care and selection of a proper transportation platform. Determination of the necessary appropriate medical support personnel, supplies and equipment must be accomp lished in an expeditious and complete manner. Continuity of care requires a direct combination of professional evaluation and information between the sending, transporting, and receiving providers. (2) For specific guidance refer to the theater in -chop message and by reviewing the Annex Q of the respective numbered fleet surgeon's homepage. Appendix H of this instruction contains a detailed MEDEVAC checklist for use in managing the MEDEVAC process. (3) Each CVN medical department must develop and pu blish a MEDEVAC checklist consisting of all required procedures, actions and notifications, customized for the ship's command structure and geographic AOR. Physician to physician contact by transferring and receiving facilities must be accomplished prior to transfer if possible. An SF 600 entry documenting all aspects of care and the reasons for transfer must be entered into the health record. (4) A MEDEVAC request message must be sent to the receiving medical treatment facility to document all MEDEVAC s. At a minimum, the COMUSFLTFORCOM and COMPACFLT Fleet Surgeon, CNAP or CNAL Force Surgeon, CSG commander and fleet commander must be made information addressees on this message and any messages concerning medical emergencies occurring at sea. The messa ge format can usually be found in the theater in-chop message. If the patient originally came from another ship or submarine, the parent command must be informed of their status. Additionally, if the patient is from a submarine, notify the submarine's gr oup commander and TYCOM as well. (5) A debrief report must be accomplished after all MEDEVACs, as specified by the theater in -chop message. (6) The responsibility for patients being transferred to another activity for transportation and/or treatment rests with the CO of the transferring command until the patient, with all necessary records and belongings, is safely delivered to the receiving medical facility. Prior to COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-14 transfer, the transferring command is also responsible for ensuring the receiving c ommand are fully informed as to the condition of all patients transferred, including mental competency and disciplinary status. (7) To avoid unnecessary personal hardship on patients being MEDEVAC'd, especially where there is any question as to the pat ient returning to the parent command, special precautions will be taken to ensure: (a) Adequate uniform and other appropriate clothing and toiletry items are transferred with the patient (b) Records, including personnel, pay, and health, are up -to-date, properly annotated, and transferred with the patient. A legible summary of care, discharge orders, enroute orders, and list of medications must be sent with the patient. (c) All patients and escorts (medical and non -medical attendants) who must travel to the hospital for appointments or admission will be issued a 30 -day funded TEMADD orders. The exception to this requirement is if the ship is in the port serviced by the hospital. In ports other than homeport, if the ship must depart and the pat ient will remain for evaluation or treatment, funded orders must be issued to the patient prior to the ship's departure. The parent unit must provide notification to the designated MTF prior to patient movement and have a discharge plan for the patient sh ould the unit depart from the port servicing MTF. The appropriate block must be checked to allow the medical facility to send the patient to another facility for further evaluation if indicated. (8) Patients sent for evaluation of suicidal ideation, ge stures, or threats must have a non - medical escort who will remain with the patient until released by the examining psychiatrist or psychologist. This escort should be at minimum an E -4 or at least the same rank of the patient whichever is senior, refer to the appropriate numbered fleet operational orders ( OPORD) for guidance. This escort does not need to be a member of the medical department. b. Transfers to U.S. Military Hospitals . Patients being transferred to a military hospital must be accompanied by their personal effects, health record, and other personnel records as appropriate. For enlisted personnel, a statement relating to their disciplinary status must be included except in cases of emergency in which instance the records must be forwarded to the admitting facility as soon as possible. Ambulatory patients should be transferred in the uniform of the day. c. Transfers to Veterans Administration Hospitals . The health record of a patient transferred to a VA hospital must be forwar ded to the appropriate authority. Prior to forwarding the record, an entry must be recorded on a SF 600 reflecting the name and location of the VA hospital to which the patient has been transferred in accordance with MANMED, chapter 16. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-15 d. Transfers to Non-Federal Facilities within CONUS . A patient being transferred to a non - federal hospital for treatment must have all his records maintained onboard unless his command is scheduled for deployment. Copies of appropriate medical record pages will accompan y the patient. e. Transfers to Hospitals of Foreign Nations (1) When a service member is hospitalized at a medical facility of a foreign nation, an entry must be made in the health record. However, this entry must not be designated as an official tra nsfer document. The health record must be retained on board until the patient either returns to duty or is transferred to another U.S. naval vessel or U.S. military activity. Copies of appropriate medical pages will accompany the patient. Upon departure of the vessel from port, the health record will be delivered to the CO or designated representative for inclusion with the member's service record and forwarding to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. The Embassy or Consulate must be furnished with a complete history of the reason for hospitalization and must be requested to coordinate with the hospital, with intent towards having the member properly cared for. Upon the member's recovery, the Embassy or Consulate must arrange for the member's transpor tation, with records, to the nearest U.S. naval activity. Refer to MANMED, article 16 -37 for further details. (2) In every case where fleet personnel are admitted to a foreign medical facility, the CO will designate a mature, responsible officer or pet ty officer as MLO. The MLO will establish and maintain close liaison between the medical facility, the patient's attending physicians and the ship's SMO. The command must submit a personnel casualty report (hospitalization in a foreign medical facility) if the ship must sail and leave the patient and MLO at the facility. As soon as the patient's condition will allow, medical evacuation will be coordinated with the appropriate commands. (3) The patient's command, when in the port where the service memb er is hospitalized, will ensure the patient is visited daily by a member of the medical department and a daily status report will be provided to the CO. 7. Patient Administration a. Administrative procedures for admitting patients to the inpatient ward or ICU must abide by the requirements noted in chapter 7, section 10, of this instruction and be logged in the medical department journal (duty log). b. Personnel whose illnesses or injuries are of such severity as to be considered life threatening (as d efined by MILPERSMAN 1770 -010) will be placed on the serious list or very serious list, with appropriate notifications made as required. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-16 c. Sick in quarters (SIQ) dispositions from other medical facilities should be considered as treatment recommendation s. The patient's command must make the final disposition. Personnel placed on SIQ will be evaluated by the ship's medical department prior to being returned to full duty, and appropriate health record entries will be made. The length of time an individu al may be placed in this status should normally be no greater than 72 hours. d. MTF may discharge a patient to return to his or her unit and recommend convalescent leave. Convalescent and sick leave are recommendations by an attending physician to the patient's command and are considered as adjuncts to patient treatment. The command has final approval or disapproval authority for such recommendations. The command must evaluate each recommendation based on individual case history and operational priorit ies. Convalescent and sick leave, when granted, do not count as annual leave. COs of naval hospitals or commanders of Naval Medical Centers may grant convalescent leave without consulting the patient's parent command according to MILPERSMAN Article 1050 -180. In case of conflict over MTF recommendations it is best to discuss the recommendation with the consultant. 8. Decedent Affairs a. General . Responsibilities of COs and medical officers regarding deaths are set forth in the following: (1) U. S. Navy Regulations, 1990, Article 0815. (2) BUMEDI NST 5360.1 Decedent Affairs Manual . (3) MCO P 3040.4E Casualty Procedures Manual. b. Reports and notifications are outlined in the following: (1) MANMED, Chapter 17. (2) MILPERSMAN Section 1770. (3) MCO P3040.4E. c. To assure orderly compliance with current procedures in the event of deaths occurring onboard ship and deaths of personnel away from their parent command, medical departments must maintain \"death portfolios\", containing a procedure c heck -off list and all pertinent forms. Appendix I is a sequential, step -by-step procedure that will assist in the timely submission of reports, messages, letters, forms, etc. by the command. d. At least five \"death portfolios\" must be available in the m edical department, at all times, and are to be provided to the cognizant action officer when the need arises. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-17 e. It is emphasized that while the Decedent Affairs Program is closely related to the Casualty Assistance Calls Program, they are separate and di stinct and should not be confused with one another. f. Decedent Affairs Procedures (1) Initial Report . When a death occurs within a command, the SMO will immediately furnish the CO with a memorandum report providing the information necessary to compl y with MILPERSMAN 1770 -030 for naval personnel and BUMEDINST 5360.1, Decedent Affairs Manual, Chapter 3, for other than naval personnel. (2) Medical department journal (duty log) . An entry will be made in the journal recording all available information concerning the death. (3) Death Certificate . MANMED, chapter 17 provides information concerning death certificates and submission of DD Form 2064, Certificate of Death (Overseas). Commands will ensure that adequate supplies of DD Form 2064s are on board for use should deaths occur outside the United States. An American medical doctor, military or civilian must sign an OCONUS death certificate. (4) Health Record Entries . After the required entries concerning a death have been completed and the d eath certificate is incorporated into the record, the health record will be closed. (5) Disposition of Remains . As soon as possible, remains will be transferred to the nearest Naval or Armed Forces Medical Facility for further disposition. Command representatives, (e.g. safety, legal and Naval Criminal Investigative Service), should be consulted to ensure all investigative protocols are met. Remains must be accompanied by the following: (a) Medical and dental records and dental x -rays. (b) DD Form 2064, Cer tificate of Death (Overseas) signed by an American physician. (c) Two DD Form 565s, Statement of Recognition, signed by shipmates who knew the deceased, if remains are recognizable. In all cases, refer to the Decedent Affairs Manual, NAVMEDCOMINST 5360.1 re garding requirements for death certificates to accompany remains. When transfer cannot be immediately accomplished, the remains will be prepared in accordance with NAVMED P -5083, placed in a body pouch and refrigerated at a temperature of 36-40 degrees Fa hrenheit or 2.2 -4.4 Celsius to prevent decomposition. The space used must contain no other items and must be cleaned and disinfected before reuse. Remains will be identified with waterproof tags, marked with waterproof ink and affixed with wire ties to t he right great toe and to each end of the body bag. Minimum identification will include the full COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-18 name, patient identifier, and rate. The Decedent Affairs Manual contains complete information and guidelines. 5-3. Miscellaneous 1. Disposition of Members Who Refuse Medical Treatment a. Medical departments may occasionally be confronted with an active duty member who refuses to submit to recommended therapeutic measures to prevent illness, injury or to remedy a defect or condition that has interfered wit h their performance of duty. Persons refusing treatment aboard ship may be subject to administrative or disciplinary consequences. In some cases, it will be appropriate to transfer the patient to a military treatment facility for further evaluation and recommendations as to disposition. The medical board process, if warranted, is detailed in MANMED, article 18 -11. Submit cases up the immediate chain of command. b. Notwithstanding the above, medical treatment may be given with or without a member's consent in certain conditions. In general, these situations are: (1) Emergency care required to preserve the life or health of the member. (2) Care necessary to protect life or health of a member who is considered by a qualified medical provider to b e mentally incompetent. (3) Isolation and quarantine for cases of suspected or proven communicable disease where medically indicated or required by law. (4) Detention on closed ward, where necessary to ensure proper treatment or to protect the members or others from harmful acts. Note: MANMED Articles 18 -4(2)(g) and 18 -12(3)(j)(6) provide guidance concerning disposition of personnel who refuse medical, surgical, or dental care or related diagnostic studies. The condition, rather than the refu sal of treatment, should be the deciding factor for determining disposition. c. Command directed psychological examinations must be conducted in accordance with DoD Instruction 6490.04, DoD Instruction 6490.4, and DoD Directive 6490.1. 2. Recommendation s for Discharge by Reason of Unsuitability a. The recommendation for separation by reason of unsuitability or unsatisfactory performance due to personality disorders and disorders of intelligence should be only made in those cases in which a member has d emonstrated unsuitability by unsatisfactory performance of duty or repeated disciplinary problems. The patient must demonstrate a personality disorder or COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 5-19 other non -psychotic mental disorder as diagnosed by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. A recen t change in administrative separation processing is that, prior to separating a Sailor with a personality disorder, the case must be reviewed by Navy Medical Forces Pacific for COMNAVAIRPAC or Navy Medical Forces Atlantic for COMNAVAIRLANT (see BUMEDNOTE 6 000 Serial M3/5/E08UGEN -016191c dated 19DEC2008). b. Enlisted personnel diagnosed having a medical condition as listed in MILPERSMAN 1910 -120 and 122 and current ICD codes, may be processed for separation in accordance with MILPERSMAN section 1900, SECNA VINST 1910.4B, and MANMED chapter 18. 3. Shipboard Medical Spaces . Shipboard medical spaces are assigned to provide certain capabilities, for care of the sick and injured consistent with size, and projected employment of the ship. Shipboard medical spac es will therefore not be converted to other use. No permanent alterations of medical spaces must be made without the submission and approval of a formal shipboard alteration request to the TYCOM. 4. Berthing of Non -Patient Personnel in Medical Spaces . There will be no non -patient personnel assigned berthing in medical department spaces. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 6-1 CHAPTER 6 MEDICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS 1. General a. Medical information systems provide vital support for the management of the medical department. These systems are evolving rapidly and can dramatically improve the provision of care to the Sailors and Marines aboard our ships. The medical department is supported by the ship's combat systems officer (CSO) and th e hardware and software provided must be approved for operation on the ship's local area network (LAN). Each individual program to be installed on the LAN must have a sponsor, be a program of record and have completed LAN compatibility and security testin g. All software must be certified as a Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) approved product. All questions concerning the installation of a specific program should be addressed to the ship's combat systems department and TYCOM force medical. b. Any computer that is provided to the medical department, as part of a medical equipment system, must not be re -utilized as a computer work station or removed from the equipment system. This requirement is intended to keep users from swapping their current co mputer with one of higher quality that is part of a medical equipment system. 2. Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP ). TMIP is the medical department information system developed by DoD for all deployed forces. This program contains an electronic medical records system, armed forces health longitudinal technology application -theater (AHLTA -T) for deployed forces, and ship specific required maritime medical modules (MMM). It also employs a data transfer system that transmits data off the ship that updates medical readiness and eventually EHR. All medical personnel should be proficient in using the TMIP. a. MMM is the current multi -user database application that is used to automate the medical department's administrative functions. Use of the f ollowing six modules is mandatory for all CVN medical departments: (1) The master tickler tracks immunizations, physicals and other monitoring programs. (2) The radiation health module is the only software application currently approved by BUMED to track radiation exposure data. (3) The occupational health and environmental health module tracks water testing, heat stress, and pest control data. (4) The supply module provides management of the medical department AMALs, including medical consumab le, pharmaceutical supplies, and durable medical equipment. It automates updating the AMALs from NAVMEDLOGCOM via the SAILOR website, refer to paragraph 3, and provides inventory tracking and re -order of medical supplies. It also tracks COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 6-2 inventory and loc ation of medical equipment in the medical department. This module of TMIP is used to manage the ship's medical storerooms. (5) The health services module is used to track medical workload. This function must be used to capture all workload provided by the medical division including care provided to the carrier air wing personnel when embarked. (6) The system management section is used to create TMIP accounts and control the level of access to the information contained in the program, and maintains s ystem integrity. Note: Use of the TMIP medical record, training management and periodic duties modules is optional. b. To ensure a complete database of all on board personnel, embarked CVW squadrons will continue to maintain, monitor, and update thei r unit's medical readiness utilizing medical readiness reporting system or authorized applicable database for squadrons. c. The information contained in TMIP is protected by encryption technology and must be maintained on a ship's server. A member of the medical department must be designated and trained as the TMIP administrator. All users must be entered into the system using the systems management module. Use is password protected and each user should only be granted access to those modules necessa ry for the completion of assigned tasks. Passwords are not to be shared with other individuals. The system manager's password must be provided to the ship's CMS or security manager for emergency access. 3. Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP ) Main tenance. Maintenance of the TMIP server, and the data contained therein, must be accomplished in accordance with the following MRCs: (48 QX23 N), (68 QX21 N), and (48 QX22 N). The Full MMM backup should be saved to a network share or other secure locatio n for redundancy. A minimum of seven MMM back - ups are required to be maintained by medical to provide a safe, redundant data repository in the event it is necessary to restore the system. Note: TMIP maintenance is normally performed by the ship's Combat Systems Department. Open communication between Medical and Combat Systems is paramount to ensure accurate and timely completion of backups.* a. TMIP Support . Submit a Navy 311 request for service ticket, include TMIP in the subject of the req uest. Provide TYCOM with service ticket number and any and all updates pertaining to TMIP issues. TMIP support is available from: (1) SPAWAR Acquisition Logistics Online Repository (SAILOR) website: https://sailor.navy.mil. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 6-3 (2) For COMM (855) NAVY -311, DSN 510 -628-9311, option 0 4. Remote Access to MTF . CVNs may be able to remotely access the supporting MTF's CHCS or AHLTA server via the internet (Citrix). Firewall clearances must be negotiated with the ship's combat systems department and the MTF's information s ystems manager. Use of such systems to submit electronic consults, obtain electronic medical record entries, laboratory and pathology results and order consults, lab tests, and radiology studies from the supporting MTF is encouraged. Note: Access to th ese systems require submission for site specific SAAR -N forms. 5. Telemedicine . Telemedicine is the business practice of exchanging clinical information in electronic format between remote locations to facilitate clinical diagnosis, treatment, consultation or referral for the purpose of delivering medical services. The word \"telemedic ine\" has been broadly applied in the medical field. CVN Medical Department providers are encouraged to use telemedia technology of communication, as available, to assure the highest quality of care for the patients served by the department. Examples of t elemedicine are: a. A telephone consult between providers, or a provider and a patient for the purpose of delivering medical services. b. A request for medical consultation through email, with or without data attachments. c. A video teleconference for the purpose of conducting a patient visit or consult between providers, or provider and patient. d. The transmission of real -time or store & forward images to a medical facility for the purpose of medical diagnosis, treatment or disposition. e. The online reference of an electronic medical library for the purpose of medical consultation or making a clinical diagnosis. f. Faxed or scanned images of medical record data transmitted between two MTFs or commands. 6. Medical Data System Manager . Each ship must designate one person in the medical department to be the medical data system manager, who must be responsible to: COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 6-4 a. Grant access to medical data systems. b. Arrange and track training of personnel in the use of the medical data systems. c. Serve as department information security official. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-1 CHAPTER 7 CLINICAL SERVICES 7-1. MRT a. The MRT is an excellent method of extending emergency room medical expertise and equipment to a patient outside the medical department during the first critical minutes following an accident or injury, such as electrical shock, asphyxiation, cardiac arrest, etc. The MRT is designed for the treatment of one or two patients and is not intended for utilization in mass casualty situations. Therefore, all COMNAVAIRFOR ships will develop and establish two MRTs in a manner that best suits the needs of the medical department and the ship. The names of MRT members must be posted on the WQSB. b. MRT must be compos ed of a minimum of four personnel, all of which must be HMs. An MRT must be present aboard ship at all times; exceptions to this policy require specific approval by the ship's CO. The MRT must be able to provide, at a minimum, BLS level of care after hours while the ship is in homeport. While the ship is at sea, or in foreign ports where a provider's presence is required aboard, the MRT is expected to be able to provide ALS level of care once the provider is present at the scene or in direct communicatio n with the MRT while en route. At the discretion of the SMO, the IDC may serve as the provider for the MRT. Also, ALS training for assigned corpsmen is highly encouraged. c. While at sea or in a foreign port, the second MRT must muster in the main medi cal spaces when a medical emergency is called away. d. MRT drills must be conducted according to the frequency specified in COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E. At a minimum, each of the two MRTs should be drilled on a monthly basis. Actual responses may count as a drill ; as long as ; the event was a bona fide medical emergency, the MRT response time was immediate, and the care rendered was deemed satisfactory in accordance with the SMO , or the MTT leader. e. Hand -held-radios, allowing for instantaneous commun ication between the MRT and the medical department, have proven invaluable in rendering quality emergency medical care. At least one hand -held radio must be carried by the MRT during all medical emergencies. Hand - held radios are not authorized for use in reactor department spaces. As such, the medical and reactor departments need to develop an effective alternative form of communication. 2. MRT Equipment a. Each MRT must have a full set of emergency medical equipment. Members of the MRT must at a min imum carry the following equipment: (1) Oxygen, suction bag -valve -mask device. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-2 (2) Trauma bag (dressings or bandages, splints, gloves, IV fluids, instruments, oral or nasal airway, and c -collar, etc.). (3) Defibrillator or Automatic External Defib rillator (AED). (4) Tamper sealed drug bag with full ALS capability (syringes, laryngoscope, endotracheal tubes, etc.) b. Additional equipment may include a stretcher, if not transported to the scene by stretcher bearers. c. Once on scene, should it be determined that a higher level of care is warranted, MRT personnel will radio the medical department to request the assistance of a medical officer (if one is not on scene), or for further medical officer guidance. d. MRT bags and equipment must be i nventoried on a daily basis during medical duty section turnover and after each use. Written documentation is required. (see chapter 14, section 2, paragraph 7d of this instruction, for requirements on deep access rescue). 3. Crash Carts a. Three comp lete crash carts must be maintained within medical and dental department spaces. One must be located within the treatment room, one in the ICU, and one in the operatory dental space. Additionally, the anesthesia cart should be stocked with emergency drug s and ALS algorithms for emergency situations in the operating room. Each crash cart will be stocked in accordance with appendix O (AMAL 3054, 3254), and will reflect the contents according to current COMNAVAIRFORNOTE 6000. b. During an availability pe riod, at least one crash cart must be maintained in the designated main medical space. If dental procedural sedation is preformed, an additional crash cart must be located in the dental operatory space. c. On a monthly basis and after every use, crash c arts must be inspected with attention paid to medication expiration dates. A tamper seal must be used to ensure the cart has not been opened between uses. Crash carts must be checked daily to ensure that a numbered, tamper proof seal is intact. Defibril lators, suction units, and oxygen tanks on the crash carts must be checked on a daily basis in accordance with preventive maintenance schedule (PMS) procedures and the manufacturer's recommendation. Written documentation of these inspections and checks is required. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-3 4. Beach Guard Medical Support a. Whenever the ship sets up a beach guard it must be manned with medical personnel constituting the medical beach guard. The mission of a medical beach guard is to supply BLS level of care capability, first aid, and safety screening of personnel before transiting to the ship. At a minimum, one HM with voice communication capability to the ship (i.e., mobile phone or hand -held radio) is required. Communication between the duty HM and ship's duty physician will be tested at the beginning of each duty section. The medical beach guard must be equipped with a junior emergency response kit (JERK). Other equipment and personnel must be available in accordance with local environmental conditions and host nation m edical resources. Medical beach guard personnel must be briefed on the contact numbers for shore medical facilities and ambulance services, guidance for when to contact the duty medical officer, when to delay transit to the ship and when to divert patient s to shore facilities. b. Refer to ship's instruction on management of intoxicated personnel. 5. Sick Call a. Sick call must be held at those times designated by the CO. Sick call should be adjusted to fit the ship's work routine when operating under adverse or other unusual conditions so as to make the services available to each watch section. b. Each patient reporting to sick call must have an entry made in the health records . Entries made in the health record must be legible and contain the da te, name of ship, vital signs, complaint, and treatment rendered in \"SOAP\" format. All sick call medical record entries must be signed and include the printed name, rank, corps, and service of the health care provider or electronically signed in the elect ronic medical record as appropriate. c. All non -physician health care providers who function in sick call evolutions must comply with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.3. A credentialed health care provider or IDC must countersign all health record entries of patients seen by sick call screeners. d. The health services module should be used to generate the sick -call log of all patients seen by the medical department. e. Brig Sick Call . Brig sick call must be conducted twice daily when any prisoners are being detained in the brig. Brig sick call must include an inspection of the sanitary conditions of the brig. The senior HM in the duty section must hold brig sick call. A medical department journal entry documenting brig sick call is required. A medical officer must be designated as the brig medica l officer, and must be informed of any medical issues or treatment provided to prisoners. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-4 f. Sick in Quarters (SIQ) and Light Duty . When a patient is determined to be too ill or injured to perform their regularly assigned duties, a recommendation for SI Q or light duty must be forwarded to the patient's chain of command. The SMO will designate which level of provider has the authority to sign SIQ and light duty chits. (1) An HM must immediately seek medical officer advice if it is anticipated that th e member cannot be returned to full duty after 72 hours due to unresolved illness. (2) The SIQ or light duty chit will contain, at a minimum, the following: (a) Limitations described as specific as possible; (b) the length of time the limitation s are expected to be in effect; (c) the specified time and place of follow -up; (d) any special instructions to the patient, and (e) a patient signature block for the patient to acknowledge his or her understanding. 6. Treatment Room . The treatment room, which also functions as the main BDS, must remain open and manned continuously, except under specific approval from the ship's CO. The function of the treatment room is as an emergency room during routine evolutions and as a BDS during general quarters. It must be appropriately stocked as a BDS as determined by the SMO. The treatment room must have the following equipment available and in working order at all times: a. Operating Room (OR) table. b. OR lighting. c. Medical oxygen. d. Suction. e. Crash cart. f. Defibrillator. g. Vital signs monitor. h. Sharps containers. i. Main BDS supplies. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-5 7. Surgery a. Surgical Services . The risk of traumatic injury and severe illness aboard ship makes the availability of surgical se rvices essential. Surgical services aboard, while of the highest quality available, cannot always match the capabilities of shore -based facilities. Therefore, a risk - benefit analysis should be undertaken prior to commencing any surgical endeavor. This i s not intended to prohibit the performance of minor surgery or emergency surgery where the delay incident to transfer of the patient would introduce a disproportionate risk and or where safe and reasonable surgical capability exists. b. Action . Medical and dental officers are directed, whenever surgical (including maxillofacial) procedures are contemplated, to carefully evaluate the aforementioned factors and to use the following guidelines: (1) It is not advisable to perform procedures on board ship while in port where more capable shore -based surgical capabilities exist. Exception can be made for minor procedures under local anesthesia. (2) Procedures requiring general, spinal, or regional anesthesia are prohibited while the ship is in homeport or in CONUS ports, with an available military hospital or civilian medical center. In unique situations, the need for surgery on board should be carefully evaluated to ensure the greatest safety for the patient. Procedural sedation may be performed while the ship is homeported consistent with the provider's clinical privileges and facility restrictions. Each CVN medical department is required to develop guidelines for the use of procedural sedation. Ensure that dental patients who are intended to recove r on the ward are included in the policy. (3) At sea, SMOs must discuss with the CO the command's policy with respect to surgery and notification of the patient's chain of command prior to performing an elective surgical procedure. The ship's CO must b e notified immediately of all emergency (unscheduled) surgical procedures. (4) The SMO is charged with the responsibility for all patient care. Explicit approval from the SMO (usually after consultation with the chain of command) is required prior to performance of any major surgical procedure requiring the use of more than local anesthesia. (5) Proper patient consent, documented on the applicable standard form, must be obtained prior to all procedures. c. See appendix J for recommended forms to prepare in support of elective surgery. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-6 8. General Anesthesia a. General Anesthesia . General anesthesia administered aboard CVNs must be administered only by a n anesthesia provider . General anesthesia is discouraged for elective surgical procedures when other methods of anesthesia are available. b. Absence of an Anesthesia Provider . In the absence of an anesthesia provider , general anesthesia will be administered only in actual emergency situations required to save life and limb. The ship's sur geon and SMO will determine if general anesthesia is required in the absence of a privileged anesthesia provider. The oral surgeon may administer general anesthesia in emergent situations. c. Anesthesia Equipment and Supplies . The anesthesia provider assigned to the ship is responsible to the SMO to ensure that all equipment and supplies are in working order and well maintained. All shipboard anesthesia machines must receive preventive maintenance and be certified in correct working order at least annu ally by a competent biomedical equipment technician or manufacturer's representative. d. The an anesthesia provider will be responsible for developing and updating the carrier instruction on procedural sedation. 9. Intensive Care Unit (ICU). a. ICU. Similar to shore -based medical treatment facilities, the ICU is intended to treat patients in a serious condition or requiring continuous monitoring. All personnel assisting in the care of ICU patients must be trained in a manner consistent with their res ponsibilities and under close supervision of the ship's nurse or a medical officer. b. ICU Beds . The ICU must have three beds, to include monitors and other necessary ICU equipment, unless specifically waived by the force medical officer. Whenever a patient requiring intensive care monitoring occupies an ICU bed, a nurse or medical officer must be present within the main medical spaces. Additionally, a qualified health care worker will be present in the ICU at all times whenever a patient is admitted to the ICU. c. Notification . All patients admitted to the ICU are to have notification procedures accomplished as specified in section 10 of this chapter. d. ICU Equipment and Supplies . The ship's nurse is responsible to the SMO to ensure that all equipment and supplies are in working order and well maintained. ICU ventilators must receive preventive maintenance and be certified in correct working order, at least annually, by a competent biomedical equipment technician or manufacturer's representat ive. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-7 10. Inpatient Care and Ward Management a. The ship's surgeon or family medicine provider will be assigned in writing as the ward medical officer. The ward medical officer will be responsible to the SMO for medical care and documentation thereof, including oversight of admissions, discharges, and daily patient rounds. The ward medical officer must ensure that the SMO is informed of all admissions. Admitting privileges to the ward or ICU are limited to TYCOM -privileged medical officers. A CP wit h the appropriate clinical privileges may admit and manage mental health patients. However, a medical officer with admitting privileges must be involved as a consulting specialist. This is to ensure medical officer involvement in a mental health admissio n to rule out a medical basis for mental status changes, prescribe medications as needed, and to ensure consistency of inpatient documentation. If medications are recommended, a privileged medical officer must sign orders. Other privileged providers (e.g . PAs, physical therapists, nurse practitioners) may assist and manage inpatient care, but a physician must countersign all notes and orders. b. The following information is provided to assist the ship's medical departments in developing and organizing an inpatient ward that will provide the best quality care for the patient. (1) The inpatient ward must be closed while the ship is homeported. When in other ports with a U.S. military hospital in close proximity, patients who require a higher level of care should be transferred to that facility. However, if the patient's condition is improving and they are expected to return to duty in a few days, t hey should remain on the ship's ward. In this circumstance, an HM must remain on the ward and a medical officer must remain on board with a hand -held radio or equivalent. (2) The minimum manning which must be maintained while the inpatient ward is open for admissions is a medical corps officer and an HM. Only trained and competent HMs will be assigned to inpatient care duties, and they will be assigned such watch sections to ensure the ward is adequately manned 24 hours a day while the ward is in opera tion. (3) The minimum number of ward beds required on a NIMITZ class CVN is 51. Specific configuration is 40 general ward bed , eight quiet room beds (usually this will be configured as two 4 -bed quiet rooms), and three ICU beds. The minimum number of ward beds on a FORD class CVN is 44. Specific configuration is 32 general ward beds, nine quiet room beds, usually configured as three 3 -bed quiet rooms and three ICU beds. Temporary reconfiguration of ward spaces is authorized so long as at l east one quiet room or isolation room is always available for patient quarantine and all beds are available for use during a mass casualty situation. Patient care and privacy must always be the priority over office space. (4) A review of the patient's profile, medication administration record, daily nursing flowsheet, and progress notes must be conducted and documented, verified by the SMO during daily beside rounds. Care must be taken to ensure that meals are served on time, medications are COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-8 administered, and other treatments are given as directed. Vital signs must be obtained at scheduled intervals, and laboratory specimens an d x-rays will be obtained as ordered by the attending provider. All abnormal results will be promptly reported to the ship's nurse or duty medical officer. The inpatient chart shall be properly maintained and legible. Timely documentation is of the utmo st importance. (5) Vital signs must be taken and documented at least every 12 hours while a patient is admitted to the ward. All abnormal results will be promptly reported to the ship's nurse or duty medical officer. (6) The following items are sugg ested for a check -off list of accomplishments for each patient admission. These items may be tailored to meet the needs of the command: (a) Patient's DIVO notified. (b) The personnel officer must be notified about all patients whose illnesses or injuries are of such severity as to be life threatening (as defined by MILPERSMAN section 1770). Such patients will be placed on the serious list or very serious list with appropriate notifications made to next of kin (NOK) as required. (c) CO and XO notified . Note: If appropriate, it is strongly recommended that the next of kin (NOK) be notified as soon as possible in all cases of admission. If possible, the notification should be done by the patient via telephone. If the patient is unable to notify the NOK, and it can be ascertained that they desire notification be made, it should be accomplished expeditiously. If the patient is admitted and does not desire the NOK to be notified, a written deferral should be signed and dated by the patient. This practice will resolve difficult questions that may arise following MEDEVACs, transfer admissions, et c. This written deferral must be noted in the nursing notes section. (7) Controlled Substances . Written procedures are required for the handling and dispensing of controlled substances as directed by MANMED, chapter 21. When an admitted patient is pr escribed a controlled substance, the medication will be dispensed from the pharmacy. If multiple doses of controlled substances are dispensed at once, they will be maintained in a locked cabinet on the inpatient ward or ICU. The storage and record of rec eipts and expenditures of these medications must be in accordance with chapter 21 of MANMED, and chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 10, of this instruction. (8) Inpatient Chart (a) All patients (medical and dental) requiring ongoing treatment or observ ation must be admitted to the ward. The highest possible quality of medical care must be administered with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-9 a clear record of care and an audit trail for routine review of patient care practices. Formal written admission procedures in accordance with standard Navy medical practices, utilizing a formal chart, will be followed. Required documentation is found on the inpatient record review form, appendix W, the abbreviated medical record (SF 539) is authorized in lieu of the SF 504, SF 505, and SF 506 for u se aboard COMNAVAIRFOR vessels if admission is less than 48 hours. (b) Upon acceptance of an individual for admission in the ward, for whatever reason, the SMO must be immediately notified and fully informed. The medical officer ordering admission (o r consulting physician if admitted by the ship's CP) must assume full responsibility for the well -being of that patient until care is appropriately concluded or the patient is formally transferred to the care of another physician. (c) In all instances, daily progress of the patient must be documented. A complete record of care must be maintained until discharge or transfer. All standard forms used in the inpatient record must meet the medical record criteria contained in MANMED, chapter 16. All inpat ient record entries (nursing notes, progress notes, doctor's orders, etc.) must record both date and time of entry. (d) Upon discharge or release from medical department cognizance, a copy of the narrative summary (SF 502) and the operative report (SF 516) if applicable, must be placed in the patient's outpatient medical record. The discharge summary must contain the following: (1) Admission diagnosis. (2) Discharge diagnosis. (3) A brief summary of stay with justification for discharge diagnosis. (4) Instructions to patient (medications, follow -up and other instructions as necessary). (5) Duty status. (6) Condition of patient on discharge. (e) According to BUMEDINST 6550.7A, patient notes or orders created by a CRNA do not require physician co -signature. c. Medical Hold (MEDHOLD) . The unique nature of medical care in the shipboard environment is clearly recognized. A deployed ship does not have the luxury of discharging a patient to convalescent leave or to a shor e-based transition care unit. On occasion, ward beds are used for patients who would not otherwise require hospitalization. Due to the difficulty COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-10 encountered using shipboard ladders and other potentially hazardous environmental conditions, some patients may be better cared for in the medical department. The close proximity of the galley, combined with the facilities on the ward, allow recovering patients to provide self -care in a controlled environment. MEDHOLD is not an alternative for admission. Patie nts must not be placed in a MEDHOLD status if they require vital signs, or other nursing care. MEDHOLD patients must be capable of self -care. (1) The SMO has a clear obligation to provide safe and proper medical care, regardless of the medical reason for accepting a pat ient for berthing in the ward. Medical transition company (MTC) is for sick or injured patients that do not require inpatient care but have multiple appointments per day or per week and need to be close to the hospital to attend those appointments. It is not an automatic acceptance, MTC has criteria that has to be met in order to accept patients and does not allow automatic acceptance. Refer to MTF operational forces medical liaison (OMFL) for specific criteria. (2) The medical depa rtment is responsible for all personnel residing in medical spaces. The medical department must account for these individuals for mustering purposes. Non -patient berthing on the ward is prohibited (see chapter 5, section 3, paragraph 4, of this instructi on). 11. Physical Examinations . The medical department is responsible to ensure all necessary physical exams are available, completed and submitted as required in a timely fashion in accordance with the MANMED and other agencies dictating specifics (DoD Medical Examination Review Board, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, etc.). All required follow -ups, recalls and resubmission should be completed in a timely manner. All laboratory and radiographic results must be reviewed and initialed by a licensed clinical provider. 12. Aviation Medicine a. All aviation medicine procedures will be accomplished in accordance with COMNAVAIRFOR M -3710.7 and chapter 15, section 65 of the MANMED. Direct oversight of operations, including review of physical examinations, waivers, and submissions will be the role of the SMO and CVW flight surgeons as directed by the SMO. b. The flight deck BDS will be manned in accordance with ship's policy by trained and competent personnel, and in accordance with chapte r 4, section 4, par d. The SMO, or assigned CVW flight surgeons, must provide oversight of flight deck BDS operations. 13. Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program (SARP) . The SARP serves to prevent and treat alcohol abuse and dependence. The SARP dire ctor reports clinically to the CP, and administratively to the medical DLCPO and medical DIVO. The SARP should work closely with the command's DAPA to ensure expeditious evaluation and treatment as necessary. The SARP must be run and services provided in accordance with BUMEDINST 5353.4B, to include COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-11 preceptor and reporting requirements. \"Performance indicator surveys\" must be distributed and collected from all patients. 14. Clinical Psychology. a. Clinical psychology services are an effective asset to the medical department and crew on a platform with an inherently stressful environment. The various preventive and treatment options made available should serve to improve working conditions and morale, as well as reduce the need for administrative sep arations and MEDEVACs for mental health reasons. b. The CP will report to the SMO, and follow all applicable instructions and directives, including COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.3, non -physician health care providers. The quality assurance program applies to assigned CP. c. CP must be well integrated into the medical department and ship's crew and provide high quality care within the parameters of their credentials. In addition, the CP will run ship -wide health promotion programs to include stress managem ent, anger management, and suicide prevention and provide SARP oversight. d. Psychiatric technicians will report clinically to the assigned CP. e. The CP may manage mental health admissions to the medical ward and ICU that do not require medication if they have the required clinical privileges. If medications are involved supervision by a medical officer is required. f. The CP will be responsibl e for developing and updating the CVN instruction on critical incident stress debriefing and on the management of personnel with suicidal ideation. 15. Physical Therapy (PT) a. PT services are an effective asset to the medical department and crew on a deploying warship and industrial complex. The various preventive and treatment modalities made available should serve to prevent injuries, decrease lost work days, improve morale and decrease the need for MEDEVACs due to musculoskeletal injuries. b. The physical therapist will report to the SMO and follow all applicable directives and instructions, including COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.3, non -physician health care providers. The quality assurance program applies to assigned physical therapists. c. The p hysical therapist must be well integrated into the medical department and crew and provide high quality care within the parameters of their credentials. The physical therapist should be utilized in health promotion (e.g., healthy back, injury prevention, etc.) and other activities as assigned by the SMO. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-12 d. Physical therapy technicians will report clinically to the physical therapist. e. Medical ward and ICU admissions related to musculo -skeletal injuries, while followed closely by the physical ther apist, must be made by a medical officer. f. The physical therapist must be responsible to the SMO for currency and maintenance of PT supplies and equipment. 16. Women's Health Issues a. It is incumbent upon medical personnel to ensure quality prev entive medicine and treatment services for women are readily available aboard ship. All medical staff members should be familiar with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.1, provision of standbys during medical examinations, and cognizant of the privacy and sensitivity issues involved. b. At the required annual health maintenance examination for women, the provider can determine periodicity of follow on cervical cytology testing based on history, age and previous cytology results. An annual health maintenance form is required for all active duty women. The annual examination will be performed in accordance with MANMED Article 15 -112. c. Due to inherent delays in receiving cervical cytology results during deployments, all attempts should be made to complete cervi cal cytology testing prior to deployment. Every effort will be made to provide patients with their results within 30 days. d. The references for the pregnancy policy are OPNAVINST 6000.1D. The following policy will be followed for a ll CVN pregnant service members: (1) May continue to serve aboard a ship until the 20th week of pregnancy, while in port or during short underway periods, provided an evacuation capability exists and the time for medical evacuation is less than six hours to a treatment facility capable of evaluating and stabilizing obstetric emergencies. This requirement includes TAD orders. The six -hour rule is not intended to allow pregnant service members to operate routinely at sea, but rather to provide the CO flexibility during short underway periods. A service member discovered to be pregnant while underway or deployed should be transferred ashore as soon as possible given the constraints of the ship's location, current mission, next port call, health of the service member, and unborn child(ren), etc. (2) Should not deploy with or be assigned to units that are deploying from notification of pregnancy through 12 months following delivery and release from their provider. Under no circumstance should a pregnant Service member remain onboard past the 20th week of pregnancy. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-13 17. Clinical Instructions . Each CVN must develop written guidance for handling the following events: a. Management of Alleged Rape Victims . Plans, policies, and procedures must be developed and implemen ted in a shipboard instruction in accordance with OPNAVINST 1752.1C and BUMEDINST 6310.11A. b. Management of Intoxicated Personnel . Although not all inclusive, the following checklist represents the minimum criteria that should be established in the man agement of intoxicated personnel: (1) Shipboard guidelines for command duty officers (CDO) on handling intoxicated personnel. (2) Medical departmental SOP for handling intoxicated personnel, to include: (a) Beach guard HM guidelines in foreign po rts. (b) Ward management. (3) Documented training for all medical department personnel for screening intoxicated personnel. c. Competence for Duty Examinations . Competence for duty examinations will be performed according to BUMEDINST 6120.20C. The purpose of competence for duty examinations is to determine whether an individual who shows signs of intoxication to medications, alcohol, or illicit drugs, is competent to perform duty to operate a motor vehicle, or to perform other official functions or risk the safety of themselves or others. The CO, XO, CDO, or department head must give the authority and signature for requesting a competence for duty examination, as delegated by the CO. Unless laboratory testing is specifically requested, a clinic al evaluation should suffice in determining competence. Competence for duty examinations must be performed by a medical privileged provider and completed on NAVMED Form 6120/1. d. Management of Personnel with Suicidal Ideation . Personnel with suicidal ideation must be managed in accordance with BUMEDINST 6520.2. Plans, policies, and procedures must be developed and implemented through a specific shipboard instruction. e. Critical Incident Stress Debriefing . Early intervention and counseling has prov en very effective when contact with the patient is initiated early after a significant event or disaster. Each ship must make plans for debriefing critical incidents including the use of indigenous assets, and off -ship assets such as Special Psychiatric R apid Intervention Team. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 7-14 f. Procedural Sedation . Each carrier medical department is required to develop guidelines for the use of IV sedatives. Ensure that dental patients who are intended to recover on the ward are included in the policy. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-1 CHAPTER 8 ANCILLARY SERVICES 8-1 Pharmacy 1. General a. This section establishes policy for general operation of the pharmacy and provides additional guidance for management of controlled substances stocks and prescriptions. b. Pharmacy services will be provided to active duty personnel of the CVN, CVW, CSG, and other eligible beneficiaries as directed by the SMO according to MANMED chapter 21. c. The SMO is responsible for maintaining appropriate security o f all pharmacy spaces and stocks. Access to the pharmacy spaces will be limited to the bare minimum needed to run the day-to-day operations of the pharmacy. In general, access to pharmacy spaces must be limited to the MAO, the pharmacy technician (or qua lified designated on the job training HM covering during the pharmacy technician's absence) and the current medical department duty officer (MDDO). d. The pharmacy technician must ensure the smooth operation of the pharmacy, manage the department's formu lary, and oversee prescription dispensing and pharmacy procedures as defined in MANMED chapter 21 and this instruction. 2. Prescription Dispensing Policies and Limitations . The following is a listing of policies pertaining to the operation of pharmacies on board CVNs. These policies are the most frequently asked about and are a common cause of concern. It is not intended as a listing of all policies and procedures relating to the pharmacy. Refer to MANMED, chapter 21, for additional information. a. Patients must be required to present military identification (ID) (or appropriate photo ID for non -active duty personnel) prior to receiving any medications dispensed from the pharmacy. Positive ID will be confirmed for all patients prior to dispensing or administering medications while in an inpatient status. b. Prescriptions from civilian providers must not be filled on board. CVN providers will not countersign, initial, or rewrite civilian prescriptions. An appropriate evaluation and medical record entry must be made prior to prescribing medications on the advice of a civilian provider. c. Providers are specifically prohibited from prescribing or furnishing a controlled substance to themselves or members of their immediate family. e. Telephoned or verbal prescriptions will not be accepted. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-2 f. Prescriptions will not be dispensed by mail (exception is via the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) as it is not part of the CVN medical department). h. Regular prescriptions must be filled within 30 days of the date written. Schedule III -V controlled substance prescriptions must be filled within 30 days of the date written. Schedule II prescriptions must be filled within seven days of the date written. g. The maximum non -controlled drugs that can be dispensed at one time is a 90 -day supply. However, birth control pills and hormonal replacement therapy (e.g., Premarin and Provera) can have a maximum quantity of 180 days of supply. The maximum quanti ty for schedule II -V pharmaceuticals is a 14 -day supply unless the prescription is cosigned by the SMO. h. All dispensed medications must be labeled properly with an appropriate health record entry in accordance with MANMED, chapters 16 and 21. i. A log will be maintained of all medications dispensed (either paper or electronic). With the implementation of the TMIP, this function is included and a separate log is only required if TMIP is not functional. j. All medications dispensed after normal work ing hours must be prepared by the duty corpsmen and will be verified by the MDDO prior to dispensing to the patient. The verification must ensure that the proper drug, strength, and quantity are dispensed. Additionally, the reviewer will ensure that all lot number and expiration date information are properly documented on DD Form -1289. Both the department duty officer and the reviewer will sign the DD Form 1289. 3. CVN Formulary a. The CVN formulary is defined by the current AMAL and is published by NAVMEDLOGCOM and distributed electronically through their website. b. In addition to this formulary, each ship may develop a local formulary addendum, listing any additional medications (non -AMAL) stocked aboard ship. This local formulary addendum must be published and made available to all medical and dental providers with authorization to prescribe medications. Any local formulary additions must be approved by the SMO and are the sole responsibility of the individual ship to obtain. No additional fu nding will be provded for locally approved, non -AMAL medications. d. IDCs may independently prescribe all formulary medications except as follows: (1) Controlled substances. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-3 (2) Any other medications and/or fluids restricted by the ship's SMO or respective TYCOM. (3) Any prescriptions for the above may be recommended by the IDC, but must be authorized and written by a privileged provider prior to administration. d. COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT force medical, with input from the fleet on an annual basis, will review and update the formulary. It is based on the DoD joint core formulary. It is designed to provide for the ongoing acute care for patients and to be pre pared for contingencies that may be expected during deployment. It is not designed to supply all ongoing chronic medication needs for members served by the CVN medical department. 4. Prescription Requirements . Prescriptions must be written in ink, or ty pewritten on an original DD Form 1289, DoD prescription or a NAVMED Form 6710/6, poly prescription. TMIP pharmacy module fulfills these requirements. Each prescription must show the following: a. Patient's full name and date of birth. b. Date prescri ption was written. c. Full name of drug, form of drug, dosage size, or strength written in the metric system and quantity to be dispensed. Prescriptions should be written using the generic medication name. d. Complete directions for the patient. \"Tak e as directed,\" in most circumstances, is not considered adequate instruction and must be avoided. Instructions to the patient must not include terminology contained on the Joint Commission list of \"Do Not Use\" list of abbreviations and notations, listed in Appendix K. e. Refill authorization. If none, specify \"no refills\". f. The legibly printed, typed, or stamped name of the provider, and the provider's original signature. g. Prescriptions not meeting these requirements will be returned to the pr ovider by the pharmacy technician for correction prior to dispensing the medication to the patient. h. Additional requirements for controlled substances include: (1) Prescriptions for controlled substances filled off the ship also require the provider 's United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) number and branch of service to be on file. (2) Prescriptions for controlled substances must be written in ink, or typewritten on DD Form 1289, DoD Prescription. NAVMED Form 6710/6 is not authorized for con trolled substances. Duplicated, carbon, photographic, pre -printed, rubber -stamped, or COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-4 \"addressographed\" orders are also not valid prescriptions for controlled substances. TMIP pharmacy module fulfils these requirements. (3) No controlled substance pre scriptions will be filled unless there is a bonafide signature card on file in the pharmacy for the physician or dentist, PA, or nurse practitioner writing the prescription. (4) Command, department, and division of the person for whom the prescription i s written must be transcribed on the prescription (may be supplied by the patient or the agent at the time of dispensing). (5) Erasure or line -outs on prescriptions for controlled substances are prohibited and will not be dispensed. i. These prescription requirements remain in effect as back up requirements when TMIP is unavailable. Providers will then use CHCS for pharmacy items and the signature requirement will be fulfilled by the electronic order entry signature. However, if a patient mu st have a prescription filled in a community pharmacy, the provider is required to write a traditional prescription and sign it as required by 21 CFR 1306.05(d). 5. Controlled Substances a. Definition . Alcohol, barbiturates, hypnotics, stimulants, narc otics, and other substances requiring special custodial care are collectively called controlled substances. Controlled medicinals are defined as a drug or other substance determined by the Director, DEA, Department of Justice, to be designated schedule sy mbols II, III, IV, or V, as defined in the controlled substances act, effective 1 May 1971, and other items requiring security storage. b. Refer to the COMNAVAIRFOR, COMNAVSUR FPAC, and COMNAVSURFLANT controlled substances SOP for the management, security , and disposal of excess quantities or deteriorated items of controlled substances in medical and dental departments. c. Additional guidance for the disposal of excess quantities or deteriorated control substances can be found in chapter 11, section 14, paragraphs (a to c), of this instruction. d. In accordance with chapter 5, section 1, paragraph 1 (a and b) of this instruction, the medical department will maintain the most up -to-date controlled substances SOP in appendix L. 6. Controlled Substances Inventory Board (CSIB) . Refer to the COMNAVAIRFOR, COMNAVSUR FPAC, and COMNAVSURFLANT controlled substances SOP for CSIB procedures and examples of the appointment letters in appendix L. 7. Reports . Refer to appendix L for examples of CSIB report letter s. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-5 8. Controlled Substance Break -out Lockers a. The purpose of the break -out locker stock is to provide providers on duty or working in the ICU, ward, OR, or dental operatory with timely access to controlled substances for use in their work sections. Th e SMO will specify the quantity and type of controlled substances held in the b reak-out locker stock. b. In order to maintain a clear and concise audit trail, all controlled medicinals for break -out use must be accompanied by a properly prepared narcotic and controlled drug account record (NAVMED Form 6710/1). Entries on the NAVMED Form 6710/1 must have corresponding substantiating entries on the medication administration record (MAR), NAVMED Form 6550/8, and on the nursing notes (SF 510) of the inpatient record. The doctor's orders must also indicate the date, time and quantity ordered and the date and time the medication is to be discontinued. Additionally, each locker must maintain a controlled drug log containing the NAVMED Form 6710/1 and narcotic a nd controlled drug inventories (NAVMED Form 6710/4) secured with the contents of the locker. All break -out lockers must be maintained under lock and key with access only to those persons designated by the SMO in writing. c. Transfer and Dispensing of Co ntrolled Medicinals (1) Transfer from working stock to and from break -out lockers: (a) Small quantities of controlled substances may be transferred from the pharmacy working stock to the break -out lockers. Appropriate security will be provided acco rding to COMNAVAIRFOR, COMNAVSURPAC, and COMNAVSURFLANT controlled substances SOP. (b) Transfer from working stock to break -out lockers, or vice versa, will follow the same procedures as outlined in MANMED, chapter 21 and will be documented on the NAVMED Form 6710/5 for the bulk stock and on the NAVMED Form 6710/1 used to track the break -out locker stock. (2) Dispensing from break -out stocks. Dispensing from the pharmacy break -out lockers after normal pharmacy hours will be made only on a proper ly prepared and signed prescription form DD Form 1289 following the following procedures: (a) Administration of controlled substances from the break -out lockers must have a documented order by the provider. Record usage on NAVMED Form 6710/1 at the sp ecified location and locked up in the break -out locker. Entries will be made in the patient's record as appropriate. (b) Physicians and dentists may sign prescriptions for schedule II through V controlled medications. PAs and nurse practitioners can prescribe schedule II through V COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-6 controlled medications, if within their scope of practice. IDCs attached to COMNAVAIRFOR units may not prescribe controlled medications. (c) The break -out locker custodian must ensure all appropriate entries are made on the NAVMED Form 6710/1 and NAVMED Form 6710/4, for each break -out locker during their watch. The custodian of the working stock must ensure the accuracy and completeness of all pertinent DD Form 1289s and NAVMED Form 6710/1. SMOs, or their appointed representatives, must assure the accuracy and completeness of all NAVMED Form 6710/4s by visual and physical accounting when deemed necessary. (d) Upon relieving the watch, a physical inventory of the pharmacy emergency break - out locker is accomplished be tween the off -going and on -coming MDDO. A third party must witness the count. The keys to the pharmacy emergency break -out locker in the pharmacy must remain in the custody of the MDDO. 9. Force Health Protection (FHP) Material . Controlled medications held on board as integral components of the FHP block AMAL, will be kept under lock and key and placed in the custody of the bulk custodian. Appropriate entries will be made in the custodian's records and will be monitored by the CSIB. At the discretion of the CSIB chair, bulk quantities of FHP controlled substances may be stored in pilfer proof packaging and may be inventoried as a single block on the quarterly CSIB report. Full inventories should be accomplished upon transfer of the bulk custodian or a t least annually. 10. Dispersal of Controlled Medicinals Prior to Combat or Emergency Situations . Planning is an important factor. The decision to distribute controlled medicinals to BDS safes rests with the CO. This action must be considered when a c ombat or emergency situation is imminent. The custodian or SMO should have written guidance defining distribution procedures and responsibilities in the event controlled medicinals need to be dispersed for an emergency situation or combat. Each ship must develop plans and simulate disbursal and retrieval of morphine and other controlled substances as determined by the SMO during each general quarters or mass casualty drill. Policies for the actual distribution of controlled substances during actual gener al quarters or mass casualty emergencies must be included in the battle bill. 11. Over the Counter Medications (OTC) . In order to expedite the treatment of minor injuries and illnesses, an OTC Medication Program is authorized aboard aircraft carriers. The list of OTC medications will be reviewed, approved and documented. No HM may hand out medications that are not on this SMO -approved OTC list. See appendix L for a sample CVN OTC patient instruction form. a. Quantities dispensed are limited to on e treatment regimen or a few days' supply for relief of minor medical conditions. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-7 b. OTC items must be labeled appropriately with adequate directions provided to the patient for safe and effective use, and also provide warnings and cautions against misus e. c. OTC medications dispensed will be entered into the patient's medical record, and an OTC log must be maintained to prevent abuse of the service. Entry into the patient's medical record is required to document the encounter. d. The patient should be cautioned that some or all OTC medications may be inappropriate for personnel on special duty status, especially for those on flight status. e. Further guidance on OTC dispensing and the elements of a dispensing request form may be found in MANMED art icle 21 -5. 12. AMAL Additions and Deletions . As therapeutic modalities change, the medications on the AMAL need to be updated. Several factors determine which medications are stocked on board. The TYCOM force surgeons determine what is authorized on the AMAL based upon level of care, specialty a dvisor recommendations, prime vendor contracts, and DoD pharmacoeconomic board input. Any staff, medical or dental officer, can request that a drug be added or deleted from the AMAL by providing written justification, to include drug, nomenclature, cost, and clinical benefit. This justification must take into account that the AMAL change will apply to all aircraft carrier medical departments. The ordering of controlled drugs not listed on the AMAL requires prior approval by the appropriate force surgeon. Refer to chapter 11 for AMAL change request procedures. 13. Pre-deployment Medication Analysis and Reporting Tool (P -MART) a. The DHA pharmacy operations division provides operational forces with a medication management tool called P -MART. Upon rece iving an alpha roster of Sailors aboard the ship, this tool can provide a medication use profile for each Sailor. The profile includes medications obtained at any MTF, the TMOP, and all TRICARE retail pharmacies. In addition, the profile can be viewed ba sed on type of medication including high risk, chronic, etc. b. To request a P -MART analysis for your unit or to seek assistance, contact the P -MART team at dha.jbsa.pharmacy -ops.mbx. pass-dmt@mail.mil or call the pharmacy analytics support section (PASS) at 1 -866-275-4732, option 1 and ask for a data management team member. Additional instructions may also be found under \"P -MART\", subheading \"How to Get a P - MART Analysis\", at https://health.mil/PMART . 14. Chronic Medications for Deployment . All personnel on chronic medications must obtain an initial supply of their medications (up to 180 days) in support of the length of the scheduled deploym ent prior to leaving home port. There are two methods for receiving these medications: a. Request a full deployment duration supply (up to 180 days) from the local MTF. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-8 b. Obtain an initial supply of medications from the TMOP. If member is unable to o btain the entire deployment length worth of medications due to TMOP prescription quantity restrictions, be sure the individual is counseled to use their shipboard address for receipt of refills and that medication refills are requested with enough lead tim e during the deployment to arrive in theatre before running out of their current supply. Complete the TMOP patient registration and prescription submission process at least 14 days prior to deployment in order to obtain the initial prescription prior to d eparture. TMOP should also be used for any non -formulary chronic use prescriptions. Deployment refill process: (1) Prior to deployment, the service member must set up an account with TMOP as follows: (a) Go to www.express -scripts.com/T RICARE. \"create register. Note: ID number is the member's complete social security number (c) Provide an e -mail address that can be accessed while deployed (d) Member should us e their current address (where they are now) and will use the website to update their address and to order refills when deployed. (e) After the member deploys, they will get reminder emails from TMOP reminding them to update their TMOP online registration with a current mailing address (which may include Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO)) and to order refills of medic ation via the member's online account. TMOP will only fill medications as requested by the service member and will send the medication to the address provided when the medication was ordered. Note: The average shipping time to an in -theater address is approximately 3 -4 weeks.

A log of all laboratory tests performed must be kept (utilization of TMIP is encouraged), containing at a minimum the following information: name, patient identifier last 4 (or successor identifier), date, test performed, technician. A separate log must be maintained for all specimens sent off the ship for testing, including the basic information listed above plus the following: Facility submitted to, date sent, date results received, and result. A copy of the laboratory results will be maintained by the laboratory for two years. The TMIP -M laboratory system will meet these documentation requirements. b. Filing of Laboratory Results . All performed laboratory test results must be entered into the medical record (hard copy or EHR) in a timely fas hion after review by a medical provider. Documentation of this review must be accomplished by the provider placing their initials on the lab chit. 2. Blood Bank a. The carrier blood bank program is optional; however, carrier medical departments choosin g to use this program, must comply with the requirements listed below. b. The carrier blood bank program authorizes the CVN to deploy with up to 20 units (usually five to eight units) of packed type O -Negative red blood cells. A deployment requiring this level of blood support is for a duration of 30 days or greater. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-12 c. Coordinate with the local MTF 15 -30 days before deployment. Red blood cell units must arrive at the designated carrier within seven days of collection. d. Coordinate OCONUS re -supply requests via message to the closest Area Joint Blood Program Office, U.S. naval hospital, or other designated blood supply source five to ten days before arrival or close transit. Blood supply source locations will be designated by the Combatant Command Joint Blood Program Office in coordination with the Navy component command depending on the area of operation. e. Ships must have an approved blood bank refrigerator. It is imperative that carriers receive and document blood bank technical assist visits . The visit should be conducted at the request of the carrier by the supporting naval hospital laboratory officer approximately 90 -120 days before deployment. 3. Walking Blood Bank (WBB) a. General . Every effort should be made to use other intravenous sol utions, when feasible, in place of whole blood for resuscitation. However, whole blood transfusions may be required in an emergency situation. The WBB will be used in a mass casualty situation, when the refrigerated blood supply (if available) has been exhausted. Procedures for processing WBB donors as well as activation or utilization procedures for the WBB must be contained in the medical department WBB SOP manual. b. Organization . The SMO will designate a medical or dental officer to be the WBB officer (WBBO). The WBBO will report the status of the WBB to the general surgeon on at least a monthly basis, or more frequently, as determined by the general surgeon. The general surgeon will exercise overall program management responsibility and will provide guidance and direction to the WBBO as necessary. The general surgeon will report the status of the WBB to the SMO prior to any underway periods. c. Donors . A minimum of 300 people or at least 10 percent of the ship's company will be enrolled an d eligible to donate. WBB donors should only be used in a true emergency when the delay necessary to transfer a patient to a shore -based medical facility would be detrimental to a critical patient. Personnel must be screened by the medical department and determined to be healthy to qualify as a donor. They must meet all screening criteria to include the following: have a normal temperature, be free of acute respiratory disease and can be determined from the donor's history, and free of disease transmiss ible by blood transfusion (e.g, viral hepatitis, malaria, syphilis, HIV, etc.). DD Form 572 will be completed and updated prior to each major deployment (30 days or greater) but no less than annually, by each member of the WBB. It is highly encouraged th at the medical department coordinate a series of ship -wide blood drives with the local MTF blood bank, prior to deployment so that a complete serological and virological screening can be performed on as many WBB donors as possible. However, separate serol ogical or virological testing is not required. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-13 d. Aircrew personnel will be handled in accordance with COMNAVAIRFOR M -3710.7 . e. Donor File . The WBBO must establish and maintain a listing of all personnel eligible as blood donors. This file must inclu de the person's full name, rate, rank, DOD ID, division, projected rotation date, telephone extension and blood type. The file must be updated on a monthly basis. f. If blood donor units are collected and transfused, the following must take place: (1) A plasma sample must be collected from the donor and recipient, properly labeled and frozen. Upon arrival at the nearest military medical facility with a blood donor center, submit the samples for the current battery of blood donor tests approved by t he Food and Drug Administration and American Association of blood banks. The recipient must be tested again at three months, six months, and at one year. (2) Ensure procedures are in place, which allow for the identification and tracking of all blood p roducts (received from off the ship or emergency onboard collections) to final disposition of the product (destroyed, transfused, or transported off the ship). Ensure receiving and shipping documents, blood donation records and transfusion records are per manently maintained. Forward copies of all shipboard transfusions and collections to the Navy Blood Program Office. (a) For COMNAVAIRLANT CVNs, the address and phone number is: Laboratory Medicine Service Line & Fleet Forces Command Liaison, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, 620 John Paul Jones Circle, Portsmouth, VA 23708 -2197; COMM: 757 -953-1617/DSN 377 - 1617. (b) For COMNAVAIRPAC CVNs, the address and phone numbers are: Director Western Area Blood Systems, Head Blood Bank, Naval Medical Cente r San Diego, 34800 Bob Wilson Drive, San Diego, CA 92134 -5000; COMM: 619 -532-9240/DSN 522 -9240 g. Copies of all blood bank records will be maintained by the ship's laboratory indefinitely. h. The WBB will be exercised during mass casualty drills at least once every 120 days. Blood samples will be obtained from three volunteer personnel: one \"recipient\" and two potential donors. Ensure one of the \"donors\" is of the same blood type as the \"rec ipient\". A type and screen (T&S) will be run on the three samples as well as an immediate spin crossmatch between the simulated recipient and both donor samples (demonstrating both a match and a mismatch). Results of this exercise, including number of WB B respondents, time required to conduct the testing, and the results of the T&S and crossmatch will be maintained in a log tracking WBB activity. The log and all associated documentation must be available for inspection at the health services readiness in spection. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-14 4. Laboratory Services a. It is imperative that all CVNs with laboratory capabilities comply with the current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program (CLIP) policy and SOP. CLIP requirements include individual unit registration, biennial ins pection (technical assist visit (TAV)), and biennial compliance certification. TYCOM will coordinate TAVs with the MTF for a CVN. A copy of the laboratory assessment, with documentation of corrective action, must be kept on file within the ship's medical department. b. The supporting MTF is required, at a minimum, to: (1) Assign a technical consultant to the ship. (2) Conduct a biennial inspection using the current fleet laboratory assessment form. A copy of the form will be provided by the technical consultant. The assessment results will be submitted to the SMO, who is responsible for taking corrective action as required. A copy will be maintained in the supporting MTF laboratory. (3) Provide laboratory training as required. (4) Est ablish internal proficiency testing as needed. (5) Review documentation validating the precision of instrumentation and accuracy of laboratory results. (6) Verify the ability to perform all shipboard laboratory procedures. 8-3. Radiology 1. Radiol ogy Services a. Medical department radiology services provide plain film x -rays of the head, thorax, abdomen, extremities, and portable ultrasound. Dental x -rays are performed at the dental department. b. Plain films are processed by computed radiogra phy (CR), a method of capturing a radiographic image on a phosphorous plate, which is inserted into and is processed through a digital laser reader that produces a digital image. The image is then transferred to a picture archiving communications system ( PACS) to store the images, display images, and then is transmitted from the ship to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, for interpretation by radiologists. c. Dental x -rays are processed as digital images and are stored on the ship. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-15 d. The medical department is equipped with ultrasound equipment capable of color flow Doppler ultrasound for intra -abdominal pathology and pelvic pathology. The family physician and general surgeon may be trained to operate the ultrasound and provide inte rpretation as part of their non -core privileges. 2. Quality Assurance (QA) . Regardless of the imaging method used, radiographs will be monitored on an ongoing basis for quality by a member of the medical staff. A complete log must be kept listing all x -ray exposures, and must contain the following elements: date of exposure, patient name, patient identifier, type of study, technician name, ordering provider, date sent for radiologist review, date returned from radiologist review, and verification that radiologist result is placed in the outpatient chart. A retake rate of less than seven percent is considered acceptable for x -ray technicians and less than eight percent for OJT trained hospital corpsmen. If the retake rate exceeds these thresholds, then t he monthly QA report will document what corrective actions have been taken (e.g. training) to reduce the retake rate. 3. Reporting of Radiology Results . SMOs must ensure that the results of radiology studies performed are entered into the medical record in a timely fashion after review by a medical provider. Documentation of this review must be accomplished by the provider placing their initials on the x -ray report or TMIP -M radiology module can fulfill these requirements when provider acknowledges the r esults in the EHR. 4. Disposition of X -Ray Studies . Shipboard x -ray studies must be maintained on board for five years. After that time, they may be disposed of in accordance with SECNAVINST 5210.8F. 5. Digital Radiology System a. A CR system has been installed on all CVNs. CR systems are composed of three major components: x -ray machine, CR system, and the PACS. The functions of each component are listed in table 8 -1. Table 8 -1 CVN Computer Radiography Configuration b. Support, repair, and maintenance procedures for the CR system are provided via a two - tier process as listed below: X-Ray Machine CR System PAC System Generates x -ray beam Exposes patient to creat e image on a cassette Extracts and digitizes the image from the cassette Creates image Digitizer and computer to process images Collects and stores the images Displays the images Transmits the image to MTF for reading COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-16 (1) Tier 1 Support Ship . The ship's bio -medical equipment technician (BMET) evaluates the situation and attempts to fix the problem. (a) Hardware . Warranty information must be carefully evaluated before any repairs are attempted, since working on the item without manufacturer approval may invalidate the warranty. The BMET may receive assistance from the ship's electronic technicians if theelectronics maintenance officer determines that they are qualified to work on the CR equipment. Hardware replacement costs may be accrued by the ship, if the warranty no longer applies. In this case, the ship will utilize repair money for CR parts on the approved parts list (APL). Fleet Technical Support Center (FTSC) Atlantic and NA VMEDLOGCOM will develop the PMS for CR systems. The ship submits an OPNAV Form 4790/7B \"Feed back report\" to - Mechanicsburg (NAVICP -M). NAVICP -M places the equipment on a PMS card and sends it to the ship when preventive main tenance is due. If PMS requirements change, the ship must submit a new OPNAV Form 4790/7B. Equipment maintenance information can be found in the vendor -supplied manuals. (b) Software . If the ship's automated data processing (ADP) staff have attended CR system administrator training, the ADP staff may attempt to restore the system to its original configuration. CR software or application configuration issues cannot be addressed by the ship's combat system department (CSD) administrator. Such issues need to be routed directly to the Navy Telemedicine Business Officer and Telemedicine Technical Support Center (TTSC) for timely assistance, in accordance with manufacture warranty, which states that only certified maintenance technicians can configure sof tware. (2) Tier 2 Vendor . In the event vendor support is needed to resolve a problem, the ship's BMET will contact the vendor. Vendor assistance may be provided by: (a) Assistance through references or troubleshooting via the vendor's website. (b) Remote troubleshooting assistance from a vendor representative. The vendor may provide shipboard assistance, if requested and funded by the carrier. In this situation, the carrier will also release a casualty report (CASREP) to the TYCOM and the appr opriate numbered fleet. Approved Parts List (APL) . NAVMEDLOGCOM and NAVICP -M are responsible for CR APL. NAVICP -M will complete the APL process and ensure the approved (populated or non -populated) APL is introduced to the CVN weapon s system file and the class configuration manager. 6. X-Ray Equipment Performance Evaluation . BUMEDINST 6470.22B provides guidelines regarding diagnostic x -ray equipment. Of particular note, each medical and dental x -ray machine requires performance tes ting every two years. Contact the supporting MTF radiation safety department to schedule the testing. Retain all copies of performance testing on board for three years. Operation of x -ray equipment without a current letter of certification requires a waiver from the TYCOM. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-17 7. Teleradiology (TR) a. General . TR involves the electronic transmission of digitized x -ray images from one location to another for interpretation by a radiologist. The purpose of TR is to provide timely expert x -ray interpretatio n to the remotely located health care provider to facilitate clinical management and thus improve patient care. b. CVNs using the medical website server will transmit via MEDWEB and the reports will be generated back to the carrier via the MEDWEB serve r. In general, this is a rapid process. CVNs using the Radworks server will transmit using a MEDWEB IP address. The x -ray reports are encrypted and sent back via the internet to a common access card -enabled computer terminal in the carrier medical depart ment for download. This is a slower process that is bandwidth constrained. c. The specific procedures for obtaining interpretations via electronic communications are dependent upon the urgency of the need, whether immediate (STAT) or routine. The provi der requesting x -ray interpretation will determine the level of urgency, using the following guidelines: (1) Stat Interpretation . The radiograph and pertinent medical history should be sent by the most expeditious means available. The TR interpretation site will provide a report by telephone (if possible) and will generate an electronic interpretation within four hours of receipt of the x -ray image and notification of the stat TR request. (2) Routine Interpretation . CD-R files can be m ailed via CD to designated MTF weekly for interpretation when bandwidth is limited or not available for routine studies. The site requesting interpretation will transfer digitized x -rays to a CD -R using a \"lossless\" compression or uncompressed format on a weekly or bi -weekly schedule, depending on volume, urgency, and mail routing availability. To avoid duplication, send only files that have not been previously transmitted for stat interpretations. The TR interpretation site will send an electronic repor t or mail a paper report within one week of receipt of the x -ray studies. e. Communication . Effective communication between transmitting referral sites and the consultation sites is crucial to the success of TR. Ships should communicate with the MTF regarding the volume of radiographs being sent via mail (on CD -R) or electronically so the MTF can efficiently integrate them into their workload. Additionally, specific information on how to access resources, including telephone numbers, e -mail addresses , points of contact (POC), and internet interfaces, must be readily available to all participants and should be acquired and tested before the ship gets underway. f. Documentation . Documentation includes providing timely permanent reports for the indivi dual patient's medical record, local temporary image back -up, permanent storage (archive) of the digital (filmless) x -ray images, and accurate workload captured. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-18 (1) Reports . The MTF providing the interpretation will generate a report for permanent docu mentation in the patient's medical record. The facility receiving the TR service is responsible for ensuring that a report is received for every image and that the report is entered into the patient's medical record. The requesting site and the MTF consu ltation center providing study interpretations must coordinate business rules to ensure the reports are delivered electronically or by regular mail, depending on the communication capabilities and/or limitations of the medical sites. (2) Archives . CVN medical departments must backup the image and report files locally, and are required to maintain the image files on board for five years. g. TR Quality Processes . Each CVN requesting TR services will establish an SOP to: (1) Monitor x -ray quality, (2) Ensure timely delivery of images to the MTF by TR electronic direct transmission or CD-R removable media, (3) Maintain temporary local backup libraries until the MTF has received and reported the final interpretation, and (4) Enter the final report into the patient's medical record. Problems with service will be addressed with the TR coordinator at the MTF. (5) Address problems with service with the TR coordinator at the MTF. 8-4. Optometric Services 1. General a. Optometric services will be provided to active duty personnel of the uniformed services in accordance with SECNAVINST 6810.1. b. Spectacle prescription, DD Form 771, must be used for requesting spectacles or repairs. Special requests will be documented in the \"special lenses or frames\" blo ck. Examples are tinted lenses due to topside watches, or frames of choice (FOC). c. Under the FOC Program (1) The CVN medical department is responsible for: (a) Overseeing the ordering and maintenance of the required supplies to support the FOC Program. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-19 (b) Fabricating FOC eyeglasses for CVN personnel, the embarked CVW, and the deployed CSG. (2) CVN supply petty officers are responsible for ordering current authorized FOC supplies through the electronic catalogue or through open purchase fr om authorized vendors, Rochester optical, 1260 Lyell Ave., Rochester, NY, 14606, phone (800)820 -6616, https://rochesteroptical.com. or Randolph Engineering Eyewear, 26 Thomas Patten Drive, Randolph, MA 02368, phone (800) 541 -1405, https://www.randolphusa. com. (3) FOC supply related questions may be directed to the COMNAVAIRFOR force medical supply and logistics POC at (619) 545 -1148, DSN 735 -1148. (4) FOC program technical guidance may be obtained from the Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activi ty by calling (757) 887 -7600 Ext: 1, DSN: 953 -7600 Ext: 1, or by at nostra -customer -service@mail.mil. d. According to SECNAVINST 6810.1, air controllers or flight deck personnel must not be issued flight goggles. Flight deck personnel shoul d be issued spectacles in accordance with paragraph 2 -4, of the above instruction. However, under the FOC program they may choose to receive one pair. Note that tinted lenses are authorized for flight deck, air controller personnel, and others whose duti es require them to stand topside watches. e. HMs qualified to perform refractions, must have a page 13 entry signed by the SMO and filed in the individual's personnel record. Aviator refractions should be countersigned by a CVW flight surgeon or SMO. f. Optometry supplies (frames and lens blanks) may be received by CVN medical departments on a no -cost basis from Naval Opthalmic Support and Training Activity (NOSTRA). CVN desiring to receive such supplies must report optometric production metrics to NOSTRA on a monthly basis via email no later than the 15th of each month. The spreadsheet format for reporting optometric production metrics is available in electronic format from NOSTRA. 8-5. Sterile Processing of Equipment and Supplies 1. Event -related Sterilization . Sterilization of surgical, dental, and patient care equipment and supplies is a critical element in infection control and patient safety. CVN medical departments must utilize an event related sterilization program. Studies h ave demonstrated that once an object is sterile it will remain so until its protective wrapping is compromised. A pathogen is presumed to have been introduced if the integrity of the protective wrapping has been compromised. Therefore, sterility is relat ed to an event vice being related to time. The requirements of the CVN central sterilization and reprocessing are covered in the joint COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-20 COMNAVAIRFOR and COMNAVSURFOR shipboard central sterilization and reprocessing SOP. Maintain a current copy on board. a. Steam Sterilization. Sterile processing of equipment and supplies for surgical procedures and patient care must be by steam sterilization. b. Liquid Chemical Sterilization. Endoscopic equipment including items that are sensitive and may be damaged by heat and pressure will be sterilized using the STERIS sterilizer. In the event the Steris sterilizer is non -functioning, chemical high -level disinfection with items such as CIDEX -OPA may be utilized temporarily until the unit is operational. c. Stand ard sterile processing procedures as outlined in paragraphs below will be adhered to for steam, liquid chemical sterilization, and high -level disinfection procedures. d. Standard sterile processing procedures will be followed, to include: proper hand wa shing, strict cleanliness of the processing room, controlling traffic through the processing room, no use of rubber bands, and not carrying sterile items under arms or in unsanitary containers. Double wrappers are required. If linen wrappers are used, an extra blue polyethylene wrapper must be added. Both of these wrappers are in the AMAL. In addition, if the item is to be stored outside of the main BDS, it must be plastic wrapped with a double heat seal. For single items, double peel pack with a doubl e heat seal is authorized. In all cases, ensure proper drying and cooling to prevent rust and contamination from condensation. e. After an item has been sterilized, it must be labeled with a sticker, which states, \"STERILE Unless Package Opened or Damage d, Check Before Use.\" The sticker must also be labeled with the date sterilized and the batch number. A sterilization log must be kept and will contain the date processed, item sterilized, batch number, temperature of sterilizer, amount of time sterilize d, and biological indicator results. Biological indicators should be run daily but, at a minimum, will be run once a week. f. Sterile items should be stored in closed cabinets whenever possible. Otherwise, they will be stored on open shelves and must not be within 12 inches of the deck or overhead. Sterile items must not be stored within two inches of walls or bulkheads unless they are properly lined and in good repair. Under no circumstances will sterile items be stored next to bulkheads that have b een known to form condensate. Sterile items that will be stored on open shelves for more than one year require dust covers. Ideal storage conditions are 64 -72 degrees Fahrenheit with 35-70 percent humidity. Under these conditions the heat -sealed plastic cover will provide the necessary protection for sterile items. Sterile items exposed to temperature above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or humidity greater than 80 percent must be re -sterilized. Each space where sterile gear is stored on open shelves will be c leaned at least weekly. Sterile gear will be rotated so that the oldest gear will be used first. New items are placed in the back, and old items are placed in the front. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 8-21 g. Sterile items must be inspected before use. They will also be inspected during the semi - annual BDS and mass casualty box inventories. Look for damage to the outer wrapper. Damage is defined as a hole or tear in the package, wet or moist package, dropped on floor, unsealed or broken seal, resealed with tape, or otherwise compromise d. Damaged items must be re - sterilized. When in doubt, remove the package from service and submit it for re -sterilization. h. After each extended availability period in excess of 90 days, all sterile gear will be opened, inventoried, and re -sterilized . This requirement conducted is for equipment accountability purposes. 2. Sterilization Records . A record of sterilizer use must be maintained, and must include the following information: a. Sterilizer number or ID. b. Sterilization load number in t he format DDMMMYY -## (i.e. 23JAN01 -01). The first load of every day is load # 01, and loads are consecutively numbered thereafter for that 24 -hour period. c. List of items and packs in the sterilizer load. d. Length of exposure time of load. e. Maximum temperature of sterilization for exposure. f. Results of biological indicator testing with each load. 3. Sterilizer Testing a. In addition to maintenance , in accordance with PMS requirements, all sterilizers on CVNs will be tested (at a minimu m) on a weekly basis with a biological indicator. A bowie - dick test should be run with the first cycle every day or at least weekly if the sterilizer has not been used. Follow the manufacturer's directions for processing the biological test. Ensure tha t testing is completed on all sterilizers, and not just the steam sterilizers. b. Results of testing are to be recorded in the sterilization record and will be maintained for a minimum of two years COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 9-1 CHAPTER 9 RADIATION HEALTH PROTECTION 1. General . The requirements of the Carrier Radiation Health program are covered in COMNAVAIRPAC/COMNAVAIRLANTINST 6470.5. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 10-1 CHAPTER 10 NUCLEAR FIELD DUTY 1. General . Nuclear field duty (NFD) involves work in the Naval Nuclear Propulsion or Nuclear Weapons Programs. A high degree of reliability, alertness, and good judgment is required in order for operations to be conducted safely and to maintain the integrity and accountability of these critical programs. It should be noted that NFD is not the same as occupational exposure to ionizing radiation (ionizing radiation work). While all nuclear field personnel must also be qualified as ionizing radiation workers, not a ll ionizing radiation workers are nuclear field personnel. Examples of the latter category are medical radiology personnel and industrial radiographers. The requirements for NFD examinations and standards are outlined in MANMED P -117, chapter 15 -103. 2. Nuclear Field Duty . The SMO assisted by the RHO and the MAO is responsible for NFD qualifications. The NFD program is administered in accordance with the above instructions, which are directly from NAVMED P -117 chapter 15 -103. For cases which NAVMED P -117, chapter 15 -103 does not address, contact the COMNAVAIRPAC or COMNAVAIRLANT Radiation Health Officer or BUMED for assistance. Appendix M provides a template for NFD disqualification and waiver packages. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-1 CHAPTER 11 MEDICAL SUPPLY AND EQUIPMENT 1. General . This chapter is a complete revision from the previous guidance and should be reviewed in its entirety. Since medical supply and equipment requirements evolve dynamically causing medical instructions to change frequently, each medical department is expected to post such changes as they are issued. The SMO is overall responsible for the medical department AMALs. The SMO will ensure all non -emergency AMALs remain at or above 90 per cent readiness, and all emergency AMALs remain at 100 percent. Note: Procurement of non -AMAL items is not authorized, without the approval of TYCOM force surgeon. This includes equipment, consumables, medications, and controlled substances not li sted on the AMAL. The SMO may request to procure non-AMAL items, however, this requires prior written approval by the TYCOM force surgeon. 2. Organization . The medical department supply team is responsible for the timely reorder and requisition of all medical supplies and equipment. The MAO, DLCPO, and medical department repair parts petty officer (RPPO) will form the medical department supply team. a. MAO and DLCPO . The MAO must be appointed as the supply team manager and the DLCPO must be appoint ed as the deputy supply team manager. These team members will act as primary liaisons between the medical and supply departments. b. Medical Department RPPO . Each CVN medical department must assign a medical department RPPO (E -5 or above) to act as the medical material manager. The medical department RPPO will report directly to the MAO and DLCPO. If a logistics support person is assigned to the medical department, they will assist the RPPO. c. Miscellaneous Supply Team Members . Additional team mem bers that assist the medical department supply team are the pharmacy technician (PHARM tech), the BMET, and the PMT. 3. Medical Supply Program Management Assignments . Prior to being assigned any supply and medical equipment management duties, the below e nd users must gain familiarization and/or complete training as follows: a. MAO, DLCPO, and RPPO .

Medical supplies and equipment are requisitioned and or maintained through the use of various online supply programs. a. TMIP . The TMIP material management module is utilized to maintain a c ontinuous inventory of all supplies and equipment onboard. b. SLEP . Utilized to test the extension of large amounts of high cost pharmaceuticals (primarily 3005 AMAL Force Health Protection medications). Each ship is required to register a primary SLEP coordinator and one alternate SLEP coordinator (Primary: PHARM tech are required to validate/update all SLEP on -hand quantities every 90 days via the SLEP website. The PHARM tech must also monitor e -mail message traffic for SLEP notices and actions, and comply with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-4 DoD/FDA system instructions regarding suspending, testing, destroying or re -labeling of extended material. When lots are sent out for testing purposes, the testing ph ase can take up to 18 months to complete and the test results are sent via e -mail from Defense Medical Standardization Board (DMSB). Training will be provided by TYCOM. c. Prime Vendor Trading Partners Account Via ECAT . The prime vendor trading partner s account accessed via the ECAT System, streamlines medical and surgical supply procurement options. ECAT is a net -centric ordering, distribution, and payment system providing the DoD and other Federal customers access to multiple manufacturer and distrib utor commercial catalogs. d. MMC . The MMC application provides users the ability to execute product searches and product souring requests against the MMC. The MMC Web Application includes a sophisticated product search capability that will assist user s in finding products that they are interested in. Once found, users can immediately execute a sourcing action for one or more of the products of interest that will return a list of executable sources for the product to their associated Department of Defe nse Activity Address Code (DoDAAC). This souring results set identifies source program (e.g., prime vendor, ECAT, readiness ECAT) and includes product ordering numbers Prime Vendor Online (PVON), National Distribution Center (NDC), as well as pricing avai lable to that customer. The application also provides product information, National Stock Numbers (NSNs) associated to a given product, equivalent products based on first data bank and supply line classification and product identifier cross references (ma nufacture part number to PVON to vendor catalog number). e. NAILS . Provides listing of most current CVN AMAL items. f. Operational Forces Support . Utilized to manage medical equipment via the NAVMEDLOGCOM website. Under the \"operations forces suppor t\" tab the following programs and documents are accessible: (1) Fleet Allowance Parts List Information . Complete listing of equipment APLs. (2) Device Codes and Life Expectancy . Complete listing of medical equipment device codes and average life e xpectancy. (3) SERP . Annual medical equipment requests for items over $5,000 that are replaced utilizing fleet funding. (4) SERP, MSE, and TAH Procurement Status Also Known as FPP . Utilized to document the receipt of SERP equipment received by the unit ordered via the SERP program. Allows the fleet to have visibility of all requirements with the SERP program. Additionally, tracks SERP buys from contract awarding to shipment to the unit. Immediately after new equipment is received, receipt acknowle dgement is entered by the BMET in 11-5 g. MMQC and MMI Messages . Utilized to control medical and dental products through quality deficiency reporting. h. SAILOR . Utilized to download TMIP AMAL quarterly updates for all CVN assemblages. The medical department will coordinate with their ship Information Technology Department to complete quarterly installations. i. VIALS . VIALS is NAVMEDLOGCOM web application that manages seasonal influenza vaccine distribution and status information for the naval h ospitals, the fleet, and Navy and Marine Corps reserve units. j. Pharma Logistics . Cardinal Health has teamed up with Pharma Logistics, a nationally recognized pharmaceutical returns company, to offer a hassle -free returns program. CVNs can now process expired, unsalable products through pharma logistics and receive credits towards the purchase of pharmaceuticals. 5. AMAL . The medical material requirements for CVNs are listed in each AMAL that can be referenced via the NAILS option on the NAVMEDLO GCOM website. Each ship must maintain all AMALs and ensure all non -emergency AMALs remain at or above 90 percent readiness and all emergency AMALs remain at 100 percent readiness. a. Fleet AMAL Taxonomy . AMALs are numbered with assigned platform spec ific numbers. The first two digits identify the platform. (ex. 3023-CVN Nimitz Class ship, 3223- CVN Ford Class ship). The last two digits identify the functional area (ex. 30 23-ICU CVN Nimitz Class, 32 23-ICU CVN Ford Class). non -emergency AMALs are 3005/3205 through 3036/3236 and must be maintained at 90 percent readiness at all times unless authorized to deviate from this practice in writing by the TYCOM force surgeon. c. Emergency AMALS . The AMALs are considered emergency AMALs are 3050/3250 through 3058/3258 and must be maintained at 100 percent readiness at all times unless authorized to deviate from this practice in writing by the TYCOM force surgeon. These AMALs are stocked and maintained in a ccordance with the annually published CVN Battle Readiness Gear Sets Notice (COMNAVAIRFORNOTE 6000) as partial quantities due to limited space, etc. A copy of this documentation is kept on file at the TYCOM force surgeon's office and a copy must be kept o n file onboard the ship as an MRI inspectable item. d. AMAL Assemblage Codes . Since medical supply and equipment requirements evolve dynamically, AMAL items are in constant fluctuation and can change on a quarterly basis. When AMAL items change, they a re given replacement prioritization codes that instruct the end user on when and how to replace them. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-6 (1) The following table is an explanation of AMAL codes: Table 11 -1 AMALs Assemblage Codes CODE EXPLANATION A0 Added to allowance list. New items should be added to stocks as soon as practical using ships OPTAR funds. A1 Added to allowance list. Field activities are to order this as a replacement item after stock of the corresponding deleted item have been exhausted or are no longer usable. A2 Technical Operational Budget (TOB) funded item. Initial outfitting item added to allowance list. Military strip requisition should be forwarded by ship's supply department for procurement citing NAVSEA OPN Medical/Dental TOB funding. A3 Added to allowanc e list. Field activities are to order this item immediately to replace stocks of the corresponding deleted item. A4 Added to allowance list. Material will be processed and delivered to ship at the discretion of COMUSFLTFORCOM/NAVSEA. A5 Added to allowance list. No procurement action is necessary. Administrative change in NSN, nomenclature, unit of issue, standardization action, etc. D0 Deleted from allowance list without replacement; field activities are not authorized to carry this item. Cont act TYCOM for disposition instructions. D1 Deleted from allowance list. Field activities are to retain and use the item until stock has been exhausted or is no longer usable. D3 Deleted from allowance list. Field activities are to dispose of the item i mmediately. D5 Deleted from allowance list. No procurement action necessary. Administrative change for NSN, nomenclature, unit of issue, standardization action, etc. NQ Quantity Change made for this NSN. Code indicates new allowance quantity. If this represents a quantity increase, activities are to order the additional quantities at the discretion of COMUSFLTFORCOM /NAVSEA. If there is a quantity decrease, activities are to use existing stock until they reach the new (decreased) level, until stock o f the deleted item has been exhausted, or until stock is no longer usable. e. Non-AMAL Items for Deployment Operations . In the event a deployment operation requires the use or procurement of non -AMAL items (i.e. consumables, medications, controlled substances) the following is required: the MAO must prepare on command letterhead a detailed memorandum containing the NSNs , nomenclature descriptions, quantities required, and appropriate justification substantiating the need for these items. The SMO must sign the memorandum and forward to the TYCOM force surgeon for review/approval. This written documentation must be kept onboard for two years and is an MRI inspectable item. 6. AMAL Custody and Inventory Periodicity . The MAO and DLCPO in conjunction with the RPPO are responsible to the SMO for the custody and inventory of medical material and equipment and must not permit waste or abuse of medical supplies and equipment. When a COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-7 change in manning occurs with the SMO or DLCPO, an inventory must be completed and documented prior to turnover in the medical supply bulkhead -to-bulkhead log. All inventories are to be documented and will be maintained onboard for two years as a MRI item. a. In company with the outgoing SMO and DLCPO, the new SMO and DLCPO must review the status of the medical department AMALs prior to assuming duty. At a minimum, this procedure must: (1) En sure a bulkhead -to-bulkhead inventory has been conducted of all AMALs on -hand. (2) Ensure all non -emergency AMALs are at or above 90 percent readiness and all emergency AMALs are at 100 percent readiness. These materials must be on -hand and not on order. (3) Ensure all material expiring in the next 120 days has been identified and placed on order. (4) Ensure the most current version of TMIP is installed and being utilized on the medical department computers. (5) Ensure a complete equipment inv entory is accomplished and reconciled. All discrepancies will be identified and investigated prior to departure. b. Inventory Periodicity . AMAL and equipment items must be inventoried at least annually. This may be accomplished by a one -time bulkhead -to-bulkhead inventory or by inventorying 10 percent of line items each month. Local spot -checks must be conducted daily in storerooms and work spaces. To maintain AMAL inventory accuracy, it is imperative that the most current version of TMIP is installed and utilized. As an MRI inspectable item, daily, weekly, and monthly database back -ups must be conducted and stored on an authorized governme nt external storage device. In addition to the annual requirement, it is highly recommended nine months prior to a planned deployment, a bulkhead -to-bulkhead inventory is conducted. All findings and solutions should then be documented on a memorandum and forwarded to the CO and TYCOM Force Surgeon to establish a supply Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) for deployment preparations. 7. Medical Funding . The budget submission of the medical OPTAR should be calculated by taking into consideration the ship' s schedule, the average of the OPTAR amounts for the previous three years, and consideration for inflation. These amounts are not intended to limit the maximum/minimum obligations for requirements. a. OPTAR Log . The OPTAR log is a ledger style accoun ting for all supply requisitions. The TMIP supply module has an OPTAR log and is the preferred method to track supply COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-8 requisitions. If the use of TMIP is not feasible, or if the command requires the use of another medium, this requirement must be waived. b. Report 21 . The report 21 is a report generated by the supply department that shows requisition status and actual cost of individual items. This report is used like a bank statement to reconcile and balance the OPTAR log. c. Embarked Units . Medic al supply and equipment usage for all embarked units has been calculated into the organic minimum quantity on board operating amounts for all AMALs. Therefore, separate funding is not provided by the ship or TYCOM to augment medical supplies or equipment for embarked units. All embarked units on board CVNs will draw medical consumables and use medical equipment on board within the medical department. d. Open Purchases . An open purchase is accomplished by completing and submitting a NAVSUPP Form 1149 or by using the command's impact card. The impact card can be used similar to a credit card for purchases under $3,500. Specific guidelines exist for the use of an impact card. Contact your supply department for guidance on the use of these cards. e. Medical Equipment Purchases . All medical equipment required by AMAL that has a cumulative cost over $5,000 will be replaced utilizing fleet funding via SERP. All equipment required by AMAL that has a cumulative cost below $5,000 is to be procured through t he ship's regular OPTAR funds. CVNs will notify the TYCOM force surgeon's office prior to requesting third party support to perform specific maintenance, calibration, or certifications for medical equipment to avoid unauthorized third party vendor commitm ents. Once approved by the TYCOM force surgeon's office, these maintenance contracts will be funded from the ship's OPTAR. Individual visits are funded by submitting a NAVSUPP Form 1149 open purchase document. Specific pieces of equipment that may requi re this level of support are: anesthesia equipment, chemistry analyzer, computed radiography unit, ventilators, and the audiometry booth. 8. Medical Supply Tracking and Requisition Methods a. Medical Supply Tracking . To track various supply requisitions, the supply department publishes a monthly material obligation verification (MOV) report. The supply department forwards this list to the medical department to validate receipt of material ordered. The RPPO then validates the list for accura cy and must report all outstanding requisitions greater than 30 days to the MAO or DLCPO for further action. The SMO will then sign the MOV and return to the supply officer. b. Requisition methods . Medical supplies are requisitioned using multiple proc urement methods based on the operational status of the ship and type of material. Below is a list of various requisition requirements and recommendations: COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-9 (1) Pier side . When CVNs are pier side for an extensive amount of time, it is highly recommended that all medical materials be requisitioned through their prime vendor trading partner account via ECAT. Materials requisitioned this way are likely delivered within 48 -72 hours via the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) warehouse where the ship is stationed . It is imperative that the MAO, DLCPO, and RPPO establish solid lines of communication with their local DLA representative to ensure the timely movement of medical material from the warehouse to the ship. R -Supply, MILSTRIP, and MILSTRAP can still be ut ilized to requisition medical material while pier sides, however shipping times are historically slower when utilizing this requisition method. (2) Underway . When CVNs are deployed, it is highly recommended that medical materials are requisitioned usin g the below methods in the following order to expedite delivery of items: (a) U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center, Europe (USAMMCE) . USAMMCE provides expedited medical logistic support to warfighters in European Command (EUCOM), African Commnand (AFRICOM), Central command (CENTCOM), and to the Department of State. Prior to deployment, it is highly recommended that the RPPO register for a USAMMCE account and use this as the primary method to procure medical materials while deployed. (b) R-Supply, MILSTRIP, and MILSTRAP . It is highly recommended that the R - Supply, MILSTRIP, and MILSTRAP methods be used as a secondary option to procure all items on the AMAL that have a NSN as this is a slower procurement method than using USAMMCE. When ordering thr ough R -Supply, MILSTRIP, and MILSTRAP, it is important to note medical material will be delivered to the medical department based on the priority code it was given at the time of requisition. As such, RPPOs must ensure all medical material items are requi sitioned with a \"777\" or \"999\" code and assigned a requisition priority code of either \"3\" or \"5\". Specific guidance on the priority of requisitions may be found in the R -Supply, MILSTRIP, and MILSTRAP manual, and the NAVSUP P Substanc e Requisitions chapter 4, section 406: \"schedule II -V narcotics are not permitted to be ordered from a prime vendor by the supply department. Instead, all controlled substances must be ordered by the medical depart ment using a standard R -Supply, MILSTRIP, and MILSTRAP requisition method.\" Note: Only the bulk custodian is authorized to sign for receipt of controlled medicinals arriving on board. 10. Vaccination Requisitions a. Annual Influenza . On an a nnual basis, the influenza vaccinations are procured using VIALS. PMTs must be responsible for submitting the annual influenza requests during the COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-10 second quarter of the current fiscal year through the VIALS's website in accordance with the annual Naval Ad ministration publication so that they may be delivered and administered to patients during the first quarter of the following fiscal year. Once quantities have been requested, the PMT must notify the MAO or DLCPO of the completion and in turn reports to t he TYCOM force surgeon's office in preparation of the upcoming influenza vaccination process. b. Requisition of Vaccinations other than Influenza . All other vaccinations are requisitioned through R -Supply, MILSTRIP, MILSTRAP, or prime vendor trading p artners via ECAT. 11. Medical Material Quality Control (MMQC) . Each CVN must maintain a strict quality control program for all medical material onboard. This must consist of frequent inspection, examination, and shelf -life material management procedure s. a. Shelf -Life Management . The following procedures will be established to maintain shelf - life management: (1) Material must be issued and used according to shelf -life on a \"first in, first out\" basis. Note: Potency dated material is material h aving a definitive storage period (expiration date). When an expiration date is given as a \"Month/Year\" (MM/YYYY), the material is considered to expire on the last day of the month. Material must be inspected regularly and estimated shelf -life must be r ecorded. Any material that has shelf -life extensions must be labeled and replaced as indicated. To avert accidental usage, expired material must be re -ordered, removed from stock prior to expiration dates, and properly disposed as soon as possible. (2) A records accounting system that adjusts promptly to reflect the results of material requisitions, receipts, and dispositions. Material must be regularly inspected. (3) A records accounting system that tracks SLEP test results on force health prote ction material. (4) A records accounting system that tracks MMQC messages. The system must document actions taken or not applicable on each MMQC message received. This documentation must be kept on file for two years, either electronically on a govern ment approved storage device or by keeping a hard copy binder. It is highly recommended that the PHARM tech sign up to receive MMQC messages, as most of the items recalled tend to be medications centric. 12. Reporting Defective Medical Supplies . Upon t he receipt or discovery of defective or unsatisfactory medical material, CVNs must suspend all stocks involved from issue and use. Materials received with less than six months of shelf -life remaining must be sent back to the vendors for refund and/or exch anges. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-11 a. Material Complaints . Reports must be made in accordance with the provisions of BUMEDINST 6710.63C. Material complaints are categorized into three sub groups as follows: category I, category II, and category III. Copies of reports must be p rovided to the TYCOM force medical offices on both coasts. Prior to submission of any report, the inadequacy or unsuitability of the item must be thoroughly evaluated by medical, supply, and/or maintenance personnel. Only items that are considered to be injurious or unsatisfactory due to inherent characteristics must be reported. Items involving idiosyncrasies or sensitivities or individual patients must not be reported. For material purchased through prime vendor trading partners, users must follow the existing vendor's material returns guidelines as published. (1) Category I Complaints . This includes equipment determined to be harmful or defective to the extent that use has already or may cause death, serious injury, or illness. Category I complai nts must be sent via priority message to the DLA Troop Support. Telephone calls are acceptable, followed by a written detailed supply deficiency report (SDR). (2) Category II & III Complaints . Category II complaints include material or medical items, other than equipment, suspected of being harmful, defective, deteriorated, or otherwise unsuitable for use. Category III complaints include equipment determined to be unsatisfactory due to malfunctions, design, or defects caused by faulty material, workma nship, quality inspection or performance. Both category II and category III complaints require original and four copies of the SDR to the DLA Troop Support. One additional copy of the report must be furnished to both the NAVMEDLOGCOM, Fort Detrick, Maryl and, MD; and DMSB, MD. (3) Pharma Logistics . All CVNs are required to register an account with Pharma Logistics in order to return expired, damaged, or excess products (dependent on the manufactures return policy, they can be a warded credits for return). Credits issued can only be used to purchase pharmaceuticals and must be used within 90 days of issue, however can be extended up to 180 days for deployed units via TYCOM request. The PHARM tech can contact the Pharma Logistics pharmaceutical program representative to help identify which products intended for disposal are actually returnable for credit. Pharma Logistics can be reached via telephone at (888) 729 -7427, business hours Monday to Friday, 0700hrs -1600hrs, central tim e; website: www.pharmalogistics.com. 13. Disposal of Medical Material (Medicinals) . All medical department personnel are cautioned that medical material should be disposed of in a manner as to ensure the medical material is rendered non -recoverable for use and harmless to the environment. a. As stated in DoD Manual 4160.21 -M, Defense Utilization Disposal Manual, \"Destruction will be complete, to preclude use of the drug or any portion thereof.\" Security of all medicinals must be maintained to ensure inaccessibility by non -medical personnel. The following guidelines must be used when disposing of medicinals: COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-12 (1) Tablets, Capsules, Powders . Remove from the original container, crush or break tablets and capsules, and flush into the sewage system. Flush in small quantities to ensure that you do not plug the sewage piping system. (2) Injectables and Parenterals . Remove the stoppers from the bottle, injectors, or open vials as directed, then express contents into the sewage system. Dispose of nee dles in sharps container. (3) Auto Injectors . Offload in bulk as medical waste. (4) Biologicals . Whether dried or suspended in liquid, these materials must be: (a) Incinerated, (b) Injected with enough sterilizing agent to kill the live biological agent, or (c) Pressure steam sterilized. Note: If one of the latter two procedures is used, the sterilized contents of the containers should be emptied into the sewage system an d the containers disposed of in a bio -hazard bag. At no time must medicinals be disposed of over -the-side, in whole or in part. b. Each pharmacy will maintain a \"survey and destruction log\" for non -controlled substances. The log will indicate: (1) Name, (2) Nomenclature, (3) NSN, (4) Lot number, (5) Manufacturer, (6) Expiration date, (7) Amount, (8) Date, (9) Method of destruction, and (10) Signature of PHARM tech. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 11-13 c. Survey and destruction of controlled substances, narcotics, and alcohol must follow the guidelines of chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 5 of this instruction. d. Destruction of the above materials should be accomplished in a well ventilated and secure area . In addition, when working with liquid substances subject to absorption through the skin, the wearing of goggles and neoprene rubber gloves is required followed by thorough hand washing in every case. 14. Disposal of Excess Quantities or Deteriorated C ontrolled Substances . Excess or deteriorated quantities of controlled substances requiring special custodial care will be disposed of according to MANMED, chapter 21, the Afloat Medical Waste Management guide (OPNAV P -45-113-3- 99) and chapter 17, section 3, paragraph 6, of this instruction. a. For forces afloat, medical waste is classified by OPNAVINST 5090.1D, chapter 22 as either infectious or non -infectious medical waste that are managed in accordance with OPNAV P-45-113-3-99. b. Pharmaceutical It ems Offload . Naval stations are subject to federal, state and local regulations for medical waste management and disposal. As the naval station is typically the receiver for offloaded material, it is important to contact the homeport environmental office prior to offloading any pharmaceutical Items. If a medical product meets federal or local jurisdiction hazardous waste criteria, and is not classified as a biohazard, sharp, or pharmaceutical, the waste is disposed by the receiving shore activity as a ha zardous waste and not as a medical waste. c. The following procedures should be followed when the ship's SMO has determined that excess pharmaceuticals need to be offloaded: (1) Where appropriate, utilize the DoD Pharmaceuticals Reverse Distribution P rogram accessible through pharmalogistics website. (2) If unable to effect reverse distribution, request the ship's afloat environmental protection coordinator to contact the base environmental office at ship's homeport with the MSDS specifics on the ma terial involved. Base environmental will be able to access contracts already in place to dispose of the material in a manner that is consistent with the homeport state laws and avoid potential violations and fines for the U.S. Navy. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 12-1 CHAPTER 12 FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE 1. Medical Equipment Maintenance and Repair Program a. COMNAVAIRFOR CVNs will comply with COMUSFLTFORCOM/ COMPACFLTINST 4235.7 and OPNAVINST 4790.4F for equipment management and maintenance policies. Maintenance and repair of medical and dental equipment is the responsibility of the BMET as supervised by the MAO, and DLC PO. (1) When new equipment arrives on board, it must be entered into the OMMS -NG and 3M/PMS Schedule (SKED) to update the ship's records. A separate entry must be submitted to remove the old unit. This provides an accurate listing in the Ship's Master System Weapons File and the Configuration Data Manager's Database - Open Architecture (CDMD -OA) database. It also drives spare parts provisioning through the Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) system. These procedures are all defined in OPNAVI NST 4790.4F. To submit to the 3M coordinator, provide the APL and Allowance Equipage List (AEL) numbers for the new piece of equipment. These numbers can be obtained from the NAVMEDLOGCOM web page at http://www -nmlc.med.navy.mil/. Once logged in using t he MIL/GOVT link, click the operational forces link and then choose APL from menu selection on the left. This page also offers all accompanying BMET information pertaining to the equipment AMALs (SERP, APLs, NSN search) and required information for docume ntation. (2) To update the maintenance procedures, a feedback report is submitted to the 3M coordinator to add the new piece of equipment and remove the old one from the ship's maintenance program. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for preventi ve maintenance until the actual PMS cards arrive. (3) A NAVMED Form 6700/3, medical and dental equipment maintenance record, is required for all equipment with a value of $5,000 and above. This record provides documentation for all unplanned but perfor med maintenance and additionally provides inspectors a quick method of checking for equipment updates and efficiencies of BMET program management ability for units. (4) If mission essential equipment malfunctions, and is beyond the BMET's ability to repair it, the ship (MAO and BMET) must contact the TYCOM for assistance and if necessary, the MAO submits a CASREP in accordance with OPNAVINST 4790.4F. Contact the ship's maintenance manager for assistance in submitting the CASREP. Ensure that Force Healt h Services, COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT Health Services, and NAVMEDLOGCOM are informed on the CASREP message. The COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT SERP's account supports medical equipment CASREPs according to COMUSFLTFORCOM/ COMPACFLTINST 4235.7. NAVMEDLOGCOM will assist in coordinating a qualified BMET or a company technician to conduct repairs. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 12-2 (5) Equipment that is no longer serviceable or being upgraded may be sent to DRMO for reutilization or disposal. Maintain disposal records in equipment files for a mini mum of two years. 2. Medical Material Requirements a. Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL). The COSAL is an authoritative document that lists: (1) The equipment or components verified by ship's configuration and logistics support information system configuration data manager (CDM) to be installed on a ship to perform its operational mission. (2) The repair parts and special tools required for the operation, overhaul, and repair of equipment or components. b. Allowance Parts List (APL) and Allowance Equipage List (AEL) . Spare parts and consumables required to support medical equipment are listed on the APL and AEL. APL and AELs: (1) Are developed and managed by NAVMEDLOGCOM and are submitted to the NAVICP -M to establish COSAL support. (2) List the technical characteristics of a particular piece of equipment to include logistic and supply information. (3) Identify all maintenance repair parts associated with the equipment. Each repair part listed has potential to fail du ring normal operation and is a possible allowance item; however, only those with a sufficiently high predicted failure rate, an actual replacement rate, and items required for planned maintenance or safety of the ship's personnel or mission will be authori zed and listed in the COSAL. Force medical, in conjunction with force supply, will review and designate items that will be carried at all times. 3. Radiation Protection Survey and Equipment Performance Test of Diagnostic X -Ray Equipment. a. References . BUMEDINST 6470.22A change -1 provides guidelines regarding diagnostic x-ray equipment. Of particular note, each medical and dental x -ray machine requires performance testing every two years. A list of approved surveyors may be obtained from NAVMEDLOGCO M and Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center (NMCPHC). Retain all copies of performance testing on board for three years. Operation of x -ray equipment without a current letter of certification requires a waiver from the TYCOM force medical. (See cha pter 8, section 3, paragraph 6). COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 12-3 4. Oxygen Handling and Storage a. At least one oxygen cylinder must be available for ready use in the main BDS, OR, and the ICU (i.e., with regulators installed at all times). When activating the remaining BDSs, oxygen r egulators will be installed on the working oxygen cylinder and checked to ensure availability of an adequate supply of oxygen. If a BDS is secured from use for extended period of time, regulators should be removed and stowed safely to prevent inadvertent tank bleed -down. Note that installing regulators will change the frequency of PMS pressure checks. b. Oxygen cylinders should be mounted off the deck and stowed according to grade B shock mounting and OPNAVINST 5100.19F. Oxygen cylinders will be mount ed in permanent storage racks. Once a cylinder is placed into service, the person using the cylinder must modify the \"Full/In Use/Empty\" tag (DD Form 1191 or equivalent) to indicate the fact that the cylinder has been placed into service. When empty, the tag will be changed to indicate the tank is empty. c. Empty cylinders are to be filled at the earliest opportunity and must never be stored in the racks provided for full cylinders. Cylinders will be filled to capacity, and kept ready for immediate us e. d. The following oxygen handling and stowage regulations, based on those of the Compressed Gas Association (http://www.cganet.com/), must be observed and posted in each area where medical oxygen tanks are used or stored. (1) Oxygen cylinders, m eeting 3A or 3AA Department of Trnasportation standards, must be hydrostatically tested and stamped in accordance with Naval Ship's Technical Manual (NSTM) Chapter 550. (2) Never permit oil, grease, or readily flammable materials to come in contact with oxygen cylinders, valves, regulators, gauges, or fittings. (3) Never lubricate regulators, gauges or fittings with oil, organic lubricants or other flammable substances. (4) Never handle oxygen cylinders or equipment with oily hands, greasy gloves o r rags. (5) Always clear the particles of dust and dirt from cylinder valve openings by slightly opening and closing the valve before applying any fitting to the cylinder. (6) Open the high -pressure valve on the oxygen cylinder before applying the eq uipment to the patient. (7) Open the cylinder valve slowly, with the face of the regulator gauge away from all personnel. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 12-4 (8) Never drape an oxygen cylinder with any materials such as hospital gowns, masks, or caps. (9) Never use oxygen fittings, v alves, regulators, or gauges for anything other than oxygen. (10) Never mix gases of any type in an oxygen bottle or any other cylinder. (11) Always use a pressure regulator to administer oxygen from a cylinder. (12) Never attempt to use regulators that need repair or have valves that do not work properly. (13) Defective oxygen equipment should always be repaired , or replaced by the manufacturer or their authorized agent. Note: All oxygen cylinders must have a medical warning tag (DD Form1191 or equivalent) affixed. 5. SERP Fleet Medical Equipment Acquisition and Maintenance a. SERP . SERP is the process employed to modernize major fleet medical equipment. For CVNs, items required by the AMAL that have a cumulative cost over $5,000 are replaced utilizing fleet funding. All SERP equipment items are managed by predetermined life cycles. The status of contracts for replacement equipment can be checked by the BMET via FPP website. Immediately upon receipt of all newly receiv ed equipment, the BMET must be report this information on the monthly QA report. Additionally, the BMET will acknowledge receipt via the FPP website. The BMET will also ensure all required SERP equipment is entered in the ship's 3M or PMS SKED and OMMS -NG database along with supporting APLs to update the ship's records via a feedback report to the 3M coordinator. This is to ensure repair parts, periodic maintenance, and support is available for these critical pieces of equipment. A separate entry must b e submitted to remove old equipment in SKED and OMMS -NG. b. SERP Acquisition Requirements and Annual Inventory . All BMETs are to maintain and annual validated SERP inventory on file with the TYCOM force surgeon's office to allow for proper planning an d funding. All BMETs will annually validate the condition of their SERP equipment and submit a SERP replacement request list to the TYCOM force surgeon's office to ensure future funding is available to replace end of life cycle medical equipment. It is important to note, procurement for SERP equipment is based on budgetary constraints, therefore, emergent buys due to equipment casualties or major repairs may result in reprioritizing and redistribution of funding after submission of the annual SERP reques ts have been received. Emergent buys will take precedence over other existing requirements. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 12-5 c. SERP Major Medical Equipment Installations . Equipment that requires major installation (i.e., audio booth, x -ray systems, etc.) needs to be planned for and c onducted during shipyard maintenance periods. All departments need to ensure they plan major installs during these maintenance periods, to include OMMS -NG entries requesting the installation. 6. Medical Equipment CASREP Procedures . If mission essential equipment malfunctions and is beyond the BMET's ability to repair it, the MAO or DLCPO must contact the ship's maintenance manager for assistance in submitting a casualty report (CASREP) in accordance with OPNAVINST 4790.4F, and documented in the monthly Q A report. Additionally, the MAO or DLCPO will immediately notify TYCOM force surgeon's office, COMUSFLTFORCOM, COMPACFLT, and NAVMEDLOGCOM. When mission essential equipment malfunctions and has not reached its life cycle expectancy, it may be replaced as long as documentation on the NAVMED Form 6700/3 medical and dental equipment maintenance record show that repairs have exceeded the current monetary value of the equipment. The BMET will coordinate with the TYCOM force surgeon's office and NAVMEDLOGCOM t o coordinate repairs or replacement of the equipment. The COMUSFLTFORCOM and COMPACFLT SERP's account supports medical with 4235.7. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-1 CHAPTER 13 MEDICAL TRAINING 13-1. General 1. Long and Short -range Training Program a. In accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E, the medical department is required to maintain a long -range training plan (LRTP) that includes pertinent events such as exercises, courses of instruction, drills, GMT, lectures, seminars, inspections, and assist visits. The LRTP should be projected for a minimum of 12 months into the OFRP. The medical department should ensure that all crew -related medical training require ments are included in the LRTP and publicized in the ship's LRTP to ensure the crew are aware of training opportunities available. b. From the LRTP, a short -range training plan (SRTP) is to be prepared for the department. This schedule should cover a pe riod of about three months. The SRTP should include exercises, drills, and lectures. Refer to COMNAVAIRFORISNT 3500.20E for a sample SRTP. 2. Medical Department Required Training a. Required training for individual medical department personnel is out lined in appendix P. The medical department training officer and the ship's training officer will track these requirements through R -ADM application and/or the Fleet Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS). Specific training requirements (i.e., SWMDOIC, firefighting, etc.) must be completed en route to the ship or shortly after the member reports onboard pending course availability. Members will receive training credit for attending an equivalency program as outlined in FLTMPS. b. As outline d in appendix P, all medical department staff will maintain current certification in BLS and use of the AED. A qualified BLS instructor -trainer will serve as the director/affiliate faculty for the program. The program director or affiliate faculty will e nsure all aspects of training, monitoring and evaluation are conducted according to the military training network (MTN), and in accordance with current DoD and BUMED guidelines. Refer to section 4, paragraph 2, of this chapter for additional requirements related to BLS training. c. In addition, training on the below topics must be provided to all medical department personnel: (1) Annual HIP AA. (2) Bloodborne Pathogens . Annual training regarding the hazards and protective COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-2 measures to prevent transmission of disease due to blood and human body fluids according to current BUMED directives. (3) Annual infectious medical waste training according to BUMEDINST 6280.1C. (4) Team Strategies and Tool to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) . Training must be completed at least quarterly, or as often as needed, to ensure that all medical personnel have completed training within three months of reporting on board. (5) Command Instructions . Training must be conducted and documented at l east once during the current OFRP, or as often as needed, to ensure that all medical personnel are familiar with the command policies and required actions for the following: (a) Management of intoxicated personnel. (b) Needle sticks. (c) Man agement of rape and alleged rape cases. (d) Competence for duty examinations. (e) Management of personnel with suicidal ideation. (f) Critical incident stress debriefing. (g) Restraints. (6) General Military Training (GMT) . Required yearly GMT courses will be completed according to current guidelines. GMT courses completed in a lecture or classroom setting need to be entered into the FLTMPS via the ship's training officer in order for the staff member to receive credit for completion . (7) Radiation Protection Training . All personnel must receive radiation protection training commensurate with their duties and according to federal regulations, DON directives, Radiological Controls for Ships (NAVSEA S9213 -33-MMA -000/(V)), and the Ra diation Health Protection Manual (NAVMED P -5055). 3. Optional Training Opportunities . The fundamentals of critical care support (FCCS) is listed to enhance awareness. This opportunity requires command funding, which may vary pending CVN location. Medi cal department staff are highly encouraged to attend the FCCS training offered by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). The course is designed primarily for providers who do not routinely work in a critical care setting but may be called upon to u se critical care skills until a patient can be transferred to an ICU setting or another higher level of COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-3 care. The course provides a review of critical care basics to include an in -depth segment on ventilator management. The course is offered periodically at Naval Medical Center San Diego and Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. Additional civilian training locations and dates can be accessed at the following SCCM website: www.sccm.org/education/fccs_courses/index.asp 4. Training Aids . The following items should be available to assist in the medical department's training efforts: a. Moulage set, simulated wounds, or injuries. b. Manual of Preventive Medicine (NAVMED P -5010). c. Manual of the Medical Department (NAVMED P -117). d. Resuscitation train ing manikins. e. AED trainer. f. Patient and rhythm simulator for defibrillator. 13-2. HM Training 1. Training of HM . The SMO is responsible for all medical care rendered on board the CVN. It is his/her responsibility to ensure that HMs are trained and competent to perform the tasks assigned. Specific utilization of HMs is outlined in COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.3, Non - Physician Health Care Providers. Training requirements are shown in appendix P. 2. Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS) . The SMO must develop a local training and certification program for duties as an HM. This program must follow the guidelines for a job qualification requirement (JQR). 3. Sick Call Screener Program (SCSP). a. The SCSP must be accomplished in acco rdance with BUMEDINST 6550.9B. b. Each HM who functions as a non -physician health care provider, in accordance with the sick call screener instruction, must be certified by the SMO prior to evaluating or treating patients. 4. Hospital Corpsman Skills B asic Program (HM SB). BUMEDINST 1510.23D established standard requirements for basic skills competencies and ongoing maintenance of medication administration, IV therapy (including insertion), venipuncture, hemorrhage control and hemostasis, and patient as sessment. Corpsmen checking into the medical department as their COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-4 initial permanent duty station must demonstrate competencies in these areas to satisfy the requirements of BUMEDINST 1510.23D , and prior to enrolling in SCSP in accordance with BUMEDINST 655 0.9B . 5. Rotation of Hospital Corps Personnel . The SMO must provide for the rotation of HM personnel through assignments in order to ensure thorough indoctrination in all phases of their duties. (Refer to OPNAVINST 3120.32D change -1 chapter 7 and OPNAVINST 3500.34G. Many areas, (i.e., lab, pharmacy , x-ray, and others) may need to be covered through OJT. While there is no requirement to have a certified technician operating in these areas at all times, OJT HMs will be expected to deliver the same standard of care. The SMO is responsible for develop ing and implementing additional safeguards to ensure quality patient care is maintained. Each CVN should benefit from their training and expertise by rotating and training additional HMs to cover each ancillary service. The overall benefit is a medical s taff that is much more capable and experienced. Additionally, a service may have to be covered by an OJT tech if a designated technician becomes an unplanned loss. It must be recognized, however, that use of OJT Corpsmen to cover in high -risk areas (e.g. Pharmacy) constitutes an increased risk of adverse events. 6. Professional Apprenticeship Career Track (PACT) Program . Previously called \"strikers\", this new program codifies existing policies and supersedes all prior policy guidance. PACT Sailors will use Career Waypoints - PACT designation (C -WAY - PACT designation) module to apply for rating entry, see MILPERSMAN 1306 -611. The Navy PACT Program requires an initial four-year active obligation, and in return, guarantees initial apprentice skill tra ining and a career development plan with viable career opportunities for Sailors who maintain eligibility. The PACT Program provides a required general workforce to support operational readiness and designed to enlist Sailors into a monitored, general app renticeship program that provides apprentice -level formal and OJT, leading to a viable career field within two years on board their permanent duty station (PDS). The Hospital Corps Strikers Program is a PACT program that was established in order to mainta in an adequate number of HMs by allowing volunteers from the fleet to enter a apprenticeship level on -the-job training that exposes them to the HM rate. Only those personnel who possess the requirements as specified by current instructions and are highly motivated to become HMs should be selected and recommended for assignment to Class \"A\" Hospital Corpsman school. Strikers do not have to be assigned to the medical department in order to be recommended for Hospital Corpsman school, although this is highly desirable. When assigned, they should be rotated throughout the department in order to ascertain their capabilities prior to requesting assignment to Hospital Corpsman school. PACT Sailors in receipt of an initial accession contract into one of the thre e tracks must meet the established minimum requirements for their chosen track. PACT must observe and/or assist and will ALWAYS be under direct supervision when conducting any patient care procedures. They must receive education and training in patient p rivacy, HIPA A, PHI prior to assignment of any duties in the medical department. Selection and use of strikers PACT Sailors as standbys during medical examinations will be in accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6320.1. Additional training guidance is provide d in section 1, paragraph 2, of this chapter. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-5 7. IDC Continuing Education . According to OPNAVINST 6400.1D, IDCs are required to complete a minimum of 15 continuing education units (CEU ) annually. This requirement is met during the first year after gradu ating from IDC school. Future CEU requirements may be fulfilled by attending the annual Joint Air Force/Navy Armed Forces Operational Medical Symposium. TYCOM fully endorses supporting IDC participation in this conference when OPTEMPO permits. This conf erence provides a comprehensive review of all subject matter within an IDC specialty of medicine. There are other methods of obtaining CEUs besides resident courses. Articles in professional association journals and other publications offer continuing me dical education (CME) credit for reading an article and answering related questions. Refer to the OPNAVINST 6400.1C and COMNAVAIRFORINST 6400.1 for further guidance and funding requests. Funding for operational forces is available through Navy Medicine P rofessional Development Command (NMPDC). 8. Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist (EAWS) , Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist (ESWS) , and Enlisted Information Warfare Specialist (EIWS) Programs a. EAWS Program . COMNAVAIRFORINST 1414.2B establishes poli cy and guidelines for the EAWS Program. EAWS is the primary warfare specialty for enlisted personnel assigned to a squadron, ship, or afloat staff under the cognizance of Naval Air Forces. b. ESWS Program . OPNAVINST 1414.9A and COMNAVSURFORINST 3502.1 D change -1 establish policy and guidelines for the ESWS Program. This warfare specialty is considered a secondary specialty for all medical department enlisted personnel permanently assigned to a CVN. c. EIWS designation signifies that an eligible Sai lor has achieved a level of excellence and proficiency in information warfare (IW). COMNAVCYBERFORINST 1414.1 establishes policy and guidelines for the EIWS program. Personnel assigned to a squadron, ship, or afloat staff are expected to qualify in the pr imary warfare mission of the unit embarked. EIWS qualification may only be obtained through the formal qualification program set forth in the COMNAVCYBERFORINST 1414.1 and is considered a secondary specialty for all medical department personnel. d. All medical department enlisted personnel may enroll into the ESWS or EIWS program upon completing their EAWS Program. 9. Non-resident Training Courses . Navy Education and Training Professional Development Center (NETPDC) publishes NAVEDTRA 12061, \"Catalog of Nonresident Training Courses\" which is available on My Navy Portal. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-6 10. Senior Enlisted Leadership Training Continuum a. Advanced Medical Department Enlisted Course (AMDEC) . The AMDEC is a three unit course in the medical department Enlisted Learning Continuum. The course is designed to introduce medical department and other enlisted personnel assigned to Navy medicine commands to the organization, structure, business practices, and operational policies of the Navy medical department. The co urse is part of the Navy E -Learning curriculum. b. Executive Medical Department Enlisted Course (EMDEC) . The EMDEC is the second course in the medical department senior enlisted leader's learning continuum. This course is designed to prepare medical de partment senior enlisted personnel for increased responsibilities as senior enlisted leaders who understand the \"practice and business\" of Navy medicine in both the operational and MTF settings. This course is offered at NMPDC. 13-3. Officer Training 1. Surface Warfare Medical Department Officer (SWMDO) Designation . COMNAVSURFPAC/COMNAVSURFLANTINST 1412.8B contains the standards and procedures for Navy medical department officers to qualify as a SWMDO. A medical department officer must not be require d to become part of any shipboard watch bill to pursue qualification as a SWMDO; and qualification must not interfere with the duties assigned in the medical department. 2. Continuing Medical Education (CME) . BUMED funding may be obtained to support required CME. Procedures to submit for BUMED and NMPDC funding are contained in BUMEDINST 5050.6A. 3. Correspondence Courses . Officers are encouraged to take advantage of this training opportunity. Most of the courses grant CME or CEU credit upon satisfa ctory completion of the course. 4. Leadership, Education, Analysis, Development, Sustainment (LEADS) (formerly known Joint Medical Executive Skills Institute). In 1992, Congress mandated that commanders of MTFs possess certain administrative competencie s before assuming their command positions. In 1996 and in 1998, that guidance was expanded to include prospective deputy commanders, lead agents, and managed care coordinators. Forty competencies in eight major areas have been identified and make up the professional skills list. In addition to overseeing the 40 competencies, LEADS publishes a catalog of executive medical courses offered by each service and the DoD. The catalog describes available courses taught within the Military Healthcare System and identifies which of the 40 competencies each course covers. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-7 5. Navy Medical Department Officer's Learning Continuum a. Basic Readiness Officer Course (BROC) . The BROC is the first course in the Navy Medical Department Officer's Learning Continuum. The purpose of the BROC is to increase junior officer awareness for all aspects of naval medicine including: MTF operations; operational medicine and health service support; and homeland defense. All those in ranks O -1 to O -3 are required to complete th is online course, which is available on My Navy Portal. b. Advanced Readiness Officer Course (AROC) . The AROC is the second course in the Navy Medical Department Officer's Learning Continuum. This course is designed to prepare medical department officers at the O -4 to O -5 level for increased responsibilities as senior officers and leaders who understa nd the \"practice and business\" of Navy medicine in both the operational and MTF settings. This course is offered at NMPDC in Bethesda, Maryland. 13-4. Crew Training 1. Training of Non -medical Personnel a. COMNAVAIRFOR considers that a comprehensive program in first aid, self -aid, buddy - aid and the medical aspects of CBR warfare is essential to maintaining a high level of combat readiness. Such training is recognized as a potentially critical factor for casualty reduction and in minimizing adverse e ffects on combat effectiveness in modern warfare. Training of this nature will enhance the successful management of mass casualties in any disaster, whether in peace or war. b. The shipboard first aid injuries that are trained are as follows: puncture or penetrating wound, sucking chest wound, abdominal evisceration, massive hemorrhage with amputation, laceration, fractures, burns, hypothermia, heat stress, electrical shock, and smoke inhalation. The ship's crew should receive basic first aid training, cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and stretcher -bearer training, at every available opportunity such as during command indoctrination, GQ drills, and on a routine basis aligned with the LRTP. c. The SMO will ensure a continuing, standardized, regularly scheduled program of instruction for the officers and crew in first aid, self -aid, and the medical aspects of CBR warfare. Utilization of shipboard information, training, and information television (SITE TV) is encouraged. 2. BLS Training a. Information on current CPR and health care provider courses are available from local chapters of the MTN, local MTFs, and 13-8 Military Training Network for Resuscitative Medicine Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814 -4799 Commercial (301) -295-0964, DSN 295 -0964 b. The medical department must: (1) Have a qualified BLS instructor -trainer on board to serve as program director or affiliate -faculty and effectively manage an approved BLS program, with appropriate documentation. Additionally, it is recommended that the department maintain a minimum o f five BLS instructors to support BLS training requirements for the crew. In addition to the ship's nurse, it is recommended that IDCs obtain BLS instructor certification as part of this minimum requirement. The purpose is to ensure that the IDCs are pre pared to conduct BLS instruction should they be required to backfill one of the smaller ships attached to the CSG. (2) Incorporate CPR/AED training into the command indoctrination for all hands , and ensure periodic courses are available to the crew. (3) Maintain current healthcare provider qualifications, at a minimum, for all medical department personnel. (4) Provide CPR/AED qualification for the following groups: (a) Minimum of 50 percent of personnel in the electrical and electronic associ ated ratings. (b) All gas -free engineers designated as rescue personnel for engineers working in confined spaces. (c) All members of CVN master -at-arms force and brig personnel, to include personnel TAD from other departments. (5) Individual dep artments are responsible for maintaining crewmembers' qualifications and ensuring curren cy. 3. Advanced Training of Repair Party, Stretcher Bearer Personnel, and Boat Crews . The training program for these personnel must include all subjects applicable to the crew, with special emphasis and additional training in first aid procedures, methods of resuscitation, self -aid in chemical warfare, casualty evacuation, and transportation of casualties. The names and assignments of stretcher -bearers must be poste d on the medical department WQSB. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 13-9 4. Medical Training Team (MTT) a. All CVNs will establish a MTT. This team will be responsible to the SMO for the proper training of medical personnel and ship's company in all aspects of first aid, medical response team performance, war wound, and mass casualty treatment. Paragraph 3 of this chapter outlines the mission area training exercises as required by COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E. b. The MTT will be comprised of personnel with the requisite knowledge, background, and training to facilitate medical training. The team leader will be the ship's nurse, leading a team made up of at a minimum, one medical officer, a departmental chief petty officer, and one independent duty hospital corpsman (IDC). MTT members will be PQS qualified and designated in writing by the CO or his designated approving authority. Either the MTT leader or the medical department LCPO will also be a member of the DCT T. c. In order to facilitate collaboration and integration among all the ship's training teams, it is recommended that each member of the MTT carry a secondary training team assignment. For example, one MTT member would also be assigned to the air depart ment training team. This secondary assignment fosters improved communication between the training teams by offering consistent MTT presence during drill planning and at drill briefs and debriefs. d. The MTT will observe, grade and critique all medical exercises and report the results to the head of department. Members of the MTT will utilize TAC cards for grading when carrying out their training drills prior to any medical drill/evolution the MTT Leade r will conduct a brief, utilizing a drill package that outlines the objective of the drill, timeline, personnel assignments, safety concerns (utilizing ORM), and lessons learned (from previous drills). Following each drill, MTT will debrief Sailors on sta tion, and conduct a drill debrief with all MTT and other drill team members involved. The drill package and de -brief will be routed to the SMO for review and/or higher authority depending on ship's requirements. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-1 CHAPTER 14 BATTLE READINESS 14-1. General Quarters (GQ). 1. Battle Bill . Each carrier will have a ship's medical department battle bill or instruction that addresses the location and quantity of emergency medical supplies located throughout the ship. It must also outline the roles and respons ibilities of medical department personnel during emergency and special evolutions. A sample battle bill is provided in appendix Q. 2. Battle Dressing Stations (BDS). a. A minimum of six BDSs must be maintained and must be located in areas affording maximum protection consistent with the availability of care for the injured. The BDS contained within the medical department must be classified as the primary (main) BDS. Since it is co - located with the operating room and has ancillary support, it is best suited to care for the critically injured. b. In addition to the main BDS, a minimum of five additional BDSs are required for CVN type ships: one forward, one aft, two auxiliary BDSs, and one in close proximity to the flight deck. c. BDSs must not be utilized as auxiliary storerooms. Stowage of personal gear within the BDS is prohibited. d. Each BDS will maintain adequate operational readiness equipment to include a potable water tank with gravity feed piping, proper lighting and a secured table suitable for the treatment of casualties. e. A roster of all assigned BDS personnel must be maintained in each BDS to include stretcher bearers and phone talkers. All BDS personnel must be incorporated into the medical department's WQSB. f. In accor dance with NWP 3 -20.31 and COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E, a minimum of one corpsman, four stretcher -bearers, and a phone talker will be assigned to support each BDS; and a minimum of one corpsman and four stretcher bearers will be assigned to support each repair locker. Stretcher -bearer personnel may be provided from damage control (DC) personnel or from outside the DC organization. Ships must have as many personnel trained to function as stretcher - bearers as deemed necessary to handle mass casualties. They must be trained in advanced first aid and casualty handling techniques and must be capable of training other crewmembers in self -aid and buddy -aid pertaining to the SFAR. Each stretcher -bearer team must be equipped with a first aid kit gun crew (gun bag) . COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-2 g. All HMs will be assigned GQ stations in a BDS, a repair locker, or in main medical. In the event of significant battle casualties, main medical must remain fully functional. This requires the lab, x -ray, pharmacy, and the ward to be fully staffed. 3. Maintenance and Rotation of Supplies . Provisions must be made for permanent stowage and adequate security of medical supplies at the BDSs. The SMO must ensure that each BDS is equipped with the necessary miscellaneous items (e.g., flashlights, head and hand lanterns, batteries, etc.). Prescribed surgical packs must be readily available and serviceable should the need arise. SMOs must inspect these facilities and supplies upon reporting for duty, and are encouraged to recommend changes to the TYCOM on the basic contents of the sterile packs and associated supplies. Additional supplies may be added to the minimum requirements if approved by the SMO. If added, they will be included on the inventory and managed the same as the required items. An inv entory list must be kept of all emergency medical supplies dispersed throughout the ship. Rotation of shelf life supplies is mandatory. Newly requisitioned supplies are to be rotated into reserve stock and older stock utilized in sick bay. This process provides the opportunity for use prior to expiration. Defective material will be surveyed and destroyed in accordance with current directives. 4. Additional Supplies for BDS . The AMAL 3052/3252 contains the minimum requirements for BDSs on all CVNs. A complete inventory of all BDSs must be accomplished semi -annually, and the inventory list signed and dated at the time the inventory is conducted. The replacement of material must occur as part of the regular semi -annual inventory. Items that will expire prior to the next scheduled inventory must be replaced during the inventory. 5.

One \"H\" cylinder and one \"D\" cylinder may be in an \"in-use\" status. All other tanks must be full. The BDS in -use tanks must not be allowed to fall below 1000 PSI unless treating actual casualties. c. Water Supply . Provisions for potable water supply for BDSs must comply with ship's design and class s pecifications. A diagram and operating instructions for the gravity fed potable water system must be posted in the immediate vicinity. The potable water gravity tank must be labeled \"drain, flush, and refill every three months.\" It must be the responsib ility of the medical department to empty, flush, and refill the emergency fresh water tanks. All tanks must have water samples taken monthly to determine chlorine and bacterial content in accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-3 current 3M and preventive medicine directives. The date and result of the most recent chlorine residual and bacteriological test must be posted on or near the potable water tanks. 6. Route and Access Markings a. Routes to BDSs must be marked on interior and exterior bulkheads throughout the ship in accordance with the NSTM, volume 2, chapter 079. b. Each hatch and door leading directly to a BDS must be fitted with a metal label plate with the inscription \"ACCESS BATTLE DRESSING STATION\" engraved thereon in 1/2 inch letters and filled with red baked e namel. c. When establishing and marking the routes to the various BDSs throughout the ship (interior and exterior), the markers must be located frequently enough to enable the person(s) following the route to have a clear view of the next marker. 7. Surgical Packs and Trays . Surgical instrument trays, anesthesia trays, minor surgical sets, suture sets and items that are routinely stocked at BDSs must be prepared in accordance with this instruction. a. Specific trays or sets must be prepared and m aintained sterile. Surgical knife blades are to be included with surgical instrument trays with the foil wrapping intact to prevent rusting. Sutures packaged in plastic packets are desirable, but are not to be autoclaved due to the deteriorating effect o f heat to plastic. Paper foil wrapped sutures may be autoclaved. Assorted suture materials will be made readily available and must be armed with a needle. Pre -packaged sterile knife blades and suture materials can be placed in the plastic dust cover with the sterile packs. A piece of tape should be placed on the outside of the plastic cover indicating the expiration date of the suture material inside. b.

Stretchers and Litters DESCRIPTION MINIMUM QUANTITY Litter, Folding, Rigid, Pole (Army Pole Litters or Mass Casualty/Decontamination Litters) 28 Litter, Rigid, Sea -Air, MEDEVAC (Sea -Air Rescue (SAR) Rigid Collapsible stretcher) 2 Litter, Rigid, Stokes 80 Litter -Splint, Extrication (Rescue or Reeves Sleeve II) 24 Sling, Rescue Helicopter 2 Wire Rope Assembly (Trail line Assembly or Extraction line) 2 Handling Lines with Snap Hooks 24 a. The type and quantity of the various stretchers must be maintained according to CVN AMALs and this instruction, and will be listed in the medical department battle bill. The recommended location for the stretchers is contained in appendix Q and appendix S, however, these locations may be altered as necessary to better meet the needs of the individual ship. Consideration will be given to the nature of extrication required when selecting the type o f stretcher for that area of the ship. Stretchers will not normally be stowed in locked spaces that are difficult to access. Determination of the type of stretcher or litter to be used for personnel casualty transfer must be based on the condition of the casualty and environmental factors; however, safety must remain a paramount consideration. b. Serviceability, inspection criteria, and accountability for all stretchers or litters must be in accordance with the current 3M system. All stretchers or litters will be stenciled with the ship's name, hull number, and compartment location. Stenciling must be located in such an area that it can be readily viewed when the stretcher and litter is in its normal storage position. Locations and types of all st retchers and litters will be included in the medical department's battle bill. c. Handling lines will be maintained in BDSs, repair lockers, and with the MRT gear. One will be available with each litter -splint, extrication (rescue or reeves sleeve II). They will consist of at least 25 feet of line, and must have a snap -hook or locking d -ring spliced to one end of the line with a minimum of five tucks on the splice. If a modern synthetic double -weave line is used, it will be tied to the ring with a bowl ine and two half hitches. Handling lines must be maintained in a pouch for easy stowage and transport. The purpose of the handling line is to belay a patient in a litter down a ladder. Historically, the lines spliced on a stretcher were difficult to mai ntain and became a significant trip hazard after they were used. If a patient must be transported down a ladder, the line will be removed from the pouch, snapped onto the stretcher, and then re -stowed at the bottom of the ladder. Handling lines with a po uch are commercially available through emergency medical services (EMS) distributors. The locking d - rings and snap -hooks must be rated for a minimum breaking strength of 5,000 pounds. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-7 d. Deep Access Rescue and Extrication (1) It is not normally the function of the medical department to rig the extrication equipment for rescue from a deep space or void. Riggers have the requisite knowledge to perform this hazardous evolution safely. Each ship will designate and train a shipboard extrication team who will rig and maintain the equipment necessary to extricate the patient, while the medical personnel treat the patient and prepare them for transport in the appropriate litter. (2) Handling lines of sufficient circumference and length will be provided t o permit efficient and safe handling. 1/2\" nylon handling lines or equivalent synthetic lines are required. (a) The line must be of sufficient length to allow the litter to be lowered into the required space with enough line remaining to pass through the pad eye or block over the hatch and take three turns around a stanchion. (b) An additional line of suitable length must be available for attachment to the lower end of the litter to stabilize it during the extrication process. (c) The shipboar d extrication team must maintain both lines along with any other specialized equipment. e. Sea-Air Rescue (SAR) Litters . NTTP 3 -50.1 requires at least two SAR MEDEVAC litters for boat and deck recovery be maintained aboard CVNs. NTTP 3 -50.1 also requir es a trail line assembly (also known as wire rope assembly or extraction line) and a rescue litter sling assembly (also known as sling, rescue helicopter) when using these litters for a SAR helicopter or deck recovery. Assemblies must be ordered separatel y. Refer to appendix O for details. The medical department is responsible to maintain SAR litters in a state of readiness at all times. f. Army pole litters (also known as litter, folding, rigid pole, or decontamination and mass casualty litters) are t o be utilized for moving patients on the ward and to support mass casualty requirements. They must not be utilized to transport patients up or down ladders. 14-3. Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) Preparedness. 1. CBR Defense Responsibility a. The SMO must ensure all providers have a thorough knowledge of CBR medical treatment regimens. Courses are available through the local environmental preventive medicine unit, on -line and through other government agencies. The following are recommend ed for self-study and references: (1) NSTM 070 Radiological Recovery of Ships After Nuclear Weapons Explosions.

The SMO must be familiar with the ship's CBR defense bill, which establishes CBR defense organization within the ship's damage control organization. The CBR defense bill will outline the battle and administrative responsibilities of the medical department during and after CBR attack. 3. CBR Defense Material a. FHP supplies will be stocked according to AMAL 3005/32005 and TYCOM requirements. Ships and operating units must provide adequate protec tive measures for Nerve Agent Auto -Injector (ATNAA) to prevent loss from pilferage or misuse. Except for pyrodistigmine bromide, which requires refrigeration to extend shelf life, adequate storage is considered to be a locked cabinet, locked medical locke r, or locked storeroom that is not readily accessible to all hands. Controlled medicinals included in the FHP AMAL will be included in the SLEP program and will be required to be inventoried every 90 days. The entire stock of the controlled medicinal can be secured with tamper evident seals to allow for quick inventory. When the ship is cruising in condition III or higher, the FHP AMAL block must be distributed to each BDS. A plan for distribution of CBR defense medications must be developed by each carrier and documented in the ship's battle bill and ship's CBR defense 4. Decontamination Stations . Personnel decontamination stations be established in accordance with NWP 3 -20.31, NSTM 470, and BUMEDINST are equired by BUMEDINST 6470.10B and are defined in appendix O. The medical department must provide them in the indicated quantity and they must be stowed in a suitably mounted cabinet or chest near each decontamination station. Semi -annual inventories of decontamination stations will be documented and signed. Dated entries must be made on the inventory list of each decontamination locker. 5. BW and CW Medical Material a. The FHP medical consumables block will be stocked in accordance with appendix O. b. Specific medications and treatment protocols may be found in the references listed in paragraph 14301. c. Medical and supply departments must coordinate custody and appropriate storage (secure refrigeration as required, etc.). d. Careful attention must be paid to the SLEP, in coordination with the TYCOM, by the designated custodian of the block. 14-4. BW Agent Confirmatory Laboratory Guidance 1. General . To provide guidance to naval units outfitted with confirmatory laboratories for use of equ ipment described herein and for receiving, sampling, testing, reporting, packaging and transport of suspected BW samples. Guidance pertains to all deployed ship platforms currently outfitted with confirmatory labs aboard. The confirmatory laboratory uses highly reliable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to confirm or discount presumptive hand held assay (HHA) results. Testing a presumptive HHA sample with a second independent method leads to a very high level of certainty for sample identificati on. This uniquely layered approach to bio - defense leads to highly reliable BW agent identification. 2. Definitions. a. PCR Testing . Confirms the presence of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a specific BW agent. PCR equipment is deployed as part of the confirmatory laboratory. b. PCR Instrument - Lightcycler or R.A.P.I.D. Laboratory instrument used to conduct PCR testing. c. Dirty Area . The dirty area is the portion of the confirmatory laboratory where positive control standards and suspect samples are prepared for PCR testing. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-10 d. Clean Area . The portion of the confirmatory laboratory where PCR reagents and negative controls are prepared for PCR testing. e. PCR Reagents . Materials required for PCR testing. f. Quality Control Program . Monthly testing program established to maintain the proficiencies of PCR trained laboratory technicians. g. Reachback . Protocols established to contact subject matter experts at the biological defense research directorate (BDRD). Reachback is the d efinitive third component of the Navy's robust layered approach to BW agent detection. h. Biosafety Cabinet (BSC) . Specialized laboratory equipment used to keep potentially biohazardous materials isolated. Confirmatory laboratories utilize the BSC to s afely manipulate suspect BW agent samples. i. Receiving Party . Person or persons responsible for receiving and transporting suspect package to its next destination. 3. Environmental Sampling. COMNAVAIRFOR CVNs are outfitted with environmental samplin g protocols and equipment to sample for the presence of aerosolized BW agents and suspicious powders and liquids in letters and parcels. Upon the detection of a suspect BW agent, Navy units are trained in the proper procedures to safely package and ship a sample of the suspect BW agent to the nearest confirmatory laboratory. All CVNs have received confirmatory testing capabilities. These capabilities include the confirmatory PCR laboratory equipment, microbiology area and HHA capabilities. The confirmat ory laboratory is staffed to deliver a second opinion on a positive environmental sample or a suspicious letter and parcel sample. 4. Confirmatory PCR Laboratory Set Up a. The confirmatory PCR laboratory consists of five components. These components include a clean area, a dirty area, a BSC, a PCR instrument (either a R.A.P.I.D. or a Lightcycler), and a set of reagents and standards. The clean area must be set up in an area where potential biological sample contaminants are not present. All reagents and negative PCR control standards are set up in the clean area. The dirty area may be set up in the standard medical laboratory. Positive controls and samples are set up in the dirty area. The BSC is co -located with the dirty area. While manipulating suspect samples within the BSC, in order to prevent DNA contamination of the clean and dirty areas, the PCR instrument must be set up in a separate area from the clean or dirty areas. The reagents and standards must be stored in a manual defrost freezer m aintained at negative 20 degrees Celsius. Freeze or thaw cycles are detrimental to these reagents and standards. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-11 b. Confirmatory microbiological laboratory consists of standard plating techniques for bacterial samples. c. An HHA is repeated in the con firmatory laboratory setting. This verifies the HHA result from the field. 5. Confirmatory Laboratory Operations Upon Notification of Inbound Presumptive BW Agent Samples . The SMO directs PCR qualified laboratory technician to prepare for receipt of samples, and to prepare the confirmatory laboratory. The SMO initiates reachback communication with BDRD. 6. Receiving Presumptive BW Agent Package a. Commander of an affected unit utilizes chain of command to arrange for safe transport of decontaminated package containing the presumptive BW agent sample to the carrier lab. The CVN CO alerts the lab that a suspect package is inbound. b. The lab prepares for receipt of suspect package. c. Suspect package is received, while maintaining ch ain of custody procedures. d. Receiving party escorts suspect package to confirmatory laboratory for testing while maintaining chain of custody procedures. e. The SMO or lab tech receives package while maintaining chain of custody procedures. f. Conf irmatory lab tech opens BW agent package within BSC and ensures integrity of sample container. The primary container is removed, decontaminated with a hype -wipe, and the sample is prepared for testing. g. Lab tech runs confirmatory tests including HHA, PCR, and microbiological analysis as appropriate. 7. Confirmatory Laboratory Testing and Responses for Negative HHA a. If receiving a suspicious letter or parcel sample with a previously negative HHA test result: (1) The SMO instructs confirmatory la b tech to repeat a complete HHA panel to verify negative HHA result, perform microbiological analysis on blood agar or MacConkey's media as available, and conduct PCR testing. Conduct reachback for specific agent test procedures. (2) Results of all con firmatory tests will be verified via reachback consultation with BDRD. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-12 (3) The SMO directs medical monitoring of \"at -risk\" personnel until lab clears sample (i.e. no growth on blood agar or MacConkey's media after the appropriate time period and/or PCR t esting negative) or as deemed appropriate by the SMO (No clinical cases observed following an anticipated agent -specific incubation period). (4) If sample is determined negative by confirmatory testing: (a) Alert chain of command of negative result . (b) Chain of command issues follow -on messages as appropriate. (c) Chain of command will determine further treatment of the sample(s) and follow - on action. If sample is shipped from the confirmatory laboratory, package as a class 6.2 infectious substance but label and ship as an \"environmental sample\". Engage local shipping experts for further detail. (5) If sample is determined positive for a BW agent by confirmatory laboratory testing: (a) The SMO directs medical treatment appropriate to BW agent detected. Since multiple agents could be present in a positive sample, engage reachback subject matter experts at BDRD for instruction on additional testing of the sample. (b) Chain of command issues follow -on messages as appropriate. (c) Chain of command will determine further treatment of the sample(s) and follow - on action. If sample is shipped, package and ship as a class 6.2 infectious substance. Engage local shipping experts for further detail. 8. Confirmatory Laboratory Testin g and Responses for Positive HHA a. If confirmatory laboratory is receiving a sample that has tested positive via the HHA: (1) The SMO directs the laboratory technician to conduct confirmatory tests including a complete HHA panel, PCR testing for the BW agent identified, and microbiological analyses (as available) for the BW agent identified. Since multiple agents could be present in a positive sample, engage reachback SMEs at BDRD for instruction on additional testing of the sample. (2) The SMO di rects medical monitoring of \"at -risk\" personnel until lab clears sample (i.e. No growth on blood agar or MacConkey's media after 72 hours and PCR testing negative) or as deemed appropriate by SMO (No clinical cases observed following an anticipated agent - specific incubation period). COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-13 (3) If Lab confirms presence of BW agent, the SMO reports positive results and recommends appropriate medical course of action to the CO. (4) If after consultation with BDRD reachback, the confirmatory laboratory determines that the sample is negative (i.e. No BW agent detected): (a) The SMO reports negative result to the CO. (b) CO initiates appropriate follow on message traffic. (c) Chain of command will determine further treatment of the sample(s) an d follow - on action. If sample is shipped, package as a Class 6.2 Infectious Substance but label and ship as an \"Environmental Sample.\" Engage local shipping experts for further detail. 9. PCR Quality Control Program a. PCR quality control reagents (u nknown samples) are deployed to confirmatory laboratories. b. Confirmatory laboratories are instructed to conduct PCR quality control testing on a monthly basis. c.

Inform the NMRC OOD that you need the BDRD watch stander paged; provide contact information to the OOD. 12. Conf irmatory Laboratory Inventories a. Inventory checklists are included in the Dirty and Clean laboratory boxes. b. Questions regarding inventory components may be addressed through reachback to BDRD. 14-5. Mass Casualty Planning 1. Definition of Ma ss Casualty . The mass casualty bill must be activated any time personnel casualties exceed the capabilities of the medical department personnel on the scene. In this situation, all of the medical personnel and material resources will need to be mobilized in an effort to render aid to the greatest number of casualties possible. The keys to successful execution of the mass casualty bill are flexibility, good communication, sound leadership, and efficient utilization of resources to return the greatest numb er of personnel to full duty, resulting in quality care to the greatest number of remaining casualties. Although triage will vary according to the ship's tactical situation and the total number of casualties sustained, the categories remain consistent. T here should be no hesitancy in calling \"Mass Casualty\" as this action mobilizes many functional areas of the ship in addition to Medical (i.e. dental, supply, weapons, AIMD, air department, and security). The exact method of notification should be outline d in the Mass Casualty Bill. The medical department must develop, implement, and regularly review the Mass Casualty Bill. Mass casualty drills are required, and the periodicity is outlined in the COMNAVAIRFORINST 3500.20E. 2. Triage Categories . Triage is necessary in order to determine priority for treatment as well as returning the greatest number of personnel to full duty. Depending upon the tactical situation, emphasis will be placed predominantly on the immediate category or on the walking wounded category. Assignment of a triage category is a continuously evolving process and should be repeated frequently, and, at a minimum, following each interventi on. The triage categories are: a. Immediate (Red) . Life or limb -saving measures are required i n order to have any reasonable expectation for survival. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-15 b. Delayed (Yellow) . Cases in which some surgical intervention will be required, but can be safely delayed until after the Immediate category have been treated. c. Minimal (Walking Wounded) (Gre en). Those who not only can ambulate without assistance to receive care, but who can be tended to most rapidly and then returned to their duty station. d. Expectant (Black) . Those whose injuries are so severe that survival is either not expected or wou ld consume so many personnel and material resources that many other casualties would suffer as a consequence. Note: Triage categories may be assigned differently depending upon the total number of casualties suffered, the number and expertise of medical providers, the amount of medical supplies, and the urgency with which casualties must be returned to duty. Depending upon the situation, it may be more important to retain a large number of casualties in the holding area where the surgeon and anesthesia p rovider are able to assist multiple casualties, rather than getting the first case to the operating room. 3. Mass Casualty Areas . The exact location of the following areas will vary depending upon the location of the casualties and the nature of the eve nt resulting in the casualties, in addition to what tactical evolution the ship is in at the time. If the ship is in flight operations, the prime consideration will be to clear the flight deck expeditiously without contributing further foreign object debr is (FOD) hazards. The primary triage evolution can be accomplished by rapid movement of casualties to another location with movement of minimal, if any, supplies onto the flight deck. a. Initial Triage and Collecting Area . This area may be one in the s ame, and merely be an area for collecting as many casualties as possible before movement to a safe location (i.e. deck edge elevator prior to movement to the hangar bay). If this area is on the flight deck, it may be just one or two HMs performing initial triage and informing other department personnel of the nature and extent of injuries. Depending upon the situation a flight surgeon and one or two HMs will be in the flight deck BDS to render aid to walking wounded (to expeditiously return them to full d uty) or possibly render the beginning of ATLS protocols. b. Triage Area . This area is the first location where a concerted triage effort is conducted, and depending upon timing and numbers, the first ATLS measures. The primary triage officer should be located here. Walking wounded should be directed to the designated treatment area, often an auxiliary BDS or a separate location in the hangar bay. Expectant and deceased casualties should be moved to other locations in the hangar bay. c. Holding Area . This area is the area where the greatest amount of care can be rendered to the greatest number of casualties with the fewest personnel because of the open spaces. This area is for the gathering of casualties for definitive resuscitation and temporary ob servation prior COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-16 to orderly movement to the main BDS. Often, this area will be the forward or aft mess decks on the second deck. One should not rush to move large numbers of casualties to the main BDS because the configuration in the main BDS is such that it takes more providers to render care in that area. Depending upon the total number of casualties, you may move two or three of your most critical casualties plus a surgical case to the main BDS. Remember, you cannot afford to commit too many personnel to just a few casualties if the total casualty count is high. d. Main BDS . All litter casualties will eventually be moved to this location. Walking wounded casualties will be treated and returned to duty to support the ships evolution. 4. Location of Providers . Distribution of providers is as critical as distribution of supplies and utilization of space. The location of all providers for mass casualty response must be listed in the WQSB. Resist the temptation to commit yourself or other providers t o a hazardous location. Personnel resources are limited and the medical department cannot afford to have any of them become casualties themselves. Crash fire and rescue personnel, other fire fighters, and repair locker personnel are trained in the recove ry, extraction, and removal of casualties. Stretcher bearers will then bring the casualties to the providers. Dental officers will assist in triage or in treatment of casualties as appropriate. Because the greatest amount of care can be provided to the greatest number of casualties in the holding area, this area may be the best location for initial utilization of the general surgeon, oral surgeon, and anesthesia provider. Like all other facets of the mass casualty scenario, distribution of personnel mus t remain flexible and well thought out in terms of safety and effectiveness. 5. Mass Casualty Supplies . Seven mass casualty sets will be used to provide mass casualty medical supplies. These sets will be stocked in accordance with appendix O (AMAL 3051/3251). These sets must be strategically pre -staged and remain portable to support a variety of continge ncies. The seven mass casualty sets should be maintained with one in each hangar bay, two on the forward mess decks, and two on the aft mess decks. These locations may be altered as necessary to better meet the needs of the individual and the ship. These supplies must be inventoried as outlined in appendix Q of this instruction. The supply petty officer must work closely with the supply department to rapidly replenish the supplies once they are depleted from the mass casualty sets and other locations. 6. Communication. Each CVN must establish an effective mass casualty communication system that allows for alternate methods of communication in the event that the primary means is lost through an equipment casualty. Hand held radio systems are the most ef ficient and are preferred over sound powered phones or messengers; however, all three methods of communication should be drilled. The number and type of casualties is critical for efficient management of the situation, and must eventually be reported to t he chain of command. The SMO must retain a capability of overseeing the entire evolution and an understanding of the \"big picture.\" This understanding is necessary in order to apply his/her expertise and experience to the overall directing of events. Th e SMO should assign a qualified officer or Chief Petty Officer to Damage Control Central for communications control and medical coordination, without compromising COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 14-17 access to bulk narcotics. This individual accumulates casualty information and directs the f low of casualties, personnel, equipment, and supplies throughout the ship. They determine safe routes based on information from the DCA and provide casualty information to the damage control officer. They are the \"controllers\" of the flow of casualty car e and medical responses throughout the ship. 7. Preparation . Planning for a wide variety of scenarios is key to being well prepared. Although history has taught us to plan for the flight deck or hangar bay mishap, there are numerous other events and lo cations that could produce mass casualties, at sea or in port. The medical department and ship's personnel should train for as many variations as possible. Although the Mass Casualty Bill is not executed during GQ, plan for the management of numerous cas ualties during GQ, and for the eventual movement of casualties as the situation evolves or the ship stands down from GQ. A script cannot possibly be written for every possible situation. Shipboard personnel must practice as many different scenarios as po ssible and create order out of chaos through effective communication and efficient utilization of resources. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 15-1 CHAPTER 15 CARRIER STRIKE GROUP OPERATIONS 1. Carrier Strike Group Surgeon (CSGS) Responsibilities . The CVN SMO must be designated as the CSGS. The CSGS is the senior medical authority afloat and advises the strike group commander on all matters pertaining to the health care of the strike group. The CSGS must become familiar with the role of JTF surgeon and joint force maritime component commander surgeon responsibilities and how to fit into CSG staff prior to any underway periods (see NTTP 3-32.1, Navy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Maritime Operations Centers). This role has become important in CSG and CVN joint force integration and in contingency operations; the SMO, MAO and others may be tasked to act as a JTF Surgeon cell. SMOs should consult with COMNAVAIRPAC or COMNAVAIRLANT if additional forces are required. It is high ly recommended that at the first sign of standing up a JTF surgeon cell that the CSGS request O -6 Medical Service Corps/POMI augment. 2. Medical Liaison with Ships in Strike Group . Carrier Medical Departments must provide medical support for the entire CSG while underway and as needed/required outside the strike group. Support within the strike group is facilitated if all parties are fully cognizant of each other's capabilities and general operating procedures. Ships in company have called upon CVN Medical Departments for assistance in a variety of circumstances, including: a. Operational emergencies involving personnel casualties. b. Medical and surgical consultative services. c. Dental support. d. Supply, x -ray and laboratory services. e. Evacuation services. f. Preventive medicine and epidemiological support. g. Optician support. h. Medical equipment repair support. i. Mental health and substance abuse consultation, evaluation, and treatment. j. IDC support. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 15-2 3. Strike Group P re-deployment Planning . To optimize medical support within the CSG, all COMNAVAIRFOR CVN medical departments, prior to commencement of strike group operations or operational deployments, must accomplish the following: a. Establish communications between the carrier and commands in company at least 30 (preferably closer to 90) days prior to Composite Training Unit Exercises or deployment. b. Hold pre -deployment briefs to assure the understanding and coordination of mission requirements and CSG policies and procedures by medical representatives of all participating units. The CSGS must provide sufficient notice and lead time to allow attendance by all medical department representatives at these work -up phase meetings. At a minimum, the following issues should be discussed: medical and dental capabilities within the CSG, quality assurance, medical intelligence, MEDEVAC procedures, grounding, and clearing of flight crew personnel and medical guard ship duty. c. Physically visit, whenever possible, medic al departments of ships, which will be in company. d. Invite medical department representatives of commands, which will be in company to visit the CVN medical department for indoctrination. e. Provide a written protocol describing, at a minimum: (1) Regular communication forums including NIPR, SIPR (chat is highly recommended), and POTS contact numbers. Underway it is highly advisable for the CSGS to have a fireside SIPRNET chat several nights a week to discuss CSG medical issues/patients. (2) Medical and dental services available and capabilities. (3) Procedures for patient referral or transfer. (4) Other information as desired by the CVN medical department, such as medical supply material carried on board. (5) Indoctrination on helicopt er MEDEVAC methods, limitations, hazards, and environment. Additionally, ascertain whether the sending ship is capable of receiving a helicopter on deck. (6) The information should also be provided to additional ships, which join the task force or oper ational group during the deployment. 4. Surface Force IDC Process Improvement . During CSG operations, a medical officer must periodically embark upon the IDC -manned strike group ships. Program process improvement COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 15-3 review and oversight rests with the COM NAVSURFOR; however, if requested, the CVN medical department may conduct process improvement reviews and assist with any difficult medical cases. COMNAVSURFOR has directed CSG monthly QA reports be copied to the CVN SMO for situational awareness. 5. Pre-deployment Checklist . All medical departments will utilize the checklist in appendix T when preparing for deployment. 6. Maritime Operations Center (MOC ) Functions .

COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 16-1 CHAPTER 16 HEALTH PROMOTIONS AND W ELLNESS 1. General a. Health Promotion and Wellness (HPW) is a combination of health education and related organizational, physical, emotional, social, spiritual, mental wellness and health care interventions designed to improve or protect health. An HPW program should encourage healthy lifestyles, increase organizational and individual readiness, and concentrate on increased healthy lifestyle choices by identifying and minimizing health risk behavior and disabilities. b. It is estimated that individ ual behaviors and environmental factors account for at least 70 percent of all premature deaths in the U.S. Unhealthy lifestyles are the major underlying cause for many of the health problems in the U.S. population, pose a huge social and economic burden, and decrease mission readiness by decreasing deployability and performance levels. Examples of unhealthy lifestyles include misuse of drugs and alcohol, tobacco use, poor nutrition, sedentary lifestyle, preventable injuries, sexual irresponsibility, misman agement of stress and anger, suicide attempts and interpersonal violence. c. The CO is responsible for ensuring that a command HPW program is implemented. The command HPW program must promote optimal wellness through various educational and intervention programs. d. Program requirements for COMNAVAIRFOR ships are outlined in COMNAVAIRFORINST 6100.1. Additional information on health promotion programs can be found in OPNAVINST 6100.2A and BUMEDINST 6110.13A. e. The medical department plays a key role in the establishment and overall maintenance of the command HPW program. 2. HPW Program Goals a. Available to all crew/staff. b. High participation and satisfaction rate. c. Increase awareness of healthier lifestyles and behaviors. d. Improve readiness. e. Increase command fitness. f. Assist in risk reduction. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 16-2 g. Encourage individual responsibility. h. Enhance productivity and morale. i. Improve quality of life. j. Emphasize healthy people leading indicators, such as (1) Physical activity (2) Overweight and obesity (3) Tobacco use (4) Substance abuse (5) Responsible sexual behavior (6) Mental health (7) Injury and violence (8) Environmental health (9) Immunizations (10) Access to health care 3. Health Promotion Coordinator Qualifications . The health promotion coordinator (HPC) must: a. Possess a genuine interest in HPW and increase crew awareness of HPW topics for a healthy lifestyle. b. Be a non -smoker. c. Maintain height/weight standards and be physically fit. d. Be paygrade E -7 or above and appointed in writing. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 16-3 4. Courses for Health Promotion Coordinator (HPC) a. Contact the NMCPHC and the local MTF/clinic for courses on HPW programs. b. The HPC must attend the three -day Navy Health Promotion Advanced Course given by NMCPHC. c. It is recommended that the HPC should attend the combined Population Health & Health Promotion and Wellness Conference sponsored by NMCPHC, Navy Occupational Health, and Preventive Medicine held annually. d. Utilize the Health Promotion toolbox and additional program guidance offered at NMCPHC's website at: http://www.nmcphc.med.navy.mil. 5. HPW Program Marketing a. A yearly calendar of events/classes must be published and distributed throughout the ship. This calendar must contain the health promotion events sponsored by the ship and the local area hosts when pier side. Many classes are taught in the local area that the ship can utilize. Contact the force environmental health officer (EHO) or the local MTF, Fleet and Family Support Center, area Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Unit (NEPMU) or clinic Health Promotion Department for more information. b. The ship's closed -circuit TV should be used to air the events calendar and show educational videos on the different health promotion programs. c. Conduct health fairs to expose the crew to current health topics and allow them to interact with health care professionals on an informal basis. Contact the local NEPMU for info and help with the hea lth fairs. d. The ship's newspaper, Plan of the Week/Day, bulletin boards, notes, brochures, pamphlets, newsletters, and promotion posters should be used to promote the command's HPW program. 6. Program Self Evaluation a. The HPC must oversee a health assessment on each command member at least annually. This assessment is to ensure that the HPW program is meeting the needs of the crew. To conduct the assessment, the Health Risk Appraisal (HRA) form or the Health Assessment Review Tool can be used. F or the fleet, the HRA is normally used. To obtain information on the following go to the NMCPHC web site: http://www.nmcphc.med.navy.mil/. The local supporting NEPMU can assist in compiling the HRA data sheets. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 16-4 b. The HPC should develop a survey or eval uation form that can be used to evaluate the HPW classes given at the command. At the end of all HPW classes, a survey should be provided to participants in order to evaluate and make changes to improve the class. All class participants should be encoura ged to fill out an evaluation form/survey. 7. Health Promotion Award . NMCPHC administers the Surgeon General's Blue \"H\" Award for command excellence in HPW. For more information, including the specific criteria for the Blue \"H\" Award, contact NMCPHC ( www.nmcphc.med.navy.mil). COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-1 CHAPTER 17 PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, AND DEPLOYMENT HEALTH SURVEILLANCE 17-1. General 1. Introduction . This chapter addresses policies that promote and mai ntain the health, welfare, and comfort of the personnel stationed aboard COMNAVAIRPAC and COMNAVAIRLANT CVNs. The SMO is responsible for implementing preventive medicine, occupational medicine, deployment health and environmental health programs and advis ing the CO of all conditions affecting the health of the crew. These include: a. IMR and PHA b. Communicable disease control and the immunization -tracking program c. TB control and surveillance program d. Food safety program e. Potable water and ice surveillance program f. CHT system and solid waste surveillance g. International health regulations h. Pest control program i. Habitability j. Medical waste program k. Bloodborne pathogen program l. Heat stress program m. Deployment he alth surveillance program 2. Inspections and Reports a. Inspections (1) The SMO or preventive medicine representative must conduct routine sanitation and COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-2 habitability inspections to identify health threats and other detrimental conditions that are potentially degrading to the health and wellbeing of the ship's crew. (2) Findings must be documented and reported to the CO with copies provided to cognizant department heads, DIVOs or LCPOs. (3) Inspection frequency is determined by published guide lines and instructions, CO's direction, potential health risk for illness or injury, and/or degree of compliance with published health standards. b. Preventive Medicine/Occupational Health Reporting (1) Pertinent aspects from the preventive medicine and occupational health program will be submitted in the monthly medical QA report. The monthly report format for the occupational health and preventive medicine information is maintained at the TYCOM and a copy is available upon request. (2) The compl iance goal for each program area is set forth by higher authority. An overall compliance equal to or greater than 90 percent is the ultimate goal. The MRI, Section E, and FHP is the assessment tool for program compliance. Additionally, the monthly QA re port monitors program compliance throughout the calendar year. Programs should have the ability to actively improve and measure program compliance and properly explain deficiencies, shortfalls and corrective actions. 17-2. Preventive Medicine 1. Diseas e Reporting a. The Medical Event Report (MER) is the primary method of reporting various medical events, including communicable diseases, injuries and outbreaks, to the chain of command and appropriate health authorities. Reporting requirements and guid elines for MERs are provided in BUMEDINST 6220.12C. b. Commands are required to report to applicable military, local, state, federal, and international health authorities. The TYCOM force EHO as well as the local MTF preventive medicine department and a rea supporting NEPMU can also offer assistance and advice. c. Submit routine MERs using the NMCPHC's NDRSi Website or TMIP as reportable event(s) are suspected or confirmed. If suspected, ensure follow up with necessary information to close the event. Urgent MERs must be reported within 24 hours of suspected diagnosis followed up by a final MER when diagnosis is confirmed. Specific reporting timeframes for each reportable disease are contained in BUMEDINST 6220.12C. TMIP -generated medical event repor ts may be acceptable to health authorities for commands that do not have adequate COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-3 internet access. Always verify these procedures depending on where you are operating to ensure proper communicable disease reporting to the correct authorities. In addition , a step by step guide to submit files through NMO is available at http://www.nmcphc.med.navy.mil/PreventiveMedicine/disease surveillance/medeventreporting.as px. Technical assistance is also available through the help desk at 757 -953-0954 or ndrs@nmcphc.med.navy.mil. d. Special emphasis concerning AOR requirements. If you are in doubt of FHP guidance or AOR Annex Q direction depending on location (e.g. COCOM, service component and or numbered fleet), notify the cognizant NEPMU via telephone and/or e -mail or contact the TYCOM force EHO at 757 -836-6317 for guidance if available. e. The medical department sick call log must be reviewed daily for tracking potential disease trends and follow -up on reportable diseases and injuries. 2. Communicable Disease Control and Surveillance a. Immunizations (1) Ship's company and embarked squadron personnel must be immunized and re - immunized, as applicable, in accordance with BUMEDINST 623 0.15B. Squadron personnel should be fully immunized by their cognizant shore -based MTF prior to deployment. In the event that significant numbers of squadron personnel embark not fully immunized, the specifics of the immunization shortfall should be repo rted to the appropriate CNAP or CNAL force medical staff in the monthly QA report. (2) Preventive medicine must provide program oversight to ensure that required immunizations are administered and documented correctly. Medical personnel administering immunizations must receive annual training in the current policies and procedures. (3) Adhere to established immunization tracking requirements. (a) Immunization documentation. Immunizations will be recorded including all the required data fields at the time of service on the Adult Immunization Record, NAVMED 6230/4 (rev 10 -2007), or TMIP generated DD 2766 and filed in the medical record. NAVMED 6230/4 is also available at: http://www.med.navy.mil/directives/ExForms/NAVMED%206230 - 4%20(10 -2007).pdf Each medical record must a current NAVMED 6230/4 or TMIP generated DD 2766. Standard Form 601, immunizations record, containing previous immunizations mus t be retained, but must not be used for recording current immunizations. Immunizations must also be recorded at the time and point of service (where the immunization is given), in TMIP when available. Immunizations listed on the DD 2766 must be fully docu mented in TMIP, as the DD 2766 print out does not list all immunization information required by the COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-4 U.S. FDA and the National Vaccine Liability Act. Requirement is to document immunizations once in the medical record and once in TMIP. (b) Electronic t ransfer of all immunization data is required weekly to the Navy Medicine Medical Information Systems Support Activity via the NMO website. This requirement is in addition to data that is transferred via TMIP communicator. (c) Accurate documentation in the database and individual medical records is critical. Entries for each vaccine or toxoid administered need to be entered on NAVMED 6230/4. Include the following information: date given, manufacturer, lot number, dose given, and route of administratio n. The provider's name, address, and title also needs to be included. 1. Cold chain management is critical. Proper storage and shelf life requirements must be closely monitored. If in doubt always check the vaccine (product) package insert for specifics. 2. The temperature of all refrigerators used to store vaccines must be checked and documented twice a day. Stay vigilant in monitoring vaccine products. This is critical for quality control and preserving supplies. b. Tuberculosis (TB) Cont rol Program (1) Navy policies governing TB control, treatment, and case management are detailed in BUMEDINST 6224.8C. Specific program guidance may be obtained from either the TYCOM or the cognizant NEPMU. (2) All operational personnel must have a L atent TB Infection Screening (LTBI) administered after receipt of orders to a commissioned vessel. All previous TB Skin Test (TST) reactors must show documentation of successful completion of LTBI treatment regimen. If a person gives an undocumented hist ory of LTBI treatment for a previous positive TST or other laboratory test, perform a TST and treat in accordance with BUMEDISNT 6224.8C. Document successful treatment for LTBI in the medical record. No additional LTBI testing or chest radiograph is requi red unless otherwise indicated. All ship personnel must be evaluated annually during the PHA using NAVMED 6224/8 Interim Tuberculosis Exposure Risk Assessment, to determine TB exposure history and risk of acquiring TB. This must be documented in the indiv idual medical record. Following the initial TST, subsequent evaluations will be conducted via TB questionnaire/survey in accordance with BUMED 6224.8C. (3) A PMT must evaluate all individuals with a TST induration greater than 5 mm to determine if their test is positive. A medical officer or PA must see all reactors prior to instituting a course of Isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy. A second opinion is req uired from a preventive medicine physician or infectious disease specialist if an initial reactor who meets the guidelines of BUMEDINST 6224.8C is not started on INH. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-5 (4) Patients placed on INH therapy must be seen monthly by preventive medicine until successful completion of treatment as prescribed in BUMEDINST 6224.8C. Consideration should be given to directly observed therapy on a semi -weekly basis as a tool to maximize compliance. A final follow -up visit is also required after the completion of I NH therapy and the patient is placed in the annual follow -up program. (5) Tracking for TB control program. TMIP must be used to track all newly identified reactors, monthly INH follow -up, and previous reactors (annuals). A desktop guide is available and should be incorporated into the SOP. This standardizes data entry, program reports, and annual summary report. c. Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Program (1) Navy guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of STDs is provided in BUMEDINST 6222.10C. The most current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment guidelines must be available and utilized for STD patient management and treatment. (2) An STD control program report (log or database) must be maintained to track the overall management of patients being assessed, evaluated and treated for STDs. TMIP serves as the management tool for this program requirement. (3) All STD patients must be directed to preventive medicine for contact interviews to fulfill various repo rting requirements in accordance with BUMEDINST 6220.12C and BUMEDINST 6222.10C. TMIP provides the necessary data fields to track patient follow -ups, Hepatitis B vaccine series, and MER submissions. Creating an ad hoc report in TMIP by selecting these fi elds that match your data input enables production of a current STD control report, useful in determining control measures that need to be undertaken. (4) A MER must be submitted for any case of chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis (all stages), and/or hepati tis B. Section 2, paragraph 1, of this chapter, details MER guidance. (5) All patients evaluated for a STD must be tested for syphilis and HIV. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine will be administered (if not previously vaccinated) to all patients evalu ated for a STD in accordance with the current CDC treatment guidelines. When STD patients return for their third dose of the HBV vaccine (i.e., 6 months) they should also be offered follow -up HIV testing. d. Rabies Prevention and Animal Bite Control (1) Follow guidance in accordance with SECNAVINST 6401.1B and BUMEDINST 6220.12C. In addition, cognizant NEPMU or local MTF preventive medicine department must be contacted for current treatment protocols and guidance with various reporting requirements, methods, and forms reportable in accordance with BUMEDINST 6220.12C. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-6 (2) All animal bite cases must be individually evaluated for possible rabies vaccine administration. In most cases, rabies vaccine should be administered when patients cannot provide adequate information to health or animal control authorities to locate the suspect animal. Utilize DD -2341 dated October 2007 for documentation. e. Malaria Prevention and Control (1) Chemoprophylaxis and treatment protocols are defined in the current edition of the Navy Medical Department Pocket Guide to Malaria Prevention and Control, NEHC -TM PM 6250.1 and NAVMEDCOMINST 6230.2. BUMEDINST 6230.16A (2) intelligence sources, such as the NCMI or their MEDIC CD -ROM product, provide information on current malaria threats and recommendations. Chemoprophylaxis drug quantities and shelf life must be verified prior to deployment and integrated into mission planning. The current AMAL may not have adequate quantities to cover an extended period in a malaria threat area. f. Hand Washing Techniques and Control (1) In order to minimize the spread of communicable diseases through direct and non - direct hand contact, the usage of waterless hand sanitizers must be implemented. These products do not replace proper hand washing techniques. They provide a portable or semi -permanent solution to help combat potential spread of communicable disease. (2) Waterless hand washing stations should be staged at various key locations throughout the ship and must be conspicuously mounted to the bulkhead. The following locations are recommended: (a) Entrance to all galley food service lines (b) Snack food vending stations (c) Medical spaces (to include patient waiting areas) (d) Liberty brows (ideally, to be used primarily during foreign port call visits) (e) Gym facilities (f) Any other area as deemed necessary by the Senior Medical Officer (3) The Supply Department will be responsible to ensure that adequate supplies are present for the waterless hand washing stations. During their scheduled inspectio ns, Preventive Medicine will inspect the hand washing stations for functionality and will conduct appropriate COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-7 awareness training on proper hand washing, personal hygiene, and ship sanitation. Individual departments that have installed waterless hand sanit izer stations are responsible for keeping them stocked. (4) Design and manufacturer of the waterless hand sanitizing stations must be left to the discretion of the Supply Department with guidance from the SMO. Specific guidance may be obtained from e ither the TYCOM Force EHO or the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center. 3. Medical Intelligence and Health Threat Briefs a. Information concerning endemic diseases and vectors in potential ports of call is available from NEPMUs and Navy and Mar ine Corps Public Health Center Intranet.

If galley personnel conduct food service training, preventive medicine staff should routinely audit the training sessions to determine the validity and effectiveness of the training curriculum. Foodservice management personnel and/or the PMTs will conduct training of foodservice workers. Additionally, training support for foodservice workers des ignated as supervisors or a person in charge can also be supported by local NEPMUs. 2. Potable Water Sanitation a. Responsibility (1) Each ship must have a Water Sanitation Bill that delineates all policies and procedures for the provision and monit oring of potable water. (2) The reactor officer is responsible for supply and treatment of potable water. (3) The SMO is responsible for conducting a comprehensive medical surveillance program of the potable water system including adequacy of disinfe ction procedures, collection of samples for bacteriological analysis, and daily halogen residuals from the potable water distribution system. b. References. NSTM chapter 531 and 533; Manual of Naval Preventive Medicine, Chapter 6 (NAVMED P -5010 -6); BUM EDINST 6240.10C. c. Surveillance (1) Preventive medicine must conduct a comprehensive potable water system inspection on a quarterly basis. The inspection should include a review of deck risers, hoses, and hose lockers, sounding tubes, sounding tapes, halogen storage, batch chlorination proc edures and the brominators, chlorinators or electrolytic disinfectant generators as applicable. A search for submerged potable water outlets and other existing or potential cross -connections must be included. A copy of the inspection must be routed via t he chain of command to the CO. (2) Daily halogen residuals must be taken from 12 sampling sites, which are varied and represent all parts of the potable water distribution system. Reactor departments will be notified daily of the sampling results. Fre e available chlorine (FAC), total chlorine residuals or total bromine residuals will be maintained as prescribed by current directives. \"Trace\" halogen residuals may be permitted underway and in CONUS but must be supported by consistently negative bacteri ological test results. If no trace is detectable, or if positive bacteriological tests occur, action must be taken to determine the cause and correct any system problems. Daily COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-10 halogen residuals may be reduced to once per week while monitoring bacteriolo gical quality of potable water when the ship is connected to shore potable water supply in homeport. (3) Bacteriological quality of potable water and ice must be tested weekly, unless otherwise noted, following the procedures provided in NAVMED P -5010 -6.

OPNAV 6210.2A provides quarantine regulations. OPNAVINST 6250.4C establishes Navy policy for implementing pest management programs. The Manual of Naval Preventive Medicine, Chapter 8 (NAVMED P -5010 -8) and the Navy -Wide Shipboard Pest Control Manual (Na vy Entomology Center for Excellence (NECE) publication) discuss Navy policies for a safe and effective pest control program. BUMEDINST 6250.12D establishes procedure for pesticide applicator training and certification for medical department personnel. c. International Health Regulations (Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate (SSCEC) or Ship Sanitation Control Certificate (SSCC)). (1) Follow BUMEDINST 6210.4 for program guidance to comply with international health regulations. Ships must mai ntain their U.S. Public Health Seal until further notice. (2) Deployable vessels must maintain a current SSCEC or SSCC. To be valid, the certificate must have been issued within the preceding six months. Ships must obtain inspection and certification from another command; self -inspection and certification is not authorized. (3) This service is available through U.S. quarantine stations in major ports of the U.S., including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and by NEPMUs, NECE, naval hospitals, and ships with qualified professionals as detailed in BUMEDINST 6210.4. Should operational commitments preclude obtaining a SSCEC or SSCC inspection prior to expiration of the current certificate then one 30 -day extension may be granted by the issuing author ity. d. Surveillance and Treatment (1) Monthly surveys of all food storage and service areas are required to actively search for signs of insect infestations. Active infestations will require frequent follow -up. All incoming provisions also need to be assessed for potential insect infestation. A comprehensive surveillance program will include the use of sticky traps and flushing agents. (2) A pest control log within TMIP will be utilized and maintained. The application documents all investigatio ns, surveys, pesticide applications and treatments. It provides the user management tools to analyze and troubleshoot problem areas. (3) In the event of an insect or rodent infestation, the ship's certified pest control personnel must initiate prompt a nd appropriate control measures. TYCOM force EHO must be notified. NEPMUs or NECE should be contacted for technical assistance as needed. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-13 (4) The application of pesticides without correcting sanitation discrepancies and eliminating insect harborages i s not approved, as it is ineffective in achieving long -term control over pests. e. Pest Control Training (1) OPNAVINST 6250.4C states that medical personnel can be trained to apply pesticides aboard ship. Individuals certified in shipboard pest contr ol are restricted to using only those procedures, equipment, and pesticides approved for shipboard use. Annual certification training is required for all medical personnel who procure and apply standard stock pesticides. The NEPMUs and NECE provide this training. (2) Additionally, Environmental Protection Agency Pesticide Applicator Category 8 certification must be maintained by PMTs as part of their basic 8432 NEC qualification per BUMEDINST 6250.12D. The certification is initially issued upon gradua tion from PMT \"C\" School and is effective for three years. Recertification can be attained at any point before the three years expires by either attending a recertification course sponsored by NECE, either in Jacksonville, Florida or an authorized regiona l course. This course is also offered every year at the NMCPHC conference. NECE is authorized to extend the expiration date by 12 months if operational commitments interfere with recertification efforts. If an individual's certification has expired, the member must repeat the entire Pesticide Applicator course. There are no exceptions since this training certification process must comply with strict federal EPA pesticide regulations. (3) Medical and supply department personnel are selectively encour aged to assist with the pest control program, under the supervision of a PMT, by attending a one -day Shipboard Pest Management Course (CANTRAC Course B -322-1075) offered by NEPMUs. 5. Habitability Inspections a. Responsibilities . The SMO or preventive medicine representative must conduct periodic sanitation inspections of berthing areas, heads, shower rooms, laundry, dry cleaning plants, confinement facilities (brig), gymnasiums, barbershops, and ship stores. The CO must be advised of conditions that are harmful to the health and morale of the crew. b. References . Shipboard habitability standards are prescribed in OPNAVINST 9640.1C. The Manual of Naval Preventive Medicine, Chapter 2 (NAVMED P -5010 -2) provides guidelines concerning sanitation of liv ing spaces and related facilities. c. Inspections (1) All berthing spaces and heads are required to be inspected for general sanitation and cleanliness on a quarterly basis. The inspection plan should focus on a randomly selected sample COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-14 of berthing c ompartments and heads by the medical department under the supervision of preventive medicine. (2) Barbershops, the ship's laundry and dry cleaning plant (if applicable), the ship's store, gymnasium, and the ship's brig are to be inspected on a quarterly basis. d. Medical Screening . All barbers and laundry workers must be medically screened and have current immunizations prior to commencing their duties. The supervisor of the laundry facility must maintain copies of the certifications and each barber must display their medical certificate at their workstation 6. Infectioius Medical Waste Management Program a. Applicability . Infectious medical waste requires special handling, sterilization, storage and disposal by medical department personnel. b. Responsibilities . The CO must ensure that no medical materials are disposed of in a manner that poses a risk or perception of a risk to public health and welfare or the marine environment. Disposal of medical materials must also comply with existing sta te and local regulations or Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA). c. References . OPNAV P -45-113-3-99 (Afloat Medical Waste Management Guide) supplements and implements the policies established for shipboard medical waste as either infectious or non -infect ious medical waste to be managed in accordance with chapter 22 of OPNAVINST 5090.1B (Navy Environmental and Natural Resources Program Manual) and BUMEDINST 6280.1C (Management of Regulated Medical Waste). d. State Medical Waste Requirements (1) In por t, potentially infectious medical waste from ships must be delivered to a designated Navy Branch Medical Clinic or turned over to an authorized PWC contractor. (2) Listing specific rules and regulations for every county, state and country where COMNAVAI RFOR maintains a homeport would be impractical due to the extent, complexity, and propensity to change of those requirements. Nevertheless, each CVN must ensure compliance with its respective municipalities' regulations regarding disposal of medical waste . Local guidance must be obtained from the supporting MTF, NEPMU or PWC Environmental staff. e. Foreign Countries . For foreign countries, the packaging, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of infectious waste must be consistent wi th standards to protect public health and the environment as prescribed by applicable SOFAs and international COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 17-15 agreements. If no SOFA or international agreement exists, infectious waste must be disposed of as specified by the cognizant fleet commander. f. Record Keeping . Tracking, storage and disposal of shipboard infectious medical waste will be recorded in the Shipboard Medical Waste Storage and Disposal Record. g. Program Oversight . Preventive medicine will evaluate overall compliance with the Medical Waste Program on a monthly basis. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 18-1 CHAPTER 18 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 18-1. General 1. Introduction a. Background . The safety and health of Navy personnel is an integral responsibility of the command and is achieved through the integration of safety and health into all aspects of naval operations. The NAVOSH program will be carried out through the chain of command, with assistance from safety and health personnel. Specific emphasis is required by supervisory personnel to ensure NAVOSH hazards are identified and corrected, and that personnel are aware of hazards associated with their work and the means to prevent accidents and illnesses. b. Purpose . The core of the NAVOSH program is t raining and the identification, risk assessment, mitigation, elimination and control of safety and health hazards. The occupational health element is primarily concerned with more insidious health effects, which are usually produced by long term (chronic) exposures to toxic chemicals and materials or harmful physical agents (e.g., noise, radiation, etc.) and the treatment of work -related injuries. The occupational health program element is divided into two major subspecialties - industrial hygiene and occupational medicine. Each of these subspecialties has, as one of its major functional components, a long -term surveillance program. (1) Industrial hygiene involves the surveillance of the work place and the anticipation, recognition, identification, eva luation, and control of any health hazards. (2) Occupational medicine focuses on the medical surveillance of personnel potentially exposed to the hazards identified during the industrial hygiene work place evaluation, and the diagnosis and treatment of occupational injuries and illnesses. c. Responsibility . The safety department is responsible for the overall NAVOSH program (COMNAVAIRFORINST 5100.3). All medical surveillance and examination requirements are the responsibility of the Medical Departmen t. 2. Command Occupational Health Inspections a. OPNAVINST 5100.19F requires that a baseline industrial hygiene survey be conducted for each ship. An update of the baseline survey is necessary when system, equipment, or load out changes significantly affect the onboard hazard and/or risk. This survey i s the essential risk management tool. As part of the operational risk management responsibilities, the CO is required to identify potential hazards, assess the risks presented by the hazards, and provide controls to prevent exposures to personnel. Deteri oration of existing controls, modifications, and additions to shipboard processes and equipment will occur over time. An update of the industrial COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 18-2 hygiene survey is required at least every two years to address all changes that may have occurred. A more li mited survey to address specific concerns is available at the discretion of the CO. Examples of changes that could significantly affect the on -board hazard and/or risk are as follows: (1) New or modified equipment or processes. (2) Introduction of new hazardous chemicals and/or harmful physical or biological agents. (3) Deterioration of existing controls (e.g., ventilation) which degrades over time. (4) Some of these changes would be the expected result of a shipyard availability period and COs may consider requesting industrial hygiene assistance from their supporting NEMPU following a major availability. b. The baseline and periodic industrial hygiene surveys will be conducted by the assistant safety/IHO assigned to the CVN. Th e CVN IHO may request assistance from their respective TYCOM force IHO, supporting regional IH plan or area NEPMU. c. The safety department must provide the medical department a copy of the baseline and periodic industrial hygiene survey, including speci fic medical surveillance requirements. The medical department will permanently maintain copies of all baseline and subsequent industrial hygiene surveys and perform occupational health exams to meet medical surveillance requirements. d. The medical depa rtment may request industrial hygiene to evaluate or re -evaluate any work procedures or processes suspected as occupational hazards based on health complaints, diagnosis, accident and injury reports, and/or non -battle injury data. 3. Workplace Monitorin g a. The IHO must conduct workplace monitoring as indicated by the baseline or periodic industrial hygiene survey. If the IHO is unable to accomplish the work place monitoring, their respective TYCOM force IHO will be notified and assistance will be arr anged. b. The medical department must be responsible for reviewing heat stress surveys from engineering and non -engineering spaces prior to submission to the CO/XO. 4. Medical Surveillance a. General COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 18-3 (1) The safety department has the primary responsibility to inform department heads of operations identified in the industrial hygiene survey, which may potentially expose personnel to health hazards. (2) Occupational medical surveillance examinations are designed to produce specific informatio n upon which decisions may be based regarding the adequacy of administrative, engineering and personal protective measures and controls used to prevent hazardous exposures, and to verify that personnel have not received dangerous exposures to chemical, phy sical, radiological or biological hazards. (3) The medical department will provide surveillance examinations as required by OPNAVINST 5100.19F for those work centers identified by the safety department as requiring medical surveillance. Medical departm ent will utilize the Medical Matrix Manual and PC Matrix program developed by the NMCPHC. This program produces standardized occupational health exam SF 600 overprints and is available at: http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/ oem/medical -matri x-11.pdf. (4) It is the responsibility of the individual's department to ensure the individual presents to the Medical Department for examinations. The safety and medical departments will coordinate and monitor compliance. b. Medical Surveillance Exa minations (1) The latest IH survey identifies departments and divisions that perform processes that present industrial health hazards. Thus, the individuals within these departments and division will be subject to various medical surveillance programs linked to their occupation. The Medical Department must coordinate with DIVOs to identify and maintain a current roster of individuals occupying those positions. The medical department is then responsible for entering these people into the appropriate me dical surveillance program and performing the appropriate occupational health medical examination(s). (2) The results of all occupational health medical surveillance examinations must be reviewed by an appropriately privileged medical provider to ensure that all aspects of the examination have been completed, and that appropriate actions have been initiated for all abnormal examination results. The medical department will track all occupational health medical examinations in TMIP. 18-2. Occupational H ealth Programs 1. Personnel Protective Equipment a. General . Operations for which respiratory protection or protective eyewear are required must be identified during the industrial hygiene survey. A listing of operations for which COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 18-4 respirators are req uired, and the types of respirators required for each must be provided to department heads and maintained by the safety department for TYCOM, INSURV review or other applicable inspection process. b. Respirator User Medical Screening (1) Individuals re quired to use respirators must be identified in the industrial hygiene survey. The individual's department is responsible for the presentation of the individual for medical examination. The safety department serves as the respirator program manager (RPM) and will be responsible for the program's management. (2) Personnel who are required to use respirators that are certified by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) must be schedul ed for a medical evaluation to screen for the presence of limiting conditions. (3) The medical privileged provider's evaluation of suitability of the individual examinee for respirator use must be based on knowledge of the workplace and tasks and results of the medical evaluation. The medical provider must classify the examinee in a category and report those findings to the responsible DIVO on the medical clearance request found in OPNAVINST 5100.19F with a copy to the RPM. c. Sight Conservation Program (1) The safety department, as part of the industrial hygiene survey, must provide a list of all eye hazardous areas and processes to the responsible department. All personnel, prior to the onset of exposure to eye -hazardous processes or operat ions or those exposed as a result of an emergency, must be referred for a sight screening examination. It is the responsibility of the individual's department to identify individuals at risk and send those individuals to the medical department. The safet y department will oversee the Sight Conservation Program. (2) The medical department must validate the prescription and facilitate procurement of required prescription safety glasses. (3) Issue and maintenance of sight protective equipment must be in accordance with OPNAVINST 5100.19F. 2. Hearing Conservation Program a. General . The definitive source documents for hearing conservation are DODINST 6055.12, OPNAVINST 5102.1D, and OPNAVINST 5100.19F. They provide guidance for the establishment and implementation of an occupational noise control and hearing conservation COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 18-5 program elements. The goal is to prevent occupational hearing loss and assure auditory fitness for duty of all navy personnel. b. Audiometry . Personnel exposed to potentially hazardous noise must receive periodic hearing testing to assess the effectiveness of noise reduction measures and personal protective equipment.

(e) The medical/dental records will be reviewed using the Provider Record Review Forms contained in appendix X. These forms are intended for review of privileged providers. In addition to the form for general outpat ient records, specialized forms are provided for CPs, PTs, and CRNAs. (f) Due to the nature of their specialties, the PT and CP records will benefit from specialty peer review when the ship is in homeport, peer review from other CVN medical department' s PTs or CPs should be utilized, when available. If no other CVN is available, arrangements should be made to have peer review at the local MTF. When the ship is at sea or deployed, the SMO will conduct these reviews. The PT's records must be reviewed u sing the PT record review form and the CP's records must be reviewed using the CP record review form contained in appendix X. (g) CRNAs will benefit from specialty peer review when the ship is in homeport, peer review from other CVN medical department's CRNA should be utilized, when available. Then, if no other CVN is available, arrangements should be made to have peer review at the local MTF. When the ship is at sea or deployed, the SMO will conduct these reviews. Records to be reviewed must include outpatient procedures using procedural sedation and operative procedures COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B 19-6 performed in the operating room. The CRNAs records must be reviewed using the CRNA record review form contained in appendix X. 6. Patient Safety Reporting Procedures . Patient safet y reports (PSR), constitute process improvement documents and are protected from disclosure under 10 U.S.C. 1102. PSRs capture information on events that negatively impact clinical care. They allow the medical department staff to identify trends, which m ay then lead to action to reduce those events. As such, their intent is to identify the cause for the process variance and provide recommendations for remedial action and must not be used for disciplinary action. CVNs will utilize the DoD web -based Joint Patient Safety Reporting (JPSR) System for patient safety reporting. If the system is unavailable (e.g. required maintenance, unit lack of connectivity), personnel will use the offline reporting form, then, transcribe the information into the electronic system as soon as possible. Offline forms must be properly labeled and safeguarded. a. The QAC will serve as the PSM for the CVN. b. Patient safety reportable events are unexpected events (i.e. death, medication error, needlestick injury, loss of powe r, repair or supply problems, etc.) that diminish the department's ability to maintain routine clinical operations. It is important that anyone can submit a PSR. Upon notification of the event, the PSM will ensure that a PSR is generated that outline the details of the incident to include: date, time, location, patient diagnosis, provider and a description of relevant circumstances surrounding the incident. The PSM will review the initial comments related to the incident. c. Upon completion of the revie w by the PSM, the report will be forwarded to the QAPA who will comment on the variance and assign a category to the incident. d. Upon completion of review by the PSM and QAPA, the report will be forwarded to the SMO for review, comment and recommendatio ns. e. The QA committee will discuss the case and formulate recommended actions to be taken. All remedial actions will be included in the report. f. Once this process has been completed, TYCOM PSM will review and close out the report. The number of the PSR for the calendar year will be included in the PSR section of the monthly QA committee meeting minutes and forwarded to the TYCOM. For incidents resulting in serious untoward effects (i.e. death, disability, ICU admission, etc.) notify the respe ctive force surgeon immediately. g. Once received by the TYCOM all reports submitted for the month will be reviewed during MEC meetings.

FORCE SURGEON By direction COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B H-1 APPENDIX H MEDICAL EVACUATION PROTOCOL AND CHECKLIST SOP : Ref: (a) COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B (b) COMNAVAIRFORINST 4630.12A (c) AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 41 -307 (d) Fleet OPORD Annex Q Encl: (1) Flight Surgeon's Aeromedical Patient Evaluation (2) Sample MEDEVAC Message (3) MEDEVAC Evacuation Checklist (4) MEDEVAC Equipment and Supply Checklist (5) MEDEVAC via COD 1. Purpose . To establish administrative protocol for conducting MEDEVACS while underway. 2. Discussion . The decision to MEDEVAC a patient rests with the command, customarily based on the recommendation of the Senior Medical Officer (SMO). It is essential to communicate with every key person when initiating administrative procedures once the decision is made to MEDEVAC. It is also essential to carefully plan and prepare for adequate supplies, equipment, paperwork and liaison with the receiving facility to ensure smooth patient movement from Medical Department to aircraft to higher echelon of care. Any pa tient transported off the ship while the ship is not tied to a pier will be considered a MEDEVAC and must be accounted for as a form of regulated patient movement. While there are instances when a patient is sent ashore for tests or consults only with the expectation that they will return to the ship for follow on care they should be treated as a MEDEVAC for accountability purposes. For these cases the applicable portions of this chapter should be followed, i.e. patients sent for studies or consults need n ot necessarily be given TAD orders for 30 days, have any medical attendants nor require any equipment. These types of patients were previously considered passengers transported via lifts of opportunity without an accounting within the medical system for th eir movement. Even though these patients are ambulatory and are being seen for outpatient procedures, studies or consults they still need to be regulated by medical personnel via a MEDEVAC message and should have follow up reporting as required by higher a uthority. Under no circumstances should a special flight or transport be arranged solely for these consultative MEDEVACS. 3. Classification . MEDEVACS are prioritized based on patient acuity into the following categories: a. Urgent - Requires MEDEVAC within hours. Flight ops may need to be interrupted to expedite the MEDEVAC. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B H-2 b. Priority - Requires MEDEVAC in the next 24 hours. c. Routine - MEDEVAC in the next three days. d. Space Available/Consultation - Routine movement of a patient for the pu rpose of obtaining additional clinical studies or consultation not available on the ship but that is of low enough priority to be able to wait for the next lift of opportunity. These patients are outpatients expected to return to the ship following their c onsultation/study and must be regulated as patient movement but do not require en route medical care. From a flight manifest perspective these patients will be viewed as a passenger but will be accounted for in medical as a regulated patient movement with an appropriate MEDEVAC message sent for accounting purposes. 4. Procedures a. Outbound: (1) Contact the nearest Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or Civilian Emergency Room for an accepting physician. If unable to reach by phone, e -mail the Operational Forces Medical Liaison (formerly known as Fleet Medical Liaison) of the respective MTF with the patient's name, rate, DOD ID, command, diagnosis, and the estimated time of arriva l. Note: In areas where ISOS is operational, (e.g., Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, etc.) contact ISOS directly. (2) Contact the patient's command, DIVO and/or LCPO, to inform them of the member being MEDEVAC'd, and obtain from them any personal items the patient may need prior to transport. (3) Contact the Air Transfer Office (ATO), to manifest the patient and any medical attendant(s) on the flight. If a medical attendant is necessary, contact the Duty Flight Surgeon to ready him/herself for the impendi ng MEDEVAC. He/she must assemble the personal flight gear and brief the patient on in -flight procedures. Note: Only flight certified personnel must accompany patients on MEDEVACS unless the patient acuity warrants additional attendants (i.e. nurse, co rpsman). (4) In the event of an emergency situation, notify the Air Operations Officer or Primary Flight Control, to schedule a MEDEVAC flight whether by Helo or COD. (5) If the patient is non -ambulatory, notify the following: (a) Flight Deck C ontrol Officer (Handler) - to clear an area on the flight deck for transporting the patient to the aircraft. COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B H-3 (b) Ordnance Handling Officer (OHO) - to coordinate the use of the upper stage weapons elevator (Engineering Department for stores elevator). (c) Security -to secure a route (notify 30 minutes prior to transfer). (d) Flight Deck BDS -to alert flight deck corpsmen to anticipated time of MEDEVAC departure. (ensure flight deck corpsmen are standing by and ready to provide transport assistance from the arriving elevator to the aircraft). (6) If time permits, complete all necessary paperwork, (enclosures (1) and (2)) for the patient and medical attendant so it ca n accompany both to their ultimate destination. Fully funded TAD orders will be provided for the patient and attendant to cover travel and per diem for a period of 30 days. Under the remarks section, indicate \"SNM needs definitive medical care\". Note: Do not hold up the MEDEVAC in an emergency. Documents can be mailed at a later time. (7) Before leaving Main Medical, make sure the patient has his/her military identification card, clothing to cover the time period of the patient's temporary detach ment, verification of Individual Force Protection Brief (in Fifth Fleet AOR), funded orders, personal effects, consults/medical record, and a small amount of cash and/or credit card for incidental expenses. (8) If the patient and attendant have a passpo rt, ensure they accompany the patient/attendant, to and from the ship, in cases of travel that may involve foreign countries. If the patient or attendants do not have passports, inform appropriate fleet liaison so they may initiate State Department contac ts as needed. (9) Track the patient's movement/treatment through the MEDEVAC system via message traffic and/or e -mail, requesting frequent updates from the receiving MTF. This information must be included on the Morning Report. Enclosure (2) is a samp le MEDEVAC message sent immediately after the patient leaves the ship. Check your local Fleet OPORD on specific guidance for drafting this message. (10) Utilize enclosures (3) and (4) as guidelines while executing a MEDEVAC.

[ ] COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B U-1 APPENDIX U POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PROTOCOL 1. Algorithm. Review and follow steps (a) through (f). a. Immediate Exposure Site Action. Flush/clean the blood borne pathogen contact area using soap and water (for wounds or skin sites), water (for the nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or skin), or water and saline (for the eyes) for at least FIVE minutes. b. Known Source HIV Testing. Determine, if possible, if the known source is HIV positive or negative to guide the post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) init iation decision. The HIV testing method must produce rapid results yet not delay PEP initiation if warranted; the Ora -Quick Rapid HIV Test (with test stand and positive/negative controls) is cu11\u00b7ently the fleet selected method . Units without testing cap ability will medevac the exposed individual to a site with testing capability. If the source patient is unknown, immediately obtain expert consultation (refer to section 1d below) to determine the optimal course of action. (1) Known Source is HIV Negat ive. HIV PEP is not recommended. However, if acute seroconverting illness or the conversion window period is suspected, prescribe a HIV PEP regimen containing 3 (or more) antiretroviral medications (refer to section 4c below for regimens) AND immediately obtain exper t consultation (refer to section 4d below) to determine the optimal course of action. The exposed patient must begin the PEP regimen as soon as possible (within hours) after exposure and continue the regimen for 4 weeks. (2) Known Source i s HIV Positive. Prescribe a HIV PEP regimen containing 3 (or more) antiretroviral medications (refer to section 4c below for regimens). The exposed patient must begin the PEP regimen as soon as possible (within hours) after exposure and continue the regim en for 4 weeks. Obtain expert consultation (refer to section 1d below). c. HIV PEP Medication Regimens (1) Preferred combination. raltegravir (Isentress) 400mg disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) 1 tablet by mouth once daily. These medications are currently included on authorized medical allowance lists. (2) Alterative combination. dolutegravir (Tivicay) 50mg 1 tablet 300mg disopr oxil fumarate (Truvada) 1 tablet by mouth once daily. (3) If the exposed individual delays exposure reporting more than 72 hours, is pregnant, has serious co -morbid disease (including chronic HBV, chronic kidney injury with eGFR less COMNAVAIRFORINST 6000.1B U-2 than 60, and drug i nteractions), and/or has known toxicity to PEP medications, immediately obtain expert consultation (refer to section 1d below) to dete1mine the optimal course of action. d. Numbered Fleet Surgeon and Expert Consultations (1) Communicate the event utilizing the respective OPORD Annex Q including contacting the appropriate numbered fleet surgeon if HIV PEP is indicated due to the medical evacuation requirement. (2) Obtain expert Infectious Disease consultation if HIV PEP is indicated, HIV PEP indication is uncertain, or confounding variables exist. Recommended contacts are: (a) Navy Blood borne Infection Management Center (NBIMC) Infectious Disease Specialist at (301) 295 -5246 (Monday through Friday 0800 -1600 ET only). (b) Walter Reed Natio nal Military Medical Center Infectious Disease Specialist at Pager (866) 296 -4913 PIN# 250 -0329 (available 24/7). e. Medical Evacuation for Follow Up. If HIV PEP is prescribed, initiate urgent medical evacuation of the exposed individual to a DoD shore M TF for time sensitive evaluation, counseling, and additional testing. Specialty care should begin within 72 hours of source exposure whenever possible. Provide patient with adequate medication for a minimum of 5 days of travel. Plan for long term follow up including testing and drug toxicity monitoring. f. Patient Safety/Risk Management Report. Initiate a report and route it to the respective TYCOM Force Surgeon to review processes, which may require support to prevent additional exposures.
