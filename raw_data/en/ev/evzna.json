We identied 14 condence measures applicable to childhood vaccination in general, all published between 2010 and 2019. The measures examined 1-5 constructs and included a mean of 12 items. Validation studies commonly examined factor structure, internal consistency reliability, and criterion-related validity. Fewer studies examined convergent and discriminant validity, test-retest reliability, or used cognitive interviewing. Most measures were developed and validated only in high-income countries. These ndings highlight the need for a childhood vaccine condence measure validated for use in diverse global contexts.

Current Opinion in Immunology 2021, 71:34-45 This review comes from a themed issue on Vaccines Edited by Charles S Wiysonge and Sara Cooper https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2021.04.002 0952-7915/ \u00e3 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.The need to assess and track the drivers of vaccination For countries to receive the full benet of immunization, maintaining high vaccination coverage is vital [1]. Many factors affect childhood vaccination including policies, systems, health services, access, and social and political influences. Parents' condence in vaccines and vaccina- tion is one determinant of vaccination, contributing in- part to both persistently low population coverage and sudden declines [2-5]. Negative vaccine attitudes and beliefs are also associated with delayed and missed child- hood vaccination [6,7]. Some vaccine preventable diseases have surged in geo- graphically concentrated areas [8/C15/C15]. As a result, several countries recently lost their measles elimination status. Many children missed vaccination during the Covid-19 pandemic [9,10], and now questions exist around how to achieve high uptake of Covid-19 vaccines. The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) outlined goals for the 'decade of vaccines' (2011-2020), emphasizing the need for all countries to develop comprehensive national vac- cine condence management strategies, encompassing regular assessment of local hesitancy, trust building, and emergency response planning [11]. The Immuniza- tion Agenda 2030 then expanded upon these objectives [12]. Characterizing the multiple reasons for low vaccination can enable direct comparisons among different factors, and help guide the development, implementation, and monitoring of interventions to improve vaccination. An important part of this work is vaccine condence moni- toring, which should build on standardized and validated measures. Here we use the term 'condence' broadly to encompass a range of factors relevant to vaccine acceptance. The World Health Organization (WHO) and global part- ners are developing tools for the assessment of the range of factors that influence children's vaccination across diverse global contexts in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. The tools are a quantitative $Given his role as Guest Editor, Charles S Wiysonge had no involvement in the peer-review of this article and has no access to information regarding its peer-review.

The aim is to support vaccine programme managers, implementation partners and fun- ders to systematically assess the drivers of routine immu- nization uptake among parents and caregivers (hereafter caregivers) of children under ve years of age and to provide consistent and comparable data over time [13/C15/C15]. To develop these tools, WHO established the 'Measuring Behavioural and Social Drivers of Vaccination' (BeSD) working group, which includes partners from the Vacci- nation Demand Hub; UNICEF; Gavi, The Vaccine Alli- ance; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We report here on the rst stage of the BeSD work informing the development of the Childhood Immuniza- tion Survey. The aim is to measure caregivers' experi- ences and perspectives that affect vaccine uptake, of which one is condence. We report on the ndings of a critical literature review aimed at identifying a compre- hensive set of key measures of vaccine condence. Spe- cically, we 1) identied available measures of vaccine condence; 2) described and compared the development methods, scope, replication, and psychometric validity of these measures; and 3) identied gaps in the available measures to be addressed by the Childhood Immuniza- tion Survey. A critical review provides an opportunity to assess the available evidence and a starting point for the conceptual development of a novel tool [14]. We carried out the search in April 2019, before a BeSD working group meeting to agree on overall constructs. We searched PubMed using terms related to vaccination (vaccine, immunization, immunisation), condence (attitude, belief, condence, trust) and measurement (psychometric testing, measure, scale, validation) for articles in English published in the peer-reviewed literature with no date restriction. Experts from the working group and author team supplemented the search with further relevant condence measures. Citations and reference lists of the included articles were then searched to locate addi- tional measures and relevant validation studies. Inclusion criteria for articles were general measures of condence in childhood vaccination and related concepts. Articles were excluded if they pertained only to a specic vaccine or if they only measured vaccine knowledge. The evidence synthesis process focused on identifying (1) the publica- tion year and country in which measure development took place, (2) the method used to develop a measure, (3) the main underlying constructs in the measures, (4) the questions and response options used to measure these constructs, and (5) the psychometric methods used to examine the validity and reliability of measures.Available measures of vaccine condence We identied 14 published measures of caregivers' con- dence in childhood vaccination, all published between 2010 and early 2019 (Table 1). The measures were all developed in high-income countries, except the Care- giver Vaccination Attitudes Scale, which was developed in Ghana, a middle-income country (Table 1). For half of the measures (n = 7), the developers explicitly reported the use of theoretical or conceptual frameworks that informed the development of their tools. The methods used to create or select items were reported for 11 of the 14 measures. Developers of all 11 of these measures reviewed the literature for items used in previ- ous surveys. Most also used at least one other method to rene or conrm items, including expert consultation (n = 5), conducting cognitive interviews (n = 3), evaluating qualitative themes from interviews or focus groups (n = 3), and pilot testing items (n = 7). Measures were relatively short, with a mean of 12 items (range = 4-39) (Table 1). Four measures had long and short forms. Short forms of measures included a maximum of 10 items. The survey items and associated constructs appear in Table S1. Measures included one to ve constructs each. The most common constructs were beliefs in the benets or importance of vaccination; trust in vaccines, healthcare providers, the scheduling of vaccines, and trust in the legitimacy of authorities to require vaccination; vaccina- tion harms; and perceived risks of infectious disease. The measures typically assessed each construct using one or two items. Developers of the measures used conceptually overlap- ping terms such as attitudes, beliefs, condence, hesi- tancy, and acceptance in ways that were often inconsis- tent and unclear [15]. For example, three measures included 'behaviour', 'behavioural intention' or 'past behaviour' as attitudinal constructs assessed with items such as 'have you ever delayed having your child get a shot for reasons other than illness or allergy?'. However, what people think (e.g. attitudes) and what they do (behaviour) are conceptually distinct, representing cause and effect. Clear conceptualization is critical to achieve meaningful measures. The BeSD working group adapted and proposed denitions of key terms, as shown in Table 2. The psychometric properties, including reliability and validity, of the 14 measures, were examined in 29 studies conducted in the United States (n = 15), Europe (n = 6), Canada (n = 3), China (n = 1), Malaysia (n = 1), Guatemala (n = 1), Ghana (n = 1), or across multiple countries (n = 1) (Table 3, Table S2). The majority of validation studies focused on the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vac- cines (PACV) measure (n = 10). The other 13 measures had few validation studies, with a mean of 1.4 studies perMeasures of childhood vaccine confidence Shapiro et al. 35 www.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Immunology 2021, 71:34-4536 VaccinesTable 1 Measures of childhood vaccination confidence identified through literature review, developed from 2010-2019 Name of measure Authors Year published (# of citations)Country Development method as described by the authors Conceptual basisConstructs included in the nal measure, as named by the authorsNumber of items The Immunisation Beliefs andIntentionsMeasure (IBIM)[30] a Tickner et al. 2010 (34) England Theory of PlannedBehaviour1.

The studies most often examined internal con- sistency (n = 13), criterion-related validity (i.e. correlation with vaccination intentions or behavior, n = 12), and factor structure (n = 11). Fewer studies examined convergent and discriminant validity (n = 7), used cognitive inter- viewing to conrm the meaning that participants ascribe to survey items matches that intended by the researchers (n = 3), and assessed test-retest reliability (n = 3). Notably, psychometric validation may be especially informative when adapting measures to other languages or for new populations [16,17]. For example, after adapting the PACV for adolescent vaccination, Roberts et al. found it was not associated with adolescent vaccination [18], though it had been associated with vaccination of young children [19,20]. Shortcomings of reviewed measures Existing condence measures have important shortcom- ings. These measures were developed within and for specic geographic populations with none developed in a low-income country and only one developed in a mid- dle-income country. Psychometric validation and replica- tion were also limited for most measures and largely conducted in high-income settings. The BeSD Working Group will develop and psychometrically validate the Childhood Immunization Survey to be useful in different cultures and languages in low-income, middle-income, and high-income country settings. Ongoing review of emerging evidence and evaluation of tool implementa- tion will be needed to ensure the tools continue to improve. Measures of vaccine condence examine what people think and feel, but this is only one aspect of a holisticapproach to understand the causes of coverage gaps. Studies focusing on other factors such as practical issues have found coverage is affected by available vaccine supply, cost of vaccination, and time to access services [21]. To address some of these shortcomings, the BeSD working group developed a comprehensive framework of vaccine uptake that includes what people think and feel, social processes, motivation, and practical issues (Fig- ure 1). In this framework we present beliefs and behav- iour as distinct and separable constructs, with condence belonging to the 'thinking and feeling' domain [13/C15/C15]. Social processes illuminate the gender barriers to vacci- nation such as travel and decision autonomy as well as the role of healthcare provider recommendation. Social pro- cesses also include family and community norms. Moti- vation refers to the intention or hesitancy to receive recommended vaccines. Practical factors include aware- ness of when and where to get a vaccine and the number of vaccinations children should receive, ease of access to a clinic, opportunity costs, and clinic experiences such as waiting time and quality of service, as well as respect from health workers towards caregivers. The caregiver jour- neys model which charts the process before, during, and after an immunization encounter assisted the develop- ment of these practical factors [13/C15/C15]. This review highlighted that not all potentially relevant condence constructs have been identied and included in previous measures of vaccine condence or compre- hensively investigated in large, representative, popula- tion-based studies. Many existing measures were devel- oped by scanning items used in previous published surveys. Items and constructs measured in earlier tools may have held greater input in the development of later40 Vaccines Table 2 Definitions of key terms used in vaccine confidence measures Term Denition Thinking and feeling Disease risk appraisalThoughts and feelings about potential health problems caused by infectious agents. Includes perceived risk, worry, fear, and anticipated regret. Condence Attitudes and beliefs that vaccines work, are safe, and are part of a trustworthy medical system. Includes perceived importance and effectiveness of vaccines and concerns about vaccines being unsafe. Motivation Hesitancy Motivational state of being conflicted about, or opposed to, getting vaccinated; includes intentions and willingness. Intention Aim or plan to get vaccinated. Behaviour Acceptance Willing receipt of vaccination. Coverage Estimated percentage of individuals who received specic vaccines. Low coverage reflects both individuals who will never be vaccinated and those for whom vaccination is delayed but eventually occurs. Delay Receiving a vaccination after the recommended age. Delay can be the result of a deliberate choice, passive inaction, or forces external to the individual, such as a vaccine shortage. Refusal Declining to receive a vaccine when offered. Un-vaccinated Has not received any of the recommended vaccines for their age. Under-vaccinated Has received some, but not all, of the recommended vaccines for their age. Uptake Receipt of a vaccine.

The prominence of these constructsmay also be due to their emphasis in well-regarded health psychology theoretical models (i.e. the Health Belief Model).

Based on the Increasing Vaccination Model [1]. www.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Immunology 2021, 71:34-45additional constructs relevant to vaccine condence, such as prot (i.e. whether vaccination is motivated by nancial gain of pharmaceutical companies or other entities), compatibility of vaccination with religious beliefs and cultural practices, moral intuitions of purity (i.e. disgust in vaccination) and liberty, self-efcacy (i.e. belief in one's capability to receive a vaccine) as well as descriptive and subjective social norms. These addi- tional constructs were included in the initial develop- ment of the BeSD tools to establish their relevance and whether they are distinct constructs of vaccine con- dence [13/C15/C15]. Surveys can quantify the relevant factors but cannot provide an in-depth and contextualised understanding of how people perceive and experience vaccination for their children. Therefore, qualitative methods are needed to provide a complementary understanding of how people experience vaccination and their reasons for under-vacci- nation [24]. The BeSD tools will also include qualitative childhood immunization in-depth interview guides. Accumulation of emerging qualitative evidence assessed over time with similar methods will also help to rene future versions of the Childhood Immunization Survey with new or modied constructs of relevance that may have been missed or not fully captured. Other aspects that are important to evaluate in the future development and piloting of quantitative measures, that were not consistently reported upon in available con- dence measures, include the average length of time to complete the measure, readability (reading level), central tendencies and distribution of the measure in the popu- lation (with particular attention to ceiling or floor effects), non-systematic presentation of items, and counterbalan- cing endpoints to reduce response bias. Furthermore, response options used by many of the condence mea- sures (i.e. response scales with multiple options) may not be appropriate for use in some low-income settings for sociocultural and linguistic reasons, among other consid- erations [25]. Review strengths and limitations Our critical review identied measures of vaccine con- dence, related constructs, and items from the recent literature. The review has informed the adaptation of the BeSD Framework from the Increasing Vaccination Model by Brewer et al. [1] to include the main factors informing uptake of childhood vaccines (Figure 1). Our review is only one aspect of developing the BeSD tools [13/C15/C15]. We conducted needs assessment interviews with regional and in-country stakeholders, reviewed the grey literature and qualitative measures of under-vaccina- tion, and enlisted expert feedback in the development and reduction of items. In addition, we completed cognitive interviews in the United States, Australia, and Sierra Leone, and elicited feedback on thetranslatability of items from WHO and UNICEF regional and country ofces [13/C15/C15]. Additional efforts are planned to test these tools in diverse countries\u2014in Pakistan, India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014to assess the psycho- metric properties of the Childhood Immunization Sur- vey, and ascertain global feasibility, suitability, and comparability. Our review identied measures of childhood vaccine condence but was not a systematic review. The review also excluded condence measures for specic vaccines. While such measures can predict vaccine intentions and coverage beyond general vaccine condence [1], we aimed for the Childhood Immunization Survey to be usable in many contexts and for many vaccines. In addi- tion, the search date excluded more recently developed measures such as the Vaccine Attitudes Scale, which was developed in Pakistan [26/C15]. Two scoping review proto- cols in the past two years have identied the need to synthesize measures of what the authors describe as vaccine hesitancy [27] and vaccination-related psychoso- cial factors [28], though neither have published their ndings to-date. Lastly, we noted the presence or absence of psychometric data for the measures but did not evalu- ate these ndings. Conclusions Vaccination is a pivotal health intervention in preventing disease, morbidity, and mortality [29]. Global demand is strong for a standardized, high-quality measure to under- stand the social and behavioral drivers of vaccination, including vaccine condence. Our review of vaccine condence measures and their psychometric validation can support the advancement of vaccination research and interventions to increase childhood vaccination. Our review has guided the development and validation approach of the BeSD tools which include what people think and feel (including condence and other constructs) as well as social processes, motivation, and practical issues (Figure 1). Development of the BeSD Childhood Immu- nization Survey will consider additional potentially rele- vant condence constructs not commonly included in previous measures of vaccine condence. Lastly, the eld needs measures validated for use in multinational, mul- tiregional, and multicultural contexts for inclusive and equitable approach to measurement. BeSD tools will be designed for global usability. Funding This work was supported by Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.
