Here are 5 natural remedies for your dog!", "sitename": "centralpetaz.com", "date": "2023-07-28", "cleaned_text": "Pet parents are notoriously dedicated to their four-legged pals. Whether you have a small yet spirited pooch or a gentle giant, you are likely willing to do whatever it takes to make sure they are happy and healthy at all times. While sometimes that requires a trip to the vet and a prescription to treat a condition, you also may be interested in natural remedies that promote overall wellness. More and more vets are discovering that natural, holistic, and alternative remedies can have a significant impact on your dog's life. These are 5 natural, vet-approved remedies for dogs that you may not know about: 1. Lavender Aromatherapy to Treat Shyness and Anxiety in Dogs You may have a favorite essential oil that you diffuse in your home, but did you know that you can use aromatherapy to help your pet as well? One of the most popular essential oils to diffuse for dogs is lavender. Lavender is a commonly used essential oil, for both humans and dogs. If you diffuse lavender in your home, you may find that your pet's anxiety, stress and even shyness dwindles over time. Before you start diffusing lavender, check with your vet to make sure it's diluted enough. Essential oils are highly concentrated, and it's important to dilute the oils before using them as a natural remedy. 2. CBD for Dogs with Chronic Pain or Seizures The idea of using CBD for dogs has recently become popular, particularly as more people find that there are many benefits to using CBD oil for themselves. According to the [American Kennel Club](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/cbd-oil-dogs/), CBD is a natural compound that is found in hemp, and in most cases, it does not contain THC. While scientists and animal researchers are still studying the efficacy of CBD for dogs, there is significant evidence to suggest that it can minimize chronic pain and reduce the risk of seizures in dogs. CBD oil may also reduce inflammation, decrease anxiety and reduce nausea in your pet. 3. Turmeric for Joint Health and Immune Support You probably have a jar of turmeric sitting in your pantry that you used for your last curry concoction. But did you realize that you can use this spice to reduce inflammation in your pet and even treat its arthritis? Turmeric is a powerful spice that has anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant, antiviral and antibacterial properties. If your pet has arthritis, then you may be able to make a [turmeric paste](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/turmeric-dogs/) or add turmeric to their pet food to help minimize your dog's joint pain. In addition, this spice will offer your pet some much-needed immune support. 4. Pumpkin for Digestive Health For a pup with an upset tummy, sometimes the best solution is a can of pumpkin. Pumpkin is a fruit that is packed full of fiber, which is very beneficial for digestive health. Your dog may benefit from fresh pumpkin if it is suffering from constipation, or if it is dealing with a bout of diarrhea. Most pet parents find that a can of pumpkin from the grocery store is the perfect complement to their pet's dinner. Be sure to buy canned pumpkin though and NOT canned pumpkin pie mix. The pumpkin pie mix will have additional ingredients, including spices and sugar, that will cause further digestive problems. 5. Nutritional Therapy for Weight Loss When your dog has packed on a few too many pounds, it may be at risk for further health complications. An overweight dog may have heart issues or joint issues. If you want to help your dog lose some weight, nutritional therapy may be a good option. You may be able to purchase a new type of dog food that can help your pet on its weight loss journey. Some experts say that you should pick a dog food that has extra protein but less fat. You also will want to pay attention to the calories in the pet food and the serving size that you offer your pet. Make sure you check with your veterinarian before you switch your pet's food, as there may be other factors you need to consider before you change up their daily dinner. Perhaps your pet has seemed more nervous than normal lately. Or maybe you have started to notice that your dog is walking gingerly around the house. While a trip to the vet is never a bad idea, you may find that a natural remedy such as CBD for dogs or aromatherapy may be the answer. Of course, if you do decide to start a natural treatment for your pet, be sure to check in with your vet first. It's always a good idea to consult with the doctor who knows your pet best before you try something new. "}
