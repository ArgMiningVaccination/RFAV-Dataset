In the field of neuroscience, with many tough-to-treat disorders and high unmet need, our scientists are relentless in their pursuit of raising the standards of care. But the brain is complex, and new challenges require new ways of thinking across all stages of drug discovery and development. That's why we are continuously exploring innovative, disease-modifying approaches to address some of the most prevalent and serious disorders, from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's to migraine, schizophrenia and stroke. We work across all stages of development in search of novel therapeutics and drug-device combinations that have the potential to treat chronic disabling neurological and psychiatric conditions. Our research interests include: New disease modification approaches Investigating mechanisms supported by genetic, molecular and physiological discoveries, with an emphasis on pathological proteins, mitochondrial/lysosomal function, proteostasis, neuroinflammation, neuroprotection, and neurorehabilitation, with an emphasis on preventing the spread and mediating the clearance of toxic intracellular protein aggregates. Managing disease symptoms Advancing approaches that ameliorate the cognitive and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease and neuropsychiatric conditions. Genetic, molecular and physiological insights Investigating mechanisms supported by genetic, molecular and physiological discoveries, with an emphasis on pathological proteins, mitochondrial/lysosomal function, proteostasis, neuroinflammation, neuroprotection, and neurorehabilitation. The burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders can feel insurmountable. But that feeling drives us to take on some of the biggest challenges and unearth potential solutions that consider the whole patient.
