The question about a possible link between MMR vaccine and autism has been extensively reviewed by independent groups of experts in the United States, including the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (now renamed the National Academy of Medicine). These reviews have concluded that the available epide - miologic evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism. The suggestion that MMR vaccine might lead to autism had its origins in gastroenterology research by Andrew Wakefield in the United Kingdom. In 1998, Wakefield and colleagues published an article in The Lancet claiming that the measles vaccine virus in MMR caused inflammatory bowel disease, allowing harmful pro-teins to enter the bloodstream and damage the brain. The validity of this finding was later called into question when it could not be reproduced by other researchers. In addition, the findings were further discredited when an investigation found that Wakefield did not disclose he was being funded for his research by lawyers seeking evidence to use against vaccine manufacturers. As a result, Wakefield was permanently barred from practicing medicine in the United Kingdom and The Lancet retracted the original article in 2010. The following list of articles published in peer-reviewed journals is provided so that parents and practitioners can themselves com - pare the balance of evidence about MMR vaccine and autism.MMR Vaccine Does Not Cause Autism Examine the evidence! More than 25 articles refute a connection between MMR vaccine and the development of autism 1. Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism - A Nationwide Cohort Study. Hviid A et al. Ann Intern Med 2019; 170(8):513-520. This nationwide cohort study included all 657,461 children born 1/1999-12/2010 in Denmark. With this many study participants, the researchers were able to look at vaccinated vs not vaccinated children, including 6,517 children with a diagnosis of autism. conclusion: The findings strongly support that MMR vaccina-tion does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30831578 2. Early Exposure to the Combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine and Thimerosal-containing Vaccines and Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Uno Y et al. Vaccine 2015;33(21):2511-6. This case-control study investigated the relationship between the risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) onset, and early exposure to MMR vac- cine and thimerosal measured from vaccinations in the highly genetically homogenous Japanese population. conclusion: No convincing evidence was found in this study that MMR vaccination and increasing thimerosal dose were asso-ciated with an increased risk of ASD onset. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562790 3. Autism Occurrence by MMR Vaccine Status among US Children with Older Siblings with and without Autism. Jain A et al. JAMA 2015;313(15):1534-40. The objective of this study was to investigate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) occurrence by MMR vaccine status in a large sample of US children who have older siblings with and without ASD. conclusion: In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25898051 4. Vaccines Are Not Associated with Autism: An Evidence-based Meta-analysis of Case-control and Cohort Studies. Taylor LE et al. Vaccine 2014;32(29):3623-9. A meta-analysis to summarize avail-able evidence from five cohort studies involving 1,256,407 children and five case-control studies involving 9,920 children. conclusion: Vaccination is not associated with the develop ment of autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Furthermore, the components of the vaccines (thimerosal or mercury) or multiple vaccines (MMR) are not associated with the development of autism or ASD. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814559 continued on the next page Immuniza tion Action Coal ition Saint Paul, Minnesota 651-647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.orgTechnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Prevention www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf Item #P4 026 (5/19)retracted: Ileal-Lymphoid-Nodular Hyperplasia, Non- Specific Colitis, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children.

MMR-Vaccine and Regression in Autism Spectrum Disorders: Negative Results Presented from Japan. Uchiyama T et al. J Autism Dev Disord 2007; 37(2):210-7. Subjects: 904 children with autism spectrum disorder. (Note: MMR was used in Japan only between 1989 and 1993.) conclusions: During the period of MMR usage no significant difference was found in the incidence of regression between MMR-vaccinated children and non-vaccinated children. Among the proportion and incidence of regression across the three MMR-program-related periods (before, during and after MMR usage), no significant difference was found between those who had received MMR and those who had not. Moreover, the incidence of regression did not change significantly across the three periods. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16865547 13. Pervasive Developmental Disorders in Montreal, Quebec, Canada: Prevalence and Links with Immunizations. Fombonne E et al. Pediatrics. 2006;118(1):e139-50.

Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination and Bowel Problems or Developmental Regression in Children with Autism: Population Study. Taylor B et al. BMJ 2002; 324(7334):393-6. Subjects: 278 children with core autism and 195 with atypical autism. conclusions: These findings provide no support for an MMR associated \"new variant\" form of autism with developmental regression and bowel problems, and further evidence against involvement of MMR vaccine in the initiation of autism. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11850369 24. No Evidence for a New Variant of Measles-Mumps-Rubella- Induced Autism. Fombonne E et al. Pediatrics 2001;108(4):E58. Subjects: 262 autistic children (pre- and post-MMR samples). conclusions: No evidence was found to support a distinct syn- drome of MMR-induced autism or of \"autistic enterocolitis.\" These results add to the recent accumulation of large-scale epi - demiologic studies that all failed to support an association between MMR and autism at population level. When combined, the current findings do not argue for changes in current immu - nization programs and recommendations. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11581466 25. Time Trends in Autism and in MMR Immunization Coverage in California. Dales L et al. JAMA 2001; 285(9):1183-5. Subjects: Children born in 1980-94 who were enrolled in California kinder-gartens (survey samples of 600-1,900 children each year). conclusions: These data do not suggest an association between MMR immunization among young children and an increase in autism occurrence. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11231748 26. Mumps, Measles, and Rubella Vaccine and the Incidence of Autism Recorded by General Practitioners: A Time Trend Analysis. Kaye JA et al. BMJ 2001; 322:460-63. Subjects: 305 children with autism. conclusions: Because the incidence of autism among 2 to 5 year olds increased markedly among boys born in each year sep- arately from 1988 to 1993 while MMR vaccine coverage was over 95% for successive annual birth cohorts, the data provide evi-dence that no correlation exists between the prevalence of MMR vaccination and the rapid increase in the risk of autism over time. The explanation for the marked increase in risk of the diag- nosis of autism in the past decade remains uncertain. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11222420 27.

Age at First Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination in Children with Autism and School-Matched Control Subjects: A Population-Based Study in Metropolitan Atlanta. et al. Pediatrics 2004; 113(2): 259-66. Subjects: 624 children with autism and 1,824 controls. conclusions: Similar proportions of case and control children were vaccinated by the recommended age or shortly after (ie, before 18 months) and before the age by which atypical develop- ment is usually recognized in children with autism (ie, 24 months). Vaccination before 36 months was more common among case children than control children, especially among children 3 to 5 years of age, likely reflecting immunization requirements for enrollment in early intervention programs. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936 19. Prevalence of Autism and Parentally Reported Triggers in a North East London Population. Lingam R et al. Arch Dis Child 2003; 88(8):666-70. Subjects: 567 children with autistic spectrum disorder. conclusions: The prevalence of autism, which was apparently rising from 1979 to 1992, reached a plateau from 1992 to 1996 at a rate of some 2.6 per 1000 live births. This levelling off, together with the reducing age at diagnosis, suggests that the earlier recorded rise in prevalence was not a real increase but was likely due to factors such as increased recognition, a greater willingness on the part of educationalists and families to accept the diag- nostic label, and better recording systems. The proportion of parents attributing their child's autism to MMR appears to have increased since August 1997. link: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12876158 20.
