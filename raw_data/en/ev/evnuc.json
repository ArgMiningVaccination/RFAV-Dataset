Join them at Verdant Hollow Farms to connect with your body, with nature, and with a circle of sisters from all walks of life. Activate the spirit of sisterhood in your life as you move through a medley of nourishing experiences that are sure to fill your cup by saying yes to this intimate, womens-only event. Gathering as women is an age-old practice that has sustained the essence of sisterhood for centuries. We sincerely hope you can join us for this sacred day. Due to the intimacy of this event there will be limited space, so if you feel the call to join us please do secure your spot today and purchase your ticket! Please reach out to ZXhwbG9yZW1vcmV3aXRoY2FzcyB8IGdtYWlsICEgY29t with any questions! We'd love to have your beautiful energy present! xo With love & light, Cass & Carly Take a Peek into Our Day We will start the day slowly with an opening circle to set our intention and deepen our connection as a group. Afterwards, we will enjoy an herb walk, learn about the medicinal plants around us, and forage fresh herbs to enjoy as medicine later in the day. Our herb walk will lead us to a special spot in Verdant Hollow's magical woods, where Cass will lead us through a yoga movement practice fit for women of all ages and phases of life. A special lunch is to follow, featuring Verdant Hollow's pasture-raised proteins and organic produce, as well as other local, medicinal delights to deeply nourish our bodies. After we have mindfully enjoyed our meal together, we will make tea with our wild herbs and drop into a powerfully connective tea ceremony as sisters. To follow, we will experience the profoundly restorative practice of yoga nidra and bathe in the sounds of quartz crystal singing bowls as we rest among the trees. To close the day, we will sow seeds as a sisterhood and plant our intentions for the Summer ahead. This will be an opportunity to reflect on your past, reclaim your present moment, and manifest whatever your heart reveals to you as you manifest for the future.

Meet Your Facilitators Cassandra Justine Cass holds space for people to explore more, to be curious and to strengthen their intuition. This Chicagoland native, now a Southwest Michigander, found yoga at age five and began her path as a yoga teacher in 2009 at the young age of 19. She is a passionate student of life devoted to studying and embodying the wisdom of our ancestors. She shares her love with the world as an experienced yoga and meditation teacher, a yoga nidra guide, a sound journey facilitator, a homeopathy enthusiast, a conscious parenting and women's circle space holder, a vibrational sound therapist, reiki master, intuitive tarot reader, writer, speaker, mentor and mother. She is the founder of Explore More - a compass for her offerings. She facilitates intentionally guided experiences in form of classes, workshops, retreats and trainings. She has co-created a variety of programs and yoga teacher trainings, has taught at several festivals and co-founded a non-profit. Carly Pinto Carly is a local herbalist, holistic nutritionist and community educator, passionate about connecting folks with the healing power of Nature. Her journey in holistic health began in her youth while encountering some health issues the conventional medical system did not have answers for. After seeing the profound power of using food and herbs as medicine in her own life, she knew she found her calling. Carly committed to being a life-long learner and has since pursued an advanced degree in holistic nutrition from a naturopathic institution, extensive training in herbal medicine and foraging, as well as continued education in other traditional medicinal systems. Through her business, Nurturing through Nature, she loves to serve in many ways, including offering foraging and medicine making experiences, holistic nutrition and herbal consultations, community wellness workshops, and making wild and homegrown herbal remedies. Carly is particularly passionate about gathering as women to learn and grow together. Her hope is to spark curiosity about the medicine we find on our land and in our food, and to empower you with tools of sovereignty to care for yourself and your community. Our Location Verdant Hollow Farms Verdant Hollow Farms is a farming operation restoring soils, water, and woodlands using regenerative practices. We celebrate the natural features of the land as a working farm with animals and vegetables and invite visitors and the local community to join us. Visiting individuals and groups will be immersed and educated in the environment and sustainable farming practices while enjoying high quality food, modest accommodations, and spaces for exploration. This land was owned for the past forty-five years by a great family who did well at stewarding the land with livestock and some farming. They converted the original barn into their home in 1971 with Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman. It truly is a unique structure with original timbers, cedar paneling, and a spiral steel staircase that connects the four levels. The patriarch was a caring veterinarian who raised sheep and llama, planted a pine and walnut forest, and maintained an orchard. In more recent years, the sixty tillable acres were leased for corn and soy production.
