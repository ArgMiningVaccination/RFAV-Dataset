With the use of Reiki, aromatherapy, sonic therapy, and crystals, we provide a way for our clients to relax and follow a path to wellness and promote a stress free life. Energy healing harnesses the life force energy as a means to restore, heal, and bring balance to a person as a whole. Our gentle and safe, hands-on healing approach allows a person's body, mind, emotions, and spirit to be brought to harmony. It can balance the chakras, reduce stress, and help heal trauma in the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies. Energetic healing derives from the knowledge that every living being emits an energy field, which is supported by multiple scientific studies on resonance and frequency. When people come to energy healing they either have some experience with alternative healing or no experience at all. Whatever your level of experience may be, Reiki is a non-invasive practice with noticeable positive effects on stress, health, and energy. Reiki does not replace traditional medicine. However, it works well as part of an holistic program. It is a high-vibrancy technique that is safe, effective and gentle to use on people of all ages, and with all medical conditions. It purifies and cleanses the chakras and energetic aura, working on the body in areas where it is needed most. We take the current pandemic situation very seriously. A thorough cleaning is done after each client. We request that you wear a mask during your sessions unless you are vaccinated against COVID-19. Thanks for your understanding and your willingness to keep our community safe as we weather this viral storm. "}
