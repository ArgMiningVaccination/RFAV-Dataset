It is one of the most cost -effective health investments, with proven strategies that make it accessible to even the most hard -to-reach and vulnerable populations. It has clearly defined target groups; it can be delivered effectively through outreach activities; and vaccination does not require any major lifestyle change.\" WHO , 2019Immune System It is important to understand the basics ofthe immune system in order to: understand how vaccines work understand the vaccination recommendations Immunity = the ability of the human body to protect itself from infectious diseases discrimination of indigenous and foreign material in the body > ability to tolerate indigenous -and eliminate foreign materialNon -specific immunity (from birth): physical barriers (e.g .,skin and mucous membranes) and chemical barriers (e.g .,gastric acid, digestive enzymes and acids of the skin) Acquired immunity: against a specific organism or a group of organismsActive Immunity Immunity produced bya person \u00b4sown immune system Usually lasts a long time ; even for a whole lifetime Obtained bycontracting a disease orbyvaccination Type A: Antibody mediated immunity : produced mainly byB lymphocytes (=B cells ) in interaction with T cells Replication and differentation of B cells into plasma cells secreting antibody to the antigenB lymphocytes (B cells) recognizationAntigen to the bodyAntibodies : provide immunity against the diseaseActive Immunity (continued ) Type B: Cell -mediated immunity > T lymphocytes (=T cells ) T helper cells Stimulate the immune response of other cells (e.g.,B cells)T suppressor cells Inhibit and control the level of immune responseCytotoxic T cells Recognize and destroy infected cells and activate phagocytesPassive Immunity Another individual oran animal hasproduced antibodies against some microbe These antibodies have been transferred to another human being By placenta (during pregnancy ) By breastfeeding a baby By injection (immunoglobulin ) By transfusion of blood orblood products Immunity is effective buttemporary : usually notlifelongVaccines produce active immunity Vaccines canbeproduced from : Live attenuated microbes Inactivated = killed microbes Inactivated microbial toxins Surface proteins of microbes Different kinds of microbial components Vaccination > antigens to thebody > active immunity system activation > antibodies against themicrobe > protection against thediseaseHow do vaccines work?
