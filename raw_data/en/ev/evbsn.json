The study was a randomized controlled longitudinal study. It included 45 adolescents from both sexes who were divided randomly into two groups: one group was treated with low calorie diet and exercise as group A and group B was treated with low calorie diet, exercise, and laser acupuncture. All parameters and blood samples were done before and after the interventions. Group A showed a highly significant reduction post intervention in anthropometric parameters: C, and hip C, except for waste/hip (W/H) ratio which showed no significant difference, p > 0.05 and some lipid profiles (cholesterol, LDL) with p < 0.001 Whereas, a significant decrease in TG was observed (p < 0.05). On the other hand, a significant increase in HDL was observed (p < 0.05). Group B (LCD + exercise + LA) showed a highly significant reduction post intervention and Hip C, except for W/H ratio which showed no significant difference, p > 0.05 and lipid profile: cholesterol, LDL, and TG with (p < 0.001), whereas a highly significant increase in HDL was observed (p < 0.001). The current study revealed a significant difference between group A and group B regarding the percentage of change, where the highest values were found in group B compared to group A, in anthropometric parameters (weight, BMI, subscapular SFT, MUAC, waist circumference) and some lipid profiles (LDL and HDL) with p < 0.05.

However, the sham procedure is conducted either at the same points that are used for the acupuncture group or at nonindicated points. Objective: To assess whether the outcome of sham acupuncture varies according to the needling points in sham-controlled trials of acupuncture for chronic nonspecific low back pain (CLBP) as an example. Data sources: Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database were conducted on February 12, 2023. Study selection: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the outcomes of acupuncture in sham acupuncture-controlled or waiting list-controlled trials on CLBP were included. Data extraction and synthesis: Two researchers independently extracted data on study characteristics and outcomes and assessed quality. Sham acupuncture was classified according to whether it was conducted at the same acupuncture points used in the acupuncture group, referred to as sham acupuncture therapy (verum) (SATV) or at different points, referred to as sham acupuncture therapy (sham) (SATS). Clinical similarity, transitivity, and consistency tests were conducted, followed by a random-effects frequentist network meta-analysis (NMA). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was pain, and the secondary outcome was back-specific function. The first assessment after the end of treatment was chosen for analysis. Effect sizes are reported as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the certainty of evidence for findings was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: Ten RCTs involving 4379 participants were included. In comparison with SATS, acupuncture was significantly associated with improvements in both pain (SMD, -0.33; 95% CI, -0.52 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.02); however, there were no differences between acupuncture and SATV. In comparison with SATS, SATV was significantly associated with better pain (SMD, -0.45; -0.88 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.05). The risk of bias that could affect the interpretation of the results was usually low, and the certainty of evidence was moderate to low. Conclusions and relevance: In this NMA, sham acupuncture needling at the same points as those in acupuncture was not a true placebo control for assessing the efficacy of acupuncture for CLBP and might underestimate the outcome of acupuncture in clinical settings.Importance When sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> is set as a id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a>, the sham the sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d007603\">procedure</a> is conducted either at the same points that are used for the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group or at nonindicated points. <h2>Objective:</h2> To assess whether the outcome of sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> varies according to the needling points in <a Allied and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000529\">Complementary Medicine</a> Database were conducted on February 12, 2023.

METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to February 28, 2023. Randomized controlled trials on acupuncture in patients after CRC resection were included. Two reviewers independently selected relevant trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to obtain summary effect estimates. The data were pooled and analyzed using RevMan 5.3. The heterogeneity of selected studies was evaluated by evaluating the I-squared (I2) statistics. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with 1878 patients were included. Results of the meta-analysis showed there was a low level evidence that acupuncture may improve early postoperative symptoms, such as time to first flatus (n = 876, MD -0.77h, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.33 h, I2 = 89%), time to first bowel movement (n = 671, MD -1.41h, 95% CI -2.20 to -0.63 h, I2 = 95%), time to first defecation (n = 556, MD -1.03h, 95% CI -1.88 to -0.18 h, CI 0.59-0.89, I2 = 49%) compared with usual care and sham acupuncture. However, there were no statistically significant differences in postoperative pain (n = 1188, MD-0.21, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.17, I2 = 74%). And there was no sufficient evidence of improving long-term functional outcomes. There was substantial heterogeneity across trials. The adverse events associated with acupuncture stimulation were minor in include studies. CONCLUSION SUBSECTIONS: There is currently low-level evidence supporting the use of acupuncture on postoperative symptoms for patients after colorectal cancer resection. More investigations should be established based on the STRICTA statement strictly.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> To evaluate from inception to February 28, 2023.

Heredity, age, underlying eye illness, internal eye surgery, or eye trauma can all cause it. A safer alternative to current therapies for macular degeneration is urgently needed since they all induce ocular irritation and postoperative recurrence as well as a host of other adverse effects. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 12-year-old girl was the patient. A laser pen burnt her right eye. There was a spot and a shadow in the middle of her right eye's visual field. DIAGNOSES: Macular degeneration. INTERVENTIONS: Given the patient's age, we opted out of medicine and instead used acupuncture as a symptomatic treatment. OUTCOMES: Two months after therapy concluded, optical coherence tomography result report indicate that the macula region of the right eye is better than it was previously. The corrected visual acuity of the right eye recovered from 0.25 to 1.0, and the clinical accompanying symptoms of the right eye disappeared. LESSONS: No additional medication or surgical procedure was employed in this instance. We treated the macular damage with acupuncture, which relieved the patient's clinical symptoms and had no adverse effects. This demonstrates that acupuncture may be beneficial in treating ophthalmopathy in this direction.RATIONALE Many factors can contribute to the development of macular <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014947\">injury</a>, which results in <a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">therapies</a> for <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008268\">macular degeneration</a> is ocular irritation and postoperative <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d012008\">recurrence</a> as <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d005123\">eye</a>.

DA or massage therapy alleviates symptoms related to intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, precise, repeatable, standardized instructions for Tuina manipulation are lacking. This study establishes IDD model rabbits induced by fibrous ring puncture, creates targeted Tuina stimulation protocols at the acupuncture points in the lumbar region, and describes in detail the operation methods and requirements of kneading, pointing, and flicking. New Zealand male white rabbits (n = 15) were selected and randomly divided into a blank group, a model group, and a Tuina group. The rabbits in the model group and the Tuina group were molded by fibrous ring puncture; the rabbits in the model group were only immobilized on the operating table without treatment. In contrast, the Tuina group used the \"8N/10N, 30 cycles/min\" prescription for kneading, pointing, and flicking to perform the intervention, using tactile sensory aids to monitor and regulate the intensity of the Tuina operation. Imaging diagnosis and pathological tests were used to assess the effect of Tuina in rabbits, and the results showed improved imaging features and significantly lowered pathology scores of lumbar disc degeneration in the Tuina group compared to the model group (P < 0.01). Targeted Tuina in the lumbar region may be beneficial in the alleviation of lumbar disc degeneration, but further verification is needed.

METHODS: A total of 69 poststroke patients were randomly assigned to the JM+AC group (n = 23), the JM group (n = 23), and the control group (n = 23). Patients in the JM+AC group and the JM group received JM for 30 minutes, twice a week for 12 weeks, and the JM+AC group received AC for 30 minutes separately once a week. The control group did not receive JM or AC. Pain (visual analog scale, shoulder pain and disability index, Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index), physical function (range of motion, 10-m walking speed test, functional gait assessment, manual function test, activities of daily living scale, instrumental activities of daily living scale), and depression (center for epidemiologic studies depression scale, Beck depression inventory) were assessed for each patient before and after the 12 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: Pain and physical function were improved significantly in the JM+AC group compared with the JM and control groups. Physical function and depression were improved significantly in the JM+AC and JM groups compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The treatment of JM combined with AC improved pain, depression, and physical function of poststroke patients with chronic neuropathic pain in this study.

This study aimed to survey the prevalence of CAM use by healthy pregnant women as a health-care prescribed therapy or self-care and to investigate the factors associated with CAM use in Japan. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, pregnant women after 34 weeks of gestation were asked to respond to a questionnaire at the clinic or online. The questionnaire comprised questions on the participants' characteristics and their use of CAM for therapy and self-care. Descriptive statistics were calculated in the analyses, and bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between factors and CAM use. RESULTS: A total of 394 women responded from three hospitals, two clinics, and two midwifery birth centers. CAM was received as treatment by practitioners during pregnancy by 75 women (19.0%). The following therapies were used: traditional Chinese medicine (7.9%), chiropractic (6.9%), moxibustion (6.4%), and acupuncture (5.3%). One or more types of therapy were used as self-care by 348 women (88.3%). Highly used CAM for self-care folic acid other supplements (51.5%), herbs (20.8%), and yoga (19.0%). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the factors associated with CAM use as a therapy were midwifery birth centers for planned childbirth settings (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.69-7.83]) and pregnancy complications diagnosed (AOR 2.46, 95%CI [1.38-4.39]). The factors associated with CAM use for self-care were age 30-39 years (AOR 4.48, 40 years 3.92, and primiparas (AOR 3.82, 95%CI [1.86-7.86]). of information was the \"Internet\" (43.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 20% of Japanese pregnant women received CAM as therapy by practitioners, and the related factors were: tended to have baby at midwifery birth center and pregnancy complications. Almost 90% of respondents used CAM as self-care and the related factors were: older, had a higher educational level and tended to be primiparas. They used the Internet as their main source of information about CAM. Health care providers need to provide evidenced-based information on CAM and to help decision making to ensure safe and effective CAM utilization by pregnant women.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> Complementary and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000529\">alternative medicine</a> (CAM) are popular and to investigate associated with CAM use in <a asked to respond to a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d011795\">questionnaire</a> at the clinic or online.

Methods: Nine databases from their inception to December 6th, 2022, were comprehensively searched to retrieve RCTs related to the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of DOR. The outcomes of interest were sex hormones level and antral follicle count (AFC). Risk of Bias (RoB) was adopted to assess the quality of the included trials. Results: A total of 13 RCTs involving 787 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The review of available evidence revealed acupuncture produced a significant efficacy in decreasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (SMD = 0.25, 95%CI [-0.00, 0.49], p = 0.05), along with AFC (MD = 1.87, 95%CI [0.96, 2.79], p < 0.0001) compared to controls. Compared with electro-acupuncture treatment, manual acupuncture was superior in reducing FSH levels, FSH/LH ratio, and increasing AMH levels and AFC (p < 0.05). A notable association was also seen when acupuncture was combined with traditional Chinese medicine therapy for improving FSH levels, FSH/LH ratio, and AFC (p < 0.05). Besides, a high dose of acupuncture (10 acupoints) was more conducive to ameliorating FSH levels, FSH/LH ratio, and AFC (p < 0.05) than a low dose of acupuncture (<10 acupoints). Substantial heterogeneity existed among studies. Conclusion: Acupuncture may have significant clinical potential for patients with DOR in terms of improving sex hormones level and increasing AFC, although the evidence is drawn with high heterogeneity. This finding suggests that more rigorous trials conducted in diverse regions worldwide are necessary to identify the efficacy of acupuncture for patients diagnosed with DOR.

AMERICAESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICAEEUUIn basic experimental acupuncture research, rats are commonly used as laboratory animals. However, it is difficult for them to maintain a fixed posture. During electroacupuncture procedures, proper immobilization of rats is essential. Various methods of rat fixation are currently used, including anesthesia fixation, high-platform fixation, binding fixation, and fixation with a self-made rat coat. However, these methods have their limitations, which may affect the efficiency and operability of the experiment to some extent. This protocol introduces a method of suspending and fixing rats using rat clothes. Firstly, rats are clothed with rat jackets that match their body shape, taking advantage of their preference for darkness and burrowing. The needling operation can then be carried out after the rats have worn rat clothes. When suspended, the rats are relatively still, as their limbs cannot move. This fixation method offers not only economical and user-friendly benefits but also ensures a stable and reliable fixation of the rats in a comfortably relaxed position. It also effectively minimizes time consumption, experimental space, and manpower resources. Additionally, this method allows for the exposure of most acupoints used for acupuncture in rats. This article primarily concentrates on the device's composition, encompassing a specially designed rat jacket, an elevated fixation rack, and their connecting structures.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion in PMD patients. METHODS: Databases, namely PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CNKI, CBM, VIP, and WanFang, were reviewed for related randomized controlled trials dated between database inception and November 22, 2022. The primary outcomes were the efficacy rate and the Hamilton Depression Scale score. The secondary outcomes were the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol and the Kupperman score. Odds ratios (ORs) were generated as the effect size for dichotomous outcomes, while the standard mean difference (SMD) \u00b1 standard deviation was used for continuous outcomes. Matrices were developed to demonstrate pairwise comparisons of regimens related to each endpoint. Utilizing Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3, Stata 16.0 and SPSS 21, data were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 27 studies involving 2269 PMD patients and 8 therapeutic measures were incorporated into the network meta-analysis (NMA). The NMA showed that warm acupuncture (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.00-2.44), electroacupuncture (OR = 1.34, (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: and common acupuncture (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 0.9-2.17) were more effective than fluoxetine + menopausal hormone treatment in the treatment of PMD. The NMA also showed that, based on the Hamilton Depression Scale score, warm acupuncture was more effective than the other 4 acupuncture-related treatments, i.e., electroacupuncture (SMD -2.26 to -0.66). The cumulative ranking probability (SUCRA) showed that warm acupuncture (99.6%) was the best treatment method. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this network meta-analysis may help patients and therapists choose the best acupuncture therapy for treating perimenopausal depression patients and furnish reliable evidence for guidelines.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> The issues related to <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d020249\">hormone replacement therapy</a>.

DEL SURBackground: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) accounts for more than half of all adult cardiac surgeries worldwide. Post-operative chest pain is a common CABG complication and can cause significant discomfort. Objectives: Because taking large amounts of analgesics can have many side effects, we evaluated whether acupuncture effectively reduces pain and the use of analgesics by CABG patients. Methods: In this clinical trial, 30 patients who had recently undergone CABG were randomly allocated to two groups. For both groups, exercise therapy and routine analgesics were recommended. The intervention group underwent bilateral acupuncture in distinct acupoints, 10 daily sessions constantly. Visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic use were evaluated in both groups at baseline and after completing the 10-day treatment. Results: Our analysis revealed significant decreases in the mean VAS scores in both the intervention and the control group, and that the reduction was more significant in the acupuncture group (p < 0.001). Moreover, analgesic use was significantly lower in the acupuncture group when compared with the control group (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings highlight acupuncture as an alternative method of controlling CABG-associated post-operative chest pain and reducing the use of analgesics, which might have many side effects.<h2>Background:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001026\">Coronary artery bypass grafting</a> (CABG) common CABG complication and can cause significant discomfort. <h2>Objectives:</h2> Because taking large amounts of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000700\">analgesics</a> can have many side effects, we <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> effectively reduces undergone CABG were randomly allocated to two groups.

Group A also received LAT three times weekly, with each session lasting 2 minutes on selected acupoints. After the 12-week intervention, plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were assessed. Results: Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in the aforementioned lipids after the 12-week intervention. A comparison between the post-intervention values of the lipids in the groups revealed a significant improvement favoring group A (the group that received LAT).

METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into blank group, model group and acupuncture group. Each group was divided into Day 1, Day 3 and Day 7 subgroups respectively, with 5 rats in each group. The autologous blood injection was adopted to duplicate rat model of ICH. In the acupuncture group, the needle was inserted from \"Baihui\" \u00ef\u00bcGV20\u00ef\u00bc towards \"Qubin\" \u00ef\u00bcGB7\u00ef\u00bc on the affected side, stimulating for 30 min each time, once daily\u00ef\u00bc the same acupuncture technique was opera-ted in each subgroup for 1, 3 and 7 days, separately. Using Bederson scale, the neurological deficit was evaluated in each group. Western blot was adopted to detect the protein expression levels lesion of the brain tissue of rats in each group. RESULTS: After treatment, the neurological deficit score of rats in the model group was higher than that of the blank group at each time point \u00ef\u00bcP<0.05\u00ef\u00bc, and the score of the acupuncture group started declining since the 3rd day of treatment when compared with the model group \u00ef\u00bcP<0.05\u00ef\u00bc. At each time point, compared with the blank group, the protein expression levels of LC3\u00e2 /\u00e2 \u00a1, Beclin1, p-c-Jun and p-JNK was increased \u00ef\u00bcP<0.01\u00ef\u00bc.

Available pharmacological therapeutic options for depression in PD mainly include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine meanwhile, agents acting on dopaminergic pathways used for symptoms, such as levodopa, dopaminergic agonists, and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors, may also provide beneficial antidepressant effects. Recently, there is a growing interest in non-pharmacological interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy; physical exercise, including dance and mind-body exercises, such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong; acupuncture; therapeutic massage; music therapy; active therapy; repetitive stimulation (rTMS); and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for refractory cases. However, the optimal treatment approach for PD depression is uncertain, its management may be challenging, and definite guidelines are also lacking. It is still unclear which of these interventions is the most appropriate and for which PD stage under which circumstances. Herein, we aim to provide an updated comprehensive review of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for depression in PD, focusing on recent clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.

Published systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) concerning the use of acupuncture for ADHD have compared the efficacy of acupuncture treatment to that of drug therapies. However, the quality of these articles has not been evaluated and the evidence varies widely. OBJECTIVE: To summarize and assess the efficacy of acupuncture for ADHD based on existing SRs and MAs. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted from inception until September 16 2021, using seven electronic databases. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to evaluate the quality of SRs and MAs, and the GRADE system was used to assess the quality of evidence. RESULTS: There are a total of five SRs and MAs included in this overview. Using the AMSTAR-2, three articles were rated as having 'Low' quality, while two were rated as having of 'Critically Low' quality. The GRADE system was used to measure the quality of evidence for ten outcomes (five response rate outcomes, three Conners' Index of Hyperactivity (CIH) score outcomes, one Conners' rating scale score outcome, and one Chinese medicine syndrome outcome) across the five included MAs. Four of the ten outcomes demonstrated 'moderate' quality, four demonstrated 'low' quality, and two demonstrated 'very low' quality. The risk of bias and inconsistency accounted for most downgrading factors in the included reviews. CONCLUSION: It is still debatable whether acupuncture is efficacious in improving the CIH score and the Response rate. Considering the heterogeneity of clinical trials and the fact that this study did not search and evaluate the relevant data of each randomized controlled trial, large-sample and high-quality randomized controlled trials are still needed to draw reliable conclusions regarding acupuncture's role in treating ADHD.

Existing treatments exhibit limited efficacy and pronounced side effects. Acupuncture has been explored as a supplementary intervention in clinical practice. This study aims to investigate the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture for post-stroke hiccups.Methods: To identify published clinical randomized controlled trials addressing post-stroke hiccups treatment, comprehensive searches were conducted across PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese Biological Medical (CBM), Wanfang Database, and China Science and Technology Journal (VIP). In addition, we scrutinized ClinicalTrials.gov and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Employing Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 and Review Manager 5.4 software, three authors independently reviewed literature, extracted data, and evaluated study quality. Data analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 and Review Manager 5.4.Results: A total of 18 trials were encompassed in the analysis. In comparison to standard treatment, acupuncture exhibited a significant enhancement in treatment effectiveness (RR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.21-1.33; P < 0.00001). Notably, Hiccup considerable decrease (WMD: -1.28, 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.93; P < 0.00001), concurrent with a noteworthy improvement in the quality of life (WMD: 8.470, 95% CI: 7.323-9.617; P < 0.00001). Additionally, adverse reactions decreased (RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.16-1.25; P = 0.13), and there was a significant reduction in SAS (WMD: -7.23, 95% CI: -8.47 - -5.99; P < 0.00001).Conclusions: Our investigation suggests that acupuncture could prove effective in post-stroke hiccup treatment.

The treatments for MNP are limited. Previous studies and clinical experience have indicated that myofascial acupuncture might be a better treatment option for MNP, but the efficacy is controversial. Therefore, our aim is to compare the efficacy of myofascial acupuncture and routine acupuncture for MNP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a multicentre, prospective randomised clinical trial. Patients will be recruited from four tertiary hospitals in China. A total of 438 participants with MNP will be randomly assigned into two groups, namely the 'Sancai-Tianbu' myofascial acupuncture group and the routine acupuncture group, at a ratio of 1:1. Each group will receive the acupuncture treatment twice a week for 21 days, totalling six sessions. The primary outcome will be the Visual Analogue Scale score. The secondary outcomes will be the Neck Disability Index, the cervical range of motion and the MOS 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. The assessments will be performed at baseline (immediately after allocation), pretreatment (5 min before every treatment), post-treatment (within 10 min after every treatment), postcourse (within 1 day after the course), and at 1, 3 and 6 months after the course. All patients will be included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Repeated-measure analysis of covariance will be used to determine the effects of the intervention on the outcome measures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation 731 Hospital, with permission number 2022-0204-01. Written informed consent will be obtained from the enrolled patients. Trial results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications.

Photobiomodulation might influence the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and miR-320 expression. The aim was to investigate the influence of LLLA biostimulation on the severity, language abilities, BDNF levels, and miR-320 in a sample of children with ASD. METHODS: The participants with ASD (N = 30) were randomly divided equally into groups: Group I received LLLA therapy twice a week for 12 sessions and Group II did not receive it. Assessments of the severity, language abilities, BDNF level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and miR-320 expression by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed before and after the intervention. A comparison between ASD cases (N = 30) before starting the therapy and neurotypical children (N = 15) regarding miR-320 expression was performed. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the severity of ASD was reduced and language performance was elevated in both groups. The improvement in Group I was higher with (P = 0.002; 0.03). The plasma BDNF level was reduced only in Group I (P < 0.001). The expression level of miR-320 in Group I did not show a change (P = 0.641). A significant difference in miR-320 expression between children with ASD and the neurotypical group (P = 0.000) was observed. CONCLUSION: This study introduces LLLA therapy as a safe and promising therapeutic procedure for improving the core manifestations and communication abilities and for modulating BDNF levels in children with ASD.

Yizhi weishu refers to a idea running through the whole process of diagnosis and treatment of sinew/fascia disorders, in which, the results, obtained by the overall observation and palpation of patient's sinew/fascia structure, are taken as the criteria of treatment. Yitong weishu (taking the sites of sensitivity or tenderness as the points) verifies this idea in practice.

METHODS: A total of 120 patients with neck-type cervical spondylosis were collected. The meridian diagnostic method was used to examine the upper back of each patient, the manifestation category of jingjin lesions, locations and the affected muscle regions of twelve meridians were recorded. RESULTS: (1) The punctate lesions of jingjin were detected in 15 regions, and the highest frequency of lesion occurred in the region from the inner upper corner of the scapula to Quyuan (SI 13) (113 cases, 94.2% of lesion frequency). The lesion frequency of 10 regions was 50.0%. The punctate lesions were mainly distributed in the muscle regions of hand-shaoyang (349 cases) and foot-taiyang (333 cases). (2) The linear lesions of jingjin were detected in 10 regions, and the highest frequency of lesion occurred in the region from the inner upper corner of the scapula to Quyuan (SI 13) (77 cases, 64.2% of lesion frequency). The lesion frequency of 2 regions was 50.0%. The linear lesions occurred mainly in the muscle region of foot-taiyang (251 cases). (3) Eight regions were examined to be the planar lesions of jingjin, and the highest frequency of lesion was found in the site of Jianjing (GB 21) (84 cases, 70.0% of lesion frequency). The lesion frequency of 3 regions was 50.0%. The muscle region of foot-taiyang (260 cases) was predominated in the planar lesions. (4) The distribution of all of the punctate, linear and planar lesions of jingjin was analyzed statistically. It was found that 25 regions were involved and those with the high lesion frequency were distributed in the area from the inner upper corner of the scapula to Quyuan (SI 13), the sites of Jianjing (GB 21) and Dazhui (GV 14), transverse processes of C3 to C5 and the area from the lateral border of the scapula to the teres minor, separately. The muscle regions of foot-taiyang, hand-shaoyang and hand-yangming were involved in various kinds of jingjin lesions. CONCLUSION: Jingjin lesions in patients with neck-type cervical spondylosis can be divided into three categories, namely, punctate, linear and planar lesions; of which, the punctate lesions are dominated. A majority of jingjin lesions is related to the muscle region of foot-taiyang, and the lesion frequency is higher compared with the lesions to the muscle regions of hand-shaoyang and hand-yangming. Jingjin lesions are commonly distributed in the area from the inner upper corner of the scapula to Quyuan (SI 13).<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To explore the manifestations of jingjin (sinews/<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d005205\">fascia</a>) lesions and summarize their of <a class=\"decs\" was used to examine id=\"d001415\">back</a> of each <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patient</a>, the manifestation jingjin lesions, locations and the affected <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009132\">muscle</a> regions of twelve <a class=\"decs\" <h2>RESULTS:</h2> (1) The punctate lesions of jingjin were detected in 15 regions, and the highest frequency of lesion occurred in the region from the inner upper corner of the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d012540\">scapula</a> to Quyuan (SI 13) (113 cases, 94.2% of lesion frequency).

The occurrence and the progression of tumor may disrupt the overall coordination between the fascial network and jingjin directly or indirectly, thereby, the impairment of this coordination may result in cancer pain. Rooted on the theory of overall balance of the fascial network, and combined with understanding of pain in jingjin theory, professor HUANG Jin-chang emphasizes the importance of \"relaxing the knot\" in treatment of cancer pain. It is recommended to select the fascia reaction point as the target point, in accordance with the principle of balance adjustment and apply various acupuncture and moxibustion therapies, such as Fu's subcutaneous needling, small-needle scalpel between jingjin (<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009132\">muscle</a> region of meridian) and the fascial network for coordinating the balance in the body.

METHODS: A total of 105 patients with HSP after stroke were randomly divided into a manual acupuncture group (35 cases, 2 cases dropped off), an EA continuous wave group (35 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and an EA disperse-dense wave group (35 cases). The conventional rehabilitation therapy was delivered in the three groups. Additionally, acupuncture was applied to Jianyu (LI 15), Jianzhen (SI 9), Jianliao (TE 14) and Jianqian (Extra) etc. on the affected side in the manual acupuncture group. In the EA continuous wave group and the EA disperse-dense wave group, besides the treatment as the manual acupuncture group, the electric stimulation was attached to two pairs of acupoints, i.e. Jianyu (LI 15) and Jianliao (TE 14), and Quchi (LI 11) and Shousanli (LI 10), with 15 Hz continuous wave, and 2 Hz/ 100 Hz disperse-dense wave, respectively. The treatment was given once daily, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks consecutively. The score of visual analogue scale (VAS) before treatment and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, as well as the passive range of motion (PROM) of shoulder forward flexion and PROM of shoulder abduction, muscle strength of the upper limb, the score of modified Barthel index (MBI) and the score of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) before and after treatment were observed in each group. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, VAS scores were reduced after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment in each group (P<0.05); and VAS scores after 4 weeks of treatment were lower than those after 2 weeks of treatment (P<0.05). After 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, VAS score in either the EA continuous wave group or the EA disperse-dense wave group was lower compared with the manual acupuncture group (P<0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, VAS score in the EA disperse-dense wave was lower than that of the EA continuous wave group (P<0.05). Compared with before treatment, PROM of the shoulder forward flexion and abduction on the affected side after treatment was enlarged (P<0.05), the muscle strength of the upper limb was increased (P<0.05), and the scores of MBI and FMA were increased (P<0.05) in the patients of each group. After treatment, in the EA continuous wave group and the EA disperse-dense wave group, PROM of the shoulder forward flexion on the affected side was higher (P<0.05), the muscle strength of the upper limb was stronger (P<0.05) when compared with the manual acupuncture group; and the scores of MBI and FMA in the EA disperse-dense wave group were higher than those of the manual acupuncture group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture is superior to manual acupuncture in the analgesic effect and comprehensive rehabilitation effect in the patients with HSP after stroke. The therapeutic effect obtained by electroacupuncture with 2 Hz/100 Hz disperse-dense wave is better than that with 15 continuous wave.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To id=\"d010361\">patients</a> with HSP after <a into a manual <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group (35 cases, 2 cases dropped off), an EA continuous <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d055871\">wave</a> group (35 cases, 3 off) and an EA disperse-dense <a class=\"decs\" <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">therapy</a> Additionally, <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> was applied to Jianyu (LI 15), Jianzhen (SI 9), Jianliao (TE 14) and Jianqian (Extra) etc. on the affected side in the manual <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group.

On the basis of the western medication group, patients in the acupuncture and medication group were treated with acupuncture at Baihui (GV 20), Ningshen, Yunting area, Mastoid 1 point, Mastoid 2 point, Fengchi (GB 20), Gongxue, Tinghui (GB 2), etc., repeated transcranial acupuncture was applied at Baihui (GV 20), Ningshen and Yunting area; Mastoid 1 point and Mastoid 2 point, Fengchi (GB 20) and Gongxue of the affected side were connected to the electroacupuncture instrument, continuous wave, 2 Hz in frequency. The needle was retained for 30 min, once a day, and rest for 1 d after 6 d of continuous treatment. All patients were treated for 3 weeks. The average hearing threshold, tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) score, dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) score and speech discrimination test score were compared between the two groups before and after treatment, and the clinical effect was evaluated. RESULTS: After treatment, the average hearing threshold, THI and DHI scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment (P<0.05), and above indexes in the acupuncture and medication group were lower than those in the western medication group (P<0.05). The speech discrimination test scores of the two groups were higher than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the score in the acupuncture and medication group was higher than that in the western medication group (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 87.2% (34/39) in the acupuncture and medication group, which was higher than 74.4% (29/39) in the western medication group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Repeated transcranial acupuncture combined with electroacupuncture can improve the hearing level of patients with flat descending sudden deafness, relieve tinnitus and vertigo symptoms.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the clinical class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> descending <a divided into an <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> and medication group (39 cases, 1 case dropped off) and a western medication group (39 cases, 1 case dropped off). <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">Patients</a> in the western medication group leaf preparation.

METHODS: A total of 40 male SD rats of SPF-grade were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a medication group and an acupuncture group, 10 rats in each group. Except for the normal group, ovalbumin sensitization method was used to establish the asthma model in the other 3 groups. Salbutamol nebulization was adopted in the medication group, while acupuncture was applied at bilateral \"Kongzui\" (LU 6) and \"Yuji\" (LU 10) in the acupuncture group. The intervention was given once a day for 14 days in the two groups. The latent period of inducing asthma and pulmonary function were observed, the levels of ET-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were detected by ELISA method, the morphology of the airway was observed by Masson staining, the ultrastructure of the airway smooth muscle was observed by transmission electron microscopy, the mRNA and protein expression of ET-1 and MT-2 in lung tissue was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot methods. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, in the model group, the latent period of inducing asthma was shortened (P<0.01); the airway resistance (RL) was increased while the dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05); the levels of ET-1 and TNF- in serum and BALF were increased (P<0.01); collagen fibers and collagen depositions were found around the bronchi, airway smooth muscle was thickened, the cell damage was severe and mitochondria were swollen; the mRNA and protein expression of ET-1 was increased while the mRNA and protein expression of MT-2 was decreased (P<0.01). Compared with the model group, in the acupuncture group, the latent period of inducing asthma was prolonged (P<0.05), the RL was decreased while the Cdyn was increased (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with the model group, in the medication group and the acupuncture group, the levels of ET-1 and TNF- in serum and BALF were decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05); collagen fibers and collagen depositions around the bronchi were reduced, the thickened airway smooth muscle was lightened, the cell damage was improved; the mRNA and protein expression of ET-1 was decreased while the mRNA and protein expression of MT-2 was increased (P<0.01). Compared with the medication group, the mRNA expression of MT-2 was increased in the acupuncture group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at \"Kongzui\" (LU 6) and \"Yuji\" (LU 10) can improve the pulmonary function and alleviate the airway smooth muscle spasm in rats with asthma. Its mechanism may be related to the down-regulation of ET-1 expression and up-regulation of MT-2 expression.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> the effects of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> at \"Kongzui\" (LU 6) and \"Yuji\" (LU 10) on the latent period of inducing <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001249\">asthma</a>, pulmonary function and class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> of SPF-grade were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a medication group and an <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group, 10 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> in class=\"decs\" id=\"d010047\">ovalbumin</a> sensitization in the other 3 groups. <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000420\">Salbutamol</a> nebulization was adopted in the medication group, while <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> was applied at bilateral \"Kongzui\" (LU 6) and \"Yuji\" (LU 10) in the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group.

METHODS: A total of 54 patients with migraine without aura were randomized into an observation group (27 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a control group (27 cases, 2 cases dropped off). The basic western medication treatment was adopted in the two groups. In the control group, mild moxibustion was applied at Shuaigu (GB 8), Fengchi (GB 20) and Yanglingquan (GB 34) on the affected side. In the observation group, the frequent acupoint areas of the affected side i.e. Shuaigu (GB 8), Fengchi (GB 20), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Taichong (LR 3), Yanglingquan (GB 34) were determined, 3 acupoints with strong heat-sensitive sensation were selected each time and mild moxibustion was adopted. The treatment was given once a day, 5 times of treatment was as one course and 2 courses were required in the two groups. Before and after treatment, the scores of migraine symptom, visual analogue scale (VAS), migraine specific quality of life questionnaire (MSQ) were observed, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated after treatment in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of migraine symptom and VAS were decreased compared with those before treatment (P<0.01), while the MSQ scores were increased compared with those before treatment (P<0.01) in the two groups. After treatment, the scores of migraine symptom and VAS in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), while the MSQ score in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). The total effective rate was 92.0% (23/25) in the observation group, which was superior to 72.0% (18/25) in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Both heat-sensitive moxibustion and mild moxibustion can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms, improve the headache degree and life quality in patients with migraine without aura, the clinical efficacy of heat-sensitive moxibustion is superior to that of mild moxibustion.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To compare the clinical effect between <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019370\">observation</a> group (27 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d035061\">control group</a> (27 cases, 2 cases dropped off).

This study is based on RNA-Seq transcriptome sequencing technology to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of acupuncture-mediated regulation of the Leptin/AMPK signaling pathway on mitochondrial dysfunction-induced fatigue in breast cancer patients after chemotherapy. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 10 patients with post-operative chemotherapy for breast cancer were selected for transcriptome sequencing to screen the key molecular pathways involved in fatigue after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Besides, peripheral blood samples were collected from 138 post-operative chemotherapy patients with breast cancer to study the composite fatigue and quality of life scores. Flow cytometry was used to detect T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood-specific immune cells. In addition, a blood cell analyzer was used to measure peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and MSP-PCR was used to detect mitochondrial DNA mutations in peripheral blood leukocytes. RESULTS: Transcriptome down-regulated mRNAs. Leptin protein was confirmed as the key factor. Leptin was significantly higher in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients who developed fatigue after chemotherapy. Acupuncture treatment effectively improved post-chemotherapy fatigue and immune status in breast cancer patients, suppressed the expression of Leptin/AMPK signaling pathway-related factor and leukocyte counts, and significantly reduced the rate of mitochondrial DNA mutations in peripheral blood leukocytes. CONCLUSION: The Leptin/AMPK signaling pathway may be the key molecular pathway affecting the occurrence of fatigue after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Leptin may improve post-chemotherapy fatigue in breast cancer patients by activating AMPK phosphorylation and alleviating mitochondrial functional impairment.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> <a factor. <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d020738\">Leptin</a> was significantly higher and <a pathway may be the key molecular pathway affecting the occurrence of <a of University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.Jiang X; School of Basic Medical, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.Yu T; Department of Acupuncture II, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.Gao Y; School of Graduate, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.Sun Y; Department of Acupuncture II, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.Efficacy and safety of scalp acupuncture for poststroke depression: A meta-analysis and systematic review.Efficacy safety of acupuncture for poststroke depression: A meta-analysis and systematic review.School GraduateHeilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaSchool of Basic MedicalHeilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaDepartment of Acupuncture IIThe Second Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaSchool of GraduateHeilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaDepartment of Acupuncture IIThe Second Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaChinaSchool of GraduateHeilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaSchool of MedicalHeilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaDepartment of Acupuncture IIThe Second Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaSchool of GraduateHeilongjiang University of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang ProvinceChinaDepartment of Acupuncture IIThe Second Affiliated Hospital of Chinese MedicineHarbinHeilongjiang (PSD) is a common clinical poststroke complication that adversely affects cognitive and physical function rehabilitation. Scalp acupuncture (SA) can significantly improve somatic dysfunction and emotional disorder in stroke patients. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SA in the treatment of PSD. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Wan Fang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and China Biology Medicine databases until December 20, 2022, to identify randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of SA in the treatment of PSD. Two independent researchers screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a meta-analysis of the eligible literature using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 15.0 software. RESULTS: This study comprised a total of 14 randomized controlled trials, 10 of which used SA and 4 of which used SA in combination with electroacupuncture therapy. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that the effective rate of the SA group was significantly higher than that of the Western medicine group (relative risk = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.02, 1.16], P = .008). Moreover, compared to the Western medicine group, the SA group demonstrated significant improvements in Hamilton depression scale scores (mean difference = -2.29, 95% CI [-3.88, -0.70], P = .005) and neurological function deficit scores (mean difference = -3.06, 95% CI [-5.91, -0.21], P = .04). Additionally, the SA group has a lower incidence of adverse events than the western medicine group (relative risk = 0.12, 95% CI [0.05, 0.29], P < .00001). CONCLUSION: SA has superior efficacy and safety compared to Western medicine for PSD. These findings suggest that SA could be a promising alternative treatment for the assessed condition. Due to the limited number and quality of the included literature, the above conclusions must be confirmed by additional high-quality research.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> Poststroke <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d003863\">depression</a> acupuncture</a> (SA) id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> of PSD. <h2>METHODS:</h2> We controlled trials investigating the <a class=\"decs\" of SA of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015982\">bias</a> in the included studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

It is often cause mood and anxiety disorders that can seriously affect quality of life. Acupuncture has been claimed to have a role in treating neuropsychiatric disorders and is becoming increasingly popular. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is sufficient to support acupuncture in improving mental health in migraine patients. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the management of pain and mood disorders in patients with migraine. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wan Fang Data Knowledge Service Platform for reports, conferences and academic papers published before January 1, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including acupuncture, sham acupuncture and medication for migraine were included. Stata 16.0 software and Cochrane RoB2.0 were used for data processing and migration risk analysis. RESULT: Thirteen randomized controlled trials containing 1766 migraine patients were included in the present study, the results showed that compared with sham acupuncture and medication, acupuncture seemed to have advantage in improving SAS (WMD: -5.64;95% CI: 0.048) in migraine patients. And it seems to be more effective in improving MH (SMD: 0.77; 95% sham acupuncture and medication. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that, compared with Western medicine and sham acupuncture, acupuncture seems to be able to effectively improve anxiety and depression in migraine patients.And it may be more effective in improving SF36-mental health, VAS and MSQ than shame acupuncture or Western medicine. The results of this study need to be verified by higher quality RCTs.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008881\">Migraine</a> is a neurological moderate to severe <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d006261\">headache</a> and various neurological symptoms.

The effectiveness of \"Lifting Yang to Dredging Du Meridian Manipulation\" (LYDD) acupuncture in clinical treatment of ischemic stroke patients has been well-established. Nevertheless, its mechanism is still uncertain. METHODS: MCAO/R rat models at different time points of reperfusion (24, 36, 48 and 72 h) were constructed, and LYDD acupuncture treatment was performed. Zea-Longa score and TTC staining were used for assessing neurological impairment and cerebral infarct in rats, respectively. The pathological changes of cerebral tissue in each group were observed by HE and Nissl's staining. Cerebral tissue from each group was subjected to RNA-seq, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, and hub gene was identified based on the String database and MCODE algorithm. RESULTS: LYDD acupuncture treatment significantly reduced Zea-Longa score, dry-wet weight ratio, infarct area, inflammatory factor levels (IL-1\u00df and TNF-), cerebral lesions, number of Nissl body and neuronal apoptosis in the MCAO/R model at different time points of reperfusion. A total of 3518 DEGs were identified in the MCAO/R model compared to the control group, and 3461 DEGs were present in the treatment group compared to the MCAO/R model, and they may be implicated in neurotransmitter transmission, synaptic membrane potential, cell junctions, inflammatory response, immune response, cell cycle, and ECM. The expression trends of BIRC3, LTBR, PLCG2, TLR4 and TRADD mRNAs in the Hub gene were consistent with the RNA-seq results, and LYDD acupuncture treatment significantly inhibited translocation. <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000083242\">Ischemic stroke</a> is a permanent neurological impairment the narrowing or blockage of <a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015424\">reperfusion</a> (24, 36, h) were <a class=\"decs\" infarct</a> in cerebral <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014024\">tissue</a> in each group were observed <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013194\">staining</a>.

Our previous pilot study has indicated the potential of acupuncture to improve HRQOL and control cancer-related symptoms burden. This full-scale trial will focus on confirming the effect of acupuncture for patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: A multicenter, open-label, three-arm randomized controlled trial with 249 patients will be conducted in China. Patients will be randomly assigned, in a ratio of 1:1:1, to receive high-dose acupuncture (HA, 7 times each chemo-cycle for 3 cycles), low-dose acupuncture (LA, 3 times each chemo-cycle for 3 cycles), or no acupuncture. The acupoints prescription consisted of bilateral ST36, PC6, SP4, DU20, EX-HN3, Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gastric (FACT-Ga) and modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (mESAS) during the therapy will be recorded. Area under curve (AUC, 21 days/cycle \u00d7 3 cycles) and average trajectory of FACT-Ga and mESAS will be calculated. The primary outcome will be the differences in AUC of the FACT-Ga Trial Outcome Index (TOI) between HA and LA versus control groups. Secondary outcomes include AUCs and average trajectory of other FACT-Ga subscales and mESAS scores. DISCUSSION: This study aims to assess the effect of acupuncture and to compare the difference between LA and HA groups on HRQOL and symptom burden controlling in gastric cancer patients by an adequately powered trial.

Employing a bibliometric approach, we conducted a comprehensive review spanning three decades to assess the research landscape, advancements, and emerging trends in AT for vomiting. METHODS: We collected the related literature data from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) from 1990 to 2022. VOSviewer and R studio were used to perform the bibliometric analysis of AT on vomiting. The status of authors, countries, affiliations, annual publications, keywords, and journals were analyzed accordingly. RESULTS: The earliest relevant paper was published in 1990. Streitberger, K was the most productive author (7 records) and had significant influence (225 reference times, H-Index = 7). The United States had the highest publication count (224 records) and received the most recognition (9719 reference times, H-Index = 52). MEDICINE had the highest number of outputs (34 records), while ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA was the most cited journal (1045 reference times). The institution with the most works was Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (CDUTCM) (13 records), and the University of California, Los Angeles received the most citations (1252 reference times). Recent and future research hotspots included AT for postoperative vomiting and post-chemotherapy vomiting. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were the predominant study types. CONCLUSIONS: The current status and development prospects of AT for vomiting are shown in this study. In addition, this article provides valuable ideas and potential directions for future research activities.<h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015670\">Acupuncture treatment</a> (AT) limited <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015706\">bibliometric analyses</a> exist in this area.

METHODS: Nine biomedical databases were searched to April 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials of acupuncture and/or moxibustion used alone or as adjunct to guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy for the treatment of endometriosis. One reviewer extracted data and another verified the data. A random effects model was used to calculate mean differences. RESULTS: Fifteen trials involving 1018 patients met the inclusion criteria, but diversity in comparisons and outcome measures prevented meta-analysis. Compared to sham acupuncture, manual acupuncture was more effective at reducing dysmenorrhea VAS pain score (mean difference [MD] - 2.40, 95 % CI [- 2.80, - 2.00]; moderate certainty evidence), pelvic pain VAS score (MD - 2.65, 95 % CI [- 3.40, - 1.90]; high certainty evidence) and dyspareunia VAS scores (MD - 2.88, [- 3.83, - 1.93]), lessened the size of ovarian cyst (MD - 3.88, 95 % CI [- 7.06, - 0.70]), and improved quality of life. Compared to conventional therapy, manual acupuncture plus conventional therapy and warm needle alone resulted in greater improvements in quality of life than conventional therapy. Among the six studies that reported safety, fewer adverse events were reported in participants who received acupuncture or moxibustion. CONCLUSIONS: Low to moderate certainty evidence from single studies showed that manual acupuncture may improve pain-related symptoms and quality of life; however, there is insufficient evidence on the overall effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion for endometriosis.<h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2> This study aimed to examine the effect of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> on symptoms searched to to identify randomized of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> and/or <a id=\"d004715\">endometriosis</a>.

However, there is no systematic review to identify the efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with rehabilitation training for poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy for patients with PSCI. METHODS: We searched nine databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and Wan Fang, from their inception to September 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of acupuncture combined with rehabilitation on PSCI were included. The primary outcomes were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score, and Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score. The quality of the methodology was evaluated by Cochrane's risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed by Revman 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 18 RCTs involving 1654 patients were included. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was low. Pooled results demonstrated that acupuncture combined with rehabilitation could significantly improve the clinical efficacy of PSCI (OR=3.23, 95% to 7.96). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture combined with rehabilitation may produce better outcomes than rehabilitation alone in the treatment of PSCI. However, the safety of combined interventions is still unclear. Therefore, research with more rigorous study designs and RCTs with larger sample sizes is still needed.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> Accumulated evidence has proven that assess the <a Database (VIP), and Wan Fang, from their inception to September 2022.

There are many clinical-intervention methods for treating this condition, but thus far, the most effective method has not been determined. METHODS: We conducted a network meta-analysis by including random evidence of insomnia improvement in people over 18 years old, without other physical diseases. From January 1, 1990 to June 15, 2022, we searched multiple electronic databases for randomized controlled trials of different insomnia-related, clinical-intervention methods. R software was used to analyze 10 indices, in order to evaluate the effect of sleep improvement. Primary outcomes comprised Pittsburgh sleep quality-index (PSQI) scores and insomnia severity-index (ISI) scores. RESULTS: Finally, 122 randomized controlled trials were included in our study. For the PSQI scores, we found the sequence of intervention measures by effect to be as follows: electroacupuncture, acupuncture, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), essential oils, herbal medicine, traditional Western medicine, Tai Chi and Baduanjin, music, supplements, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and exercise. The results for ISI were similar to those for PSQI, but with slight differences. CONCLUSION: Our research results indicate that various measures have a certain effect on improving sleep, among which the effect of instruments is more prominent. The curative effect of placebo groups was better than that of blank control groups. There is essentially no statistical difference in detailed classification within the same intervention category.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d007319\">Insomnia</a> is clinical-intervention <a class=\"decs\" id=\"q000379\">methods</a> for treating this condition, but thus far, the most effective <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008722\">method</a> has not been determined. <h2>METHODS:</h2> We conducted a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000071076\">network meta-analysis</a> by including random evidence of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d007319\">insomnia</a> improvement in people over 18 years old, without other physical <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004194\">diseases</a>.

Because the disease is usually discovered in the late stage of complete degeneration of neurons, it can greatly delay treatment and even eventually lead to death. Therefore, the diagnosis of this disease is very challenging, and it is gratifying that substantial progress has been made in the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a diagnostic biomarker for this disease, and genetic and imaging tests have become part of routine protocols in clinical practice. In the cognition of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this disease belongs to deficiency in origin and excess in superficiality, which is always caused by deficiency of liver and kidney, deficiency of qi and blood, and is closely related to wind, fire, phlegm and blood stasis. A large number of studies have shown that TCM can effectively treat motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammatory response, and improve the quality of life of patients. Based on the pathophysiological mechanism of PD, this paper discusses the treatment of PD by TCM acupuncture combined with medicine based on the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004194\">disease</a> is usually discovered in the late stage of complete degeneration of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009474\">neurons</a>, it can greatly class=\"decs\" id=\"d004194\">disease</a> is very challenging, and it is gratifying that substantial progress has been made in the development of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d041623\">optical coherence tomography</a> (OCT) for this <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004194\">disease</a>, and genetic and imaging tests have become part of routine <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d017408\">protocols</a> in clinical in origin and excess in superficiality, which caused by number of studies have shown that TCM can effectively treat motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, combat <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d018384\">oxidative stress</a> id=\"d011788\">quality of life</a> of traditionnelle chinoise/m\u00e9thodesSyndromeingleshttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10378731https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.000000000003427810.1097/MD.00000000000342782023072820230811The authors have no SihuiHuang, QianhuiYang, QingqingPeng, XiaohuaWu, QiaofengLi S; Acupuncture and Moxibustion of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 610075, China.Huang Q; Acupuncture and Moxibustion College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 610075, China.Yang Q; Acupuncture and Moxibustion College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 610075, China.Peng X; Acupuncture and Moxibustion College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 610075, China.Wu Q; Acupuncture and Moxibustion College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 610075, China; Acupuncture & Chronobiology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, Sichuan 610075, China; Institute of Acupuncture and Homeostasis Regulation, Chengdu University of TradMicroRNAs as promising therapeutic agents: A perspective from acupuncture.MicroRNAs as promising therapeutic agents: A perspective from acupuncture.Acupuncture and Moxibustion CollegeChengdu University of Traditional Chinese MedicineChengduSichuan of Traditional Chinese of Traditional Chinese of Traditional Chinese University of Traditional Chinese & Chronobiology Key Laboratory of Sichuan ProvinceChengduSichuan 610075ChinaInstitute and Homeostasis RegulationChengdu University of Chinese MedicineChengduSichuan of Traditional Chinese of Traditional Chinese of Traditional Chinese University of Traditional Chinese & Chronobiology Key Laboratory of Sichuan ProvinceChengduSichuan 610075ChinaInstitute Acupuncture and Homeostasis RegulationChengdu University of Trad154652Pathol res. practPathology (Print)Pathol Res Pract;248: 154652, 2023 Aug. 2481618-0631en202307DEALEMANHAGERMANYALEMANIADEUSTCHLANDMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are gaining recognition as potential therapeutic agents due to their small size, ability to target a wide range of genes, and significant role in disease progression. However, despite their promising potential, nearly half of the miRNA drugs developed for therapeutic purposes have been discontinued or put on hold, and none have advanced to phase III clinical trials. The development of miRNA therapeutics has faced obstacles such as difficulties in validating miRNA targets, conflicting evidence regarding competition and saturation effects, challenges in miRNA delivery, and determining appropriate dosages. These hurdles primarily arise from the intricate functional complexity of miRNAs. Acupuncture, a distinct, complementary therapy, offers a promising avenue to overcome these barriers, particularly by addressing the fundamental issue of preserving functional complexity through acupuncture regulatory networks. The acupuncture regulatory network consists of three main components: the acupoint network, the neuro-endocrine-immune (NEI) network, and the disease network. These networks represent the processes of information transformation, amplification, and conduction that occur during acupuncture. Notably, miRNAs serve as essential mediators and shared biological language within these interconnected networks. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of acupuncture-derived miRNAs can help reduce the time and economic resources required for miRNA drug development and alleviate the current developmental challenges miRNA therapeutics face. This review provides an interdisciplinary perspective by summarizing the interactions between miRNAs, their targets, and the three acupuncture regulatory networks mentioned earlier. The aim is to illuminate the challenges and opportunities in developing miRNA therapeutics. This review paper presents a comprehensive overview of miRNAs, their interactions with acupuncture regulatory networks, and their potential as therapeutic agents. By bridging the miRNA research and acupuncture fields, we aim to offer valuable insights into the obstacles and prospects of developing miRNA therapeutics.<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d035683\">MicroRNAs</a> agents due to their small size, <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001076\">ability</a> to target a wide progression</a>.

METHODS: The rabbits were divided into blank control, model, acupotomy and electroacupuncture (EA) groups, with 12 rabbits in each. Modified Videman's method was used to prepare KOA model. The acupotomy and EA group were given indicated intervention for 3 weeks. The behavior of rabbits in each group was recorded. Subsequently, cartilage-subchondral bone units were obtained and morphological changes were observed by optical microscope and micro computed tomography. Compression test was used to detect the mechanical properties of subchondral bone, Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were applied to detect the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2-Smad1 (BMP2-Smad1) pathway in subchondral bone. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, rabbits in the KOA group showed lameness, knee pain, and cartilage degradation; the subchondral bone showed active resorption, the mechanical properties decreased significantly and the BMP2-Smad1 pathway downregulated significantly. Both acupotomy and EA intervention could increase the thickness of trabecular bone (Tb. Th), the bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and the thickness of subchondral bone plate, reduce the separation of trabecular bone (Tb. Sp), improve the maximum load and elastic modulus of subchondral bone, and effectively delay cartilage degeneration in KOA rabbits. This process may be achieved through upregulation the related proteins of BMP2-Smad1 pathway. The maximum load and elastic modulus of subchondral bone in the acupotomy group were slightly better than those in the EA group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupotomy could effectively protect cartilage by inhibiting abnormal bone resorption and improving mechanical properties of subchondral bone thorough the related proteins of BMP2-Smad1 pathway in KOA rabbits.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To investigate the effects Videman's <a class=\"decs\" prepare KOA model.

Hospitalization was recommended for the patient. After ruling out other possibilities, he was eventually diagnosed with nonketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea-hemiballismus. Intensive glycemic control was immediately started with subcutaneous injection and acupuncture treatment at \"governor vessel 13 acupoints\", and the involuntary movements completely disappeared on the ninth day of hospitalization. The pathophysiology of nonketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea-hemiballismus is unclear. Different patient histories lead to different brain tissue conditions, and relapses and uncontrolled blood glucose add difficulties to treatment. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, insufficient kidney essence leads to brain dystrophy and causes the symptoms of hemichorea-hemiballismus.

DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE(OVID), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database and Wanfang database from inception to 15 July 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in Chinese and English comparing acupuncture alone against sham acupuncture/placebo/no treatment/pharmacological therapy or comparing acupuncture plus pharmacological therapy against the same pharmacological therapy. Results were reported as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% CIs. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and the certainty of the evidence (CoE) with GRADE. : Main outcome measures : a) The rate of headache freedom (pain score=0) at 2h after the treatment; b) the rate of headache relief (at least 50% reduction of pain score); c) headache intensity at 2h after the treatment(study data from scales measuring pain intensity, including visual analogue scale, numerical rating scale) d) the improvement of headache intensity at 2h after the treatment; e) the improvement values of migraine-associated symptoms; f) adverse events. RESULTS: We included 21 RCTs from 15 studies with 1926 participants comparing acupuncture against other interventions. Comparing to sham acupuncture or placebo, acupuncture may result in an increase in the rate of headache freedom (RR 6.03, 95% CI 1.62 to 22.41, 180 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, low CoE) and the improvement of headache intensity (MD 0.51, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.85, 375 participants, 5 studies, I2=13%, moderate CoE) at 2 hours after treatment. It also may result on a higher rate of headache relief (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.49, 179 participants,3 studies, I2=74%, very low CoE) and greater improvement of migraine-associated symptoms (MD 0.97, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.61, 90 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, very low CoE) at 2 hours after treatment but the evidence is very uncertain. Meanwhile the analysis indicates acupuncture probably results in little to no difference in adverse events compared with sham acupuncture (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.87, 884 participants, 10 studies, I2=0%, moderate CoE). In acupuncture plus pharmacological intervention versus the same pharmacological intervention, acupuncture plus pharmacological therapy may result in little to no difference in the rate of headache freedom (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.42, 94 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, low CoE), the rate of headache relief (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.57, 94 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, low CoE) at 2 hours after treatment and adverse events(RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.92, 94 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, low CoE). However, it may result in a reduction in headache intensity (MD -1.05, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.62, 129 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, low CoE) and an increase in the improvement of headache intensity (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.95, 94 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, low CoE) at 2 hours after treatment compared with pharmacological therapy only. In comparison to pharmacological intervention, acupuncture may result in little to no difference in the rate of headache freedom (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.52, 294 participants, 4 studies, I2=22%, low CoE), the rate of headache relief (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14, 206 participants, 3 studies. I2=0%, low CoE) at 2 hours and adverse events (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.22, 294 participants, 4 studies, I2=0%, low CoE) after treatment. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acupuncture on the headache intensity (MD -0.07, 95% CI -1.11 to 0.98, 641 participants, 5 studies, I2=98%, very low CoE) and the improvement of headache intensity (MD -0.32, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.42, 95 participants, 2 studies, I2=0%, very low CoE) at 2 hours after treatment compared with pharmacological intervention. CONCLUSION: The body of evidence suggests that acupuncture may be more effective than sham acupuncture in the treatment of migraine. Acupuncture may also be as effective as pharmacological therapy. However, the certainty evidence across outcomes was low to very low and new high-quality studies can provide more clarity.

Despite that increasing clinical trials have indicated that acupuncture seems to be effective for insomnia disorder in the elderly, comparative efficacy and safety of different acupuncture methods for elderly individuals with insomnia disorder has been unclear. Therefore, this protocol outlined a plan to evaluate and rank the efficacy and safety of various acupuncture approaches for insomnia disorder in the elderly. METHODS: A systematic search of 8 bibliographic databases will be conducted from their inception to 18 June 2023, including Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, VIP Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). Randomized controlled trials investigating acupuncture methods for insomnia disorder in the elderly, published in English or Chinese will be included. The primary outcome is sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Two reviewers will independently perform study selection, data extraction and risk assessment of bias. The quality of included literatures will be appraised using Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2.0). ADDIS (Aggregate Data Drug Information System) V.1.16.8 will be used to conduct Bayesian network meta-analysis. The quality of evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation System (GRADE). DISCUSSION: In this study, the results will provide credible evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapies for elderly patients with insomnia disorder, assisting patients, physicians and clinical research investigators to select the most appropriate acupuncture method.

The pathophysiology of TS involves both genetic and environmental factors. Assessing TS pathogenesis is complex, and its underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. It is gratifying that the research in the past 5 years has brought new research progress on the genetic, neurophysiological and brain network changes of TS. However, despite the progress of research, the treatment methods and drugs of modern medicine are still unsatisfactory, and it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Traditional Chinese medicine, as a part of complementary and alternative medicine, has unique efficacy in the treatment of TS, and the safety of its treatment is also worthy of attention.

Our aim was to assess the efficacy of acupuncture versus RT for PSSP. METHODS: Six databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese biological medicine database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, and WAN FANG were searched from their inception to March 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with RT on PSSP were included. Primary outcome was shoulder pain. Secondary outcomes were upper limb motor function, activities of daily living (ADL), and adverse events (AEs). We used RevMan Version 5.3 to pool data. We conducted data synthesis of all outcomes using the random effects model. The methodological quality of all studies was assessed by 2 independent reviewers using the risk of bias (ROB) assessment tool. We also performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. We assessed the publication bias using the Egger test and funnel plots. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in qualitative synthesis, fifteen (83%) studies with 978 patients were included in meta-analysis (MA) because of the outcomes of 3 studies were inappropriate. Nine (50%) studies were considered as moderate to high quality according to ROB assessment tool. The effectiveness of acupuncture for patients with PSSP was similar to that of RT on shoulder pain alleviation (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.91 to 0.08, P = .10), improvement of upper limb motor function (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.80, 95% CI: -1.19 CI: -3.17 to (11%) studied reported no acupuncture-related AEs, and fourteen (78%) studies did not mention AEs resulting from acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is similar to RT in relieving shoulder pain, improving upper limb motor function and ADL in patients with PSSP. Either acupuncture or RT might be the optimal treatment of PSSP.

Clinically, acupuncture and moxibustion have been commonly applied to treat tinnitus in China, with potential therapeutic effects but with limitations in study methodology and high-quality evidence. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of either electroacupuncture alone or combined with warm needling for reducing tinnitus loudness and improving quality of life. METHODS: This a prospective, multicenter, assessor-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group, randomized, waitlist-controlled trial. In total, 90 patients will be randomly assigned to the electroacupuncture, electroacupuncture and warm needing, or waitlist control group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients in the 2 treatment groups will be treated twice a week for a total of 5 weeks. Patients in the control group will not receive treatment during the study period and will be informed that they can receive it for free after a 10-week waiting period. The duration of intervention for this study will be 5 weeks, followed by another 5 weeks for the posttreatment assessment. The primary outcome is the change in the visual analog scale score for tinnitus loudness from baseline until the end of treatment. The secondary outcome is the tinnitus discomfort assessment measured using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. Outcome parameters will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 5 and 10. Any adverse events will be observed and recorded for safety assessment. Linear mixed models for repeated measures will be applied in the analysis. DISCUSSION: Acupuncture and moxibustion could be potentially effective treatment alternatives for tinnitus. The study results will provide evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture with or without warm needling for tinnitus.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" study <a high-quality evidence.

OM treatment included acupuncture, herbal medicine, pharmacoacupuncture, and moxibustion. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar, 4 Korean medical databases (KoreaMed, Korean Studies Information Service System, Research Information Service System, and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System), and one Chinese database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched for articles published between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of OM interventions, single or combined with conventional treatments, on knee osteoarthritis were searched. The risk of bias and quality of evidence of the included studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methods, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 3911 relevant studies were retrieved and only 23 studies were included for systematic review. Most of the studies showed a significant effect on knee osteoarthritis. 21 studies comparing single OM treatment with conventional treatment were included in the meta-analysis. The effect size of standardized mean difference (SMD) was analyzed as a \"small effect\" with 0.48 (95% CI -0.80 to -0.16, Z = 2.98, P = .003). In addition, a meta-analysis of 4 studies comparing integrative treatment with conventional treatment showed a \"very large effect\" with 1.52 (95% CI -2.09 to -0.95, Z = 5.19, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that single OM treatment and integrative treatment significantly reduce pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis. However, there is a limited number of RCTs considering integrative treatment which implies more related RCTs should be conducted in the future.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> We aimed to evaluate the id=\"d020370\">knee osteoarthritis</a> and assess of evidence searched for articles published between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2021.

OF CHINAOBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of heat-tonifying needling on Keap1-Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 signal transduction pathway in knee synovium in rabbits with cold syndrome type rheumatoid arthritis (RA), so as to explore its mechanisms underl-ying improvement of RA. METHODS: New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into normal control, RA model, uniform reinforcing-reducing acupuncture, twisting reinforcing acupuncture and heat-tonifying acupuncture groups, with 6 rabbits in each group. The cold syndrome type RA model was established by subcutaneous injection of mixture fluid of ovalbumin and Freund's complete adjuvant at the shoulder-back as well as injection of mixture of ovalbumin and normal saline into knee-joint cavity combined with ice-compress freezing. Acupuncture stimulation (uniform reinforcing-reducing, or twisting reinforcing or heat-tonifying) was applied to bilateral \"Zusanli\"(ST36) for 1 min with the needle retained for 30 min, once a day for 7 consecutive days. The general conditions of rabbits in each group were recorded, the thermal pain threshold (TPT) and perimeter of knee joints was measured. Conditions of the synovium in the knee cavity, hydrops, blood flow signal, articular surface, and related muscles were observed by using a color Doppler ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, and the blood flow signals inside the synovium (image scores) were divided into 0 (no signals), I (1 or 2 dot-like signal), II (less than half) ad III (more than half). After H.E. staining, the pathological changes (0-3 points) were assessed according to the state of inflammatory cell infiltration, and hyperplasia of synovial matrix and coating cells. The expression levels of Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1 and GSH-PX1 mRNAs in the knee synovium were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, and the expression of knee synovial HO-1 protein was measured by Western blot. RESULTS: In comparison with the normal control group, the model group had a significant increase in the perimeter, pathological score, expression of Nrf2, HO-1 mRNAs and HO-1 protein (P<0.05), and an obvious decrease in the TPT, expression levels of Keap1 and GSH-PX1 mRNAs (P<0.05). Relevant to the model group, all the three acupuncture maneuvers reversed modeling-induced increase of perimeter and pathological score (P<0.05), decrease of TPT and expression expression HO-1 protein (P<0.05). The heat-reinforcing manipulation was significantly superior to uniform reinforcing-reducing and twirling reinforcing manipulations in up-regulating reinforcing-reducing and twirling reinforcing needling manipulations may relieve pain and improve pathological state in RA rabbits, which may be associated with their functions in raising the ability of anti-oxidative stress by regulating Keap1-Nrf2/ARE/ HO-1 signaling pathway, the therapeutic effect of heat-tonifying needling is superior to that of uniform reinforcing-reducing and twirling reinforcing needling.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the improvement of RA. <h2>METHODS:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d011817\">New Zealand rabbits</a> were randomly of mixture fluid of class=\"decs\" id=\"d006358\">heat</a>-tonifying) was applied to bilateral \"Zusanli\"(ST36) for 1 min with the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009339\">needle</a> retained for 30 min, once a day for 7 consecutive days.

METHODS: Thirty-five patients with PD (PD group), 34 patients with SD (SD group) and 35 healthy subjects (healthy group) were recruited. The compression method was used to examine the lower leg segment of the foot three yin meridians. Positive reactions(palpable skin changes, including cords, nodules, depressions) and tenderness of meridians and acupoints were recorded. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the tenderness severity of acupoints. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy group, the probability of positive reactions and tenderness in foot three yin meridians were higher in PD and SD groups (P<0.01,P<0.05). Compared with the PD group, the probability of positive reactions in Spleen and Liver Meridians were higher in the SD group, with higher probability of tenderness in Liver Meridian(P<0.05). The probability of positive reactions and tenderness in the Spleen Meridian of PD and SD groups was significantly higher than that in the Kidney Meridian (P<0.01), while the probability of tenderness in the Spleen Meridian of the PD group was significantly higher than that in the Liver Meridian (P<0.05). Positive reactions and tenderness were concentrated at Yinlingquan (SP9), Diji (SP8) and and Ligou (LR5) in Liver Meridian of PD and SD groups. In comparison with the PD group, the probability of positive reactions, tenderness and VAS score of SP8 and LR5 of the SD group were higher (P<0.05, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The positive reaction occurs most frequently in the Spleen Meridian, followed by the Liver Meridian, and least frequently in the Kidney Meridian. The acupoints with positive reaction are different between PD and SD, which suggests that the Spleen Meridian acupoints should be the main acupoints when treating the two kinds of dysmenorrhea, and acupoints should also be selected according to the meridian and acupoint examination results.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the meridian-<a and 35 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d064368\">healthy subjects</a> (healthy group) were recruited.

Studies have found that acupuncture-moxibustion plays an important role in wound healing. In this paper, we reviewed the mechanisms of acupuncture-moxibustion in promoting wound repair. Outcomes display that acupuncture-moxibustion has an action in promoting wound restoration by improving wound flow perfusion, promoting angiogenesis, increasing the number of fibroblasts and regulating collagen synthesis. In addition, acupuncture can effectively promote wound healing by controlling the release of inflammatory cytokines, up-regulating the expression of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-\u00df1, and affecting phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinase and advanced glycation end products/receptor for AGEs signaling pathways.

KINGDOMREINO UNIDOUKGREAT BRITAININGLATERRAENGLANDESCOCIASCOTLANDBACKGROUND: People align their beliefs and behaviors, including those related to health, increasingly along politically ideological lines. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether individual political orientation (PO) predicts the use of conventional (CM) and complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) across Europe. METHODS: We used cross-sectional samples representative of persons aged 15 and over from 19 European countries (ESS 2015; round 7; N = 35,572). We assessed PO based on participants' vote choice in the most recent national election, using expert ratings of party positioning along five Use of CM was defined as having consulted a general practitioner or specialist, and use of CAM as having used acupuncture, acupressure, Chinese medicine, homeopathy, herbal treatment, hypnotherapy, or spiritual healing. RESULTS: Participants with an anti-corruption PO were less likely to use CM and more likely to use CAM than other Europeans. Participants with a Green/alternative/libertarian PO were more likely to use CAM than others. Poorer health moderated the association between anti-corruption PO and CM, such that people in poor health tended to use CM regardless of their political leanings, but health status did not moderate the association between PO and CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that political and socio-cultural views are associated with how the European lay public engages with healthcare and complementary/alternative services, but the relevant boundary lines do not lie along the left-right dimension. People who preferred parties favoring expanded freedoms were more likely to use complementary/alternative services, but likely for other reasons than to seek cures for diseases in a traditional biomedical sense. Concerns about corruption among the lay public may be more relevant for conventional healthcare than has been recognized.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> People align their <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d003469\">beliefs</a> class=\"decs\" id=\"d006262\">health</a>, increasingly along politically ideological lines. <h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> We investigated whether individual political <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009949\">orientation</a> (PO) predicts the use of conventional id=\"d000529\">alternative medicine</a> (CAM) across <a id=\"d009272\">persons</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000368\">aged</a> 15 and over from European countries (ESS 2015; round 7; N = 35,572).

The three CAM strategies provided were massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic therapies. The evaluation team worked with a peer recovery support specialist and tribal evaluation intern to co-create a one-page, eight-question, fixed-response instrument based on previous work in the community. Surveys were collected by the peer support specialist post-session with individuals receiving CAM therapies. Surveys assessed self-reported impacts, reasons for attending CAM sessions, and mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional health before and after CAM sessions. Paired t-tests were used to examine significant differences in mean scores before and after CAM sessions. A total of 40 participants completed the survey between March 2021 and March 2022. The evaluation found a significant increase in the mean scores for all measured self-reported health ratings: physical, spiritual, emotional, and mental. The greatest increase observed was for physical health (M = 5.32, SD = 2.53) and physical health after (M = 8.38, SD = 1.60) based on self-report data; t(78) = 6.46, p = .0001. CAM sessions positively influenced participants; 83% (n = 33) reported being more hopeful about their overall health and wellness. The holistic approach demonstrated promising results and potential benefits of CAM on overall wellness and belonging.

UNIDOUKGREAT mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is the main subtype of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and has the highest risk of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) among all MCI subtypes. Episodic memory impairment is the early cognitive impairment of aMCI, which has become an important target for AD prevention. Previous clinical evidence has shown that acupuncture can improve the cognitive ability of MCI patients. This experiment aimed to observe the efficacy and neural mechanism of TiaoshenYizhi acupuncture on the episodic memory of patients with aMCI. METHODS: In this multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 360 aMCI participants will be recruited from six subcenters and randomly assigned to the acupuncture group, sham acupuncture group, and control group. The acupuncture group will receive TiaoshenYizhi (TSYZ) acupuncture, the sham acupuncture group will use streitberger sham acupuncture, and the control group will only receive free health education. Participants in the two acupuncture groups will receive real acupuncture treatment or placebo acupuncture three times per week, 24 sessions over 8 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome will be global cognitive ability. Secondary outcomes will be a specific cognitive domain, including episodic memory and execution ability, electroencephalogram, and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and the fourth and eighth weeks after randomization. Repeated measurement analysis of variance and a mixed linear model will be used to observe the intervention effect. DISCUSSION: The protocol will give a detailed procedure to the multicenter clinical trial to further evaluate the efficacy and neural mechanism of TiaoshenYizhi acupuncture on episodic memory in patients with aMCI. From this research, we expect to provide clinical evidence for early aMCI (MCI) and of conversion to impairment</a> of aMCI, which has become an important target for AD prevention.

METHODS: From January 1, 2018 to March 12, 2023, 7 electronic databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang Database, and CBM, were systematically searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trial studies. RESULTS: Meta analysis showed that traditional Chinese medicine combined with acupuncture can more effectively improve sex hormone levels compared to Western medicine alone, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in older patients (standardized mean difference 3.00; 95% confidence interval 29%). Compared to Western medicine alone, traditional Chinese medicine combined with acupuncture also had a better effect to increase ovulation rate (risk ratio [RR]: 2.46; 87%). The combination of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture also had better effects on quality of life (RR: 0.19; 0%), compared to Western medicine alone. CONCLUSION: This study shows evidence that traditional Chinese medicine formulas combined with acupuncture are an effective and safe treatment approach.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of acupuncture and laserpuncture on nociception and inflammation in mice compared to the effects of morphine and dexamethasone. 140 male Swiss mice were used. Treatment with acupuncture and laserpuncture were performed at the acupoints LI11, ST36, GB34, and BL60 in mice. To evaluate the effect of acupuncture and laserpuncture on nociception, the hot plate test and intraplantar formalin injection were used. The effect of acupuncture and laserpuncture on the inflammation was evaluated through carrageenan-induced paw edema. Thermographic analysis was also applied to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects. An antinociceptive effect (57%) was observed in treatments with acupuncture and laserpuncture, equivalent to the effect of morphine. Laserpuncture and acupuncture decreased paw edema by 25%. Acupuncture had an effect equivalent to dexamethason, basides reducing the neurogenic phase by 35% and the inflammatory phase in formalin-induced nociception by 40%, equivalent to the effects of morphine. In thermographic analysis, acupuncture, laserpuncture, morphine, and negative control had paw temperature of 27 \u00b0C, while formalin treatment was 31\u00b0C.

The practice is guided by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation theory and employs acupoint stimulation and heat to alleviate pain. Although prior research has shown that these are dependable methods for pain relief, the combined effect of the two techniques has not been described. In our research, we found that compared to using diclofenac sodium enteric-coated capsules alone, adding acupoint needle-embedding combined with ironing therapy was more effective for reducing pain levels at different stages after hemorrhoid surgery. Although this technique is efficient and commonly used in clinics, due to its invasive practice, acupoint needle embedding still carries risks relating to hospital-acquired infections and broken needles. Ironing therapy, on the other hand, can result in burns and connective tissue injuries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a standardized protocol for medical staff. Our protocol refines the traditional techniques and provides detailed instructions on patient preparation, operation techniques, and postoperative care to ensure the therapy is carried out safely and efficiently. By standardizing this therapy, this technique is expected to become an important complementary therapy for postoperative pain relief in hemorrhoids, which will significantly improve patients quality after for <a class=\"decs\" of the two <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008722\">techniques</a> has not been described.

METHODS: A total of 130 stroke patients after rt-PA thrombolytic were divided into an acupuncture group (58 cases, 1 case dropped off) and a non-acupuncture group (72 cases, 7 cases dropped off) according to whether they received acupuncture treatment. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match each group, with 38 patients in each group. The patients in the non-acupuncture group received rt-PA thrombolytic therapy and western medical basic treatment. In addition to the basic treatment, the patients in the acupuncture group received Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture at Shuigou (GV 26), bilateral Neiguan (PC 6), and ipsilateral Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Chize (LU 5), once a day for 14 days. The incidence of hemorrhagic transformation within 30 days after onset was compared between the two groups. The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) score and activities of daily living (ADL) score were observed at baseline and 30 days, 6 months, 1 year after onset in the two groups. The disability rate at 6 months and 1 year after onset was recorded, and safety was evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: The incidence of hemorrhagic transformation in the acupuncture group was 5.3% (2/38), which was lower than 21.1% (8/38) in the non-acupuncture group (P<0.05). At 30 days, 6 month, and 1 year after onset, the FMA and ADL scores of both groups were higher than those at baseline (P<0.01), and the scores in the acupuncture group were higher than those in the non-acupuncture group (P<0.01). The disability rate in the acupuncture group at 1 year after onset was 10.5% (4/38), which was lower than 28.9% (11/38) in the non-acupuncture group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups (P>0.05).

METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion were randomly divided into an observation group (30 cases, 1 case dropped off) and a control group (30 cases, 1 case was eliminated). The patients in the control group were treated with routine anesthesia. On the basis of the control group, the patients in the observation group were treated with buccal acupuncture at bilateral back point, waist point, and sacral point for 30 min per treatment. The first acupuncture was given before anesthesia induction, and then once a day postoperation for two days, totally 3 treatments. The dosage of sufentanil, the number of remedial analgesia, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting within 48 h after surgery were compared between the two groups; rest and motion visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 2 (T1), 8 (T2), 12 (T3), 24 (T4), and 48 (T5) h after surgery were observed; the quality of recovery-15 scale (QoR-15) at 24 and 48 h after surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: The dosage of sufentanil and the number of remedial analgesia within 48 h after surgery in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.01). There was no significant statistically difference in rest and motion VAS scores between the two groups in T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 (P>0.05).

METHODS: Sixty girls with IPP were randomly divided into an observation group (30 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a control group (30 cases, 2 cases were eliminated). The girls in the control group were treated with healthy diet and proper exercise for 12 weeks. On the basis of the treatment in the control group, the girls in the observation group were treated with acupuncture combined with auricular point sticking. The acupuncture was applied at Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Guanyuan (CV 4), Guilai (ST 29), etc., the needles were retained for 20 min, acupuncture was given twice a week (once every 3 days). The auricular point sticking was (CO18), Yuanzhong (AT2,3,4i), etc., twice a week. The treatment was given for 12 weeks. Before treatment, after treatment and in follow-up after 12 weeks of treatment completion, the Tanner stage of breast, serum contents of sex hormone (luteinizing hormone [LH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], estradiol [E2]) were ovarian volume, the number of follicles with diameter>4 mm, and the uterine volume were measured by abdominal color Doppler ultrasound. In addition, the safety of the observation group was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, the Tanner stage of breast in the observation group was improved after treatment and in follow-up (P<0.05); after treatment and in follow-up, the Tanner stage of breast in the observation group was better than that in the control group (P<0.05). Compared with before treatment, the serum levels of LH and E2 in the observation group were increased (P<0.05), and the volume of bilateral ovaries was larger (P<0.05) in follow-up. Compared with before treatment, the serum contents of LH, FSH and E2 in the control group were increased (P<0.05), the volume of bilateral ovaries was larger (P<0.05), and the number of follicles was increased (P<0.05) after treatment and in follow-up. The serum levels of LH, FSH and E2 in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), the volume of bilateral ovaries was smaller than that in the control group (P<0.05), and the number of follicles was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). Compared with before treatment, the uterine volume in the two groups was larger in follow-up (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups after treatment and in follow-up (P>0.05). During the treatment, 3 cases in the observation group had slight abdominal pain and subcutaneous blood stasis, without serious adverse reactions.

The articles of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) on stable COPD treated with acupuncture and moxibustion were searched electronically in CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science and Cochrane library. The search was conducted from the inception of the databases to March 20th, 2022. Data analysis was performed using R4.1.1, Stata16.0 and RevMan5.3 softwares. A total of 48 RCTs were included, involving 15 kinds of acupuncture and moxibustion interventions and a sample size of 3 900 cases. The results of network Meta-analysis showed that: \u00e2 For the forced expiratory volume in one second predicted (FEV1%), both the governor vessel moxibustion combined with conventional treatment (G+C therapy) and the yang-supplementing moxibustion combined with conventional treatment (Y+C therapy) obtained the better effect than that of the conventional treatment (P<0.05), and the G+C therapy was more effective compared with the thread-embedding therapy combined with conventional treatment (E+C therapy) and warm needling (P<0.05). \u00e2\u00a1 Concerning to COPD assessment test (CAT) score, the results indicated that the Y+C therapy, and the mild moxibustion combined with conventional treatment (M+C therapy) were more effective when compared with the conventional treatment (P<0.05), and the effect of the Y+C therapy was better than that of the E+C therapy (P<0.05). \u00e2\u00a2 Regarding six-minute walking distance (6MWD), the effect of acupuncture combined with conventional treatment (A+C therapy) was better than that of either the E+C therapy or the conventional treatment (P<0.05). The effect of the G+C therapy was optimal for improving FEV1%, the Y+C therapy obtained the best effect for improving CAT score, and A+C therapy was the most effective for improving 6MWD.

Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of both acupuncture and acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) in the management of obesity. However, the superiority of acupuncture combined with ACE over acupuncture alone remains a subject of controversy. This study aims to elucidate this controversy and provide robust clinical evidence. METHODS: A comprehensive search of relevant literature from the initiation to July 2022 was carried out in 8 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database, Web of Science, CBM Database, CNKI, Wan-fang Database, and VIP Database). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the treatment of simple obesity using acupuncture paired with ACE, with acupuncture alone as the control group. The pooled outcomes included body mass index (BMI), body weight (BW), %BF, waist circumference (WC), hip circumferences (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), therapeutic effective rate (TER), and adverse events. Two independent reviewers performed screening (using EndNote X9) and quality assessment (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool) for the included studies. with the software RevMan 5.3 was used to perform pooling of effect sizes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: A total of 20 trials involving 15 datasets (1616 participants) were included. The findings demonstrated significant improvements in outcome measures when acupuncture was combined with ACE, compared with acupuncture alone (BMI: MD = -1.49 kg/m2, 95% confidence = = = = OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.93-3.74, P < .01). Adverse effects were reported in 4 studies. CONCLUSION SUBSECTIONS: The results of this meta-analysis indicate that acupuncture combined with ACE is superior to acupuncture alone in the treatment of obesity, which is supported by the subgroup analysis. The assessment of efficacy may have been influenced by variations in study quality, potentially amplifying the observed effects. RCTs with larger sample sizes and improved methodological quality are needed to enhance the validity of the findings.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009765\">Obesity</a> is id=\"d009765\">obesity</a>.

However, the major drawback of IUD use is pain perception during the insertion of the device. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of bilateral LI4 acupuncture, administered before IUD insertion, on pain perception. METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled study. It was held in Community Health Center in Nigde, Turkiye. Individuals enrolled in the study were randomized into the acupuncture group and non-intervention group. Acupuncture group received bilateral LI4 acupuncture prior to IUD insertion while others received no interventions. After IUD insertion, 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) score was evaluated at 3rd minute and at 10th minute. Health care provider performing the IUD insertion and VAS evaluation was blind to randomization. RESULTS: In total 72 participants were included in the study. The VAS scores were significantly lower in the acupuncture group both at 3rd minute and at 10th minute (1.93 \u00b1 1.68; 3.81 \u00b1 \u00b1 1.10; p < 0.001 respectively). Linear regression analysis showed that acupuncture was a significant predictor for lowering VAS both at 3rd minutes and 10th minutes following IUD insertion (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized controlled clinical study investigating the effects of acupuncture on pain control during IUD insertion. The results demonstrated that bilateral LI4 acupuncture provides significant pain relief at both cervical and fundal components. Acupuncture prior to IUD insertion is a significant predictor of lowering overall VAS scores of individuals.

Acupuncture has become a popular treatment for stroke, with auricular acupuncture providing a new idea for stroke treatment. However, the neuromodulatory mechanism of auricular acupuncture in the brain is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of auricular acupuncture in the treatment of upper limb dysfunction and the activation of specific brain regions in stroke patients. Forty patients with stroke hemiplegia who met the nerf criteria were included in the experiment and randomly assigned into two groups (20 patients in each group): the auricular acupuncture group and the control group. Fugl-Meyer score (FMA) assessment of upper limb motor function, motor evoked potential (MEP) measurement, and functional near-infrared brain function imaging (fNIRS) data acquisition in the primary motor M1 area of the brain at rest were performed before and after treatment, respectively. It was found that: 1) after auricular acupuncture treatment, the patients in the auricular acupuncture group showed significantly greater peak MEP and significantly higher oxyhemoglobin content in the M1 region of the brain compared with the control group, with a significant activation effect (MEP: P-value = 0.032, t = -2.22; HbO2; f = 4.225, p = 0.046); 2) in the clinical efficacy assessment, the FMA score in the auricular acupuncture group after treatment (p = 0.0122, t = 2.769). The results suggest that auricular acupuncture has an ameliorative effect on upper limb motor deficits after stroke and that activation of the M1 region of the brain may be a key node in auricular acupuncture for treating upper limb dysfunction in stroke patients, a finding that emphasizes the potential for clinical application of auricular acupuncture therapy for stroke patients with potential mechanisms influencing the outcome.<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d020521\">Cerebral the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001921\">brain</a> is still unclear.

METHODS: 160 CSR subjects were recruited who met the inclusion criteria in our hospital from October 2019 to December 2021. The subjects were randomly divided into the experimental and control group, with 80 cases in each. The experimental group received ultrasound-guided injection acupotomy as a minimally invasive intervention therapy. The control group received ultrasound-guided selective nerve root block (SNRB). The Odom's criteria clinical curative effect, visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) were used to evaluate the outcome of subjects at several different points in time. RESULTS: At 30 min and 1 month after the end of treatment, there was no significant difference in any scores. However, after six months, the excellent and good rate was better in the experimental group compared to the control (RD = 0.175; 95% CI, 0.044-0.300, p = 0.009). The total effective rate was also better in the experimental group (RD = 0.126; 95% CI, 0.021-0.232, p = 0.018). In contrast, the VAS score (MD = -0.500; 95% CI, -1.000-0.000, p = 0.030) and NDI score (MD = -6.460; 95% CI, -11.067 to -1.852, p = 0.006) were lower in the experimental group compared to the control. The total SF-36 score was higher in the experimental group (MD = 7.568; 95% CI, 2.459-12.677, p = 0.004). minimally invasive interventional treatment of CSR has no significant difference in short-term curative effect compared with ultrasound-guided SNRB, but the data indicators are significantly better than the latter at 6 months after the end of the course of treatment, showing better long-term efficacy.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To explore the the inclusion criteria in our <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d006761\">hospital</a> from October 2019 to December 2021.

Acupuncture may be effective as an alternative and complementary medicine for BC. Nonetheless, rigorous trials investigating its efficacy are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study protocol is to determine whether acupuncture provides immediate relief of pain and associated symptoms in BC patients. METHOD: Eighty-six participants who aged from 18 to 60 years with BC will be recruited in the First People's Hospital of Longquanyi District, Chengdu (West China Longquan Hospital Sichuan University). All participants will be allocated into two treatment groups including acupuncture group and sham acupuncture group using a 1:1 ratio. Each group will only receive a single 30-min needle treatment while waiting for their test results after completing the routine examination for BC. The primary outcome of the study is to assess the change in pain intensity after the 30-min acupuncture treatment. The secondary outcomes of the study include the change in pain intensity at various time points, the degree of gastrointestinal symptoms at different time points, the level of anxiety experienced during pain episodes at different time points, the score of Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale-20 (PASS-20), the score of Fear of Pain Questionnaire-III (FPQ-III), and the score of Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), among others. DISCUSSION: The results of this research will provide substantial evidence regarding the efficacy of acupuncture in alleviating symptoms associated with BC.

The intestinal microbiome is altered in MCI and AD, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u00ce\u00b54 gene polymorphism is a risk factor for the progression of MCI to AD. This study aims to investigate the improvement in cognitive function of MCI patients with and without ApoE \u00ce\u00b54 due to acupuncture and the changes in gut microbiota community composition and abundance in MCI. METHODS: This randomized assessor-blind controlled study will enrol MCI patients with and without the ApoE \u00ce\u00b54 gene (n = 60/60). Sixty subjects with the ApoE \u00ce\u00b54 gene and 60 subjects without the ApoE \u00ce\u00b54 gene will be randomly allocated into treatment and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. Intestinal microbiome profiles will be evaluated by 16 S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples and compared between the groups. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is an effective method to improve cognitive function in MCI. This study will provide data on the relationship between the gut microbiota and the effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with MCI from a new angle.

However, the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of acute pharyngeal infections are controversial. To systematically assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in treating acute pharynx infections, thus providing a reference for clinical decision-making. METHODS: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical, clinical research registration platforms, gray literature, and reference lists of the selected studies from inception to October 30, 2022. The risk of bias assessment was performed using RevMan. The meta-analysis was performed using STATA with the Hedges' g value. We also performed a subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias detection using Harbord's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: We included 19 randomized controlled trials comprising 1701 patients, of which only one study had a high risk of bias. The primary outcome, i.e., the response rate, revealed that acupuncture was more effective than antibiotics. The secondary results revealed that the differences in the reduction of VAS scores, sore throat duration, and white blood cell counts were statistically significant in the acupuncture group compared with the antibiotic group. However, the difference in the modulation of the neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein levels was insignificant. Moreover, the acupuncture treatment resulted in a lower incidence of adverse events than the antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, acupuncture therapy for acute pharyngeal infections is safe and its response rate is superior to that of antibiotics. Acupuncture showed positive outcomes for alleviating the sore throat symptoms, shortening the sore throat duration, and improving the immune inflammation index. Nevertheless, owing to the limitations of this study, our conclusions should be interpreted with caution. More high-quality trials are warranted in the future for improving the methodology and reporting quality.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> Several clinical <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d058028\">reports</a> id=\"d000076889\">gray literature</a>, and reference lists of the selected studies from inception to October 30, 2022.

This study aims to confirm the clinical significance of acupuncture in the treatment of PDS . METHODS: This study only randomized controlled trials were included from the following databases: CNKI, Medline, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Clinical Trial. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using Revman 5.4.1 (Revman 2020), and all 12 included studies were considered to have a low risk of bias. This study used Stata 16.1 for data analysis, including sensitivity analysis and publication bias test. The quality of each study was evaluated with the Cochrane tool. The main outcomes included the overall therapeutic rate, the SID score, the HADS Score, The NDI score, and Side effects. RESULTS: This study identified a total of 1532 studies interested in the curative effect of acupuncture on Postprandial discomfort syndrome (PDS) and finally included a total of 12 studies with 1113 patients after identifying their abstracts, titles, and full text. The process of literature searches and identifying is shown in Figure 1 and data analysis showed that acupuncture is effective in the treatment of PDS and promotes the life quality of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed the effects of acupuncture on PDS from 5 aspects: overall therapeutic rate, SID, HADS, NDI, and side effects, overall therapeutic rate as primary outcome measure. Statistical analysis results showed that acupuncture has a significant effect on the treatment of PDS. In conclusion, it is an effective clinical treatment method. Also, the potential bias in the included studies, high-quality studies are needed to further confirm the possible side effects of acupuncture in treatment.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008516\">Traditional Chinese medicine</a> large clinical trials of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> have produced controversial results.

Acupuncture has shown potential in correcting hemiplegic gait patterns and improving motor function recovery after stroke. However, controversial findings and a lack of supportive evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for post-stroke hemiplegia. The intelligent gait analysis system provides a new perspective for the study of hemiparetic gait. This systematic review aims to collect relevant studies and critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in alleviating gait disturbance of post-stroke hemiplegia based on quantified gait parameters. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane stroke group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, AMED, three Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literatures database (CBM), National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wan fang Digital Periodicals), four trails registries (The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, and The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry) will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for gait disturbance in post-stroke patients. No restrictions on language or publication status. The primary outcomes are gait temporospatial parameters (eg, step length, stride length, step width, step frequency (cadence), walking speed, etc), and gait kinematic parameters (eg, hip peak flex/extend angle, knee peak flex/extend angle, ankle peak dorsi/plantar-flexion angle, etc). We will assess bias using the approach recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesise the evidence for each outcome measure. The 2 test and I2 statistic will be used for assessing heterogeneity between studies.

Maigne's syndrome (MS), commonly referred to as thoracolumbar junction syndrome, is a condition characterized by pain resulting from nerve entrapment, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study presents a series of six case reports wherein patients diagnosed with MS received acupuncture treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: Six individuals with LBP were included in the study, and all were diagnosed with MS. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis was confirmed in all six patients through pinch-roll and thoracic vertebrae compression tests, indicating the presence of thoracolumbar junction syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture treatment was administered to all patients, primarily targeting the T11-L2 facet joints, with additional acupoints selected based on the specific nerve entrapment of MS including the superior cluneal, subcostal, and iliohypogastric nerves. OUTCOMES: Following acupuncture therapy, all patients reported improvements in their LBP symptoms, while four patients also exhibited amelioration in their thoracic vertebrae compression test results. LESSONS: These findings underscore the significance of promptly diagnosing the underlying cause of LBP and suggest that acupuncture may be an effective approach in alleviating MS-related pain.RATIONALE Diagnosing the back id=\"d010361\">patients</a>.

The effect of acupuncture on vascular dementia models is ambiguous, and there is controversy about whether acupuncture has a placebo effect. Oxidative stress and inflammation are the most essential mechanisms in preclinical studies of vascular dementia. However, there is no meta-analysis on the mechanism of vascular dementia in animal models. It is necessary to explore the efficacy of acupuncture through Meta-analysis of preclinical studies. METHODS: Three major databases, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science (including medline), were searched in English until December 2022.The quality of the including literature was assessed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Review Manager 5.3 was used to statistically summarize the included studies and the statistical effect values were expressed by SMD. The outcomes included: behavioral tests (escape latency, pathological IL-1\u00df, IL-6). RESULTS: total of 31 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the escape latency, the contents of ROS, MDA, IL-1\u00df, and IL-6 were decreased, and the contents of SOD and Nissl-positive neurons were increased in the acupuncture group as compared with the non-group (P\u00e2 <\u00e2 .05). Compared with the impaired group, the acupuncture group also had the above advantages (P\u00e2 <\u00e2 .05). In addition, the acupuncture group also increased the number of crossings and GSH-PX content, and decreased the expression of TUNEL-positive neurons and TNF- (P\u00e2 <\u00e2 .05). CONCLUSIONS: From behavioral tests to slices and pathological markers in animal models of vascular dementia, it can be proved that acupuncture is effective in targeting oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory damage, and acupuncture is not a placebo effect. Nevertheless, attention needs to be paid to the gap between animal experiments and clinical applications.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> id=\"d015140\">vascular dementia</a> models there is in preclinical studies of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015140\">vascular dementia</a>.

Increasing studies support the effectiveness of acupressure in managing preoperative anxiety. However, the magnitude of acupressure's positive association with preoperative anxiety is still unclear due to a lack of rigorous evidence synthesis. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of acupressure on preoperative anxiety and physiological parameters amongst adults scheduled for elective surgery. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Search terms were combined for acupressure and preoperative anxiety in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang Data Knowledge Service Platform to search for eligible randomised controlled trials from the inception of each database through September 2022. METHODS: Pairs of researchers independently screened and extracted data from included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool Version 2.0. Meanwhile, random-effects meta-analysis of overall effects and prespecified subgroup (i.e., surgery types, intervention providers, and acupressure stimulation tools) was conducted using Review Manager Software 5.4.1. Meta-regression was performed to explore study-level variables that may contribute to heterogeneity using STATA 16. RESULTS: Of 24 eligible randomised controlled trials, there were a total of 2537 participants from 5 countries contributed to this synthesis. When comparing acupressure with usual care or placebo, acupressure showed a large effect size for preoperative anxiety (SMD\u00e2\u00af=\u00e2\u00af-1.30; 95%CI\u00e2\u00af=\u00e2\u00af-1.54 to -1.06; p\u00e2\u00af<\u00e2\u00af0.001; I2\u00e2\u00af=\u00e2\u00af86%). The significant mean reduction of heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was I2\u00e2\u00af=\u00e2\u00af78%), respectively. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed significant differences in surgery types and acupressure stimulation tools, whilst the intervention providers (i.e., healthcare professionals and self-administered) showed no statistically significant difference for acupressure therapy. None of the predefined participants and study-level characteristics moderated preoperative anxiety through meta-regression. CONCLUSION: Acupressure appears efficacious as a therapy for improving preoperative anxiety and physiological parameters amongst adults with elective surgery. Self-administered acupressure, which is effective with a large effect, may be considered as an evidence-based approach to managing preoperative anxiety.

METHODS: A total of 72 patients with PMI of kidney-yin deficiency were randomized into an observation group (36 cases, 1 case dropped off) and a control group (36 cases, 1 case dropped off). Acupuncture was applied at Baihui (GV 20) and bilateral Shenshu (BL 23), Taixi (KI 3), Anmian (Extra) in the observation group, while sham acupuncture of shallow needling at non-acupoints was applied in the control group. The treatment was required once every other day, 3 times a week for 10 times in the two groups. Before and after treatment, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the subjective sleep quality, and polysomnography (PSG) was used to monitor the objective sleep quality in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, hypnotic, daytime dysfunction and total score of PSQI were decreased compared with those before treatment in the observation group (P<0.01), the scores of sleep duration, sleep efficiency and total score of PSQI were decreased compared with those before treatment in the control group (P<0.05); the scores of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, hypnotic and total score of PSQI in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the sleep time was prolonged, the sleep efficiency was improved, the sleep latency and the awake time after falling asleep were shortened, the arousal awake index was reduced (P<0.01) when PSG indexes were monitored, and the percentage of non-rapid eye movement sleep period 1 (N1%) was decreased while the percentage of non-rapid eye movement sleep period 3 (N3%) was increased (P<0.05) compared with those before treatment in the observation group; there was no statistical difference in the PSG indexes compared with those before treatment in the control group (P>0.05). After treatment, compared with the control group, the sleep time was prolonged, the sleep efficiency was improved, the sleep latency and the awake time after falling asleep were shortened, the arousal awake index and N1% were decreased in the observation group (P<0.01).

METHODS: Sixty patients with post-stroke dysphagia were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, with 30 cases in each group. The neuromuscular electrical stimulation was adopted in the control group. Besides the treatment as the control group, in the observation group, the four-step acupuncture therapy for opening orifices and benefiting throat was supplemented. Step 1: the three areas of scalp acupuncture on the affected side were stimulated. Step 2: pricking method was operated on the posterior pharyngeal wall. Step 3: bleeding technique was operated at Jinjin (EX-HN 12) and Yuye (EX-HN 13). Step 4: deep insertion of needle was operated at three-pharynx points. The needles were retained for 30 min at the three areas of scalp acupuncture and the three-pharynx points. The intervention of each group was delivered once daily, 6 times a week, at the interval of 1 day. One course of treatment was 1 week and 4 successive courses were required. The rating of Kubota water swallow test, the score of standardized swallowing assessment (SSA) and the rating of Rosenbek penetration- aspiration scale (PAS) were observed before and after treatment in patients of the two groups. The incidence of clinical complications and clinical efficacy were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with those before treatment, the rating of Kubota water swallow test, the scores of SSA and the rating of PAS of patients in the two groups were decreased after treatment (P<0.01), and the values of the observation group were lower than those of the control group after treatment (P<0.05).

The intervention was delivered for 30 min each time, once daily, lasting 3 weeks consecutively. Using lung function detector, the airway resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) of the lungs were detected. The histomorphology of lung tissues was detected with HE staining and Masson staining, and the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-\u00df1 and Smad3 in lung tissues was detected with the real-time PCR and Western blot methods. RESULTS: Compared with the blank group, RL was increased and Cdyn was decreased in the rats of the model group (P<0.01); and RL was reduced and Cdyn was increased in the AAF group and the AAK group when compared with those in the model group (P<0.01, P<0.05). The rats of the model group had bronchial lumen stenosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen fibre hyperplasia and thickened smooth muscle in the lung tissues when compared with those in the blank group; and in comparison with the model group, all of the above morphological changes were attenuated in the AAF group and the AAK group. Besides, these morphological changes of the lung tissues were more alleviated in the AAF group when compared with those in the AAK group. In comparison with the blank group, the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-\u00df1 and Smad3 of the lung tissues was increased in the model group (P<0.01), and it was reduced in the AAF group and the AAK group when compared with that in the model group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The mRNA expression of TGF-\u00df1 and Smad3 was lower in the AAF group when compared with that in the AAK group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at 1) or \"Kongzui\" (LU 6)+\"Yuji\" (LU 10) reduces the airway remodeling in the rats with asthma, which may be related to the down-regulation of mRNA and protein expression of TGF-\u00df1 and Smad3.

MSCs transplantation has great potential for the treatment of tissue damage caused by early stage inflammatory cascade reactions of IS, but its actual transformation is limited by various factors. How to improve the homing efficiency of MSCs is the primary issue to enhance its efficacy. As such, the possible mechanisms of acupuncture and MSCs transplantation in inhibiting inflammatory cascade reactions induced by IS are explored by reviewing literature, and a hypothesis that acupuncture could promote the secretion of stromal (CXCR4) axis, thereby improving the homing efficiency of MSCs transplantation, exerting its neuroprotective function, and improving the bed transformation ability, is proposed.The scientific basis of of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014024\">tissue</a> damage caused by early stage inflammatory cascade reactions of IS, but its actual transformation is limited by various factors.

METHODS: Seventy-six patients with lumbar muscle strain with cold and dampness were randomly divided into an acupuncture + cupping group (A + C group, 38 cases) and a cupping + acupuncture group (C + A group, 38 cases, 1 case dropped off). In the A + C group, cupping therapy was delivered 10 min after the end of treatment with acupuncture, while in the C + A group, acupuncture therapy was exerted 10 min after the end of treatment with cupping. Acupuncture was applied to Mingmen (GV 4), Yaoyangguan (BL 25), Weizhong (BL 40) and Yanglingquan (GB 34), and the needles were retained for 30 min in each intervention. Flash cupping was operated along the bilateral sides of the lumbar spine for 3 min, and the cups were retained for 10 min at bilateral Shenshu (BL 23), Dachangshu (BL 25) and ashi points. The intervention was delivered once every two days, 3 times weekly, for 3 weeks totally in each group. The scores of visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI), TCM syndrome score and the mean temperature of the lumbar region before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. The safety and the clinical efficacy were assessed for the interventions of the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with the values before treatment, except for the sleep score of ODI, the VAS scores, ODI scores and TCM syndrome scores were decreased after treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05); while the mean temperature of the lumbar region was increased (P<0.01) in both groups. After treatment, the VAS score and the pain score of ODI in the C + A group were lower than those in the A + C group (P<0.05). The incidence rate of adverse reactions of the C + A group was lower than that of the A + C group (P<0.01). The effective rate in the A+C group was 92.1% (35/38), that in the C+A group was 94.6%(35/37), there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P>0.05).

METHODS: A total of 90 patients with FD were randomly divided into a 3-time acupuncture treatment per week group (3-A group, 31 cases, 2 cases dropped off), a 1-time acupuncture treatment per week group (1-A group, 30 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a control group (29 cases, 2 cases dropped off). In the two acupuncture groups, the acupoints were Zhongwan (CV 12) and bilateral Tianshu (ST 25), Neiguan (PC 6), Liangqiu (ST 34), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Zusanli (ST 36) and Taichong (LR 3), stimulated 3 times a week and once a week, respectively; and the treatment was given consecutively for 4 weeks. In the control group, no intervention was adopted, but the compensatory therapy was provided after the end of follow-up. The scores of the symptom index of dyspepsia (SID), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were compared among the 3 groups before treatment, after 4 weeks of treatment and in 4 and 8 weeks after treatment completion separately. The score of Nepean dyspepsia life quality index (NDLQI) was evaluated before treatment, after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment and in 4 and 8 weeks after treatment completion. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment and in 4 and 8 weeks after treatment completion, the scores of SID, SAS and SDS were all reduced in the 3-A group and the 1-A group when compared with the scores before treatment (P<0.000 1, P<0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, the scores of SID, SAS and SDS in the two acupuncture groups were lower than those in the control group (P<0.000 1). After 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, the increased values of NDLQI score in the two acupuncture groups were all higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). In 4 and 8 weeks after treatment completion, the scores of SID, SAS and SDS in the 3-A group were lower than those in the 1-A group (P<0.001, P<0.05), and the increased values of NDLQI score in the 3-A group were higher than those in the 1-A group (P<0.000 1). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture given 3 times per week is superior to the treatment given once per week in the aspects of relieving the clinical symptoms, improving the quality of life and regulating the emotional state in patients with FD. This efficacy is persistent for 8 weeks after treatment completion.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To compare the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d016896\">clinical efficacy</a> id=\"d015670\">acupuncture treatment</a> per week group off), a 1-<a id=\"d013995\">time</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015670\">acupuncture treatment</a> per week group (1-A group, 30 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d035061\">control group</a> (29 cases, 2 cases dropped off). two <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> groups, the bilateral 25), Neiguan (PC 6), Liangqiu (ST 34), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Zusanli (ST 36) and Taichong (LR 3), stimulated 3 times a week and once a week, respectively; and the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> was given consecutively for 4 weeks.

Herein, we report two cases of iatrogenic pneumothorax after acupuncture. These points indicate that physicians should be aware of these risk factors through history-taking before acupuncture. Chronic pulmonary diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, lung cancer, pneumonia, and thoracic surgery, may be associated with a higher risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax after acupuncture.

But its effect on dynamic brain networks remains unclear. This study is aimed at investigating how acupuncture affected the brain's dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) after ischemic stroke. Methods: We conducted a single-center, randomised controlled neuroimaging study in ischemic stroke patients. A total of 53 patients were randomly divided into the true acupoint treatment group (TATG) and the sham acupoint treatment group (SATG) at a ratio of 2 : 1. Clinical assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed on subjects before and after treatment. We used dFNC analysis to estimate distinct dynamic connectivity states. Then, the temporal properties and strength of functional connectivity (FC) matrix were compared within and between the two groups. The correlation analysis between dynamic characteristics and clinical scales was also calculated. Results: All functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices were clustered into 3 connectivity states. After treatment, the TATG group showed a reduced mean dwell time and found attenuated FC between the sensorimotor network (SMN) and the frontoparietal network (FPN) in state 3, which was a sparsely connected state. The FC between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN) was higher after treatment in the TATG group in state 1, which was a relative segregated state. The SATG group preferred to increase the mean dwell time and FC within FPN in state 2, which displayed a local tightly connected state. In addition, we found that the FC value increased between DAN and right frontoparietal network (RFPN) in state 1 in the TATG group after treatment compared to the SATG group. Correlation analyses before treatment showed that the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) lower score was negatively correlated with the mean dwell time in state 3. FMA score showed positive correlation with FC in RFPN-SMN in state 3. FMA-lower score was positively correlated with FC in DAN-DMN and DAN-RFPN in state 1. Conclusions: Acupuncture has the potential to modulate abnormal temporal properties and promote the balance of separation and integration of brain function. True acupoint stimulation may have a more positive effect on regulating the brain's dynamic function. Clinical Trial Registration.

METHODS: Twenty-eight SD rats were randomly divided into normal, model, acupuncture and sertraline groups, with 7 rats in each group. The PTSD model was established by single prolonged stress method. The next day after modeling, acupuncture was applied to \"Baihui\" (GV20) and \"Dazhui\" (GV14) of rats in the acupuncture group for 10 min, once a day for 7 days. Sertraline (10 mg/kg) was given by gavage to rats of the sertraline group daily for 7 days. The behavioral changes of rats were detected by elevated cross maze experiment and new object recognition experiment. The expression levels of PERK,phosphorylated(p)-PERK, eIF2, p-eIF2 and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) proteins in hippocampus were detected by Western blot. The ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons was observed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the percentage of times and retention time of entering the open arm of the elevated cross maze experiment, and new object recognition index were significantly decreased (P<0.01); the expression levels of p-PERK, p-eIF2 and ATF4 proteins in hippocampus were significantly increased (P<0.05) of rats in the model group. Compared with the model group, the percentage of times and retention time of entering the open arm, and new object recognition index were significantly increased (P<0.05\u00ef\u00bcP<0.01), the expression levels of p-PERK, p-eIF2 and ATF4 proteins in hippocampus were significantly decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01) of rats in the acupuncture and sertraline groups; the expression level of eIF2 protein was significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the sertraline group. Hippocampal neurons in the model group were damaged, the rough endoplasmic reticulum showed severe dilation, the mitochondrial cristae showed reduction or mild cavitation; compared with the model group, hippocampal neurons structural damage and the rough endoplasmic reticulum dilation were alleviated\u00ef\u00bc and only some of the mitochondrial cristae decreased in the acupuncture and sertraline groups. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can alleviate the anxiety behavior as well as the recognition and memory ability of PTSD rats, and its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of hippocampus PERK/eIF2 signaling pathway and the reduction of hippocampal neuron damage caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe group.

It is believed that scalp acupuncture can modulate the function of certain brain areas through stimulation of specific scalp areas corresponding to the related cortical areas, thereby providing therapeutic benefits for a wide scope of diseases. In recent decades, there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the brain circuitry of many brain-related disorders through cutting-edge brain imaging techniques. Unfortunately, these findings have not been incorporated into scalp acupuncture protocols. Thus, identifying surface cortical regions associated with these disorders would expand stimulation target selections of scalp acupuncture. In this manuscript, we aim to 1) propose the idea and methods to incorporate neuroimaging findings and scalp acupuncture; and 2) introduce scalp acupuncture stimulation targets for some psychological and neurological disorders based on recent brain imaging findings.

METHODS: Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model and acupuncture groups, with 12 rats in each group. The depression model was induced by CUMS stress for 21 days. After the depression model was successfully established, the rats in the acupuncture group received manual acupuncture stimulation at \"Baihui\" (GV20) and \"Yintang\" (GV24+) for 20 min, once daily for 21 days. Open field test, sugar water preference test and forced swimming test (FST) were used to evaluate the behavioral changes. TMT quantitative proteomics was used to obtain differential proteins in the hippocampus tissue and related signaling pathways enrichment was analyzed, followed by verifying differential protein pathways by using Western blot and immunofluorescence methods. RESULTS: Behavior tests showed that on the 21st and 42nd days, the horizontal crossing times, walking distance and percentage of sugar water consumption were significantly decreased (P<0.05), while the immobility time of FST was obviously increased (P<0.05) in the model group relevant to the control group. After acupuncture intervention, the horizontal crossing times, walking distance and percentage of sugar water consumption were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the immobility time was apparently decreased (P<0.05) in the acupuncture group relevant to the model group. The TMT quantitative proteomics of hippocampus tissue displayed that of the 71 differential proteins (model group vs control group), 32 was down-regulated and 39 up-regulated in the model group; and among the above 71 differential proteins, there were 20 differential proteins between acupuncture group and model group, 15 down-regulated and 5 up-regulated in the acupuncture group (vs the model group). The expression of Mapk8ipl was up-regulated in the model group (vs the control group) and down-regulated in the acupuncture group (vs the model group). GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that these acupuncture-related differential proteins mainly involve the regulation of blood coagulation system, MAPK signaling pathway, etc. We selected the MAPK/JNK signaling pathway related to depression for verification. Western blot showed that the expression levels of c-JUN and phosphorylated c-JUN terminal kinase (p-JNK) proteins in the hippocampus were up-regulated in the model group relevant to the control group (P<0.05); while the expression levels of c-JUN and p-JNK proteins in the hippocampus were down-regulated in the acupuncture group relevant to the model group (P<0.05). The results of immunofluorescence showed that the mean fluorescence intensity of c-JUN and p-JNK in hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG regions was increased in the model group relevant to the control group (P<0.05), while the mean fluorescence intensity of c-JUN and p-JNK in hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG regions was obviously lower in the acupuncture group than in the model group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture for \"regulating qi and relieving depression\" can significantly improve depression-like behavior in CUMS-induced depression model rats, which involves multiple targets and multiple pathways, including MAPK/JNK signaling.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To investigate the possible class=\"decs\" id=\"d003863\">depression</a> in class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> groups, with 12 The <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d003863\">depression</a> model was induced by CUMS stress for 21 days.

METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation, model, conventional acupuncture(CA) and paired points(PP) groups (with 8 rats in each group). The LDH model was established by injection of autologous suspension made from rats' own nucleus pulsus into the epidural space. Rats in the CA group received acupuncture treatment at bilateral \"Weizhong\"(BL40), \"Dachangshu\"(BL25) and \"Shenshu\"(BL23), while rats in the PP group received acupuncture at bilateral SI3 and GB30, 30 min each time, once daily for 14 consecutive days. The thermal pain threshold of bilateral hind feet of rats was detected by thermal pain stimulator. The contents of serum IL-1\u00df, IL-6 and IL-8 of rats were detected by ELISA. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression of HMGB1 protein in the lumbar(L)5 SNT of rats. The relative expression of HMGB1 mRNA in L5 SNT was determined by qPCR. HE staining was used to observe the morphological changes of L5 SNT. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group, the thermal pain threshold of bilateral hind feet in the model group was decreased (P<0.05); compared with the model group, the thermal pain threshold of bilateral hind feet in the CA group and the PP group were increased (P<0.05). The expressions of HMGB1 protein and mRNA in L5 SNT, and the contents of serum IL-1\u00df, IL-6 and IL-8 of rats in the model group were significantly increased(P<0.000 1, P<0.001) in contrast to the sham operation group. The expressions of HMGB1 protein and mRNA in L5 SNT, and the levels of serum IL-1\u00df, were significantly decreased P<0.001, P<0.05) in the CA and PP group, in comparison with those of the model group. Compared with the CA group, the above indexes of rats in the PP group recovered more significantly (P<0.05,P<0.001, P<0.01,P<0.000 1). The histomorphological results showed scattered and various-sized nerve fibers, vacuolation, a large number of disintegrating myelin sheath and lysed Schwann cells in the model group. Myelin sheaths regeneration, regularly-arranged nerve fibers were seen in the CA group and the PP group, with more obvious histopathological recovery observed in the PP group than the CA group. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture intervention inhibites the expressions of HMGB1 protein and mRNA in rats with LDH, and further reduces the production of IL-1\u00df, IL-6 and IL-8, which is beneficial to inflammatory response inhibition and pain alleviation. The therapeutic effect of the PP group is more obvious than that of the CA group.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the effect of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> at \"Houxi\"(SI3) and the mechanisms of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> at this paired points LDH. <h2>METHODS:</h2> SD <a class=\"decs\" into operation, model, conventional <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a>(CA) and paired points(PP) groups (with 8 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> in each group).

OF CHINAOBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of \"Tiaoshen Tongluo\" acupuncture (TTA) at \"Dingzhongxian\" (MS5) and right \"Dingpangxian\" (MS8) on neurological injury, muscle tension and neurotransmitters through nuclear transcription factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway in spastic rats after stroke, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying relief of post-stroke spasm (PSS). METHODS: A total of 90 male SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, i.e. sham operation, PSS model, medication, non-acupoint acupuncture, TTA, TTA+ML385 groups, with 15 rats in each group. The PSS model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. After modeling, rats of the medication group were treated by gavage of baclofen (0.4 mg/kg), once daily for 7 days. For rats of the non-acupoint acupuncture group, the spot about 10 mm above the iliac crest and below the armpit of the affected side was needled, and for those of the TTA group and TTA+ML385 group, EA stimulation (1 mA, 2 Hz/15 Hz) was applied to MS5 and right MS8 for 10 min, once daily for 7 consecutive days. Intraperitoneal injection of ML385 \u00ef\u00bc\u00bb a specific nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) inhibitor, 30 mg/kg\u00ef\u00bc\u00bd was given to rats of the TTA+ML385 group before TTA was performed. The rats' neurological deficit score (0-4 points) was evaluated by referring to Zea Longa's methods and the muscular spasm degree of the quadriceps femoris of the left hindlimb (0-4 points) assessed by using Ashworth scale (MAS). The muscular tension of the left quadriceps femoris was measured by using a tension sensor, and Hoffman (H)-reflex response and M and H waves of electromyogram of the muscle between the metatarsals of the left foot were measured using an electrophysiological recorder. The cerebral infarction volume was measured after 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) of (Gly), glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) of the right cortical infarct area were detected by using high performance capillary electrophoresis, and the contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) were detected by fluorescence spectrophoto-metry, as well as the level of ROS in the right cerebral cortical infarction tissues was detected by dihydroethidium staining. The expression levels of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) proteins in the infarcted cerebral area were detected using Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group, the neurological deficit score, MAS score, percentage of cerebral infarction volume, Hmax/Mmax ratio, contents of Glu and Asp and ROS level were significantly increased (P<0.001), whereas the muscle tone, stimulation threshold for inducing H-reflex, GABA, Gly, 5-HT, DA and NE contents, cerebral Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression levels were apparently decreased (P<0.001) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the neurological deficit score, MAS score, percentage of cerebral infarction volume, Hmax/Mmax ratio, contents of Glu, Asp and ROS levels were decreased (P<0.001), and the muscle tone, stimulation threshold for inducing H-reflex, GABA, Gly, 5-HT, DA and NE contents, Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions were increased (P<0.001, P<0.01) in both the medication and TTA groups. No significant differences were found between the non-acupoint group and model group, and between the medication and TTA groups in all the indexes mentioned above (P>0.05). After administration of ML385, the effects of TTA in reducing neurological deficit score, MAS score, Hmax/Mmax, percentage of cerebral infarct volume, Glu, Asp, ROS, and up-regulating H-reflex threshold, GABA, Gly, 5-HT, DA, NE, Nrf2 and HO-1 levels were eliminated (P<0.001\u00ef\u00bcP<0.05,P<0.01). CONCLUSION: TTA can improve neurological behavior and muscle spasm in rats with PSS, which may be associated with its functions in regulating the levels of neurotransmitters in the cortical infarcted area by activating the Nrf2/ROS signaling pathway.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> the effect class=\"decs\" id=\"d020521\">stroke</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> were randomly divided into 6 groups, i.e. PSS model, medication, non-<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> in each group.

METHODS: The patients with PAR were randomly divided into acupuncture + western medicine group (n=30) and western medicine group (n=30). In the western medicine group, fluticasone propionate nasal spray was administered, one spray in each nostril in one treatment, once a day, for 6 weeks. On the basis of the western medicine group, fuyangguben acupuncture-moxibustion therapy was supplemented. Acupuncture was at Dazhui (GV14). The patients of this group received 30 min of acupuncture-moxibustion therapy 3 times weekly during the first 4 weeks and twice a week in the last 2 weeks, totally for 6 weeks. Before treatment, after treatment, in week 10, 18 and 30 of follow-up visits, the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), the total non-nasal symptom score (TNNSS), the total ophthalmic symptom score (TOSS), and the score of the rhinitis quality of life (RQLQ) scale were compared in the patients of the two groups separately. Using ELISA, the serum concentrations of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were detected before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the rTNSS, TNNSS, TOSS, as well as RQLQ score were lower in comparison with those before treatment in each group (P<0.05).The rTNSS, TNNSS, TOSS and the score of RQLQ in the week 10, 18 and 30 of follow-up visits were reduced when compared with those before treatment in each group (P<0.05), and these scores in the acupuncture + western medicine group were remarkably lower than those of the western medicine group (P<0.05). After treatment, the serum contents of total IgE and IL-4 were significantly decreased when compared with those before treatment in the acupuncture + western medicine group (P<0.05), and these indicators in the acupuncture + western medicine group were lower than those of the western medicine group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: On the base of treatment with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, \"Fuyang Guben\" acupuncture-moxibustion therapy is safe and effective on PAR, presenting a remarkably long-term efficacy. The functioning mechanism may be related to the down-regulation of total IgE and IL-4 in serum.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To investigate long-term its functioning mechanism. <h2>METHODS:</h2> The <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> with PAR were nostril in one <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a>, once a day, for 6 weeks.

Although the method of Ziwuliuzhu acupuncture possesses a unique rhythmic pattern. Objectives: In this study, we have creatively combined the traditional Chinese medicine of Ziwuliuzhu with a modern biological rhythm to investigate the internal mechanism of insomnia. Methods: Pathological tissue from the hypothalamus was analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The level of TNF (tumor necrosis factor)- in the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) area of the hypothalamus was detected in situ using the TUNEL fluorescence staining assay. The concentration the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression of Clock and Bmal1 was measured using RT-qPCR. Results: In the Ziwuliuzhu acupuncture groups, the structural damage in the hypothalamic neurons was alleviated compared to the model group and the expression of inflammatory factors was reduced. The mRNA expression levels of Clock and Bmal1 were significantly increased (p < 0.05). The concentration of melatonin was significantly increased (p < 0.001). Although there were no significant differences between the treatment groups (diazepam group, Nazi group, Najia group, and routine group) (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Ziwuliuzhu acupuncture alleviated neuronal damage and modulated the inflammatory reaction in the hypothalamus of rats with insomnia. Moreover, Ziwuliuzhu acupuncture increased the expression levels of Clock and Bmal1 mRNA, and MT content. This study has potentially highlighted one of the mechanisms through which Ziwuliuzhu acupuncture can be used to treat insomnia.<h2>Background:</h2> In clinics, Ziwuliuzhu <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> is of treating <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d007319\">insomnia</a>; however, there is currently limited information available regarding its possible mechanisms.

Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years to treat motor dysfunction, cognitive disorder and language barrier caused by cerebral ischemic stroke. Acupoint lines, vertex middle line and anterior oblique line of vertex temple, are always employed to treat cerebral ischemic stroke. However, the mechanism of the two acupoint lines in relieving cerebral ischemic stroke needs further exploration. In the present study, scalp acupuncture treatment alleviated the motor dysfunction, brain damage, and cell death induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Proteomics analysis and ultrastructure observation indicated that endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes might involve in the mechanism of the scalp acupuncture treatment in suppressing MCAO-triggered neural deficits. Effect of the scalp acupuncture treatment on ER stress was then investigated and found that the activation of ER stress mediators, including PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, was downregulated after the scalp acupuncture treatment. Co-localisation analysis of KDEL and CD63 showed that the engulfment of ER fragments by lysosomes was accelerated by the scalp acupuncture treatment. Moreover, expression of pro-apoptotic protein CHOP, phosphorylated-JNK, cleaved capases-3 and -9 also decreased after the scalp acupuncture. In conclusion, the present study showed that scalp acupuncture of vertex middle line and anterior oblique line of vertex temple may alleviate cerebral ischemic stroke by inhibiting years to treat motor <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d060825\">dysfunction, cognitive</a> and anterior oblique line of vertex temple, are always employed to treat cerebral <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000083242\">ischemic stroke</a>.

Traditional Chinese herbs (TCHs) and acupuncture are valuable therapeutic options for MCI. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and Yishen Granule (YSG) in restoring cognitive function in elderly patients with MCI. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial (8-week intervention) was conducted at two tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China. A total of 120 participants were randomly divided into four groups (n = 30 per group): A, acupuncture with YSG; B, acupuncture with placebo herbal medicine; C, sham acupuncture with YSG; D, sham acupuncture with placebo herbal medicine. The primary outcome was a change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), while the secondary outcome was to evaluate improvement in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Assessments were conducted at baseline and weeks 4 and 8. Results: Of the 120 patients (69.17 \u00b1 6.57 years; 71 women [59.17%] and 49 men [40.83%]) included in the study, 106 (88.33%) completed the study. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that the MoCA and MMSE scores in group A were significantly different from those in group D at week 4 (P < .05). At week 8, the MoCA and MMSE scores in groups A, B, and C were significantly improved compared with those in group D (P < .001 for all), and the delayed recall score in group A was significantly greater than those in groups B and C (P < .05). Acupuncture and YSG were well tolerated and safe, and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Acupuncture, YSG, and the combination of both improved cognitive function, with the combined therapy being the most effective, which can be beneficial in preventing dementia and improving the quality of life of the elderly.<h2>Objective:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d060825\">Mild cognitive impairment</a> (MCI) is a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">therapeutic</a> options for This study aimed id=\"d062606\">tertiary hospitals</a> in Shanghai, <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d002681\">China</a>.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Twelve databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline (Ovid) (from 1946), Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, Open Grey, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP) and China Biology Medicine disc (CBM)) and three registration websites (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR)) were searched from the inception to September 2022, and citations of the included literature were screened. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials addressing invasive acupuncture for PGS. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Key information on the included studies was extracted by two reviewers independently. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI was used for categorical data, and mean difference with 95% CI for continuous data. The quality of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Outcomes were conducted with trial sequential analysis (TSA). RESULTS: Fifteen studies with 759 patients met the inclusion criteria. Subgroup analyses revealed that compared with the drug group, the drug and acupuncture group had a greater positive effect on the total effective rate (TER) (nine trials, n=427; RR=1.20; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32; P-heterogeneity=0.20, I2=28%, p=0.0004) the recovery rate (RCR) (six trials, n = 294; RR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.98; P-heterogeneity=0.29, I2=19%, p<0.0001) of PGS after abdominal surgery. However, acupuncture showed no significant advantages in terms of the TER after thoracic surgery (one trial, p=0.13) or thoracic/abdominal surgery-related PGS (two to 2.01; P-heterogeneity=0.96, I2=0%, p=0.07). The quality of evidence for TER and RCR was moderate certainty. Only one study reported an acupuncture-related adverse event, in the form of mild local subcutaneous haemorrhage and pain that recovered spontaneously. TSA indicated that outcomes reached a necessary effect size except for clinical symptom score. CONCLUSION: Based on subgroup analysis, compared with the drug treatment, acupuncture combined drug has significant advantages in the treatment of PGS associated with abdominal surgery, but not with thoracic surgery.

Our aim is to assess the methodological and reporting quality of SRs/MAs and make an evaluation about the available evidence of the safety and efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine. RECENT FINDINGS: Migraine is one of the most common primary headaches, with various symptoms, threatening human health. Acupuncture is a specific treatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and a validated non-pharmaceutical option as well, widely used in the treatment of migraine, and has gained remarkable therapeutic effect. An overview can evaluate research methods and evidence for SRs/MAs in evidence-based medicine, although there is much relevant research, it's still a hard work to synthesis all the evidence or to make robust conclusions, the variation in the methodological and quality evidence in such SRs/MAs play a significant role. For this overview, we searched six electronic databases from inception until 8 September 2022, and without languages restrictions, the results showed that, acupuncture as a more safety and more convenient therapeutic, and it has been shown to be effective in the treatment of migraine, that is worthy of clinical promotion. However, there are also some limitations because of the low-quality evidence of most of the studies. In conclusion, most included SRs/MAs suggested that acupuncture was more effective than the control group in the treatment of migraine. However, the quality evidence of most of the studies still needs to be improved.PURPOSE OF <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d016454\">REVIEW</a> Over the past few years, there have been many systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) used to assess the methodological and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"ddcs036428\">reporting</a> quality of SRs/MAs and make an evaluation about the available evidence of the <a most common non-<a as class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> of there is it's still a hard <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014937\">work</a> to synthesis all the evidence or to make robust conclusions, the variation in the methodological and quality evidence in such SRs/MAs <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010988\">play</a> a significant <a searched six <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004581\">electronic</a> databases from inception until 8 September 2022, and without <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d007802\">languages</a> restrictions, the results convenient <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">therapeutic</a>, and it has been shown to be in the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008881\">migraine</a>, that is worthy of clinical promotion.

DEL SURBackground: Cardiorespiratory depression caused by anesthesia decreases the quality and increases the time of postoperative recovery. The acupoint Governor Vessel 26 (GV26) is a resuscitation point that can reverse this depression and can be safely used without side effects. Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the stimulation and anesthetic recovery time of GV26 in bitches submitted to hydrochloride (2 mg/kg) was used, and induction was performed using midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg). For the control group, standard procedure was performed for OH, with anesthetic recovery and post-surgical procedures. For the acupuncture group (AP), the stimulation of acupoint GV26 was performed 20 minutes after the anesthetic induction and maintained for 5 minutes. Respiratory rate, amplitude (superficial, normal or deep), type of respiratory movement (abdominal, abdominocostal or thoracoabdominal), heart rate, capillary filling time, temperature, presence or absence of laryngotracheal reflex, presence or absence of interdigital reflexes were assessed immediately before PAM application, and 2 (T1), 5 (T2), 10 (T3), 15 (T4), 20 (T5), 25 (T6) and 30 (T7) minutes after treatment. The results were tabulated and statistically analyzed. Results: When comparing the AP group with the control group, an improvement in amplitude of the chest cage was observed at all times, where the animals remained in normal or deep respiratory amplitude. The heart rate was significantly higher for the AP group (155.5 \u00b1 34.4 bpm) than the control group at T1 (105.1 \u00b1 15.4 bpm), while recovery time was lower for the AP group (54.1 \u00b1 14.9 min) when compared to control group (79.9 \u00b1 17.9 min). Conclusion: The present paper demonstrated the efficacy of GV26 in maintaining adequate respiratory amplitude and decreasing the of postoperative recovery.

Nowadays, the incidence rate of breast hyperplasia in women is increasing year by year, and the etiology is related to the imbalance of estrogen and progesterone in the body. The symptoms include breast pain, breast nodules, or nipple discharge, which can develop into breast cancer in the context of psychological pressure. Therefore, it is timely and effectively necessary for people to treat the symptoms. At present, traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) often treats breast hyperplasia by oral drug, external application, acupuncture, moxibustion, and massage, while western medicine often uses hormone therapy or surgery. TCM can regulate hormone levels to treat breast hyperplasia. Acupuncture, moxibustion, and other methods can stimulate acupoints to reduce breast lumps. However, since TCM is easy to produce hepatorenal toxicity after long-term use and simple external treatment is slow to take effect, rapid and effective treatment is difficult to be achieved. Although western medicine can inhibit the disease, it is easy to produce toxic and side effects if taken for a long time. In addition, surgery can only remove the focus and the recurrence rate is high. Some studies have found that the combination of oral and external use of TCM compounds has a significant effect, with mild toxic and side effects, few adverse reactions, and a low recurrence rate. Based on the relevant literature in recent years, this article reviewed the combination of oral and external treatment of TCM in the treatment of hyperplasia of mammary glands, discussed the effectiveness, clinical evaluation indexes, and mechanism, and pointed out the existing shortcomings to explore a comprehensive therapy worthy of clinical application.<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d006965\">Hyperplasia</a> year, and the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"q000209\">etiology</a> is related to id=\"d004967\">estrogen</a> and <a class=\"decs\" the context of psychological <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d011312\">pressure</a>.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture, doxylamine-pyridoxine, and a combination of both in women with moderate to severe NVP. DESIGN: SETTING: 13 tertiary hospitals in mainland China from 21 June 2020 to 2 February 2022. PARTICIPANTS: 352 women in early pregnancy with moderate to severe NVP. INTERVENTION: Participants received daily active or sham acupuncture for 30 minutes and doxylamine-pyridoxine or placebo for 14 days. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the reduction in Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score at the end of the intervention at day 15 relative to baseline. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events, and maternal and perinatal complications. RESULTS: No significant interaction was detected between the interventions (P = 0.69). Participants receiving acupuncture (mean difference [MD], both (MD, -1.6 [CI, -2.2 to -0.9]) had a larger reduction in PUQE score over the treatment course than their respective control groups (sham acupuncture, placebo, and sham acupuncture plus placebo). Compared with placebo, a higher risk for births with children who were small for gestational age was observed with doxylamine-pyridoxine (odds ratio, 3.8 [CI, 1.0 to 14.1]). LIMITATION: The placebo effects of the interventions and natural regression of the disease were not evaluated. CONCLUSION: Both acupuncture and doxylamine-pyridoxine alone are efficacious for moderate and severe NVP. However, the clinical importance of this effect is uncertain because of its modest magnitude. The combination of acupuncture and doxylamine-pyridoxine may yield a potentially larger benefit than each treatment alone.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of combinations of acupuncture with ondansetron versus ondansetron alone for PONV prophylaxis in women at a high risk. METHODS: This parallel, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary hospital in China. Patients who had three or four PONV risk factors on the Apfel simplified risk score, undergoing elective laparoscopic gynaecological surgery for benign pathology, were recruited. Patients in the combination group received two sessions of acupuncture treatment and 8 mg intravenous ondansetron, whereas those in the ondansetron group received ondansetron alone. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV within 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postoperative nausea, postoperative vomiting, adverse events etc. RESULTS: Between January and July 2021, a total of 212 women were recruited, 91 patients in the combination group and 93 patients in the ondansetron group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. In the first 24 h postoperatively, 44.0% of the patients in the combination group and 60.2% of the patients in the ondansetron group experienced nausea, vomiting, or both (difference, -16.3% [95% CI, -30.5 to -2.0]; risk ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.55-0.97]; p = 0.03). However, the results of the secondary outcomes showed that compared to ondansetron alone, acupuncture together with ondansetron was only effective in reducing nausea but did not have a significant impact on vomiting. The incidence of adverse events was similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with ondansetron as a multimodal prophylaxis approach is more effective than ondansetron alone in preventing postoperative nausea in high-risk patients.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d032921\">Consensus</a> guidelines <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000932\">antiemetics</a> as a multimodal approach was of very low quality. <h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> This study aimed to assess the effect of combinations of <a <h2>METHODS:</h2> class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">Patients</a> in received two sessions id=\"d015670\">acupuncture treatment</a> and 8 received <a class=\"decs\" July 2021, a total of 212 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014930\">women</a> were recruited, 91 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> in the <a class=\"decs\" class=\"decs\" id=\"q000032\">analysis</a>. of the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> in the results of the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"q000556\">secondary</a> outcomes showed in reducing <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009325\">nausea</a> but did not have a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014839\">vomiting</a>.

Electro-acupuncture (EA) has been shown to improve constipation-related symptoms and rebalance the gut microbiota. However, it is currently unknown whether the gut microbiota is a key mechanistic target for EA or how EA promotes gut motility by regulating the gut microbiota and SCFAs. Therefore, we assessed the effects of EA in FC mice and pseudo-germfree (PGF) mice to address these questions. METHODS: Forty female Kunming mice were randomly separated into a normal control group (n = 8), an FC group (n = 8), an FC + EA group (n = 8), a PGF group (n = 8) and a PGF + EA group (n = 8). The FC group and FC + EA group were treated with diphenoxylate to establish the FC model; the PGF group and PGF + EA group were given an antibiotic cocktail to initiate the PGF model. After maintaining the model for 14 d, mice in the FC + EA and PGF + EA groups received EA stimulation at the ST25 and ST37 acupoints, once a day, 5 times per week, for 2 weeks. Fecal parameters and intestinal transit rate were calculated to assess the efficacy of EA on constipation and gastrointestinal motility. Colonic contents were quantify microbial diversity using 16S rRNA sequencing, concentrations using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: EA significantly shortened the first black stool defecation time (P < 0.05) and increased the intestinal transit rate (P < 0.01), and fecal pellet number (P < 0.05), wet weight (P < 0.05) and water content (P < 0.01) over 8 h, compared with the FC group, showing that EA promoted gut motility and alleviated constipation. However, EA treatment did not reverse slow-transit colonic motility in PGF mice (P > 0.05), demonstrating that the gut microbiota may play a mechanistic role in the EA treatment of constipation. In addition, EA treatment restored the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and significantly increased butyric acid generation in FC mice (P < 0.05), most likely due to the upregulation of Staphylococcaceae microorganisms (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: EA-mediated resolution of constipation occurs through rebalancing the gut microbiota and promoting butyric acid generation.

Based on the results of EA on inflammation in the mouse model of lipopolysaccharide inflammatory storm, the study showed that the distal effect of acupuncture can be achieved by \"driving the vagus-adrenal axis (through the adrenal medulla, by releasing PROKR2Cre-marked sensory neurons, which innervate the deep hindlimb fascia but not the abdominal fascia, are crucial for driving this axis. The study suggests the existence of specificity distribution of acupoints, that different EA stimulation intensities or different needle penetration depths have different therapeutic effects, that photosensitive stimulation may be a substitute for needle acupuncture, and that massage, stretching and body movements may also activate PROKR2Cre-markable dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons and elicit anti-inflammatory effects. However, results of some other studies are contrary to the conclusions of Ma's team. For examples: low-intensity EA at GB30 point significantly reduced the inflammation in the rat model of persistent inflammation, which is more relevant to the real daily acupuncture practice, and this effect was partly related to the adrenal cortex and associated with the stimulation of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone; manual acupuncture (similar to the low-intensity EA) at KI3, Zhichuan point (an extra point), etc. was effective in a severe COVID-19 patient with sepsis; stimulating ST25 with low-intensity EA or manual acupuncture was effective against gastrointestinal inflammations; the above mentioned points are not in an area enriched with PROKR2Cre-marked sensory nerve endings.

Objective: To evaluate acupuncture availability and acceptability in Australian palliative care. Outcomes: (1) Domains of the survey included participant characteristics, (2) workplace availability, (3) personal attitudes, and (4) recommendation likelihood. Design: An online REDCap survey of Australian palliative medicine practitioners was administered. Results: Acupuncture was mostly not available/permitted at workplaces (45.2%) due to cost/funding (57.1%) and limited evidence (57.1%). When available by workplace (24.2%) or affiliated service (4.8%), doctors mostly administered acupuncture (66.7%). Respondents were not up to date with current research (71.4%). Referral likelihood increased with confidence in provider (80.0%), workplace availability (77.1%), and patient prior/current use (77.1%). Patient acupuncture discussions were rare (62.9%) with barriers of effectiveness uncertainty (71.4%) and limited knowledge of availability (57.1%). Conclusion: Despite available integrative services and acceptability by Australian palliative medicine practitioners, utilization is low.

Acupuncture is often used as a treatment method in CTS and numerous studies consider it effective. However, no study has yet compared the efficacy of physical therapy including bone and neural mobilization, exercise and electrotherapy with and without acupuncture in CTS patients. PURPOSE: comparing the effect of physiotherapy plus acupuncture with physiotherapy alone on pain, disability and grip strength in CTS patients. METHOD: Forty patients with mild to moderate CTS were randomly divided into two equal groups. Both groups received exercise and manual techniques for 10 sessions. Patients in the physiotherapy plus acupuncture group also received 30 min of acupuncture in every session. The visual analog scale (VAS) score, the score on the Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire for functional status and symptom severity, shortened disability of arm, shoulder, hand (Quick-DASH) score and grip strength were evaluated at pre-test and post-test. RESULTS: According to ANOVA results, there is a significant interaction between group and time for VAS, BCTQ and Quick-DASH parameters. At the post-test, while the parameters of VAS, BCTQ and Quick-DASH in the physiotherapy plus acupuncture group had a statistically significant difference compared to the physiotherapy group, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in the pre-test. Moreover, there is no significant difference between groups in grip strength improvement. CONCLUSION: This study shows preliminary evidence that physiotherapy plus acupuncture, was more effective than physiotherapy alone in pain relief and improving disability of patients suffering from CTS.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d002349\">Carpal tunnel <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008722\">method</a> in CTS and numerous studies consider it effective.

METHODS: The pilot study used mixed methods, collecting quantitative and qualitative data. Patients (n = 12) with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy after colorectal cancer were blindly randomized to genuine acupuncture or telescopic sham acupuncture. Individual interviews were conducted, and were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The patients registered pain and unpleasant sensations (100 mm Visual Analog Scales) before and after n = 120 sessions, n = 60 genuine and n = 60 sham acupuncture sessions. RESULTS: Five categories of patient experiences were described. The neuropathy negatively affected life. Physical activity was perceived to be important for health, but neuropathy was a barrier. The neuropathy required symptom-managing strategies. Acupuncture was pleasant and valuable, but some patients presented doubts regarding its effect mechanisms. After the genuine acupuncture sessions, pain (mean -2.0 steps relief during each session) and unpleasant sensations (-2.4) in the face was reduced more than after sham acupuncture (+0.1 steps worse pain, P = .018, +0.1 steps worse unpleasant sensations, P = .036). After genuine acupuncture, unpleasant sensations in the hands were reduced less (-0.23) compared to after sham acupuncture (-5.5, P = .002). Pain or unpleasant sensations in the feet did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Patients experienced that the neuropathy negatively changed their life and that acupuncture was pleasant and valuable. Patients receiving genuine acupuncture had short-term effects regarding pain and unpleasant sensations in the face compared to patients receiving sham acupuncture, while hands and feet did not improve. The patients were successfully blinded and complied with the acupuncture. We welcome future full-scaled randomized sham-controlled acupuncture studies.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> Since there is to describe <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a>' experiences, and to study the feasibility and sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a>.

Acupuncture has been shown to improve follicular development abnormalities in patients with PCOS, but its mechanism is unknown. This study hypothesized that the mechanism of acupuncture on follicular development abnormalities in PCOS patients is the inhibition of granulosa cell apoptosis through LncMEG3-mediated regulation of miR-21-3p. METHODS: A PCOS-like rat model was established using subcutaneous injection of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Acupuncture was performed on rats for 15 d (CV-4, RN-3, CV-6, SP-6 and EX-CA 1). Ovarian morphology was observed by HE staining, and sex hormone and AMH levels were detected by ELISA. Primary granulosa cells were isolated from each group of rats to assess the association of acupuncture treatment, LncMEG3, miR-21-3p, and granulosa cell apoptosis in rats with PCOS. RESULTS: LncMEG3 and miR-21-3p were highly expressed in the ovarian granulosa cells of rats with PCOS, and LncMEG3-mediated regulation of miR-21-3p was involved in the development of PCOS in rats. Silencing of MEG3 attenuated sex hormone dysregulation and ovarian histopathological changes in PCOS rats and promoted follicle cell development and maturation. In addition, silencing MEG3 increased the viability and number of granulosa cells. In addition, silencing MEG3 further inhibited early and late apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells in PCOS rats. Acupuncture improved polycystic ovarian morphology and sex hormone levels in PCOS rats. Acupuncture intervention increased the viability and number of granulosa cells. Acupuncture intervention inhibited early and late apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells in PCOS rats by targeting miR-21-3p via LncMEG3. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that acupuncture can downregulate LncMEG3, thereby targeting and regulating miR-21-3p to suppress early and late granulosa cell apoptosis and normalize their proliferation. These factors ultimately compensate for abnormal follicular development. These findings shed light on the clinical potential of acupuncture as a safe treatment for follicular developmental abnormalities in PCOS.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> The main features id=\"d011085\">polycystic ovary syndrome</a> (PCOS) are abnormal follicular development dysfunction, which are caused by excessive in <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> with PCOS, but its mechanism is unknown.

Feeding jejunostomy is used in advanced esophagus cancer patients in order to support and supplement the patients' nutrition needs. In dumping syndrome, the food is rapidly introduced into the intestine at a rate that is faster than normal, it is associated with both digestive system and vasoactive symptoms. Dumping syndrome has an association with both esophagus cancer patients and feeding jejunostomy. In the mid and long term, dumping syndrome is an important issue that contributes to the risk of malnourishment in advanced esophagus cancer patients. In recent studies, acupuncture was effective in regulating digestive symptoms. Acupuncture is considered to be a safe intervention, that was previously shown to be effective in treating digestive-related symptoms. METHODS: Sixty advanced esophageal cancer patients post-feeding jejunostomy will be divided into 2 equal groups, an intervention group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30). Patients in the intervention group will receive acupuncture using the (Taichung). Patients in the control group will receive shallow acupuncture on 12 non-acupoints (sham points), 1 cm from the above mention points. Patients and assessors will be blind to trial allocation. Both groups will receive acupuncture twice a week for 6 weeks. The main outcome measurements are: body weight, BMI, Sigstad's score, and the Arts' dumping questionnaire. DISCUSSION: There are no previous studies that have examined the use of acupuncture on patients with dumping syndrome. This single-blind randomized control trial will investigate the effect of acupuncture on dumping syndrome in advanced esophagus cancer patients with feeding jejunostomy.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted across multiple locations according to the articles searched. Seven databases, including trial registration sites, were searched. A total of six trials were included involving 489 patients; of them, 244 received acupuncture therapy. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the incidence of EA compared with placebo/sham or standard care in children were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of EA, as evaluated using a specific assessment tool. Data about the incidence rate of EA, heterogeneity, quality of trials and evidence, and adverse events were collected. Additionally, data about patient demographic characteristics, type of anesthesia, duration and onset of acupuncture therapy, EA and pain score, time taken for extubation, and post-anesthesia care unit length of stay were collected. The results indicated that the overall incidence of EA in the acupuncture therapy group and the control group was 23.4% and 39.5%, respectively, with no significant difference (risk ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.48; I2 = 63%). Subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the overall incidence of EA in the acupuncture therapy and control groups according to surgery type (high-risk vs. low-risk surgery), suggesting that acupuncture therapy may be effective in reducing EA for patients undergoing high-risk surgery. The quality of evidence was downgraded to \"very low\" due to the study designs, inconsistency, and possible publication bias. In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that the currently available RCTs are insufficient to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy in preventing EA in children undergoing general anesthesia.This study aimed to <a were conducted across multiple locations according to the articles searched.

METHODS: A randomised cross-over design was used to compare the perception of needle skin penetration, pain experienced and types of sensations experienced following a single placebo dry needling and a single therapeutic dry needling application. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the proportions of patients reported ability to perceive needle penetration (p = 0.646), description of needling sensations (p = 0.3) or pain rating (p = 0.405) when comparing placebo needling to therapeutic dry needling. CONCLUSION: Needle tip bending creates a simple, cost-effective and effective placebo needle for use in comparisons with therapeutic dry needling. This offers researchers a viable alternative to expensive and inappropriate acupuncture sham devices when conducting dry needling trials.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To use which is a single application. <h2>RESULTS:</h2> proportions of <a class=\"decs\" (p <a and effective placebo <a The Authors. rights reserved.Article de p\u00e9riodiqueEssai crois\u00e9esingles10.1016/j.jbmt.2023.04.011https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbmt.2023.04.0112023061820230620Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.50.01776547443767246848mdl-37289799MEDLINEregionalregionalfronterizabvsespanacarphacontrolecancermtcparaguaypanamabvsmsperunicaraguaboliviacns-brguatemalahondurascostaricaarticleKwon, Chan-YoungLeem, of Korean Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.Leem J; College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Republic of Korea.Kim DW; Department of Neuropsychiatry of Korean Medicine, Pohang Korean Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Daegu Haany University, Pohang-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea.Kwon HJ; College of Haany University, Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea.Park HS; Department of Internal Medicine of Korean Medicine, National Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.Kim SH; Department of Neuropsychiatry of Korean Medicine, Pohang Korean Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Daegu Haany University, Pohang-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea.Effects of acupuncture on earthquake survivors with major psychiatric disorders and related symptoms: A scoping review of clinical studies.Effects of acupuncture on earthquake survivors with major psychiatric disorders and related symptoms: A scoping review of clinical studies.Department of Oriental NeuropsychiatryDong-Eui University College of Korean MedicineBusanRepublic of KoreaCollege of Korean MedicineWonkwang UniversityIksanRepublic of KoreaDepartment of Neuropsychiatry of Korean MedicinePohang Korean Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Daegu Haany UniversityPohang-siGyeongsangbuk-doRepublic of KoreaCollege of Korean MedicineDaegu Haany UniversityGyeongsan-siGyeongsangbuk-doRepublic Internal of Korean Medical CenterSeoulRepublic of KoreaDepartment of Neuropsychiatry of Korean MedicinePohang Korean Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Daegu Haany UniversityPohang-siGyeongsangbuk-doRepublic of KoreaRepublic of KoreaDepartment of Oriental NeuropsychiatryDong-Eui University of Korean MedicineBusanRepublic of KoreaCollege of Korean MedicineWonkwang UniversityIksanRepublic of KoreaDepartment of Neuropsychiatry of Korean MedicinePohang Korean Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Daegu Haany UniversityPohang-siGyeongsangbuk-doRepublic of KoreaCollege of Korean MedicineDaegu Haany UniversityGyeongsan-siGyeongsangbuk-doRepublic Internal of Korean Medical CenterSeoulRepublic of KoreaDepartment of Neuropsychiatry of Korean MedicinePohang Korean Medicine Hospital Affiliated Daegu AMERICAEEUUBACKGROUND: This scoping review aimed to determine the current research status of acupuncture for major psychiatric disorder (MPD) in earthquake survivors. METHOD: We followed the scoping review process described previously. A literature search on 14 electronic databases was conducted from inception to November 29, 2022. Data from the included studies were collected and descriptively analyzed to address our research question. Extracted data were collated, synthesized, and summarized the according to the analytical framework of a scoping review. RESULT: This scoping review included nine clinical studies: four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five before-after studies. The most frequent MPD type among the included acupuncture studies was posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 6/9, 66.67%). The most frequent acupuncture type was scalp electro-acupuncture (4/9, 44.44%), followed by manual acupuncture acupuncture (3/9, 33.33%). Studies using GB20, GV20, GV24, and EX-HN1. In general, the treatment period lasted between 4 and 12 weeks. Validated assessment tools for PTSD severity and accompanying symptoms were used for patients with PTSD, while the corresponding evaluation tools were used for patients with other diagnoses or clinical symptoms. Acupuncture-related adverse events were generally mild and temporary, such as mild bleeding and hematoma, and syncope was a rare but potentially serious adverse event (1/48 patients and 1/864 sessions over a treatment period of 4 weeks). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture studies for MPD after an earthquake mainly focused on PTSD. RCTs accounted for around half of the included studies. Scalp electro-acupuncture was the most common acupuncture type, and EX-HN1 and GV24 were the most important acupoints in the acupuncture procedures for MPD. The included studies mostly used validated symptom assessment tools, though some did not. Clinical studies in this field need to be further expanded regardless of the study type.

However, drug abuse causes harm to the human body and also pollutes the environment to a certain extent. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a highly selective and sensitive biosensor for PMZ determination. An acupuncture needle (AN) was used as an electrode in 2015, and further research on the electrode's essence in electrochemistry is needed. In this work, a sensor based on a surface imprinted film coordinated Au/Sn biometal was first fabricated on AN via electrochemistry. The obtained cavities showed complementary and suitable sites for \"N atom\" electron transfer through the phenyl ring structure in promethazine, which is rigorous for the configuration near the interface. Under the optimal conditions, MIP/Au/Sn/ANE exhibits a good linear relationship in the range of 0.5 \u00b5M-500 \u00b5M, and the detection limit (LOD) is 0.14 \u00b5M (S/N = 3). The sensor exhibits good repeatability, stability, and selectivity and can be successfully used to analyze and detect PMZ in human serum and environmental water.

Acupuncture combined with moxibustion (AM) therapy has been widely used for motor dysfunction treatment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this work, we aimed to determine whether AM therapy could alleviate motor impairment post-SCI and, if so, the potential mechanism. METHODS: A SCI model was established in mice through impact methods. AM treatment was performed in SCI model mice at Dazhui (GV14) (BL32) on both sides for 30 min once per day for 28 days. The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score was used to assess motor function in mice. A series of experiments including astrocytes activation detected by immunofluorescence, the roles of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3)-IL-18 signaling pathway with the application of astrocyte-specific NLRP3 knockout mice, and western blot were performed to explore the specific mechanism of AM treatment in SCI. RESULTS: Our data indicated that mice with SCI exposure exhibited motor dysfunction, a significant decrease of neuronal cells, a remarkable activation of astrocytes and microglia, an increase of IL-6, TNF-, IL-18 expression, of IL-18 colocalized with astrocytes, while astrocytes-specific NLRP3 knockout heavily reversed these changes. Besides, AM treatment simulated the neuroprotective effects of astrocyte-specific NLRP3 knockout, whereas an activator of NLRP3 nigericin partially the AM neuroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: AM treatment mitigates SCI-induced motor dysfunction in mice; this protective mechanism may be related to the NLRP3-IL18 signaling pathway inhibition in astrocytes.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013119\">Spinal cord injury</a> (SCI), which reportedly induces severe motor dysfunction, imposes a significant social and <a class=\"decs\" for motor dysfunction <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a>, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.

The pathogenesis of PCOS is relatively complex and has a certain relationship with endocrine disorders. The increase of androgen and luteinizing hormone (LH) is the main cause of a series of symptoms. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has obvious advantages and significant curative effects in the treatment of this disease. It can effectively reduce the insulin level of PCOS patients, regulate lipid metabolism, and increase ovulation rate and pregnancy rate and has fewer side effects.

However, especially in the spine medicinal domain, relevant studies are scarce. In order to manage proper recovery after surgery, practitioners need to take a comprehensive look at the suppression of pain, strategies for improving the results of surgery, improving the quality of life, and mental support of patients. To this end, a recovery-enhancing program through integrated medical technology which covers both conventional and Korean medicine is highly required. We want to develop an integrated medical program that covers a wide range of medicinal domains for the early recovery of patients after spinal surgery. The aim of the present study is to check out which thermal stimulation with meridian points are more effective than others to enhance recovery after spinal surgery. METHODS: The following online databases will be retrieved in the present study: PubMed; Scopus; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Chinese Biomedical Literature Database; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP database). We will independently classify articles and will encapsulate characteristics of the study components. Primary outcomes will be categorized into visual analog scale, Tolerance to liquid and solid diet, postoperative hospitalization period, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed based on the study findings. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Furthermore, the outcomes of this study would afford the documentation of whether thermal stimulation on meridian points can be effective for enhanced recovery after spine surgery.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000080482\">Enhanced recovery after surgery</a> programs are widely as a far-reaching approach to help <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> with surgeries recover rapidly by giving optimized care.

Plum-blossom needle is a traditional Chinese cost-effective instrument for enhancing the transdermal delivery of ALA. However, whether it could improve the efficacy of AK treatment has not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of plum-blossom needle-assisted PDT in facial AK in the Chinese population. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective study, a total of 142 patients with AKs (grades I-III) were randomized into the plum-blossom needle-assisted PDT group (P-PDT) and control PDT group (C-PDT). In the P-PDT group, each AK lesion was tapped vertically by a plum-blossom needle before the application of 10% ALA cream. In the C-PDT group, each lesion was only wiped with regular saline before ALA cream incubation. Then, 3 hours later, all the lesions were irradiated with light-emitting diode (LED) at a wavelength of 630 nm. PDT was performed once every 2 weeks until all lesion patients achieved complete remission or completed six sessions. The efficacy (lesion response) and safety (pain scale and adverse events) in both groups were evaluated before each treatment and at every follow-up visit at 3-month intervals until 12 months. RESULTS: In the P-PDT and C-PDT groups, the clearance rates for all AK lesions after the first treatment were 57.9% and 48.0%, respectively (P < 0.05). For grade I AK lesions, the clearance rates were 56.5% and 50.4%, respectively (P = 0.34). For grade II AK lesions, the clearance rates were 58.0% and 48.9%, respectively (P = 0.1). For grade III AK lesions, the clearance rates were 59.0% and 44.2%, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, grade III AK lesions in the P-PDT group required fewer treatment sessions (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the pain score between the two groups (P = 0.752).

As a non-invasive alternative, acupuncture (AP) has been widely used to treat depression in clinic, yet few basic studies have been focused on the effects and mechanism of acupuncture on synaptic plasticity in LHb. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential mechanism of the antidepressant effect of acupuncture. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), AP, fluoxetine (FLX), acupoint catgut embedding (ACE), sham-ACE groups (n = 9/group). Rats were given a 28-day treatment at the Shangxing (GV23) and Fengfu acupuncture, ACE, sham-ACE fluoxetine (2.1 mg/kg). The results showed that AP, FLX and ACE suppressed the behavioral deficits, increased the level of the 5-hydroxytryptamine and FNDC5/IRISIN in serum, also reduced the expression of pro-BDNF impacted by CUMS. Both AP and BrdU and LHb and increased the expression of BDNF/TrkB/CREB, with non-significant difference between the two groups These findings suggest that AP therapy relieves depression-related manifestations in depressed rats, suggesting a potential mechanism via the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in LHb.<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d003863\">Depression</a> is a major mental class=\"decs\" id=\"d004194\">disease</a> worldwide, causing dysfunction of Lateral Habenular (LHb).

The UK National Institute for Health Research and the Medical Research Council jointly published the Applying Surgical Placebo in Randomised Evaluation (ASPIRE) guidelines on the application of placebo surgical operation in randomized evaluation, which includes 4 parts: rationale and ethics, design, conduct, and interpretation and translation, providing comprehensive guidance for the application of placebo controls in surgical trials. As an operational intervention, acupuncture is similar to surgery, so, ASPIRE guidelines can also provide certain guidance for the application of sham acupuncture. In the present paper, we introduce the ASPIRE guidelines, and put forward its enlightenment and reference to the application of sham acupuncture control in combination with retrospecting the current situations of sham acupuncture research. We hold that future studies should strengthen the consideration of the rationality and ethics of sham acupuncture, standardize the design of sham acupuncture control, and convey the information related to sham acupuncture to patients with appropriate descriptions.Reasonable and standard application of sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> control is the key to determine the quality of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> clinical trials, and is also a difficult faced by <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> clinical <a jointly published the Applying Surgical Placebo in Randomised Evaluation (ASPIRE) guidelines on the application of placebo surgical operation in randomized evaluation, which includes 4 parts rationale and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004989\">ethics</a>, design, conduct, and interpretation and translation, providing comprehensive guidance for the application of placebo controls in surgical trials.

We genotyped 325 participants from a randomized controlled trial of cancer survivors with chronic musculoskeletal pain. We found that carrying methionine at position 158 (158Met) of COMT, encoded by the A allele, significantly increased the analgesic response to electroacupuncture (74% vs 50%; odds ratio [OR]: 2.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31, 6.05; P < 60%; OR: 1.43; 95% 18%; OR: 1.46; 95% CI: .38, 7.24; P = .61) compared to Val/Val. These findings raise the possibility that COMT Val158Met might be an important predictor of analgesic response to electroacupuncture, providing novel insights into precision nonpharmacologic pain management tailored to individual genetic backgrounds. PERSPECTIVE: This work suggests the modulating effects of the polymorphism in COMT Val158Met on the response to acupuncture.

We applied a new combined therapy of local recombinant human interferon alpha 1b (rhIFN1b) injection plus acupuncture on verruca vulgaris recently to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combined therapy. The retrospective study was conducted in The First Hospital of China Medical University from 2018 to 2020. Patients with verruca vulgaris were included. Combined therapy with local rhIFN1b injection plus acupuncture was set as treatment group, rhIFN1b injection and carbon dioxide (CO2) laser were set as control groups. A total of 2415 patients were included in the study. The cure rates were 81.85%, 85.93%, and 100% in combined group, rhIFN1b group, and CO2 laser group, separately. All lesions cured in combined group were located on hands or feet, while majority of lesions cured in other groups were located on other sites. For patients with medium/big single lesion or 6-9 lesions, less treatment times were needed in combined group than rhIFN1b group. For patients with small single, two to five or more than ten lesions, the treatment times of combined group and rhIFN1b group were comparable. All patients complained of pain in varying degrees when local injection or laser irradiation. Compared with CO2 laser group, more fever, less swelling or scar was reported in combined group. In conclusion, combined therapy of local rhIFN1b plus acupuncture was beneficial for verruca vulgaris with limited adverse effects. The therapy was more acceptable by younger female patients with verruca vulgaris.<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014860\">Verruca</a> vulgaris is always stubborn to treat.

AIMS: The COMFORT (Community-engaged Options to Maximize and Facilitate Opioid ReducTion) study was designed to provide virtual multidimensional integrated nonpharmacologic therapies via a cloud-based videoconferencing platform over six weeks to adults with chronic pain who were prescribed an opioid to investigate measurable health improvements. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive analysis explored participants' experiences of a novel pain management intervention. A total of 19 participants consented to participate in the study and 15 completed six virtual consultations with either yoga, massage, chiropractic, or physical therapists. Semi-structured exit interviews were conducted, and data analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Five main themes were identified, including unmet pain needs, self-care practices, incentive for participation, perception of a virtual environment, and benefits of the intervention. All participants reported at least minor benefits, with about half reporting improvement in pain levels, and some were able to reduce their opioid use. A virtual environment posed challenges for a few participants who found it more difficult to engage with than in-person therapy; others found the platform easy to navigate. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with chronic pain were open and willing to try a novel way to access nonpharmacologic consultations to address unmet pain needs.

There are few clinical studies on BBPT-SCIWORA and even fewer on treatments for BBPT-SCIWORA-induced lower limb motor dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effect of acupuncture at bilateral spine acupoints combined with lower limb acupoints in BBPT-SCIWORA. CASE PRESENTATION: This study reported four cases of BBPT-SCIWORA after dancing, two of which received a unique medium-frequency electroacupuncture treatment. They were all females aged between 5 and 12 years old. They were diagnosed with BBPT-SCIWORA by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transferred to the rehabilitation department for lower limb dysfunction, and received rehabilitation treatments and acupuncture. Cases 1 and 2 received acupuncture treatment for lower limb acupoints, while Cases 3 and 4 received acupuncture treatment at the bilateral spine acupoints beside the lesion and lower limb acupoints.

Acupuncture (AC), as a minimally invasive technique, has become a popular choice for improving depression symptoms. However, it is still unclear which therapy is associated with the best outcomes for PSD. In this review, we aimed to explore the impact of AC in alleviating symptoms of PSD and to evaluate the difference in effectiveness between AC combined with pharmacotherapies and various non-pharmacotherapies. METHODS: Six databases and three clinical trials registration platforms were searched from inception to March 2023. Randomized clinical trial comparing needle-based AC with pharmacotherapy, and other non-pharmacotherapy or invalid group were included. Two independent reviewers identified eligible studies, and collected data using a pre-made form. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to assess and compare different techniques using RStudio 3.6.0 with the package 'GEMTC' V.0.8.1. The primary outcome was the efficacy for PSD assessed by scales measuring depressive symptoms. The secondary outcomes were effectiveness for neurological function and the quality of life. The ranking probabilities for all treatment interventions was performed using the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA). The risk of bias was assessed by using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2. RESULTS: Sixty-two studies, involving 5308 participants published from 2003 to 2022, were included. The results showed that compared with western medicine (WM) (defined as pharmacotherapy for PSD), AC alone or with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (RTMS), Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) alone or with WM, were superior for alleviating depression symptoms. Compared to Usual Care, AC alone or plus other therapies could significantly decrease scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale. According to result of SUCRA, AC plus RTMS had the highest probability of improving depressive symptoms with a probability of 49.43%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that AC alone or combined with other therapies appears to be effective in improving depression symptoms of stroke survivors. Moreover, in comparison to WM, AC alone or plus RTMS, TCM, TCM with WM, or WM, were more effective in improving depression symptoms of PSD. Also, AC with RTMS seems to be the most effective with the highest probability.

Acupuncture (AC) is an effective method of postoperative pain management, but its clinical efficacy depends on the rationale used to select AC points. METHODS: We developed a method to identify individual patterns of pain and a corresponding set of acupoints (corrAC) based on the relative pressure sensitivity of six abdominal visceral pressure points, i.e., the gastrointestinal (GI) checkpoints (G1-G6). Patients with moderate to severe pain were included and received a single AC treatment following surgery. The visual analog scale (VAS) score, pain threshold, and skin temperature were assessed before AC and at 5 min, 1 h, and 24 h following AC. AC was performed with 1-mm-deep permanent needles. RESULTS: From April 2021 to March 2022, 72 patients were included in the analysis. Fifty-nine patients received corrAC, whereas 13 received a noncorresponding AC (nonAC) as an internal control. Patients receiving corrAC showed a significant reduction (74%) in pain at 5 min after treatment (p < 0.0001) and a significant increase (37%) in the pain threshold (p < 0.0001). In this group, a significant increase in skin temperature above G1, G3, G4, and G5 was observed. Patients receiving nonAC showed neither significant pain reduction nor significant changes in pain threshold. The skin above G3 and G4 did not reveal temperature changes. CONCLUSION: Checkpoint AC may be an effective tool in postoperative pain therapy after bariatric surgery. Vegetative functional involvement might be associated with pain relief.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> It remains challenging in clinical practice to id=\"d016896\">clinical efficacy</a> depends on the rationale used to select AC points. <h2>METHODS:</h2> We developed a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008722\">method</a> to identify individual patterns of <a a corresponding set of with moderate to severe <a class=\"decs\" included and received temperature</a> were assessed before AC and at 5 min, 1 h, and 24 h following AC.

METHODS: Patients with FM refractory to standard drug therapy underwent eight weekly acupuncture sessions. Significant improvement, defined as a reduction of at least 30% of the revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), was assessed at the end of the eight weeks (T1) of treatment and three months after the end of treatment (T2). Univariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of significant improvement at T1 and T2. Variables that resulted to be significantly associated with clinical improvement at univariate analysis were included in multivariate models. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on 77 patients (9 males, 11.7%). At T1, significant improvement in FIQR was recorded in 44.2% of patients. At T2, persistent significant improvement was recorded in 20.8% of patients. In the multivariate analysis, predictive variables of treatment failure were tender point count (TPC) (odds ratio [OR] =0.49, 95% the Pain Catastrophising Scale, at T1. At T2, the only predictive variable of treatment failure concomitant use (OR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.05-0.95, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: High TPC and a tendency for pain magnification predict immediate treatment failure, while duloxetine therapy predicts it three months after completion of the acupuncture course. The identification of clinical characteristics of unfavourable response to acupuncture could help to implement a cost-effective prevention of treatment failure in FM.<h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2> To identify the predictive factors of <a eight weekly <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> sessions.

PFNP seriously affects patients' quality of life, and approximately 30% of patients suffer from sequelae, such as unrecovered palsy, synkinesis, facial muscle contracture, and facial spasm. Many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of PFNP. However, the specific mechanism remains unclear and needs to be further explored. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying acupuncture treatment for PFNP using neuroimaging methods. METHODS: We will search all published studies from inception to March 2023 using the following databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, KMBASE, KISS, ScienceON, and OASIS. All clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating PFNP using functional neuroimaging will be selected without language restrictions. Two reviewers will independently conduct the study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, according to a predetermined protocol. The outcomes, including the types of functional neuroimaging techniques, brain function alterations, and clinical outcomes, such as the House-Brackmann scale and Sunnybrook Facial Grading System, will also be analyzed. Coordinate-based meta-analysis and subgroup analyses will be performed if possible. RESULTS: This study will analyze the effect of acupuncture on brain activity alterations and clinical improvement in patients with PFNP using functional neuroimaging.

Some of its important applications have been neglected during the medical revolution. Meanwhile, different treatment modalities that incorporate heat, including moxibustion, have progressed in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we reviewed the main TPM textbooks that were written specifically in the field of kaiy. We considered the traditional teachings in the context of contemporary information, gathered from the scientific literature about moxibustion and modern cauterization. Some surgical therapeutic indications of kaiy (e.g., debridement and coagulative procedures) have been advanced by the innovation of electro-cauterization. However, those therapeutic applications that were based on the TPM humoral theory for relieving body coldness or myofascial pains-which are similar to moxibustion usages-have not received the same attention. Apart from the broad similarities of kaiy and moxibustion as thermal therapies with similar indications, there is a striking correspondence between kaiy point mapping and acupoints. Therefore, further research on different kaiy aspects is recommended. Please cite this article as: Jaladat AM, Alizadeh Vaghasloo M, Atarzadeh F, Ayati MH, Kazemi AH, Akin E, Hashempur MH.

This review aims to provide up-to-date evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture for managing pain in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. METHODS: Eleven databases were searched from inception until November 2022 for relevant articles Two researchers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and evaluation. The present review solely targeted randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool 2.0 was employed to assess the risk of bias. Data were compiled using RevMan 5.4.1 software, and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: Thirty studies involving 2295 patients were included in this review. Compared with carbamazepine, acupuncture led to improvements in pain scores (15 RCTs, mean difference (MD) - 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI)-1.82 to -0.98 [95% prediction interval, -3.137,0.343], p < 0.00001, low certainty of evidence (CoE)), response rates (29 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.25 [95% prediction interval, 1.067, 1.346], p < 0.00001, low CoE), frequency of pain attacks (2 RCTs, MD -2.53, 95% CI -4.11 to -0.96, P = 0.002, low CoE), and adverse effects (13 RCTs, risk difference (RD) -0.15, 95% CI -0.19 prediction P < 0.00001, very low CoE). CONCLUSION: Although the quality of evidence is low, compared with carbamazepine, acupuncture may improve trigeminal neuralgia-related pain.

Nevertheless, standard monitoring strategies are limited by poor temporal resolution. Herein, an implantable needle-type microsensor capable of monitoring ADO release in vivo in response to acupuncture in real time has been developed. Electrocatalytic Prussian Blue nanoparticles, an immobilized multienzyme system, and a permselective poly-o-phenylenediamine-based membrane were used for the sequential modification of the sensing region of the electrode. The resultant sensor can perform amperometric measurements of ADO levels in response to a very low level of applied potential (-0.05 V vs Ag/AgCl). This microsensor also functioned across a broad linear range (0-50 \u00b5M) and exhibited good sensitivity (1.1 nA/\u00b5M) with a rapid response time of under 5 s. Importantly, the sensor also exhibited good reproducibility and high selectivity. For in vivo animal studies, the microsensor was employed for the continuous assessment of instantaneous ADO release at the ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint when this acupoint was subjected to twirling-rotating acupuncture manipulation. Benefiting from superior sensor in vivo performance and stability, the positive correlation between the variability in acupuncture-induced ADO release and the stimulus intensity levels that affect the clinical benefit can be demonstrated for the first time. Overall, these results highlight a powerful approach to analyzing the in vivo physiological effects of acupuncture, expanding application realm of micro-nano sensor technology on a fast time scale.Rapid <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000241\">adenosine</a> (ADO) signaling, on the class=\"decs\" id=\"d008566\">membrane</a> were used for the sequential of the sensing region of the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004566\">electrode</a>.

METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group (n=11) and operation group. Then after successful modeling, rats in the operation group were randomly divided into model, acupuncture, model+3-MA and acupuncture+3-MA groups, with 11 rats in each group. The model of CI/RI was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Rats in the model+3-MA and acupuncture+3-MA groups were injected with 3-MA (400 nmol/ 5 \u00b5L) 5 \u00b5L into the lateral ventricle 30 min before reperfusion. Rats in the acupuncture and acupuncture+3-MA groups were punctured (GV26) and \"Baihui\" (GV20) and stimulated manually once every 15 min. The acupuncture intervention was conducted for 30 min each time, once every 12 h for a total of 7 times. The degree of neurological impairment was evaluated 2 h after reperfusion and after intervention by Garcia score. After intervention, the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was observed by TTC staining, the protein expression levels of type \u00e2 microtubule-associated protein 1 protein 2 (Lamp2) and P62 in ischemic hippocampal tissue were detected by Western blot, the ultrastructure of neurons in ischemic hippocampus was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group, the Garcia score was decreased (P<0.01), the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was increased (P<0.01), the expression the expression level of P62 protein was increased (P<0.01) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the model group. Compared with the model group, the Garcia score was increased (P<0.01), the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was decreased (P<0.01), the expression level of P62 was decreased (P<0.01) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the acupuncture group\u00ef\u00bc the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was increased (P<0.05), the expressions of type \u00e2 \u00a2 PI3K and Beclin-1 were decreased (P<0.01) and the expression level of P62 protein was increased (P<0.05) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the mo-del+3-MA group. Compared with the model +3-MA group, the Garcia score was increased (P<0.05), the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was decreased (P<0.01), the expression levels P<0.05) in the acupuncture+3-MA group. Compared with the acupuncture group, the Garcia score was decreased, the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), the expression levels of proteins increased (P<0.05) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the acupuncture+3-MA group. The results of TEM showed that the edema of neurons was heavier, and few hypolysosomes existed in the model group; there was no obvious damage to neuronal structure, intracellular matrix was abundant, and a few lysosomes existed in the acupuncture group; the neuronal cells had mild edema and primary lysosomes were present in the acupuncture +3-MA group. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve the symptoms of neurological impairment and reduce the percentage of cerebral ischemic area in rats with CI/RI. The mechanism may be related to regulating type \u00e2 \u00a2 PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway, up-regulating the expressions \u00a1 and Lamp2, and down-regulating the expression of P62.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the effects of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> in regulating divided into sham operation group (n=11) and operation group.

METHODS: Ninety patients with PC-BPPV who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into manual reduction control group, acupuncture control group and experimental group, with 30 cases in each group. Epley reduction method was used for manual reduction control treatment of patients in the manual reduction control group, until there was no obvious vertigo of patients. Patients in the acupuncture control group received ordinary acupuncture treatment, while patients in the experiment group received dynamic and static acupuncture treatment, both on the basis of manual reduction control treatment. Baihui(GV20) and Yintang(GV24+), Sanyinjiao(SP6), Zhongzhu(TE3), Houxi(SI3) and Waiguan(TE5) on the healthy side, and the vertigo-auditory area and Fengchi(GB20) on the affected side were selected for acupuncture intervention, which was performed once a day, with needles retained for 30 minutes in two acupuncture groups. Every six times was taken as a session and two sessions were required. Dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) scale and visual analogue score (VAS) were used to evaluate the degree of vertigo before, after 1 and 2 sessions of treatment respectively. RESULTS: Compared with those before treatment, the DHI score and VAS score of each group after 1 and 2 sessions of treatment were both significantly decreased (P<0.05). Compared with the acupuncture control group and the manual reduction control group, the DHI score of the experiment group was significantly decreased (P<0.05) after 1 and 2 sessions of treatment. VAS score of the experiment group was significantly decreased compared with that of the manual reduction control group(P<0.05) after 1 and 2 sessions of treatment. The total effective rate of the experiment group was 86.67%, better than those of the acupuncture control group (83.33%, P<0.05) and the manual reduction control group(66.67%, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The dynamic and static acupuncture method combined with manual reduction effectively improved vertigo symptoms in PC-BPPV with rapid and lasting effects, which is worthy of further clinical promotion and application.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the clinical effect and advantages of dynamic and static <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> <a met the in each group.

As some psychiatric symptoms degrade the quality of life of patients with PD, a novel alternative non-pharmacological treatment is required. Acupuncture appears to be an effective and safe treatment for PD. The emotional freedom technique (EFT) is a type of psychological therapy that alleviates psychiatric symptoms by stimulating acupoints. In this study, we will compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of the EFT and acupuncture and acupuncture alone. METHODS: This study is a randomized, assessor-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. Eighty participants will be equally divided into experimental and control groups. Each participant will receive a total of 24 interventions over 12 weeks. The experimental group will receive EFT combined with acupuncture and the control group will receive acupuncture alone. The primary outcome is the change in the Beck Depression Inventory score from baseline to 12 weeks, and the secondary outcomes include change in the following variables: Beck Depression Inventory, Parkinson's disease sleep scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Korean version of the Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, and Loss of weight questionnaire scale, and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale III and exercises. DISCUSSION: Acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for motor and nonmotor symptoms in PD, and EFT appears to be safe and effective for a variety of psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we will investigate the potential of EFT combined with acupuncture to improve psychiatric symptoms in PD.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010300\">Parkinson's disease</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019636\">neurodegenerative diseases</a> in world.

However, the reporting quality of sham acupuncture remains unclear despite its critical importance in understanding and analyzing the effects of acupuncture. This paper presents a literature review aimed at assessing the quality of reporting of sham acupuncture in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) based on STRICTA 2010 and Three electronic English-language databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase) were searched from inception to March 7, 2022, and RCTs of sham acupuncture were identified. The reporting quality of sham acupuncture was assessed in accordance with the items recommended in STRICTA 2010 and TIDieR-Placebo. The reporting quality of other items related to sham acupuncture apart from items from these two checklists was also captured to further assess the reporting quality of sham acupuncture. RESULTS: A total of 609 eligible studies were included. For all of the items recommended in STRICTA 2010 and TIDieR-Placebo, 100% of the studies reported a brief name that described the sham acupuncture, 93.9% studies reported the needle type, and 90.0% reported the names of the points used. Other items for which the reporting rates were above 50% included the number, frequency and duration of treatment sessions; needle retention time; and number of needle insertions per subject per session. Overall, 49.4% of the studies revealed the rationale why sham acupuncture was chosen, 39.7% of the studies involving insertion processes reported the depth of insertion, and 37.9% of the studies reported the needle manufacturer. Other items for which the reporting rates were below 30% included practitioner-related information, response sought, evaluation of blinding, intervention mode and environment, assisting tools, and the extent to which the treatment was varied. The items \"Modifications\", \"How well (planned)\" and \"How well (actual)\" were not reported in any of the analyzed studies. CONCLUSIONS: The overall reporting quality of sham acupuncture in RCTs was suboptimal. Although STRICTA 2010 and TIDieR-Placebo could be beneficial for describing sham acupuncture, neither can offer recommendations specifically for sham acupuncture. There is thus an urgent need to develop specialized guidelines for reporting sham acupuncture in clinical trials.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> Sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> is usually used to assess the specific of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a>.

This study aimed to assess the association between anticoagulant drug use and bleeding after acupuncture. DESIGN: Case control study SETTING: We analysed the diagnosis and treatment records (2000-2018) of a random sample of two million patients from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. INTERVENTIONS: anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence rates of major (visceral bleeding or ruptured blood vessels requiring transfusion) and minor (skin bleeding or contusion) bleeding after acupuncture RESULTS: We included the records of 13,447,563 acupuncture sessions in 821,946 participants and followed up the patients for 14 days after each session. The incidence of minor bleeding was 8.31 per 10,000 needles, whereas that of major bleeding was 4.26 per 100,000 needles. Anticoagulants significantly increased the risk of minor bleeding (adjusted OR = 1.15 (1.03-1.28)), but the risk of major bleeding did not reach statistical significance (adjusted OR = 1.18 (0.8 0-1.75)). Anticoagulants, such as warfarin (adjusted OR = 4.95 (2.55-7.64)), direct oral anticoagulants (adjusted OR = 3.07 (1.23-5.47)), and heparin (adjusted OR = 3.72 (2.18-6.34)) significantly increased the risk of bleeding. However, antiplatelet drug was not significantly associated with post-acupuncture bleeding. Comorbidities including liver cirrhosis, diabetes, and coagulation defects, were the risk factors for bleeding after acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant drugs may increase the risk of bleeding after acupuncture. We encourage physicians to ask patients in detail about their medical history and drug use prior to acupuncture treatment.<h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">Patients</a> on <a followed up the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> for 14 days after that of major id=\"d012306\">risk</a> of major <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d006470\">bleeding</a> did not reach statistical significance (adjusted OR = 1.18 (0.8 0-1.75)). <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000925\">Anticoagulants</a>, treatment</a>.Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

This study aimed to access the effectiveness of acupuncture for treatment of asthma in adults. METHODS: Five English databases and four Chinese databases were searched from inception to November 2021. Randomised sham/placebo-controlled trials meeting inclusion criteria were included. Risk of bias was evaluated according to the Cochrane Review Handbook, and data analysis was performed in RevMan 5.4.1. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) profiler. RESULTS: Sixteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. Results indicated that acupuncture was well-tolerated and could improve FEV1% compared with sham/placebo 95% CI = 93%, of participants (n) = 603]. Acupuncture also improved Cai's Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (MD 7.26, 95% CI 5.02-9.50, I2 = 0, n = 358), and reduced the asthma symptom score (SMD -2.73, 95% CI -3.59 to -1.87, I2 = 65%, n = 120). One study showed acupuncture increased the Asthma Control Test (ACT) score (MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.90-3.10, n = 111), and decreased exacerbation frequency (MD -1.00, 95% CI -1.55 to -1.45, n = 111). Other lung function and medication use parameters were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture versus sham/placebo control appeared to improve quality of life, FEV1%, symptoms, and asthma control, and reduced exacerbation frequency per year. Further studies with appropriate controls, more participants, and high-quality evidence are needed.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">therapy</a>, but the benefits remain This study aimed to access the <a searched from inception to November 2021.

METHODS: Seven databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing AMT to routine care or conventional drug for alleviating CRPS of insomnia, depression, and anxiety before April 2020. Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 30 RCTs involving 2483 cancer patients were enrolled. The pooled analysis indicated that the treatment group was significantly better than the control group in improving the depression effective rate [= 1.29, 95% (1.12, 1.49), 0.0004], the quality of life (0.80, \u00ef\u00b9\u00a35.05), 0.000 01]. But there was no statistically significant difference between two groups in improving the insomnia effective rate [= 1.18, 95% (0.93, 1.51), 0.18]. The subgroup analysis showed the effectiveness of different intervention on CRPS. Compared with routine care, AMT helps relieve CRPS better evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and depression effective rate. Compared with conventional drug, AMT performs better evaluated by SDS, depression effective rate and QOL. Moreover, the conventional drug showed higher treatment efficacy on improving insomnia effective rate compared with AMT. Compared to conventional drug, AMT plus conventional drug resulted in a significant reduction on CRPS such as PSQI, HAMD, SDS, and SAS, and also had a meaningful improvement on insomnia effective rate, depression effective rate and QOL. Fewer published reports were found on the adverse events of AMT than the conventional drug. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that AMT might be effective in improving CPRI; however, a definite conclusion could not be drawn because the quality of trials are low. Further large-scale and high-quality RCTs to verify the efficacy and safety of AMT on CRPS are still warranted.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To evaluate for randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing AMT to routine care or conventional <a April 2020.

METHODS: SP rat model was produced by permanent MCAO. Rats were divided into five groups: blank control group (Control), sham operation group (Sham), model group (Model), waggle needling group (WN) and perpendicular needling group (PN). SP rats were treated with acupuncture from day 3 after MCAO, once a day for 6 d. The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and modified Ashworth scale (MAS) were conducted on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ischemic cortex was measured by laser speckle imaging 5 min pre ischemia, 5 min post ischemia, and after intervention on day 9. All rats were sacrificed at day 9 and the protein and mRNA expressions of \u00ce\u00b32 subunit of the \u00ce\u00b3-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAA\u00ce\u00b32) and 2 (KCC2) in the ischemic cortex and lumber enlargement was measured by Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Both Control and Sham groups showed no changes in mNSS and MAS scores and in the regional CBF. Compared with Model group, both WN and PN treatments significantly ameliorated neurological deficit ( 0.01), decreased muscle tone ( 0.05), and enhanced CBF ( 0.001) in SP WN showed superior effects than PN ( 0.001). In line with the improvement in neurobehavior, acupuncture interventions up-regulated the expressions of GABAA\u00ce\u00b32 and KCC2 in the ischemic cortex as well as lumber enlargement ( 0.01) in SP rats, and those changes were more obvious in WN ( 0.05).

METHODS: Sixty Wistar rats were randomly divided into blank group ( 10), the rest of the rats were clamped tail as stimulation combined with injected intraperitoneally p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) to establish sleep deprivation model. After the successful replication of the model, they were randomly divided into model group, grabbing group, Western Medicine group, acupuncture group and sham acupuncture group, with 10 rats in each group. The model group was given normal saline; The grasping group was grasped in the same way as the two treatment groups; Western medicine group was given estazolam solution; The acupuncture group was treated with the acupuncture method of \"soothing the liver group were needled with four non-acupoint sites. After 7 d of treatment of rats in each group, sodium pentobarbital sleep experiment was used to evaluate the sleep latency (SL) and sleep time (ST). The percentage of rats entering the open arm (OE%) and the percentage of time entering the open arm (OT%) in each group were monitored by elevated cross maze, and the vertical score, horizontal crossing times, central grid score and modification times were monitored by open field test, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs) was used to monitor the changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (Deoxy-Hb) and total hemoglobin (Total-Hb) in the cerebral cortex of rats in each group under light stimulation and dark stimulation, the statistically significant channel combinations were selected from 8 light sources and 12 detectors (S-D). According to the position of the light source detector covering the cerebral cortex, Preliminarily determine the key brain areas of insomnia (the preliminary experiment found that 6S-8D and 7S-9D were the key channels of insomnia under light stimulation, and the corresponding brain areas were prefrontal lobe and occipital lobe respectively; 7S-7D channel under dark stimulation, and the corresponding brain area was occipital lobe); The hemodynamic map of cerebral cortex was constructed through the absolute value of whole brain blood oxygen level. Further identify key brain regions for insomnia. RESULTS: Compared with the blank group, ST, OE%, OT%, the vertical score, horizontal crossing times, central grid score, the concentration of Deoxy-Hb in prefrontal and occipital lobes were decreased significantly (<0.01), and the concentrations of SL, modification times, Oxy-Hb and Total-Hb were increased significantly (<0.01); There was no difference in the above indexes between the model group and the grabbing group (>0.05); After treatment, ST, OE%, OT%, the vertical score, horizontal crossing times, central grid score and Deoxy-Hb concentration in acupuncture group and Western medicine group increased significantly, while SL, modification times, Oxy-Hb and Total-Hb concentrations were decreased significantly (<0.01, <0.05), Compared with the Western Medicine group, the values of OE% and OT% were more significantly higher in the acupuncture group (<0.05), while the rest of the indexes were not significantly different between the two groups (>0.05); Compared with the acupuncture group, ST, OE%, OT%, the vertical score, horizontal crossing times, central grid score and the concentration of deoxy Hb in the sham acupuncture group decreased significantly (<0.01), and the concentrations of SL, modification times, Oxy-Hb and Total-Hb increased significantly (<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The needling method for soothing the liver and regulating mind could improve the abnormal behavior of insomnia rats with liver stagnation, and its effect on the improvement of abnormal mood caused by insomnia with liver stagnation is better than that of Western Medicine, and the mechanism of action may be related to the regulation of blood oxygen metabolism in the prefrontal and occipital lobes of the cerebral cortex by model.

METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into eight groups ( 12), including blank group, model group, medication group, acupuncture group, high-dose XXMD group (XXMD-H), low-dose and acupuncture combined with low-dose XXMD group (A+L). After treatment for 6 weeks, dopamine (DA) neurons and the pathological changes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells were observed. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the content of DA and the level of interleukin-1\u00df (IL-1\u00df), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and The mRNA level of PINK1 and Parkin and the protein expression of Nix, PINK1 and Parkin in the substantia nigra were also detected. RESULTS: Combination treatment effectively ameliorated the symptoms of PD. Compared with model group, combined treatment significantly up-regulated the protein expression of Nix, Parkin and PINK1 and the mRNA levels the levels of pro-inflammation cytokines were obviously decreased after combination therapy, while IL-10 content was increased remarkably (<0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared with each treatment alone, combination therapy improved the pathological damage of DA neurons of PD mice more effectively. The possible mechanism may be attributed to the up-regulated level of mitochondrial autophagy and improved mitochondrial function.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture or usual care (UC). The main outcome is complete control (no vomiting episodes and/or no more than mild nausea) of CINV. GRADE approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Thirty-eight RCTs with a total of 2503 patients were evaluated. Acupuncture in addition to UC may increase the complete control of acute vomiting (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25; 10 studies) and delayed vomiting (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.00; 10 studies) when compared with UC only. No effects were found for all other review outcomes. The certainty of evidence was generally low or very low. None of the predefined moderators changed the overall findings, but in an exploratory moderator analysis we found that an adequate reporting of planned rescue antiemetics might decrease the effect size of complete control of acute vomiting (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture in addition to usual care may increase the complete control of chemotherapy-induced acute vomiting and delayed vomiting but the certainty of evidence was very low. Well-designed RCTs with larger sample sizes, standardized treatment regimens, and core outcome measures are needed.<h2>PURPOSE:</h2> To assess controlled trials (RCTs) that compared <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> to sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> or usual care (UC).

Acupuncture Popularization in Guangdong Province was closely combined with the interest of the public and the proposal that 'doctors with western background should learn from Chinese medicine'. Some measures, such as extensive mobilization, short-term training and stepwise promotion, were introduced to popularize acupuncture in primary healthcare. This developed Chinese medicine as the process of primary care in New China and improved the 'uniting of Chinese medicine and Western medicine' and the community-level social management.

CHINAOBJECTIVE: To at \"(LI11) and interleukin (IL)-33, suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) and mast cell degranulation in sensitive area of skin tissue in rats with urticaria, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying prevention of urticaria. METHODS: A total of 32 male SD rats were randomly divided into blank control, model, EA preconditioning and medication groups, with 8 rats in each group. The urticaria model was established by topical injection of the prepared anti-ovalbumin serum (foreign serum, 0.1 mL/spot) along the bilateral sides of the spinal column on the back, followed by injection of mixture solution of ovalbumin, 0.5% evans blue and normal saline via the tail vein 48 h later. EA intervention (2 Hz/15 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral LI11 and SP10 for 20 min, once daily for 7 d before modeling.Back sensitization was started from the 5th day on. Rats of the medication group received gavage of loratadine, and those of the model group received gavage of the same volume of normal saline. The diameter of evans blue spots at the back skin tissue was measured; the histopathological changes of the blue spot tissues were observed by light microscope after H.E. staining. The state of degranulation of mast cells in the subcutaneous loose connective tissue was observed by using toluidine blue staining. Serum IgE and histamine contents were detected by ELISA, and the immunoactivity of IL-33 and ST2 in the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the sensitized spots (evans blue exudation spots) was observed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the blank control group, the diameter of evans blue spot, degranulation rate of mast cells, serum IgE and histamine contents, and the immunoactivity of IL-33 and ST2 in the evans blue exudation spot tissues were significantly increased in the model group (P<0.01). In comparison with the model group, the increase of the above-mentioned indexes was reversed in both EA and medication groups (P<0.01\u00ef\u00bcP<0.05). No significant differences were found between the EA and medication groups in down-regulating the levels of the 6 indexes. H.E. staining of the blue spot tissues of rats in the model group showed incomplete structure of the epidermal layer of the skin, unclear interface of tissues, incomplete keratinization, chaotic epidermal cells, disorderly arrangement of fibers in the dermis, and infiltration of inflammatory cells and edema, which was relatively milder in the EA and medication groups. CONCLUSION: EA preconditioning can prevent urticaria (reduce size and sensitive reactions) in rats, which may be associated with its functions in lowering the level of IgE through inhibiting IL-33 and ST2.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the mechanisms underlying prevention of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014581\">urticaria</a>. <h2>METHODS:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> were randomly divided into blank control, model, EA preconditioning and medication groups, with 8 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> in each group.

METHODS: Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, model group, and BB group, with 10 rats in each group. The IBS model was established by the combination of acute stress method and chronic stress method, and the success of the model establishment was evaluated by abdominal wall reflex (AWR). BB group received and \"Guanyuan\" (CV4) for 15 min, once a day, for a total of 28 days. Bristol's fecal character score was evaluated, and intestinal propulsion rate was calculated. The open-field experiment was used to observe the behaviour of rats. Pathological changes in the colon were observed by H.E. staining. TM widely targeted metabolomics technology was used to detect the metabolic profile of serum samples from 3 groups of rats. Principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discrimination analysis techniques were combined with database screening to screen differential metabolites, and the KEGG database was utilized to map the enriched metabolic pathway. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, AWR, and the total distance, speed, duration traveled autonomously, the distance of central grid traveling, the number of central grid crossings of the open-field experiment were significantly decreased (P<0.01\u00ef\u00bcP<0.05), while Bristol's fecal character score, intestinal propulsion rate and rest duration in the open-field experiment were significantly increased(P<0.01) in the model group. Compared with the model group, Bristol's fecal character score, the intestinal propulsion rate, rest duration, and rest episode were significantly decreased(P<0.01, P<0.05), while AWR, the total distance, speed, duration traveled autonomously, the distance of central grid traveling, the number of central grid crossings, and the residence time of the central grid were significantly increased(P<0.01\u00ef\u00bcP<0.05) in the BB group. H.E. staining showed a discontinuous mucosal layer of colon tissue, a slightly disordered arrangement of glands, and more inflammatory cell infiltration in the submucosa and muscle layer in the model group, which was relatively milder in the BB group. After comparing the model and control group, 123 differential metabolites were screened, while 57 were screened after comparing the model and BB group. Six differential metabolic pathways were acquired when comparing the model and the control group, while 8 were acquired when comparing the model and BB group using KEGG enrichment analysis, both of which included the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. CONCLUSION: \"Biao-Ben\" acupoint combination can improve symptoms of IBS by regulating metabolites of the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, which may be a potential target for the treatment of IBS.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To investigate the effect id=\"d051381\">rats</a>, so as to explore the mechanisms of BB in the prevention and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> of IBS. <h2>METHODS:</h2> Thirty SD <a divided into groups <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d035061\">control group</a>, model group, and BB group, with 10 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> in each group.

METHODS: A total of 102 AIS patients with onset to treatment time (OTT) 3 h were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 51 cases each group. In the control group, thrombolysis and conventional medical treatment were applied. On the basis of the treatment as the control group, acupuncture at Shuigou (GV 26), Zhongwan (CV 12), Qihai (CV 6), Neiguan (PC 6), etc. was applied in the observation group, 30 min each time, once a day. Both groups were treated for 2 weeks. Before and after treatment, the scores of National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin scale (mRS), modified Barthel index (MBI) and serum level of homocysteine (Hcy), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were compared, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of NIHSS, mRS and serum level of Hcy, hs-CRP were decreased compared with those before treatment (P<0.05), while the MBI scores were increased (P<0.05) in the two groups. The scores of NIHSS, mRS and serum level of Hcy, hs-CRP in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05, P<0.01), the MBI score in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). The total effective rate was 88.2% (45/51) in the observation group, which was superior to 70.6% (36/51) in the control group (P<0.05).

METHODS: Sixty-four patients with CFS were randomly divided into a moxibustion group (32 cases, 1 case dropped off, 1 case excluded) and an acupuncture group (32 cases, 2 cases dropped off). The patients in the moxibustion group were treated with bamboo-based medicinal moxibustion, while the patients in the acupuncture group were treated with routine acupuncture. Both groups were treated once a day, 6 days as a course of treatment with 1 day interval, for a total of 2 courses of treatment. Before treatment, 1 and 2 courses into treatment and in the follow-up of 14 days after treatment, the fatigue scale-14 (FS-14) and somatic and psychological health report (SPHERE) scores were observed in the two groups. Before and after treatment, the contents of CD+3, CD+4, CD+8 of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets were measured and CD+4/CD+8 ratio was calculated; the clinical efficacy of the two groups was compared. RESULTS: Compared before treatment, the FS-14 and SPHERE scores in the two groups were decreased 1 and 2 courses into treatment and in the follow-up (P<0.01), and the FS-14 and SPHERE scores in the moxibustion group were lower than those in the acupuncture group (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared before treatment, the contents of CD+3, CD+4 and CD+4/CD+8 ratio in the moxibustion group were increased after treatment (P<0.01). There was no significant difference of CD+3, CD+4, CD+8 and CD+4/CD+8 ratio between before and after treatment in the acupuncture group (P>0.05). After treatment, the contents of CD+3 and CD+4 in the moxibustion group were higher than those in the acupuncture group (P<0.05).

METHODS: A total of 15 children with TD were recruited as an observation group and 10 healthy children as a healthy control group. Regulating spleen and stomach acupuncture combined with infantile tuina were received in the observation group. First, acupuncture was applied to Zhongwan (CV 12), Tianshu (ST 25), Guanyuan (CV 4), Hegu (LI 4), Zusanli (ST 36), etc., and then abdominal massage and other tuina techniques were applied, once a day, 6 times a week, 2 weeks as a course of treatment, a total of 2 courses of treatment were required. No intervention was given in the healthy control group. In the observation group, Yale global tic severity scale (YGTSS) score and TCM syndrome score were compared before treatment and after 1 and 2 courses of treatment. 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to detect the intestinal flora in the healthy control group and before and after treatment in the observation group. RESULTS: After 1 and 2 courses of treatment, the scores of YGTSS and TCM syndrome in the observation group were lower than those before treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with the healthy control group, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) and indexes of Chao1, Sobs, Ace and Shannon were decreased in the observation group before treatment (P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with before treatment, the number of OTU and indexes of Chao1, Sobs, Ace and Shannon were increased in the observation group after treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with the healthy control group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the observation group before treatment was decreased (P<0.001), while the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides and Erysipelatoclostridium was increased (P<0.001, P<0.05). Compared with before treatment, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the observation group was decreased (P<0.001) after treatment, while the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium and Atopobium was increased (P<0.05, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with infantile tuina based on the principle of regulating spleen and stomach could effectively improve TD symptoms in children, which may be related to regulating the diversity of intestinal flora, increasing beneficial bacteria, maintaining intestinal microecological balance, and playing a role in improving neurological disorders.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the effect of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> combined with infantile and mechanism. <h2>METHODS:</h2> A total of 15 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d002648\">children</a> with TD were recruited as an id=\"d019370\">observation</a> group and 10 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019370\">observation</a> group.

Painkillers have adverse effects, such as tolerance, addiction, irritation of the digestive tract, and liver and kidney damage. Electroacupuncture has been used as alternative therapy, although with no (non-anecdotal) evidence of effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of electroacupuncture in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Moreover, by observing changes in serum and urine metabolites, we will evaluate the putative mechanisms randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial including 336 women with primary dysmenorrhea is being conducted at three hospital centers in China and consists of a 12-week treatment and a 3-month follow-up. Women will undergo electroacupuncture (n = 168) or sham acupuncture (n = 168), beginning 7 days before their menstruation, once per day, until menstruation. Each menstrual cycle equals one course of treatment, and we will evaluate a total of three courses of treatment. The primary outcome of interest is the change in visual analogue scale scores before and after treatment. The secondary outcomes include changes in the numeric rating scale, Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale, traditional Chinese medicine symptoms, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and 36-Item Short Form questionnaire scores, and a safety evaluation. Moreover, we will preliminarily investigate the metabolomics mechanism as a potential mediator of the association between electroacupuncture and primary dysmenorrhea symptomology. DISCUSSION: We aim to find a suitable non-medicinal alternative for primary dysmenorrhea treatment to reduce reliance on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

In the face of inflammation-induced cartilage and bone damage, RA treatment remains insufficient. While research evidence indicates that acupuncture can exert anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, improve the joint function of RA patients, and delay the disease, data on whether it can promote RA repair are lacking. Findings from the present work demonstrated that both the antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) models can simulate joint swelling of RA. The AIA model was more stable than the CIA model, with a higher incidence of successful arthritis modeling. Moreover, the AIA mice model could simulate the signal molecules and related pathological processes of the autoimmune response in RA, as well as major pathways related to RA and antigen immune response mechanisms. Manual acupuncture (MA) at Zusanli (ST36) significantly improved paw redness and swelling, pain, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the joints in AIA mice. The therapeutic effect of MA on AIA is achieved primarily through the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis, cell metabolism, and tissue repair processes. MA at ST36 can increase the gene contents of tissue repair growth factors, including PEG3, GADD45A, GDF5, FGF5, SOX2, and ATP6V1C2 in the inflammatory side joints of AIA mice, as well as the gene expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In conclusion, acupuncture may alleviate RA in the joints via modulating the tissue healing process.<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001172\">Rheumatoid arthritis</a> the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004194\">disease</a>, data on whether it can promote RA repair are lacking.

Methods: Chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) induced rats were established for the depression animal model. There were a total of four rat groups, including the control group, the CUMS group, the CUMS+acupuncture group, and the CUMS+fluoxetine group. The acupuncture group and the fluoxetine group were given a 3-week treatment after the modeling intervention. The researcher performed the open-field, elevated plus maze, and sucrose preference tests to evaluate depressive behaviors. The number of nerve cells, dendrites' length, and the prefrontal cortex's spine density were detected using Golgi staining. The cortex expression, such as BDNF, PSD95, SYN, and PKMZ protein, was detected using the western blot and RT-PCR. Results: Acupuncture could alleviate depressive-like behaviors and promote the recovery of the neural plasticity functions in the prefrontal cortex, showing the increasing cell numbers, prolonging the length of the dendrites, and enhancing the spine density. The neural plasticity-related proteins in the prefrontal cortex, including BDNF, PKMZ, were all downregulated in the CUMS-induced group; however, these effects could be partly reversed after being treated by acupuncture and fluoxetine (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Acupuncture can ameliorate depressive-like behaviors by promoting the recovery of neural plasticity and neural plasticity-related protein upregulation in the prefrontal cortex of CUMS-induced depressed rats. Our study provides new insights into the antidepressant approach, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of acupuncture involved in depression treatment.<h2>Purpose:</h2> To explore including a 3-week functions downregulated in the CUMS-induced group; however, these effects could be partly reversed after being treated by <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> new insights into the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000928\">antidepressant</a> approach, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of <a University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Wen J; Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Massage, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Zhang X; Basic Medical School of Chinese Medicine, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Dong Q; Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Massage, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Jia CS; Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Massage, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Zhang X; Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Massage, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Gao F; Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Massage, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Du YZ; Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Massage, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.Li XF; Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Massage, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.[Network visual data mining and analysis of literature on electroacupuncture treatment of post-stroke sequelae].[Network visual data mining and analysis of literature on electroacupuncture treatment of post-stroke sequelae].Institute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and Chinese Acupuncture-moxibustion and MassageHebei University of Chinese MedicineShijiazhuang 050200ChinaBasic Medical School of Chinese MedicineHebei University of Chinese MedicineShijiazhuang 050200ChinaInstitute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese Acupuncture-moxibustion and MassageHebei University of Chinese MedicineShijiazhuang 050200ChinaBasic Medical School of Chinese MedicineHebei University of Chinese MedicineShijiazhuang 050200ChinaInstitute of Acupuncture-moxibustion and of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese of Chinese Acupuncture-moxibustion 2023 May 25. 4851000-0607zh202305CNCHINACHINACHINAREPUBLIC OF CHINAOBJECTIVE: To analyze the optimum stimulating parameters and acupoint combination law of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment of post-stroke sequelae (PSS) through the network visual data mining and analysis of the literature\u00ef\u00bcso as to provide reference for clinical application. METHODS: The related articles of acupuncture treatment of PSS patients published from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2021 were collected from databases of CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu\u00ef\u00bcVIP), SinoMed, CHAOXING, DUXIU, PubMed, Ovid, Embase and Cochrane Library. After the articles were screened according to our formulated inclusion and exclusion criteria, a \"Clinical Literature Database of EA Treatment of PSS\" was established. The SPSS Modeler14.1 software was used for modeling (by using the parameters of EA, types of apoplexy sequelae, names of acupoints, methods of acupoint matching, acupoint-attributed meridians, etc.) and association rule analysis, and the Cytoscape 3.6.0 software was used for data network visualization analysis. RESULTS: A total of 354 articles were collected, including 13 types of PSS, among which the hemi-plegia accounts for the highest proportion (51.13%), followed by depression (17.51%) and dysphagia (14.97%). A total of 228 acupoints are used, with a total frequency-time of 1 690. Among the 8 PSS (hemiplegia, depression, dysphagia, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, speech disorders, constipation) with the frequency of application of acupoints greater than or equal to 3, 275 articles are involved, with the frequency of dense wave being the highest (123 times), followed by continuous waves (95 times). The stimulation frequency of EA appears 275 times, with the low frequency being the highest (188 times). For hemiplegia type of PSS, low frequency and continuous waves or dense waves are mostly used, and the high correlation acupoint groups are Zusanli(ST36)/Hegu(LI4), LI4/Quchi(LI11) and ST36/LI11. For depression, low frequency and dense waves are mostly used, and the high correlation acupoint groups are Baihui(GV20)/Yintang(EX-HN3), GV20/Shenting(GV24) and GV20/Neiguan(PC6). For swallowing disorder, the mostly used stimulation parameter is low frequency, and the high correlation acupoint groups are Lianquan(CV23)/ST36/Fenglong(ST40), Tongli(HT5)/Yifeng(TE17)/PC6/ST40, and TE17/HT5/PC6/LI4. CONCLUSION: EA therapy is frequently used in the treatment of PSS, for which ST36, LI4 and LI11 are most frequently used in the treatment of hemiplegia, with the stimulation parameters being low-frequency and continuous waves or dense waves. For depression, GV20, EX-HN3, GV24 and PC6 are used, with the stimulation parameters being low frequency and dense waves. For dysphagia, CV23, HT5, TE17, PC6, ST36, with low frequency electrical stimulation.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To analyze the optimum stimulating class=\"decs\" id=\"q000032\">analysis</a> of as to provide reference for clinical application. <h2>METHODS:</h2> The related articles <a class=\"decs\" January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2021 were collected from databases id=\"d007990\">Library</a>.

METHODS: Thirty male Japanese white rabbits were randomly divided into normal, model and acupotomy groups, with 10 rabbits in each group. The LIDD model was established by axial compression method, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to judge whether the model was successful or not. After modeling, the acupotomy was applied to lumbar (L)4-L5 spinous process space and bilateral transverse processes for loosening, twice a week for 4 weeks. The structural changes of L4-L5 intervertebral disc were observed by MRI. The morphological changes of lumbar spine were observed by HE staining. The expression of Caspase-3 in nucleus pulposus was observed by immunohistochemistry, and the protein expressions of DCN and BGN in intervertebral disc were detected by Western blot, separatively. RESULTS: After mode-ling, the rabbits showed slow movement, stiff back muscles with cords or nodules, the fibrous ring structure of lumbar intervertebral disc was disordered, the number of nucleus pulposus cells was reduced, and the signal intensity of L4-L5 intervertebral disc was decreased in the model group relevant to the normal group. At the same time, the expression of Caspase-3 in nucleus pulposus was increased significantly (P<0.05), and the expression levels of DCN and BGN in intervertebral disc were decreased significantly (P<0.05). After acupotomy treatment, the modeling induced slow movement, stiff back muscles and disordered structure of lumbar intervertebral disc were significantly improved. The number of nucleus pulposus cells was increased, the signal intensity of L4-L5 intervertebral disc was enhanced, the expression of Caspase-3 in nucleus pulposus was decreased significantly (P<0.05), and the expression levels of DCN and BGN in intervertebral disc were increased significantly (P<0.05) compared with the model group. CONCLUSION: Acupotomy intervention can inhibit cell apoptosis, reduce the degradation of extracellular matrix in nucleus pulposus of intervertebral disc, and restore the normal force balance and dynamic balance of lumbar spine, which may be one of its mechanisms underlying improving LIDD.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the effect of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015670\">acupotomy</a> to class=\"decs\" id=\"d015670\">acupotomy</a> groups, with 10 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d011817\">rabbits</a> in each group.

Research acupuncturists, particularly those trained in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are often required to set aside valued precepts of traditional care, including diagnosing imbalances, individualizing treatment, and forging a therapeutic relationship with patients. TCM-trained acupuncturists express mixed feelings about participating in clinical trials. Many are eager to play a vital role in the advancement of acupuncture science and appreciate the need for strict protocol adherence to minimize bias. However, the acupuncturist(s) may also have concerns about clinical trial methodology, including but not limited to the delivery of a control condition, e.g., sham acupuncture. Investigators should anticipate certain questions and even a level of resistance to the requirements of research among acupuncturists and be prepared to address them. This manuscript presents a brief review of the subjective experience of the research acupuncturist within the available scientific literature as it pertains to the delivery of active and sham clinical research protocols. Our goals are to better understand the perspectives of acupuncturists who may participate in clinical research, so that their concerns may be addressed in study design and methodology. To that end, we suggest the creation of a novel training program specifically for clinical trial acupuncturists, intended for qualified TCM- and Western-trained practitioners, that would help to standardize the research acupuncturist's role and help to strengthen the design and execution of acupuncture studies.

BRITAININGLATERRAENGLANDESCOCIASCOTLANDBACKGROUND: Frozen shoulder is a common disorder that can lead to long-lasting impairment in shoulder-related daily activities. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the effort to manage frozen shoulder. PURPOSE: We aimed to develop an evidence-based guideline for treating frozen shoulder with traditional Chinese medicine. STUDY DESIGN: Evidence-based guideline. METHODS: We developed this guideline based on internationally recognized and accepted guideline standards. The guideline development group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rate the certainty of evidence and the strength of recommendations. The benefits and harms, resources, accessibility, and other factors were fully taken into account, and the GRADE grid method was used to reach consensus on all recommendations. RESULTS: We established a multidisciplinary guideline development panel. Based on a systematic literature search and a face-to-face meeting, nine clinical questions were identified. Finally, twelve recommendations were reached by consensus, comprehensively considering the balance of benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, costs, clinical feasibility, accessibility, and clinical acceptability. CONCLUSION: This guideline panel made twelve recommendations, which covered the use of manual therapy, acupuncture, needle knife, Cheezheng Xiaotong plaster, Gutong plaster, exercise therapy and integrated TCM and Western medicine, such as combined modalities and corticosteroid injections. Most of them were weakly recommended or consensus based. The users of this guideline are most likely to be clinicians and health administrators.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d002062\">Frozen shoulder</a> is an to manage <a used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rate the certainty of evidence and the strength of recommendations.

Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), MAP variability (mean of MAP standard deviation), bispectral index (BIS), and calculated blood pressure Average Real Variability (ARV) were measured intraoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients participated: Group A, 41; Group B, 24; Group C, 26. Among patients undergoing open laparotomy, Group A showed lower and more stable MAP and HR compared to Group B, (MAP, p = 0.026; HR, p = 0.029) and Group C (MAP, p = 0.025). Mean BIS, from incision to suture closing, was lower in Group A (vs. controls, p = 0.024). In patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, MAP was elevated within Group A (p = 0.026) throughout surgery, with MAP variability significantly higher in Group A (P = 0.023) and Group B (P = 0.013) 10 min post-incision (vs. pre-incision). All groups showed similar intraoperative and post-anesthesia use of analgesic medication. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative acupuncture was shown to reduce and stabilize MAP and HR, and reduce BIS in gynecology oncology patients undergoing laparotomy, with no impact on perioperative analgesic medication use. In the laparoscopic setting, intraoperative acupuncture was associated with elevated MAP. Further research is needed to explore the hemodynamic and BIS-associated benefits and risks of intraoperative acupuncture, and the impact on the use of analgesic drugs in response to these changes.CONTEXT AND <h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2> The present study examined the (mean of MAP bispectral index (BIS), and calculated <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001794\">blood pressure</a> Average Real Variability (ARV) A total of 91 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> participated Group A, 41; Group B, 24; Among <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> undergoing open <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d007813\">laparotomy</a>, Group A showed lower and more stable MAP and HR compared to Group B, (MAP, p = 0.026; HR, p = 0.029) and Group C (MAP, p = 0.025).

We aimed to verify the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in reducing TTH frequency by meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). METHODS: Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched until September 29, 2022. Randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, no acupuncture, or other active therapies in adults with TTH were included. The primary outcome was TTH frequency. The secondary outcomes were responder rate and adverse event. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 2795 participants were included. Acupuncture had more reduction than sham acupuncture in TTH frequency, both after treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] - 0.80, 95% CI - 1.36 to - 0.24, P = 0.005) and at the follow-up period (SMD - 1.33, 95% CI - 2.18 to - 0.49, P = 0.002), while TSA showed the included sample size did not exceed required information size (RIS). Acupuncture was superior over no acupuncture after treatment (SMD - 0.52, 95% CI - 0.63 to - 0.41, P < 0.001), and cumulative sample size reached RIS. In terms of responder rate, acupuncture had a higher responder rate compared with sham acupuncture both after treatment (relative ratio [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.46, P = 0.0003) and the follow-up period (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.58, P < 0.0001), but the sample size is inadequate. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is an efficacious and safe treatment for TTH prevention, but this conclusion might be limited by the generally very low to low quality evidence. TSA suggested that high-quality trials are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">Acupuncture</a> id=\"d018781\">tension-type headache</a> (TTH) frequency in previous studies.

Military personnel and veterans are at high risk for posttraumatic stress disorder. Conventional posttraumatic stress disorder treatments have certain limitations. Complementary and integrative medicine treatments, especially acupuncture, are potential novel first-line treatments that may overcome these limitations. We aim to investigate the current status of the available clinical evidence related to acupuncture treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder in war veterans. We will follow the scoping review process as previously described. The study question is as follows: \"Which types of clinical research designs, study types, study durations, adverse events, and clinical outcomes have been reported regarding acupuncture therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in military veterans?\" We will perform a comprehensive search of Medline, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Scopus databases, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycArticles databases, as well as Chinese, Korean, and Japanese databases, from inception to June 2022.

During this period, a virtual acupuncturist-guided session of patient self-acupressure was implemented to provide continuity of supportive care for cancer patients. We provide preliminary findings on the feasibility and potential impact of remotely delivered acupressure on patient-reported symptom burden in cancer populations. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of cancer patients who received virtual acupressure service at a single academic cancer center from May 11 to December 31, 2020. Each telehealth session consisted of a one-on-one appointment between the patient and acupuncturist. A semi-standardized set of acupoints were used, including Yintang, ST36, GB20, PC6, and HT7 as well as Relaxation Point on the ear. At the start of each session, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) was used to collect patient-reported symptom burden. For patients with at least one follow-up within 14 days of the baseline visit, paired t-test was used to analyze changes in ESAS scores from baseline to first follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 102 virtual acupressure sessions were administered to 32 patients. Most patients were females (90.6%) and white (84.4%), and the mean age was 55.7 (range = 26-82; SD = 15.7). The most common cancer diagnosis was breast (53.1%), followed by pancreatic (12.5%) and lung (9.4%). Baseline ESAS Total, Physical, and Emotional scores were 21.5 (SD = 11.1), 12.4 (SD = 7.5), and 5.2 (SD = 3.8), respectively. Of 32 patients, 13 (41%) had a second acupressure session within 14 days. For these 13 patients, there was a statistically significant reduction in Total symptom burden (-4.9 \u00b1 7.6; p = 0.04) and in Physical (-3.5 5.4; p = 0.04) and Emotional (-1.2 \u00b1 p = 0.03) subscales from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Virtual acupressure was associated with significant reduction in symptom burden among cancer patients from their baseline to follow-up visits. Larger scale randomized clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings and better understand the impact of virtual acupressure on symptom burden in cancer populations.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> Following the outbreak of COVID-19, access to in-<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009272\">person</a> oncology for <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009369\">cancer</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a>.

Acupuncture and exercise are the most popular treatments currently. The outcomes for acupuncture for KOA, however, are controversial, with some researchers finding that the addition of acupuncture to exercise therapy provided no additional improvement in pain scores. Objective: The study intended to evaluate the therapeutic effects for KOA of exercise in combination with acupuncture on acupoints selected using the Traditional Chinse Medicine (TCM) theory of Equal Impact on Tendons, Bones, and Muscles (EITBM) in comparison with that of acupoints selected using classical consensus for the treatment. Design: The research team performed a randomized controlled trial. Setting: The study took place in the Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion at the First Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Chinese Medicine in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. Participants: Participants were 70 patients with KOA who visited the hospital between December 2020 and February 2021. Intervention: Participants in both group received acupuncture plus exercise therapy. The research team randomly assigned participants to one of two groups: (1) 35 to the intervention group, which received acupuncture using acupoints selected using EITBM, and (2) 35 to the control group, which received acupuncture using the classical consensus acupoints. Both groups performed a 25-min session of acupuncture three times weekly for 4 weeks, with the exercise therapy following the acupuncture each time. Outcome Measures: The research team assessed clinical efficacy at baseline and postintervention. The primary outcome measures included assessments: (1) of knee joint pain using a visual analog scale (VAS), (2) of knee joint pain, flexibility, and function using the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; and (3) joint range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcome measures included measurement of serum levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u00df), tumor necrosis factor (MMP-13) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results: The VAS and WOMAC scores significantly decreased for both groups between baseline and postintervention, and the intervention group's decrease was significantly greater than that of the control group. The ROM of knee flexion was significantly higher in both groups postintervention than at baseline, and the intervention group's increase was significantly higher than that of the control group. The serum IL-1\u00df, TNF-, and MMP-13 also significantly decreased postintervention in both groups, and the intervention group's levels were significantly lower than those of the control group. The total effective rate was 94.1% in the intervention group, 32 out of 34 participants, and 75.8% in the control group, 25 out of 33 participants, which was significantly different. Conclusions: Acupuncture, in combination with exercise, can relieve symptoms, improve joint function, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u00df and TNF-a) as well as MMP-13 for patients with KOA. The outcomes for acupuncture using EITBM acupoints were significantly better than those of the acupoints selected using classical consensus.Context <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d020370\">Knee osteoarthritis</a> The outcomes for <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> KOA, however, are controversial, with some <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d012108\">researchers</a> finding that <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001939\">pain</a> scores. <h2>Objective:</h2> The study intended to id=\"d045506\">therapeutic effects</a> for controlled trial</a>. <h2>Setting:</h2> The study took of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">Acupuncture</a> and id=\"d006761\">hospital</a> between December 2020 and February 2021.

Treatment can be surgical or non-surgical. Korean Medicine, including acupuncture and pharmacopuncture, is a part of conservative treatment. Pharmacopuncture, combining acupuncture with herbal medicine, has been used for musculoskeletal disorders since the 1960s, but clinical evidence on its effectiveness is lacking. Objectives: This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacopuncture for rotator cuff disease. Methods: A two-group, parallel, single-center, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial will be conducted. A total of 40 patients will be recruited, starting in July 2022. All patients will be received acupuncture treatment, and pharmacopuncture will be applied to intervention group additionally. After eight treatments are delivered over four weeks, follow-up assessments will be performed. Results: Assessments will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these treatments at baseline and at weeks 2 (2 W), 4 (4 W), and 8 (8 W). The primary outcome will be a visual analog scale (VAS) evaluation of shoulder pain levels. Assessments will include shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), shoulder range of motion (ROM), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), patient global impression of change (PGIC), 'no worse than mild pain', and drug consumption rates. Conclusion: This study may offer a rationale for a future full-scale trial on the effectiveness and safety of pharmacopuncture treatment for rotator cuff disease and provide data on non-surgical treatment for the disease.<h2>Background:</h2> <a been used for musculoskeletal disorders since the 1960s, but clinical evidence on its <a class=\"decs\" id=\"ddcs016735\">effectiveness</a> is lacking. <h2>Objectives:</h2> This study <a class=\"decs\" additionally.

However, to more accurately examine the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment effectiveness in pathological models, it is crucial to investigate changes in disease-free animals. Among various hypotheses regarding the effects of acupuncture on the body, we focused on the result that acupuncture stimulation is related to mitochondria. Objectives: We examined the effects of into control, SP1, SP2, SP3, SP5, and SP9 acupuncture groups. Acupuncture was performed at each point for 10 minutes daily for four days. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1- (PGC-1) and fission protein 1 (Fis1) levels were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), while dynamin-related (MFN2) levels western blotting. Mitochondria protein concentrations and NADH dehydrogenase activity in spleen tissues were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: PGC-1 expression decreased in the SP1 (p < 0.01), SP5 (p < 0.05), and SP9 (p < 0.05) groups, while Fis1 expression increased in the SP1 (p < 0.01), SP5 (p < 0.01), and SP9 (p < 0.05) groups. DRP1, OPA1, MFN1, and MFN2 levels exhibited no significant changes. Mitochondrial protein concentrations decreased in the SP2 (p < 0.01), SP3 (p < 0.01), SP5 (p < 0.01), and SP9 (p < 0.01) groups, while NADH dehydrogenase activity decreased in the SP2 (p < 0.05) and SP9 (p < 0.05) groups.

KOREACOREA DEL SURBackground: Pain related to Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) is severe, negatively affecting patients' quality of life, and often resistant to conventional treatments. Abdominal Acupuncture (AA) is known to be particularly effective for pain, especially chronic and musculoskeletal pain, but it is still poorly studied and never investigated in TMD patients. Objectives: To analyze the efficacy of AA for the treatment of patients with subacute and chronic pain related to TMD and non-responding to previous conventional therapies (occlusal splint, medications, physical therapy). Methods: Twenty-eight patients, 24 F and four M (mean age 49.36 years), were recruited from January 2019-February 2021. All patients underwent AA treatment: two sessions per week for four weeks, for a total of eight sessions. At the beginning of therapy (T0) and at the end of the cycle (T1) the following data were evaluated: maximum mouth opening (MMO); cranio-facial pain related to TMD (verbal numeric scale, VNS); pain interference with normal activities and quality of life of patients (Brief Pain Inventory, BPI); oral functioning (Oral Behavior Checklist, OBC); impression of treatment effectiveness (Patients' Global Impression of Improvement, PGI-I Scale). Statistical comparison of data before and after the AA treatment was performed by Wilcoxon's signed-rank test (significance level p < 0.05). Results: The MMO values were significantly improved after one cycle of AA (p = 0.0002). In addition, TMD-related pain had a statistically significant decline following AA treatment (all p < 0.001). Patients' general activity and quality of life (BPI) were described as improved following a course of AA, with statistically significant values for all aspects considered (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: Abdominal acupuncture resulted in effective treatment of subacute/chronic-resistant pain related to TMD, capable of improving mandibular function and facial pain, and reduced the interference of pain affecting patients' quality of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"ddcs060068\">Abdominal Acupuncture</a> class=\"decs\" id=\"d001939\">pain</a>, especially chronic and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d059352\">musculoskeletal pain</a>, but it is still poorly studied and never investigated in TMD <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a>. <h2>Objectives:</h2> To analyze four M (mean age 49.36 years), were recruited from January 2019-February id=\"d010361\">patients</a> underwent AA <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> two sessions per week for four weeks, for a total of eight sessions.

Currently, there is no study in which Bayesian network meta-analysis is applied to making a comparative analysis of efficacy of different combination therapies of -RBs and traditional Chinese medicine external therapy in the treatment of CP/CPPS. Therefore, based on Bayesian algorithm, a network meta-analysis was conducted by us to make a comparison between different combination therapies of -RBs and traditional Chinese medicine external therapy. METHODS: A document retrieval was conducted in the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data Dissertations of China database, VIP China Science and Technology Journal Database, SinoMed. Literatures were searched for published in biomedical journals concerning clinical study on -RBs combined with various traditional Chinese medicine external therapies in the treatment of CP/CPPS from inception of database to July 2022. Newest version risks of bias assessment tool (RoB2) was used to assess the risks of bias of studies included in this analysis. Stata 16.0 software and R4.1.3 software were used to make a Bayesian network meta-analysis and charts. RESULTS: 19 literatures were included involving 1739 patients concerning 12 interventions which were used in the treatment of CP/CPPS. With respect to the total effective rate, -RBs+ needling was most likely to be the optimal treatment. Concerning National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) total score, -RBs+ moxibustion+ auricular point sticking was most likely to be optimal treatment, the therapy ranking second was -RBs+ needling, and the therapy ranking third was -RBs+ moxibustion. Pain score, voiding score and quality-of-life score are subdomains of the NIH-CPSI total score. With regard to pain score, -RBs+ moxibustion was most likely to be optimal treatment. In reference to voiding and quality-of-life score, there was no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of various interventions. CONCLUSIONS: -RBs+ needling, -RBs+ moxibustion and -RBs+ moxibustion+ auricular point provided relatively good efficacy in the treatment of CP/CPPS. In these treatments, attention should be paid on -RBs+ needling and -RBs+ moxibustion which ranked higher many times in the evaluation of various outcome indicators. However, there still were certain limitations in this study, so large-sample clinical randomized control trials with a rigor design following the evidence-based medicine standards need to be conducted to justify the results of this study.

METHODS: In this meta-epidemiological study, we searched the Cochrane library from its inception until December 2021, and identified systematic reviews and meta-analyses with acupuncture as one of the interventions. Paired reviewers independently screened the reviews and extracted the information. We repeated the meta-analysis of the selected outcomes to separately pool the results of Chinese- and non-Chinese-language acupuncture studies and presented the pooled estimates as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We calculated the Ratio of ORs (ROR) by dividing the OR of the Chinese-language trials by the OR of the non-Chinese-language trials, and the ROR by dividing the OR of trials addressing Chinese population by the OR of trials addressing non-Chinese population. We explored whether the impact of a high risk of bias on the effect size differed between studies published in Chinese- and in non-Chinese-language, and whether the treatment effects of acupuncture differed between Chinese and non-Chinese population. RESULTS: We identified 84 Cochrane acupuncture reviews involving 33 Cochrane groups, of which 31 reviews (37%) searched Chinese databases. Searching versus not searching Chinese databases significantly increased the contribution of Chinese-language literature both to the total number of included trials (54% vs. 15%) and the sample size (40% vs. 15%). When compared with non-Chinese-language trials, Chinese-language trials were associated with a larger effect size (pooled ROR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.91). We also observed a higher risk of bias in Chinese-language trials in blinding of participants and personnel (97% vs. 51%) and blinding of outcome assessment (93% vs. 47%). The higher risk of bias was associated with a larger effect estimate in both Chinese-language (allocation concealment: high/unclear risk vs. low risk, ROR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.87) and non-Chinese-language studies (blinding of participants and personnel: high/unclear risk vs. low risk, ROR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.74). However, we found no evidence that the higher risk of bias would increase the effect size of acupuncture in Chinese-language studies more often than in non-Chinese-language studies (the confidence intervals of all ROR in the high-risk group included 1, Table 3). We further found acupuncture appeared to be more effective in Chinese than in non-Chinese population (Table 4). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest the higher risk of bias may lead to an overestimation of the treatment effects of acupuncture but would not increase the treatment effects in Chinese-language studies more often than in other language studies. The difference in treatment effects of acupuncture was probably associated with differences in population characteristics.

Especially, it is often accompanied by cognitive impairment of the brain. Acupuncture is safe and effective for improving cognitive function, but its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is an important means to study brain activity changes. However, the results are inconsistent and lack systematic evaluation and analysis. METHODS: We will search 9 databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCOhost-Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Database and Wan-Fang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and 2 clinical trials register platforms: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov/) from inception to November 1, 2022. We will use the Review Manager 5.4 software provided by the Cochrane Collaborative Network for statistical analysis. We then assessed the quality and risk of the included studies and observed the outcome measures. RESULTS: This study will analyze the effect of acupuncture on brain activity changes, improvement of sleep duration, and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture on brain activity changes in sleep deprivation comorbid with cognitive dysfunction, so as to provide effective evidence for clarifying its pathogenesis.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d003071\">cognitive function</a>, but its underlying class=\"decs\" id=\"ddcs036438\">state</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008279\">functional magnetic means to study <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d001921\">brain</a> activity changes.

It rapidly produces long-lasting effects in soft tissue injuries, particularly in painful musculoskeletal conditions, by providing stimulation primarily in the subcutaneous area. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in adults worldwide and is often accompanied by a painful syndrome of structural changes in the peripheral joints of the knee. However, the etiology of OA pain is not fully understood, though myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) are commonly found in the lower limb muscles (so-called \"tightened muscles\") of patients with knee OA. FSN has been used in many fields for the treatment of acute pain problems and can relieve muscle contraction from MTrPs, thereby improving the local circulation. This study recruited patients with pain from knee OA into an FSN group or a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) group with three treatment sessions and a follow-up over the course of 2 weeks. The results showed that FSN was effective in treating soft tissue pain around the knee with OA. This study aimed to establish and visualize three key technical indicators during FSN therapy, including the FSN needle insertion point and layer; the frequency and duration of the swaying movement; and the manipulation of the reperfusion approach. These findings have great potential for future applications in myofascial pain treatment, especially for pain management.

AT is an effective treatment for many diseases, but its efficacy in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. Therefore, we performed the present meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of AT in stable COPD patients. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for AT efficacy in stable COPD patients were searched in literature databases from the inception to December 31, 2021. Pooled effect sizes of outcome measurements with respect to lung function (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], FEV1 in predicted value [FEV1%], FEV1/FVC), quality of life (St. George respiratory questionnaire [SGRQ]), exercise capacity (6-minute walking distance [6MWD]) and effective rate were estimated by calculating weighted mean difference (WMD) or odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI), respectively, by a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 28 RCTs with 2130 COPD patients were included. AT group had significant improvement in FVC (WMD = 0.29 L, 95% CI: 0.22-0.36, CI: -12.34 to -3.24, P < .001), and higher effective rate (OR = 3.71, 95% CI: 2.50-5.52, P < .001) compared to the control group. Subgroup analysis stratified by comparison model (AT combined with other treatments vs other treatments, AT alone vs sham AT) and treatment duration (8 weeks, <8 weeks) also showed more improvement in AT arm than control arm without significant between-subgroup difference. Adverse events were reported in a few studies and only mild reactions were observed. CONCLUSION: AT is effective in improving lung function, quality of life and exercise capacity, and can be used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with stable COPD.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" we performed class=\"decs\" id=\"d017418\">meta-analysis</a> to evaluate the from the inception to December 31, 2021.

Acupuncture is one of the measures for sleep apnea syndrome, and it is also widely used in stroke. However, we are concerned that its efficacy and safety in the treatment of stroke with sleep apnea syndrome are not yet clear. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses schema and was registered with INPLASY (registration number: INPLASY202250113). The following 8 databases were searched: PubMed, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP Information, WanFang Data, and China Biomedical Literature Database limited from the establishment of each database to May 4, 2022. Subject headings, free words, and keywords were used for retrieval. Relevant literature was supplemented by consulting other resources. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RevMan 5.4 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020) was used to perform the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Six records were included, including a total of 513 participants: 256 in the experimental group and 257 in the control group.

However, the exact mechanism by which electroacupuncture improves stroke hemiparesis is uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of electroacupuncture care on sirt3 levels in elderly patients with stroke hemiparesis. METHODS: One hundred and ten elderly patients with hemiplegia after first stroke were divided into an experimental group and a control group (n\u00e2 =\u00e2 55 in each group). The control group was given conventional rehabilitation care by a rehabilitation therapist. In the experimental group, on the basis of conventional rehabilitation care, electroacupuncture was performed once a day for 28 days. RESULTS: Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) and barthel index (BI) scores were significantly higher, while neurologic deficit scale (NDS) and physiological state scores were significantly lower in both groups after 14 and 28 days of intervention compared to preintervention. The Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model also showed that the experimental group showed more favorable improvements in all outcomes at postintervention time points compared to the control group. After the intervention, serum sirt3 levels increased significantly in both groups compared to preintervention, and the increase was more pronounced in the experimental group. Consistently, the GEE model showed that serum sirt3 levels were significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group at postintervention time points. Correlation analysis revealed that serum sirt3 levels in the experimental group were negatively correlated with FMA and BI pre- and postintervention, while showing a significant positive correlation with NDS and physiological state scores. CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture intervention led to significant improvements in motor function, activities of daily living and neurological function in elderly patients with stroke hemiplegia, which may be associate with increased serum sirt3 levels.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015670\">Acupuncture treatment</a> uncertain.

Neuroplasticity may be a pivotal bridge to elucidate the potential recovery mechanisms of acupuncture for aphasia. Therefore, understanding the neuroplasticity mechanism of acupuncture in PSA is crucial. However, the underlying therapeutic mechanism of neuroplasticity in PSA after acupuncture needs to be explored. Excitotoxicity after brain injury affects the activity of neurotransmitters and disrupts the transmission of normal neuron information. Thus, a helpful strategy of acupuncture might be to improve PSA by affecting the availability of these neurotransmitters and glutamate receptors at synapses. In addition, the regulation of neuroplasticity by acupuncture may also be related to the regulation of astrocytes. Considering the guiding significance of acupuncture for clinical treatment, it is necessary to carry out further study about the influence of acupuncture on the recovery of aphasia after stroke. This study summarizes the current research on the neural mechanism of acupuncture in treating PSA.

Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) is a modern acupuncture therapy based on basic medicine commonly used in patients with pain. However, evidence of its effectiveness in treating cancer pain has not been systematically proven. Therefore, this pragmatic randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of FSN for cancer pain management. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Overall, 120 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned into two groups using block randomisation. Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The treatment group will receive FSN therapy one time a day for 6 days. Additionally, we will assess analgesic consumption as the primary outcome and the Numerical Rating Scale, outbreak pain, symptom assessment and adverse events as secondary outcomes to evaluate the effect and safety of FSN in treating cancer pain. The incidence of adverse events will be monitored to assess the safety of FSN. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (approval No: K(2021)096). The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and trial participants will be informed via email and/or phone calls.

As a main disabling motor impairment after stroke, spasticity has unexpected negative impacts on the quality of life and social participation in patients. Moreover, it brings heavy economic burden to the family and society. Previous researches indicated that abnormality of neural modulation and muscle property corelates with the pathogenesis of poststroke spasticity (PSS). So far, there still lacks golden standardized treatment regimen for PSS; furthermore, certain potential adverse-events of the mainstream therapy, for example, drug-induced generalized muscle weakness or high risk related surgery somehow decrease patient preference and compliance, which brings challenges to disease treatment and follow-up care. As an essential non-pharmacological therapy, acupuncture has long been used for PSS in China and shows favorable effects on improvements of spastic hypertonia and motor function. Notably, previous studies focused mainly on the research of antispastic acupoints. In comparison, few studies lay special stress on the other significant factor impacting on acupuncture efficacy, that is acupuncture technique. Based on current evidences from the clinic and laboratory, we will discuss certain new insights into acupuncture technique, in particular the antispastic needling technique, for PSS management in light of its potential effects on central modulations as well as peripheral adjustments, and attempt to provide some suggestions for future studies with respect to the intervention timing and course, application of acupuncture techniques, acupoint selection, predictive and aggravating factors of PSS, aiming at optimization of antispastic acupuncture regimen and improvement of quality of life in stroke patients.

METHODS: The comprehensive search for all randomized controlled trials regarding NPCM therapies for the treatment of DLSS was performed through online databases searches, commencing from their inception to January 1st, 2023. The relevant literature underwent a thorough screening process, and the data was meticulously extracted and subjected to analysis through the implementation of RevMan 5.3 software. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was employed to assess the potential risk of bias. The synthesis of evidence was performed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. RESULTS: The extensive search procedure produced 5674 records, including data from 37 studies of 38 comparisons (2965 participants). Moderate evidence was obtained demonstrating that the application of acupuncture for a duration of 6-8 weeks was significantly superior to sham acupuncture in terms of intermediate-term (6 months) alleviation of back pain (2 trials, n = 128; MD, -1.08; 95% CI, -1.81\u00e2\u00bc-0.34) and improvement in lumbar function (2 trials, n = 128; MD, -1.40; 95% CI, -2.93\u00e2\u00bc-0.13). The available low evidence suggested that, as compared to sham acupuncture, acupuncture was effective in reducing short-term (3 months) back pain and enhancing lumbar function but had no impact on leg pain. A trial with low risk of bias found that acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture in enhancing disability and walking capabilities. The other studies presented inconsistent evidence with regards to the efficacy of the various interventions employed. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of low-to-moderate quality suggests that for DLSS patients, the implementation of acupuncture in comparison to sham acupuncture presents favorable outcomes in terms of short- and intermediate-term alleviation of back pain, improvement in lumbar function, enhancement of disability and walking capacity. The conclusion regarding the efficacy of other NPCM therapies was not obtained due to the insufficient quality of the available evidence.

METHODS: Five acupuncture needle models with different surface patterns, including the smooth needle, the lined needle, the ringed needle, the left-hand threaded needle and the right-hand threaded needle, and a layered model of the Zusanli acupoint were used to investigate how to reduce tissue damage and increase stimulation during acupuncture treatment. Puncturing of the skin as well as lifting-inserting and twisting needle manipulations were simulated using these models, and the degree of damage and force of stimulation caused by the acupuncture needles with different surface patterns during acupuncture were compared. RESULTS: The smooth needle and the lined needle caused the least tissue damage during insertion, while the left-hand threaded and the right-hand threaded needles caused the most damage. The ringed needle, the left-hand threaded needle and the right-hand threaded needle stimulated the acupoint tissue more during lifting-inserting manipulations, while the lined needle and the smooth needle produced less stimulation. The stimulation of the lined needle on the acupoint tissue was the largest during twisting manipulation, whereas the left-hand threaded needle and the right-hand threaded needle had smaller effects. In lifting-inserting and twisting manipulations, both the left-hand threaded needle and right-hand threaded needle provided more stimulation, but the torsion direction in which they produced better stimulation was the opposite. CONCLUSION: According to the simulation results, the ringed pattern enhances stimulation best in the lifting-inserting manipulation, whereas the lined pattern enhances stimulation best in the twisting manipulation. Both the right-hand and left-hand thread patterns have certain enhancing effects in these two operations. Taking the geometric properties of the pattern into account, the left-hand thread pattern and the right-hand thread pattern have the geometric characteristics of both the lined pattern and the ringed pattern. To conclude, a pattern perpendicular to the movement direction during the acupuncture manipulation creates more stimulation. These results have significance for future needle design.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of Shallow Puncture and More Twirling method of acupuncture in treating migraine and its impact on serum 5-HT and \u00df-EP. METHODS: A total of 76 patients with migraine were randomized into a control group and acupuncture group with 38 cases in each. In the control group, patients were orally administered flunarizine hydrochloride before sleep, 2 capsules once daily for 4 weeks. In the acupuncture group, Shallow Puncture and More Twirling method was adopted for the acupoints of Sizhukong (SJ 23), Toulinqi (GB 15) Shuaigu 5), Fengchi (GB 20), Waiguan (SJ 5), Zulinqi (GB 41). Patients were given acupuncture 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Then, the total VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scores, composite score of migraine, serum level of 5-HT and \u00df-EP, and the clinical efficacy differences were observed before and after treatment and the side-effects were recorded among the two groups. RESULTS: The total VAS scores and composite score of migraine were significantly reduced among both groups after the treatment (P< 0.05), and the serum level of 5-HT and \u00df-EP was significantly improved (P< 0.05). Compared with control group, the acupuncture group reported lower results in VAS score and migraine composite score (P< 0.05), and higher results in serum 5-HT and \u00df-EP level (P< 0.05). The acupuncture group with shallow puncture and more twirling method showed a total effective rate of 86.5%, which is higher than the control group (78.4%). The difference is statistically significant (P< 0.05).

Functional brain networks can provide connectivity information among brain regions. OBJECTIVE: The study goal is to explore the regulatory effect of acupuncture on the brain functional network. METHODS: This paper analyzes the electroencephalography (EEG)-based power spectrum and brain functional network elicited by acupuncture at Quchi (LI 11). RESULTS: The power spectrum results showed that acupuncture at LI 11 decreased the energy in the alpha frequency, mainly in the central region, left parietal lobe, left temporal lobe and left frontal lobe. Moreover, functional brain networks converted from the magnitude-squared coherence matrix in the alpha band are reconstructed. The results show that acupuncture did not alter the basic properties of the brain functional connection network. During acupuncture, the average node degree, average clustering coefficient, and small-world property of the brain functional connection network decreased after acupuncture compared with that before it. However, the average characteristic path length increased after acupuncture compared with before. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at LI 11 altered the brain's electrical activity. In the meantime, this acupuncture reduced the network's internal connectivity and information transfer efficiency.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> As class=\"decs\" id=\"d008516\">traditional regions. <h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> The study <a class=\"decs\" explore the id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> on 11). results showed that <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> at LI 11 decreased the energy in the alpha frequency, mainly in the central region, left <a class=\"decs\" the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"ddcs034703\">magnitude</a>-squared coherence matrix in the alpha band are reconstructed.

Many studies have shown the various effects of acupuncture around the eyes for ophthalmologic or nonophthalmologic conditions. For ophthalmologic conditions, the effect of acupuncture on dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, myopia, amblyopia, ophthalmoplegia, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, blepharospasm, and blepharoptosis has been reported. Recently, several studies on dry eye syndrome have been reported and are in the spotlight. However, given the variety of study designs and reported outcomes of periocular acupuncture, research is still inconclusive, and further studies are required. In addition, although a systematic and reliable safety assessment is required, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of a literature review of ocular complications resulting from periocular acupuncture. This review collected cases of ocular injury as severe adverse events from previously published case reports of periocular acupuncture. A total of 14 case reports (15 eyes of 14 patients) of adverse events published between 1982 and 2020 were identified.

Measuring CPZ in vivo can assist doctors in evaluating patients' blood drug concentration and monitoring drug metabolism. Therefore, an accurate in vivo detection of CPZ is crucial. In recent years, the acupuncture needle, traditionally used in Chinese medicine, has emerged as a potential electrode in the field of electrochemistry, with promising applications for in vivo detection. In this study, Au/Cu nanoparticles were electrodeposited onto an acupuncture needle electrode (ANE) to improve electrical conductivity and provide an electro-catalytic surface. Subsequently, 3-aminophenylboronic acid and CPZ were attracted to each other through intermolecular forces; at the same time, the interaction force of Au-S between CPZ and the AuNPs made the polymer layer grow around the CPZ molecules on the modified electrode surface. The imprinted nanocavities showed highly selective and sensitive detection performance for CPZ after elution. Inside the recognizable site and microenvironment of the cavities, the captured CPZ molecule provided a suitable configuration for the fluent electron transfer of the electroactive group within a short range from the Au/Cu bimetal. Under ideal conditions, the MIP/Au/Cu/ANE exhibited two good linear ranges of 0.1-100 \u00b5M and 100-1000 \u00b5M with a detection limit of 0.07 \u00b5M. Moreover, the sensors showed great selectivity, good stability and excellent repeatability, making them suitable for CPZ detection in human serum.

This overview is aimed at summarizing current systematic reviews of acupuncture for EH and assessing the methodological bias and quality of evidence. Methods: Two researchers searched and extracted 7 databases for systematic reviews (SRs)/meta-analyses (MAs) and independently assessed the methodological quality, risk of bias, reporting quality, and quality of evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the SRs/MAs. Tools used included the measurement tool to assess systematic reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), the risk of bias in systematic (ROBIS) scale, the checklist of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA), and the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: This overview included 14 SRs/MAs that use quantitative calculations to comprehensively assess the various effects of acupuncture in essential hypertension interventions. The methodological quality, reporting quality, risk of bias, and quality of evidence for outcome measures of SRs/MAs were all unsatisfactory. According to the results of the AMSTAR-2 assessment, all SRs/MAs were of low or very low quality. According to the results of the ROBIS evaluation, a few SRs/MAs were assessed as low risk of bias. According to the results of the PRISMA checklist assessment, SRs/MAs that were not fully reported on the checklist accounted for the majority. According to the GRADE system, 86 outcomes were assessed under different interventions in SRs/MAs, and 2 were rated as moderate-quality evidence, 23 as low-quality evidence, and 61 as very low-quality evidence. Limitations of the included SRs/MAs included the lack of necessary items, such as not being registered in the protocol, not providing a list of excluded studies, and not analyzing and addressing the risk of bias.

Acupuncture may have beneficial effects in the management of chemotherapy-associated insomnia. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in improving chemotherapy-associated insomnia in breast cancer patients. METHODS: This assessor-participant blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial was conducted from November 2019 to January 2022 (follow-up completed July 2022). Participants were referred by oncologists from two Hong Kong hospitals. Assessments and interventions were conducted at the outpatient clinic of School of Chinese Medicine, the University of Hong Kong. The 138 breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-associated insomnia were randomly assigned to receive either 15 sessions of active acupuncture regimen by combining needling into body acupoints and acupressure on auricular acupoints or sham acupuncture control (69 each) for 18 weeks, followed by 24 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome was measured using Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Secondary outcomes included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Actiwatch and sleep diary for sleep parameters, depression and anxiety, fatigue and pain, and quality of life. RESULTS: There were 87.7% (121/138) participants who completed the primary endpoint (week-6). The active acupuncture regimen was not superior to the sham control in reducing ISI score from baseline to 6 weeks (mean difference: - 0.4, 95% CI - 1.8-1.1; P = 0.609), but produced short-term treatment and long-term follow-up better outcomes in improving sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Participants of the active acupuncture group had a pronouncedly higher cessation rate of sleeping medications than the sham control (56.5% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.011). All treatment-related adverse events were mild. No participants discontinued treatments due to adverse events.

The skin temperature of acupoints can reflect the state of local tissue and may be a potential factor for guiding acupoint selection. This study aims to compare the skin temperature of acupoints between KOA patients and the healthy population. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a protocol for a cross-sectional case-control study with 170 KOA patients and 170 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals. Diagnosed patients aged 45 to 70 will be recruited in the KOA group. Participants in the healthy group will be matched with the KOA group based on mean age and gender distribution. Skin temperature of from infrared thermography (IRT) images of the lower limbs. Other measurements will include demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity, education, height, weight, BMI) and disease-related data (numerical rating scale, pain sites, duration of pain, pain descriptors, pain activities). DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide biological evidence for acupoint selection. This study is a precondition for follow-up studies, in which the value of optimized acupoint selection will be verified.

METHODS: A total of 60 patients with comorbid mild-to-moderate depressive disorder and insomnia were randomly divided into an observation group (30 cases, 1 case dropped off) and a control group (30 cases, 2 cases dropped off). In the observation group, acupuncture and low frequency repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) were combined for the intervention. Acupuncture was applied to Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (GV 24+), Neiguan (PC 6) and Yanglingquan (GB 34), etc., the needles were retained for 30 min; and the intradermal needles were embedded at Xinshu (BL 15) and Danshu (BL 19) for 2 days. After acupuncture, the rTMS was delivered at the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC), with 1 Hz and 80% of movement threshold, lasting 30 min in each treatment. In the control group, the sham-acupuncture was adopted, combined with low frequency rTMS. The acupoint selection and manipulation were the same as the observation group. In the two groups, acupuncture was given once every two days, 3 times weekly; while, rTMS was operated once daily, for consecutive 5 days a week. The duration of treatment consisted of 4 weeks. Hamilton depression scale-17 (HAMD-17) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores were observed before and after treatment, as well as 1 month after the treatment completion (follow-up period) separately. Besides, the levels of nerve growth factor (BDNF) and \u00ce\u00b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the serum were detected before and after treatment in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment and in follow-up, the HAMD-17 scores were lower than those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.05), and the scores in the observation group were lower than the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the total scores and the scores of each factor of PSQI were reduced in the two groups in comparison with those before treatment except for the score of sleep efficiency in the control group (P<0.05); the total PSQI score and the scores for sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep efficiency and daytime dysfunction in the observation group were all lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). In the follow-up, except for the scores of sleep duration and sleep efficiency in the control group, the total PSQI score and the scores of all the other factors were reduced compared with those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.05); the total PSQI score and the scores of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency and daytime dysfunction in the observation group were lower than the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the levels of serum BDNF and GABA were increased in comparison with those before treatment in the observation group (P<0.05), and the level of serum BDNF was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture relieves depressive mood and improves sleep quality in patients with comorbid mild-to-moderate depressive disorder and insomnia. The effect mechanism may be related to the regulation of BDNF and GABA levels and the promotion of brain neurological function recovery.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the impacts of <a an <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019370\">observation</a> group (30 cases, 1 case dropped off) and a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d035061\">control group</a> (30 cases, 2 cases <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019370\">observation</a> group, were combined 34), the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009339\">needles</a> were 30 min; (BL for 2 days.

The \"body-mind holism\" is valuable in the guidance for clinical acupuncture practice, but, it is only remained on the theoretical significance by the medical masters in the past dynasties. In the paper, based on the understanding of Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic), the similarities and differences are compared between the body-mind theory and psychosomatic medicine. In association with clinical observation, from three aspects, i.e. body-mind pathogenesis, acupoint detection and observing the mind, and body-mind treatment, the guidance of \"body-mind holism\" is explored for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of acupuncture and moxibustion; the referents of \"body\" and \"mind\" are clarified in views of disease, diagnosis and treatment; and the treatment strategies of acupuncture and moxibustion are discussed in the perspective of \"body-mind holism\".The medicine</a>.

Professor SUN, the master of traditional Chinese medicine, believes that depression refers to comorbidity of \"heart mind\" and \"body\", resulting from the \"body-mind\" disharmony, specially dominated by the emotional disorder. This disease is located in the brain, with the injury of mind and closely related to the heart and liver dysfunction. In pathogenesis, the dysfunction of brain mind and the unhealthy conditions of body and mind are involved. The treatment should focus on \"regulating the mind, improving the intelligence, co-modulating the abdominal and brain functions and treating the physical and mental disorders\". Baihui (GV 20), Ningshen (Extra) and emotional area on the head are selected as the main points to benefit the intelligence and calming down the mind; the abdominal region 1 and region 8 of \"Sun's abdominal acupuncture\" are used as the main points of the abdomen to regulate the brain functions. The point prescription is modified according to the symptoms and etiologies. The repeated transcranial acupuncture stimulation and electroacupuncture at low frequency (2 Hz) are crucial to the therapeutic effect. Reliving anxious emotions is specially considered before acupuncture, and the mind is protected and deqi is consolidated during the \"body-mind\" dominated by the emotional disorder.

Chronic urticaria refers to \"mind and body comorbidity\" because qi and blood dysfunction and emotional abnormality are presented simultaneously in the disease and affected each other. In clinical diagnosis and treatment, the mutual regulation of mind and body should be considered to improve the curative effect. In treatment with acupuncture and moxibustion, through regulating the mind of brain, heart and zang organs, as well as qi movement, the mental activity is adjusted; through harmonizing the defensive qi and the nutrient blood, eliminating wind and stopping itching, the unhealthy conditions of body are treated. The comprehensive therapy of acupuncture is adopted in combination with moxibustion, bloodletting and auricular point therapy, in which, \"regulating the mind\" goes through the whole process of treatment, and the doctors and patients are well cooperated to ensure the qi-blood harmonization and presented simultaneously in the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004194\">disease</a> and id=\"d012926\">regulation</a> of mind and body should be considered to improve the curative effect.

METHODS: From January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2022, the articles for clinical researches of acupuncture and moxibustion for aphasia published in CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, EMbase were searched. Using Microsoft Excel 2021, the database was set up to analyze the use frequency of acupoint, meridian tropism, acupoint distribution and the use of specific points. SPSS26.0 was adopted for factor analysis, SPSS Modeler 18.0 was for association rule analysis of prescriptions, and Gephi 0.9.5 was to plot the co-occurrence network diagrams of acupoints and meridians. RESULTS: A total of 140 articles were collated, including 146 acupuncture and moxibustion prescriptions and 189 acupoints. The total use frequency of these acupoints was 1 211. Lianquan (GV 15) were the top 5 acupoints of the high use frequency for aphasia treated with acupuncture and moxibustion. Among 189 acupoints collected, the extra points and empirical points were mostly selected. The top 3 involved meridians were the governor vessel, the gallbladder meridian of foot-shaoyang and the conception vessel. These acupoints were mostly distributed on the head, face and neck region. The use frequency of five-shu points was the highest among the specific points. The acupoint combinations of high frequency referred 12).

METHODS: A total of 70 patients (89 affected eyes) with glaucoma-induced optic atrophy were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 35 cases in each group. The control group was given basic western medicine treatment. In the observation group, on the basis of the treatment in the control group, acupuncture was applied at main acupoints i.e. Baihui (GV 20), Shangjingming (Extra), Chengqi (ST 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Zusanli (ST 36), combined with supplementary acupoints based on syndrome differentiation, once every three days, twice a week. The treatment for 3 months was required in both groups. Before treatment, after treatment and in follow-up of 6 months after treatment, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), indexes of visual field (visual field index [VFI], mean deviation [MD], pattern standard deviation [PSD]) and mean thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) were observed in the two groups. RESULTS: Compared before treatment, BCVA was decreased after treatment and in follow-up in the control group (P<0.05); in the follow-up, BCVA in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). On each time point before and after treatment, there was no significant difference within or between the two groups (P>0.05). After treatment and in the follow-up, the mean thickness of RNFL was larger than the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: On the basis of the basic western medicine treatment, acupuncture can delay the decline of vision and the thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer in patients with glaucoma-induced optic atrophy.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the clinical <a each group. 1), Fengchi (GB Zusanli (ST 36), combined supplementary <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015669\">acupoints</a> based on <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013577\">syndrome</a> differentiation, once three days, twice a week.

METHODS: Forty-five patients with chronic persistent asthma (observation group) and 45 healthy subjects (control group) were selected. The body surface temperature of bilateral Feishu (BL 13), Geshu (BL 17), Pishu measured by BK-MT02A medical infrared thermography. RESULTS: The body surface temperature Feishu (BL 17), Pishu (BL 20) and Shenshu (BL 23) in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). The body surface temperature of bilateral Feishu (BL 13) and Geshu (BL 17) was higher of ipsilateral Pishu (BL 20) and Shenshu (BL 23) in the two groups (P<0.01, P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in body surface temperature between ipsilateral Feishu (BL 13) and (P>0.05). (BL 17), Pishu (BL 20) and Shenshu (BL 23) in patients with chronic persistent asthma indicates that above acupoints have specificity in reflecting lung diseases. The Feishu (BL 13) and Geshu (BL 17), which have significantly increased body surface temperature, not only provide objective basis for the pathological pathogenesis of \"deficiency in origin and excess in symptom\" in patients with chronic persistent asthma, but also reflect the different expressions of different acupoints on the same meridian for the lung diseases.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To detect the body surface <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013696\">temperature</a> thermal imaging <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013672\">technology</a>, and observe the specific changes of the body surface <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013696\">temperature</a> of the relevant <a the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019370\">observation</a> group (BL 13) and was higher of ipsilateral Pishu (BL 20) and Shenshu (BL 23) in the two groups (P<0.01, P<0.05).

METHODS: A total of 78 patients with TRD were randomly divided into an observation group (39 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a control group (39 cases, 4 cases dropped off). The patients in the control group were treated with medications according to the treatment plan of psychiatrists (at least one medication was 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor). On the basis of the control group, the patients in the observation group were treated with Tiaoqi Jieyu acupuncture, and Neiguan (PC 6), Yinlingquan (SP 9) and Zusanli (ST 36), etc. were selected. The acupuncture was given three times a week. Both groups were treated for 8 weeks. After 8-week treatment, the response rate of Hamilton depression scale-24 (HAMD-24) score after was evaluated in the two groups. The scores of HAMD-24 and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were compared between the two groups before treatment, after 4, 8-week treatment and 12 weeks after treatment (follow-up). After the first treatment and 8-week treatment, the visual analogue scale (VAS) score in the observation group was evaluated, and the correlation between VAS score after the first treatment and HAMD-24 score before treatment, between VAS score after the first treatment and the course of disease in the observation group was analyzed, and the correlation between difference of VAS after 8-week treatment and after the first treatment and difference of HAMD-24 score before treatment and after 8-week treatment was analyzed. RESULTS: After 8-week treatment, the response rate of HAMD-24 score in the observation group was 52.8% (19/36), higher than 17.1% (6/35) in the control group (P<0.001). Compared before treatment, the scores of HAMD-24 and HAMA in the two groups were decreased after 4-week treatment, 8-week treatment and in follow-up (P<0.05), and those in the observation group were superior to the control group (P<0.05). After 8-week treatment, the acupuncture pain VAS score in the observation group was (5.28\u00b12.13) points, which was higher than (3.33\u00b11.62) points after the first treatment (P<0.001). There was a negative correlation between VAS score after the first treatment and HAMD-24 score before treatment in the observation group (r =-0.486, P=0.003); there was no correlation between acupuncture pain VAS score after the first treatment and the course of disease in the observation group (P>0.05). After 8-week treatment, there was a positive correlation between the difference of VAS score and the difference of HAMD-24 score in the observation group (r =0.514, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Tiaoqi Jieyu acupuncture could improve the depression and anxiety in patients with TRD, and the symptom's improvement is related to the recovery of acupuncture pain sensitivity.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To observe the effect of Tiaoqi class=\"decs\" id=\"d003863\">depression</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> TRD were randomly divided into an <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019370\">observation</a> group (39 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d035061\">control group</a> (39 cases, 4 cases id=\"d010361\">patients</a> in the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d035061\">control class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> plan of <a <a Neiguan (PC 6), Yinlingquan (SP 9) and Zusanli (ST 36), etc. were selected.

It is believed that the internal causes of adolescent depressive disorder are mostly emotional and physical factors, while the external causes are mainly social factors, and yang-qi stagnation and emotional disorder are the key pathogenesis. The key of acupuncture and moxibustion with Tongyang Xingshen is warming and regulating the governor vessel. The governor vessel acupoints at head, neck and back are selected.

METHODS: Sixty female SD rats were randomly divided into a blank group, a model group, a sham acupuncture group, a medication group, and an acupuncture group, 12 rats in each group. Except the blank group, the rats in the remaining groups were intraperitoneally injected with cyclophosphamide to establish the POI model. After the model was successfully established, the rats in the acupuncture group were treated with acupuncture at \"Zhibian\" (BL 54) through \"Shuidao\" (ST 28), with a depth of about 12 mm, and the needle was retained for 30 min; the acupuncture was given once a day, for a total of 4 weeks. The rats in the sham acupuncture group were treated with blunt-head needle to tap the skin surface of \"Zhibian\" (BL 54), without penetrating the skin, once a day for 4 weeks. The rats in the medication group were treated with estradiol valerate by gastric gavage for 4 weeks. After the intervention, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ovarian tissue was detected by fluorescence probe; the O1 (FoxO1), and p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma) mRNA and protein in ovarian tissue were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the blank group, the level of ROS and the expression of JNK mRNA, p-JNK protein, FoxO1, p53, Puma mRNA and protein in the ovarian tissue in the model group were increased (P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the level of ROS and the expression of p-JNK protein, FoxO1, p53, Puma mRNA and protein in the ovarian tissue in the sham acupuncture group were slightly reduced, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The level of ROS and the expression of JNK mRNA, p-JNK protein, FoxO1, p53, Puma mRNA and protein in the ovarian tissue in the acupuncture group and the medication group were reduced (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at \"Zhibian\" (BL 54) through \"Shuidao\" (ST 28) could improve the level of oxidative stress, down-regulate the expression of apoptosis-related factors JNK, FoxO1, p53 and Puma induced by oxidative stress, and inhibit the premature failure of ovarian reserve function caused by apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells in POI rats.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To explore possible mechanism <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> at \"Zhibian\" (BL 54) through \"Shuidao\" (ST 28) on premature ovarian from were randomly divided into a blank group, a model group, a sham <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group, a medication group, id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group, 12 <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> in Except the blank group, the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> in the remaining groups were intraperitoneally injected with <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d003520\">cyclophosphamide</a> to establish the POI model.

Australian marginalized populations and their use of complementary medicine, including acupuncture, lack investigation. We have collected information on the health-seeking behaviors of marginalized individuals who utilize an acupuncture service within a community-based integrative health setting. Methods: A secondary analysis of pre-existing data involving the linking of three datasets. Information was collected across four domains: health characteristics, socio-demographics, health services utilization, and vulnerability markers. Bivariate analysis using Fisher's exact and chi-square tests additional to logistic regression analysis were conducted to determine the characteristics of the study population. All data once analyzed were then presented as a cumulative statistic. Results: Study participants (n = 42) included 28% of individuals with reported histories of homelessness (n = 12) and 32% with a history of psychological trauma (n = 13). Eighty-three percent (n = 31) of the population sought acupuncture to manage pain and 91% (n = 36) for musculoskeletal conditions. Sixty-three percent (n = 24) reported a mental health diagnosis, most commonly depression (n = 18). Participants were most likely to engage with three other health services within the study setting, in addition to acupuncture. Participants with an illicit substance abuse problem were 12 times more likely to seek a greater number of acupuncture treatments, and individuals with trauma histories were twice as likely to attend the acupuncture clinic eight or more times. Discussion: Our study findings suggest a robust level of engagement with acupuncture treatment among the target population and a willingness to engage with integrative health services when barriers to uptake such as accessibility and affordability are removed. Findings support current evidence pertaining to acupuncture's use as an adjunct to managing pain in marginalized populations as well as a perceived acceptability and feasibility of the integration of acupuncture within conventional health settings. There is the further observation that acupuncture in a group setting is suitable for a marginalized population and an interest in commitment to treatment among individuals with substance abuse problems.<h2>Introduction:</h2> Marginalized <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d011153\">populations</a> experience <a systems</a>.

Methods: Experimental rats were randomly divided into normal group (N), model group (M) and acupuncture group(A), and samples were collected on Day 4, 5 and 6 after mating. COH rats were treated with acupuncture at SP6, LR3, and ST36 once a day for 7 times. The pinopodes were observed under a scanning electron microscope. Serum estrogen and progesterone levels were measured via ELISA. The protein and mRNA levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), integrin \u00df3, vascular endothelial growth factor fibroblast growth (FGF-2) in the endometrium were evaluated via West-blot, immunohistochemistry, and PCR. Results: Compared with group N, the pregnancy rate of group M was significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the abnormal serum hormone levels and implantation window advancement were observed. Compared with group M, the pregnancy rate of group A was significantly increased (P<0.05), the supraphysiological serum progesterone levels were restored to normalcy (P<0.05), and the advanced implantation window was restored to a certain extent. Further, the abnormal ER, PR, LIF, integrin \u00df3, VEGF, and FGF-2 expression levels of the endometrium got recovered to varying degrees. Conclusion: Acupuncture may restore the estrogen and progesterone balance in COH rats and the forward shift of the implantation window to a certain extent, improving the endometrial receptivity and finally improving the pregnancy rate of COH rats.<h2>Purpose:</h2> To investigate the effect of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013995\">time</a> window and endometrial receptivity. <h2>Methods:</h2> Experimental <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d051381\">rats</a> were randomly divided into normal group (N), model group (M) and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> group(A), and samples were collected on Day 4, 5 and 6 after mating.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of acupoint stimulation combined with EECP (acupoint-EECP) for endothelial cell function in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: Thirty essential hypertensive patients were, randomly divided into two groups, with 15 patients in the acupoint-EECP group, and 15 patients in the control group, of which 3 cases were lost by week 6. Both groups were treated with continued medicine. The participants in the acupoint-EECP group received acupoint stimulation combined with EECP therapy, 45 min for each time, 5 times weekly for 6 weeks for a total of 22.5 hours. The selected acupoints are Zusanli (ST36), Fenglong (ST40) and Sanyinjiao (SP6). The curative effects of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The acupoint-EECP group (n=15) showed significant improvement in endothelial function [nitric oxide (NO) \u00ef\u00bcendothelin-1 (ET-1) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), respectively] values compared to the control group (n=12). Multiple imputation (n = 20 imputations) was performed to account for potential bias due to missing data. In stratified analyses, SBP and DBP values decreased when the baseline SBP was 120 mmHg and DBP was 80 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the feasibility of acupoint-EECP in improving endothelial function and treating hypertension.

In recent years, the advantages of acupuncture combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the control of arrhythmia have become increasingly prominent. Neiguan (PC6) is the collateral point in pericardium meridian; acupuncture at Neiguan can nourish the heart and calm the mind, and also plays an important role in treating arrhythmias. There is currently a lack of evidence-based medical evidence for the combination of acupuncture and TCM in the treatment of arrhythmia. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acupuncture combined with oral TCM in the treatment of arrhythmia. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials published from the inception of databases to June 2022 were reviewed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, VIP, and WanFang databases. Review Manager 5.4.1 was used for the meta-analysis after the reviewers scanned the literature, extracted information, and identified the risk of bias. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials with 804 patients were reviewed, including 402 and 402 patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The results of the meta-analysis showed a significant benefit of acupuncture plus oral TCM in terms of clinical effectiveness compared with oral TCM alone (n = 696; relative risk (RR), 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.30; P < .00001) and in lowering the number of premature beats in 24 hours (n = 374; standard mean difference, -10,55; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -14.61 to -6.49; P < .00001). Acupuncture plus oral TCM was also found to improve the conversion rate (n = 168; RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.14-1.52; P = .0002) and increase the left ventricular ejection fraction (n = 250; mean difference, 6.57; 95% CI, 4.11-9.04; P < .00001), but it had no significant increase in adverse events (n = 262; RR, 0.57; 95% CI 0.30-1.09; P = .09). CONCLUSION: Compared with oral TCM alone, acupuncture combined with oral TCM showed a clear benefit in treating arrhythmias and had no increase in adverse events.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d045483\">stream</a>, but the accompanying side effects are also exposed, which brings <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d011312\">pressure</a> on medical <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d006295\">resources</a> and social In recent years, the of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> combined with <a id=\"d001145\">arrhythmia</a> have become increasingly prominent.

However, we are not aware of any clinical trial that has evaluated the effectiveness of this technique in adults > 65 years. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain in the elderly. STUDY DESIGN: Triple-blind, controlled, and randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Faculty of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP); Sector of Biological Sciences - Physiotherapy Course, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR). METHODS: The study included 125 elderly people with chronic nonspecific low back pain who were randomized to one of 5 study groups: 3 of electroacupuncture; one control; and one placebo, all of them treated for 5 weeks. The primary endpoint was pain intensity, and secondary endpoints included the qualitative aspect of pain, functional disability (Roland-Morris and sit and stand test), emotional functioning (depression and anxiety), and psychosocial factors. Data analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. The confidence interval was set at 95% and the significance level at 5%. RESULTS: All groups achieved a reduction in pain intensity; however, a significant difference was only detected between electroacupuncture and placebo, where the latter showed greater pain reduction. Regarding secondary outcomes, all groups showed good posttreatment results for all assessments but without statistical significance. Among the groups, the placebo was the one that obtained the best results between the pre- and post-treatment for depression, qualitative aspect of pain, and functional disability, but only for the qualitative aspect of pain and for the sit-and-stand test was a significant reduction found in the intergroup comparison. The analysis of the overall effect perceived by the participants in relation to low back pain revealed that individuals from all groups felt close to full recovery. LIMITATIONS: Absence of follow-up and a relatively small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that there is no one frequency of electroacupuncture that is most effective in treating chronic low back pain in the elderly and that electroacupuncture is not superior to manual acupuncture or placebo treatment.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">Acupuncture</a> is one of the most id=\"d013812\">therapies</a> to class=\"decs\" id=\"d000700\">analgesic</a> effect seems to be potentiated by the addition of electric current (<a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015671\">electroacupuncture</a>).

Currently, little is known about the use of acupuncture in the treatment of PPD from the point of view of practitioners. The aim of this study was to explore practitioners' perspectives on the treatment of PPD with acupuncture and provide suggestions for future improvement. METHODS: This study employed a qualitative descriptive method. Semistructured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 14 acupuncture practitioners from 7 hospitals via face-to-face or telephone interviews. The data were collected using interview outline from March to May 2022 and analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: In general, the use of acupuncture for treating PPD was positively regarded by practitioners. They claimed that acupuncture is both safe and helpful for breastfeeding women who are experiencing emotional discomfort and that it can alleviate a variety of somatic symptoms. The following three themes were extracted: (a) patient acceptance and compliance; (b) acupuncture as a treatment for PPD; and (c) the advantages and drawbacks of acupuncture treatment. CONCLUSION: Practitioners' optimistic outlooks demonstrated that acupuncture is a promising treatment option for PPD. However, the time cost was the most significant barrier to compliance. Future development will focus mostly on improving acupuncture equipment and the style of service.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014373\">PPD</a> from the point of view of practitioners.

PURPOSE: This meta-analysis aims to review the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of AMD. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials up to September 4, 2022 were searched in the following databases: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, VIP, Wanfang, and SINOMED. Two reviewers independently performed literature screening and data extraction. RevMan 5.4 was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine of the 226 articles were finally included. A total of 508 AMD patients (631 eyes) were enrolled, including 360 dry eyes and 271 wet eyes. The results showed that acupuncture alone or as an adjunct therapy improved both the clinical efficacy and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of AMD patients and reduced their central macular thickness. The certainty of the evidence ranged from \"low\" to \"very low\". CONCLUSION: There is no high-quality evidence that acupuncture is effective in treating patients with AMD; patients with dry AMD may benefit from acupuncture treatment. Considering the potential of acupuncture treatment for AMD, it is necessary to conduct a rigorously designed randomized controlled trials to verify its efficacy.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> In recent years, an increasing been no Randomized controlled trials up to September 4, 2022 were searched in the class=\"decs\" id=\"d008091\">literature</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d008403\">screening</a> and for the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d017418\">meta-analysis</a>. <h2>RESULTS:</h2> Nine of the 226 articles were finally included.

A large number of studies have found that compared with traditional therapy, acupuncture and moxibustion treatment are beneficial for the treatment of primary tinnitus, although current evidence remains inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion for primary tinnitus. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review in multiple databases from inception through December 2021, including PubMed, Medline, Ovid, Embase, Science Direct, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) and VIP Database. The database search was supplemented by subsequent periodic scrutiny of unpublished and ongoing RCTs from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP). We included RCTs that compared acupuncture and moxibustion with pharmacological therapies, oxygen or physical therapies, or no treatment, for treating primary tinnitus. The main outcome measures were Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and efficacy rate; the secondary outcome measures were Tinnitus Evaluation Questionnaire (TEQ), Pure Tone Average (PTA), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and adverse events. Data accumulation and synthesis included meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, publication bias, risk-of-bias assessment, sensitivity analysis, and adverse events. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the evidence quality. RESULTS: We included 34 RCTs involving 3086 patients. Results indicated that compared with the controls, acupuncture and moxibustion resulted in significantly lower scores on the THI, achieved a significantly higher efficacy rate, reduced scores on TEQ, PTA, VAS, HAMA and HAMD. The meta-analysis revealed that acupuncture and moxibustion have a good safety profile in the treatment of primary tinnitus. CONCLUSION: The results showed that acupuncture and moxibustion for primary tinnitus yielded the greatest decrease in tinnitus severity and improvement in quality of life. Due to the low quality of GRADE evidence grade, the considerable heterogeneity among trials for several data syntheses, more high-quality studies with large sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are urgently needed.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014012\">Tinnitus</a> is are still lacking.

Acupuncture is commonly used to manage both pain and depression, but the choice of acupoints for specific disorders differs. This study aimed to investigate whether specific acupuncture intervention on pain- and depression-acupoints would have specific efficacy and immune effects in patients with comorbid chronic pain and major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: We performed a subject- and assessor-blinded, crossover, and randomized controlled clinical trial of depression- and pain-specific acupuncture intervention and measured clinical responses and proinflammatory cytokines in patients with comorbid chronic pain and MDD. Specific acupoints for pain and depression were used in random order with a washout interval. Forty-seven patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: (1) the depression-pain group (23 patients who were treated with depression-specific acupoints and then the pain-specific acupoints after the washout) and (2) pain-depression group (24 patients with the reverse order). RESULTS: The pain-specific acupoints for pain did not reduce Brief Pain Inventory scores to a significantly greater degree (-0.97 \u00b1 1.69) The significantly different, too. CONCLUSION: This study rejected our hypothesis that the pain-specific acupoints might produce superior analgesic effects than the depression-specific acupoints and vice versa. The cytokine results might imply that pain and depression share common biological mechanisms. (trial <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015669\">acupoints</a> for specific disorders differs.

Thirty adult healthy bulls, crossbred, were included in the study and randomly allocated into two groups of 15 animals, according to the use of acupuncture treatment for six months (GA) or not (GB). The variables were measured 30 min before (TP0) and 10 min (TP10min), 12 (TP12h), 24 (TP24h), 48 (TP48h), and 72 h (TP72h) after a single episode of jumping emulating rodeo exercise. The GB group showed variations in hemoglobin between TP0 and TP10min (p = 0.002) and TP0 and TP12h (p = 0.004), and the GA presented an increase in eosinophil values between TP0 and TP12h (p = 0.013) and TP0 and TP24h (p = 0.034). Leukopenia was observed in GB between TP10min and TP72h ((p = 0.008). The CK values were high ( 300 UI/l) after exercise until the TP24h, and decreased in TP48h, in both groups. The plasma lactate elevation was lower in the GA at TP10min (p = 0.011), TP12h (p = 0.008), TP72h (p < 0.001).

Haley Veterans HospitalTampaFloridaUSADepartment of Psychiatry after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and can become chronic. Acupuncture is an increasingly popular non-pharmacologic option in the United States and is commonly used for pain. OBJECTIVE: We explored demographics, injury characteristics, and pain characteristics of individuals who reported using acupuncture for chronic pain after TBI. METHODS: We analyzed a subset of data collected as part of the Pain After Traumatic Brain Injury collaborative study and identified individuals reporting a history of acupuncture as part of management for chronic pain after TBI. We characterized and compared basic demographic data, pain treatment engagements, pain severity, pain interference, functional independence, and pain locations using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Our sample included 1,064 individuals. Acupuncture use (n = 208) was lower proportionally among females, Blacks/African Americans, Asians, less educated, and nonmilitary service members. Insurance type varied between acupuncture and non-acupuncture users. Functional and pain outcomes were similar, but acupuncture users reported a higher number of pain sites. DISCUSSION: Acupuncture is one treatment utilized by individuals with TBI and chronic pain. Further investigation would be helpful to understand the barriers and facilitators of acupuncture use to inform clinical trials to examine the potential benefit of acupuncture on pain outcomes after TBI.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> can chronic. <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">Acupuncture</a> is an increasingly popular non-pharmacologic option in the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014481\">United analyzed a data collected as of the After <a class=\"decs\" sample included 1,064 individuals. <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">Acupuncture</a> use (n = and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d059350\">chronic pain</a>.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of acupuncture versus usual care on sleep quality among cancer survivors with comorbid sleep disturbance and chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Sleep outcome data from the Personalized Electroacupuncture Versus Auricular Acupuncture Comparative Effectiveness (PEACE) randomized clinical trial were analyzed. Electroacupuncture or auricular acupuncture was compared with usual care for sleep quality improvement over 10 weeks of treatment among cancer survivors with clinically significant sleep disturbance and chronic musculoskeletal pain at baseline. Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score. RESULTS: Among 268 participants (mean [standard deviation age, years; 191 score, 10.3 [3.3] points), electroacupuncture and auricular acupuncture resulted in greater reductions in the PSQI global score from baseline to 10 weeks in comparison with usual care: 1.42 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-2.38; p = .004) and 1.59 points (95% CI, 0.62-2.55; p = .001), respectively. The improvement in sleep quality for the acupuncture groups was sustained for 24 weeks from randomization. Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients in the electroacupuncture and auricular acupuncture groups had clinically meaningful improvement in sleep quality compared to the usual care group (41.0% and 42.9% vs. 21.4%; p = .044). CONCLUSIONS: Among cancer survivors with comorbid sleep disturbance and chronic pain, electroacupuncture and auricular acupuncture produced a clinically relevant and persistent improvement in sleep quality. These findings suggest that acupuncture may be an evidence-based nonpharmacologic intervention to improve sleep health for cancer survivors with pain. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study analyzed the sleep quality data from a published randomized clinical trial that evaluated the effect of electroacupuncture or auricular acupuncture versus usual care on pain relief among people who survived cancer. This analysis included a prespecified subgroup of 268 participants with co-occurring sleep disturbance and chronic musculoskeletal pain at baseline and found that patients who used acupuncture for pain relief demonstrated greater improvements in sleep quality compared with patients who received usual care.

These therapies have gained increased attention in recent years, particularly for their potential to help manage chronic pain and other conditions. National organizations not only recommend the use of CIH therapies but also the documentation of these therapies within electronic health records (EHRs). Yet, how CIH therapies are documented in the EHR is not well understood. The purpose of this scoping review of the literature was to examine and describe research that focused on CIH therapy clinical documentation in the EHR. Methods: The authors conducted a literature search using six electronic databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and health records\" using AND/OR statements. No restrictions were placed on publication date. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Original peer-reviewed full article in English, (2) focus on CIH therapies, and (3) CIH therapy documentation practice used in the research. Results: The authors identified 1684 articles, of which 33 met the criteria for a full review. A majority of the studies were conducted in the United States (20) and hospitals (19). The most common study design was retrospective (9), and 26 studies used EHR data as a data source for analysis. Documentation practices varied widely across all studies, ranging from the feasibility of documenting integrative therapies (i.e., homeopathy) to create changes in the EHR to support documentation (i.e., flowsheet). Discussion: This scoping review identified varying EHR clinical documentation trends for CIH therapies. Pain was the most frequent reason for use of CIH therapies across all included studies and a broad range of CIH therapies were used.

For chronic low back pain (cLBP), typically defined as lasting three months or longer, many treatments for younger adults may be inappropriate for older adults given their greater prevalence of comorbidities with attendant polypharmacy. While acupuncture has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for cLBP in adults overall, few studies of acupuncture have either included or focused on adults 65 years old. METHODS: The BackInAction study is a pragmatic, multi-site, three-arm, parallel-groups randomized controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of acupuncture needling for improving back pain-related disability among 807 older adults 65 years old with cLBP. Participants are randomized to standard acupuncture (SA; up to 15 treatment sessions across 12 weeks), enhanced acupuncture (EA; SA during first 12 weeks and up to 6 additional sessions across the following 12 weeks), and usual medical care (UMC) alone. Participants are followed for 12 months with study outcomes assessed monthly with the primary outcome timepoint at 6 months. DISCUSSION: The BackInAction study offers an opportunity to further understand the effectiveness, dose-dependence, and safety of acupuncture in a Medicare population. Additionally, study results may encourage broader adoption of more effective, safer, and more satisfactory options to the continuing over-reliance on opioid- and invasive medical treatments for cLBP among older adults.

AIMS: To compare the modulation effects of acupuncture treatment with NSAIDs and placebo medication on descending pain modulation system (DPMS) in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients. METHODS: This study recruited 180 KOA patients with knee pain and 41 healthy controls (HCs). Individuals with KOA knee pain were divided randomly into groups of verum acupuncture (VA), sham acupuncture (SA), celecoxib (SC), placebo (PB), and waiting list (WT), with 36 patients in each group. VA and SA groups included ten sessions of puncturing acupoints or puncturing non-acupoints acupuncture treatment for two successive weeks. Celecoxib capsules were continuously given orally to patients in the SC group at a dosage of 200 mg daily for 2 weeks. In the PB group, patients received a placebo capsule once a day for 2 weeks at the same dosage as celecoxib capsules. In the WL group, patients did not receive any treatment. Patients underwent a resting-state BOLD-fMRI scan pre- and post-receiving the therapy, whereas HCs only underwent a baseline scan. Seed (ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, vlPAG, a key node in DPMS) based resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) was applied in the data analysis. RESULTS: All groups demonstrated improved knee pain scores relative to the initial state. There was no statistical difference between the VA and SA groups in all clinical outcomes, and vlPAG rs-FC alterations. KOA knee pain individuals reported higher vlPAG rs-FC in the bilateral thalamus than HCs. KOA knee pain patients in the acupuncture group (verum + sham, AG) exhibited increased vlPAG rs-FC with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right angular, which is associated with knee pain improvement. In contrast with the SC and PB group, the AG exhibited significantly increased vlPAG rs-FC with the right DLPFC and angular. Contrary to the WT group, the AG showed greater vlPAG rs-FC with the right DLPFC and precuneus. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture treatment, celecoxib, and placebo medication have different modulation effects on vlPAG DPMS in KOA knee pain patients. Acupuncture could modulate vlPAG rs-FC with brain regions associated with cognitive control, attention, and reappraisal for knee pain relief in KOA patients, compared with celecoxib and placebo medication.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> The <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000700\">analgesic</a> effect of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> placebo medication, remain class=\"decs\" id=\"d007717\">knee</a> <a <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> in each group.

CURRENT PRACTICE: Although increasingly used in the clinical setting, acupuncture is not mentioned or weakly recommended in guidelines for the treatment of KOA. RECOMMENDATIONS: We suggest acupuncture rather than no treatment in adult KOA (weak recommendation, moderate certainty evidence), and acupuncture combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rather than acupuncture alone when KOA symptoms are severe (weak recommendation, moderate certainty evidence), with duration of acupuncture for 4-8 weeks depending on KOA severity and treatment response (weak recommendation, moderate certainty evidence), and discussing with patients in shared decision-making. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: This rapid recommendation was developed following the Making GRADE the Irresistible Choice (MAGIC) methodological framework. First, the clinical specialist identified the topic of recommendation and demand for evidence. Then the independent evidence synthesis group performed a systematic review to summarize available evidence and evaluate the evidence using the GRADE approach. Finally, the clinical specialist group produced recommendations for practice through a consensus procedure. THE EVIDENCE: The linked systematic review and meta-analysis included 9422 KOA patients, 61.1% of whom were women. The median mean age was 61.8 years. Compared with no treatment, acupuncture had beneficial effect on KOA in improving the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score (moderate certainty evidence), and WOMAC pain (very low certainty evidence), WOMAC stiffness (low certainty evidence), and WOMAC function (low certainty evidence) subscale scores. Compared with usual care, acupuncture improved WOMAC stiffness subscale score (moderate certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses showed different effects in the improvement of WOMAC total scores by different durations of acupuncture and whether acupuncture combined with NSAIDs, but no difference between manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture was found. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS: Compared with no treatment, acupuncture is suggested to reduce pain, stiffness, and disfunction in KOA patients, ultimately improving the patient's health status. Acupuncture can be used as an alternative therapy when usual care is ineffective or there are adverse reactions so that patients can no longer continue the treatment. Manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture is suggested for 4-8 weeks to improve the health status of KOA. The patient's values and preferences should be considered when selecting acupuncture for KOA treatment.CLINICAL QUESTION Is <a id=\"d020370\">knee osteoarthritis</a> (KOA)?

BACKGROUND: There is a need to optimize the treatment course of acupuncture for FC to improve efficacy and save health resources. METHODS: We performed a systematic electronic search of eight databases from inception to April 2021. Randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture treatment with sham acupuncture were included. The main outcome indicators were complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM), spontaneous bowel movement, Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), responder rate and safety evaluation (SE). RESULTS: In this network meta-analysis, 19 studies with 1753 participants and 8 different acupuncture treatments were included. Using the consistency model via Monte Carlo simulation iterations, we found that the effect of acupuncture treatment at 3/4 weeks may be better in terms of CSBM and BSFS. The results of rank probability analysis showed that 6 weeks of treatment may be better for the responder rate, and 2 weeks of treatment may be better for SE. And, subgroup analysis found that, for patients with chronic severe functional constipation (CSFC), 8 weeks of acupuncture treatment may be the best for CSBM. CONCLUSIONS: By indirect comparison, 3/4 weeks of acupuncture treatment may be the optimal course of treatment for FC in terms of improving bowel frequency and stool shape. And for CSFC, 8 weeks of acupuncture treatment may be the best. However, there is still a lack of direct comparison and publication bias that affects the accuracy of research results.<h2>AIM:</h2> The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative <a of eight databases from inception Randomized controlled different <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d015670\">acupuncture treatments</a> were included.

The body masses were recorded before and after the treatment, respectively. After the intervention, the rats were subjected to suspension experiment, slope experiment, tactile stimulation experiment and Morris water maze experiment. After the end of the experiment, the morphological changes of hippocampal histology were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining under light microscope, and the expression of Notch1, Notch3 and Hes5 were detected by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The changes in body mass of the rats in each group were different; in behavioral experiments, compared with the sham, the suspension time of the model was shortened, the slope experiment, tactile stimulation experiment, and escape latency time were prolonged, and the number of platform crossing was reduced in the model, compared with the model, the suspension time of the acupuncture was prolonged, the slope experiment, tactile stimulation experiment, and escape latency time were shortened, and the number of platform crossing times was increased; HE staining showed severe hippocampal damage in the model and reduced hippocampal damage in the acupuncture. Western Blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that the expression of Notch1, Notch3 and Hes5 were increased in the model and the expression of Notch1, Notch3, Hes5 in acupuncture were decreased.

METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to three groups: normal group, model group, and acupuncture group. Acupuncture was at h after TBI modeling with a frequency of one session per day for 4 weeks. Neurobehavioral assessment, hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence detection, and magnetic resonance imaging scanning were performed on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after modeling of traumatic brain injury (TBI). RESULTS: Acupuncture promoted the proliferation of glial cells and glial scars at an early stage but inhibited the proliferation of glial cells and glial scars at a late stage. Morphological observations and immunofluorescence histochemistry showed that the morphology of the perilesional cortex in the acupuncture group was improved and the number of neurons was increased when compared with the model group. The lesion size of ipsilateral brain parenchyma in the acupuncture group was smaller than in the model group on days 7, 14, and 28 ( < 0.05) after TBI modeling. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture might have a bidirectional regulatory effect on glial scar repair after TBI by promoting the proliferation of glial cells and glial scars to limit the injured area and relieve nerve injury during the early stages, and by inhibiting glial scar hyperplasia to benefit the regeneration and repair of neurons and axons and promote neurological function recovery during the later stages.<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2> To explore the underlying mechanism of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> on nerve repair by investigating its effect on the differentiation of <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d009457\">glial groups normal group, model group, and <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d026881\">acupuncture</a> h after TBI modeling with a frequency of one session per day for 4 weeks.

METHODS: A total of 61 outpatients with post-chest and back herpes zoster neuralgia were recruited in the Department of Pain at the Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences from May 2019 to June 2021. They were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty-one patients in the control group were treated with ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral nerve block (PVB) alone, one patient declined to continue during treatment ( 30), and thirty patients in the observation group received the acupuncture along the fascia, meridians, and nerves combined with ultrasound-guided PVB treatment ( 30). Both control and observation group received treatment weekly for 4 weeks. The medical history data such as age, sex, presence or absence of comorbidities and disease course were analyzed. The visual analog scale (VAS) score was used to assess the pain degree of two groups at T0 (before treatment), T1 (1-time treatment ended), T2 (2 times treatment ended), T3 (3 times treatment ended), and T4 (4 times treatment ended). The sleep state was examined by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before and after the study. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in general conditions between the control group and the observation group (> 0.05). The VAS score in both control and observation group was decreased in a time-dependent manner after 1-4 weeks of treatment. There were no significant differences in VAS scores between the two groups after 1 or 2 weeks of treatment ( > 0.05). After 3 and 4 weeks of treatment, the VAS score was significantly decreased in the observation group compared with that in the control group ( < 0.001). In addition, the reduction in VAS score (after treatment-before treatment) between the two groups was statistically significant [D value: -1.53, 95% (-2.32, 0.74), < 0.001]. Furthermore, the sleep state of patients in both groups markedly improved and much obvious in the observation group than that in the control group ( < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a combination of acupuncture along fascia, meridians, and nerves with ultrasound-guided PVB treatment is more effective than ultrasound-guided PVB treatment alone.

METHODS: The study was designed as a single-centre, outcome-assessor-blinded parallel randomised controlled trial with 120 post-stroke hemiplegia patients randomly assigned into two groups: electroacupuncture plus cycling (CT group) and electroacupuncture (AT group). Patients were assessed before and after the treatment (using muscle grading, modified Rankin, Barthel, Orgorozo scores and electromyography). Statistical Man-Whitney U test, and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare between CT and AT groups. RESULTS: The results reported statistically significant improvement in motor function in patients suffering from hemiplegia following ischemic stroke in both CT and AT groups. Patients in CT group experienced a greater improvement compared to those in AT group including better muscle contraction (increased frequency and amplitude of electromyography and increased muscle grading scale); increased recovery (Orgogozo scale), increased independency (Barthel scale) and decreased disability (Modified Rankin scale) (< 0.01).

Increasing attention has been paid to the use of acupuncture in IBD patients; however, its regulatory effects on inflammatory factors in IBD still require validation. Here, we systematically evaluated the effects of acupuncture on inflammatory factors in IBD patients. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria. After evaluating the quality of the studies selected by two reviewers, the meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in IBD patients and the impact on inflammatory factors (TNF-, IL-1, IL-8 and IL-10). RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials with a total of 228 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Acupuncture has a positive therapeutic impact on IBD (MD = 1.22, 95% CI [1.07, 1.39], P = 0.003). Moreover, it regulates levels of TNF- (MD =-60.58, 60.91], P = 0.005) in IBD patients. However, the P value of meta-analysis IL-1 great than P = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture has a positive therapeutic impact on IBD and can effectively regulate inflammatory factors in IBD patients.

However, the effects of self-acupressure on cancer symptom management are less clear. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review is the first to summarize the current experimental evidence on self-acupressure for symptom management in cancer patients. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched for experimental studies that examined self-acupressure for cancer patients with symptoms and published in peer-reviewed English or Chinese journals. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool and the JBI critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies. Data were extracted as predefined and synthesized narratively. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist was used to report the intervention characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies were included in this study, six as feasibility or pilot trials. The methodological quality of included studies was suboptimal. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in acupressure training, acupoint selection, intervention duration, dosage, and timing. Self-acupressure was only associated with reduced nausea and vomiting (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The limited evidence from this review precludes the definitive conclusions on intervention effectiveness for cancer symptoms. Future research should consider developing the standard protocol for intervention delivery, improving the methodology of self-acupressure trials, and conducting large-scale research to advance the science of self-acupressure for cancer symptom management.CONTEXT <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d019050\">Acupressure</a> is a popular nonpharmacological intervention that is increasingly proven to effectively alleviate symptoms in <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d010361\">patients</a> with This <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000078182\">systematic review</a> is the first to experimental evidence on <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004532\">self</a>-<a or <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d000095225\">Chinese</a> journals.

Once it has occurred, localized pain and numbness of the fingers will develop, in severe cases, muscle atrophy will even arise, and after rest and physical therapy, many patients will still be unable to relieve or recur. In this case, the patient can receive intrathecal glucocorticoid injections, but the hormone injections alone can only provide short-term relief, and because the mechanical factors of median nerve compression are not fundamentally removed. Therefore, combined acupotomy release can help to release the compression of the transverse carpal ligament on the nerve and increase the volume within the carpal tunnel to achieve more satisfactory long-term results. Hence, a meta-analysis is necessary to provide evidence whether there is a significant difference in the treatment of CTS with acupotomy release combined with glucocorticoid intrathecal injection (ARGI) compared with isolated glucocorticoid intrathecal injection (GI). METHODS: We will search, with no time restriction, without any restriction of language and status, the time from the establishment of the database to October 2022, on the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Web of Science, Chinese national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang data, Chinese scientific journals database, Chinese databases SinoMed, and electronic databases. The electronic database search will be supplemented by a manual search of the reference lists of included articles. We will apply the risk-of-bias tool of the Cochrane collaboration for randomized controlled trials to assess the methodological quality. Risk-of-Bias Assessment Tool for nonrandomized studies was used to evaluate the quality of comparative studies. Statistical analysis will be conducted using RevMan 5.4 software. RESULTS: This systematic review will evaluate the difference in efficacy of ARGI versus isolated GI in the treatment of CTS. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of this study will provide evidence for judging whether ARGI is superior to GI for treatment of CTS.<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2> <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d002349\">Carpal tunnel syndrome</a> (CTS) is more common in people <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d014944\">who</a> recur.

METHODS: The self-established database was searched from 8 Chinese and English databases to June 2022, and the randomized controlled trials articles on the comparative treatment of thalamic pain after stroke with acupuncture were included. That visual analog scale, present pain intensity score, pain rating index, the total efficiency, and adverse reactions were mainly used to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 11 papers were included. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture appeared to be more effective than drugs for treatment of thalamic pain, as assessed by the visual analog scale [mean difference (MD) = -1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-1.20, -0.91), P < .00001], the present pain intensity score = -0.27, 95% CI (-0.43, -0.11), P -1.02, 95% CI (-1.41, -0.63), P < .00001], and the total efficiency [risk ratio = 1.31, 95% CI (1.22,1.41), P < .00001]. Meta-analysis results show that there is no significant difference in safety between acupuncture and drug therapy [risk ratio = 0.50, 95% CI (0.30,0.84), P = .009]. CONCLUSION: Studies have shown that acupuncture in the treatment of thalamic pain is effective, and it does not prove to have a higher safety than drug treatment, therefore a large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trials study is needed to further evaluate the class=\"decs\" and English databases to June 2022, and the randomized controlled trials articles <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d004526\">efficiency</a>, and adverse reactions were mainly used to evaluate the outcomes. <h2>RESULTS:</h2> A total of 11 <a class=\"decs\" <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d017418\">Meta-analysis</a> results show that there is id=\"d001939\">pain</a> is effective, and it does not prove to have a higher is needed to further prove.Copyright \u00a9 2023 the Author(s).

Pharmacological treatments often provide limited relief; therefore, a multidisciplinary approach should be utilized to manage neuropathic pain. This review examines the current literature on integrative health modalities (anti-inflammatory diets, functional movement, acupuncture, meditation, and transcutaneous therapy) for treating patients with neuropathic pain. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of an anti-inflammatory diet, functional movement, acupuncture, meditation, and transcutaneous therapy in treating neuropathic pain has been investigated in prior literature with positive outcomes. However, there remains a large void in evidence-based knowledge and clinical applicability for these interventions. Overall, integrative health offers a cost-efficient and harmless way of creating a multidisciplinary approach to managing neuropathic pain. There are many complementary approaches to treating neuropathic pain as part of an integrative medicine approach. Research is needed to explore other herbs and spices not yet reported in the peer-review literature. Additionally, follow-on research is needed to understand the clinical applicability of the proposed interventions as well as the dose and timing of the interventions to predict response and duration.PURPOSE OF lives.

Firstly, observing the behavioral changes of the DPD rat model, the regulation of monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the midbrain, the change of -synuclein (-syn) in the striatum, the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of DPD was discussed. Secondly, autophagy inhibitors and activators were selected to judge the effect of acupuncture on autophagy in the DPD rat model. Finally, an mTOR inhibitor was used to observe the effect of acupuncture on the mTOR pathway in the DPD rat model. The results showed that acupuncture could improve the motor and depressive symptoms of DPD model rats, increase the content of DA and 5-HT, and decrease the content of \u00c9-syn in the striatum. Acupuncture inhibited the expression of autophagy in the striatum of DPD model rats. At the same time, acupuncture upregulates p-mTOR expression, inhibits autophagy, and promotes synaptic protein expression. Therefore, we concluded that acupuncture might improve the behavior of DPD model rats by activating the mTOR pathway, inhibiting autophagy from removing -syn and the <a class=\"decs\" id=\"d013812\">treatment</a> of DPD was explored in this study.
