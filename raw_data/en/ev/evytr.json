Normal or Possible Autism? I'm a FTM. I have a 7 month old, and she has never been an easy to care for baby. She has never eaten or slept well, and has always been very fussy. I have never been able to find things that keeps her occupied or calm. No luck with swings, carriers of any kind, bouncers, etc. Only mostly calm when held in my arms. Since she was maybe 2 or 3 months old she always aggressively rubbed her face on my shoulder to the point that I thought she would break her nose, and she has always tightly twisted her ankles together and said \"ooo k\" sound over and over. Lately, things are getting worse. She makes mmm and ehh sounds so loudly most of the day (she's been doing this for maybe 3 or 4 months) along with shockingly high pitch horrifying screams randomly. She has started babbling occasionally, but it's extremely loud and she doesn't look at us when she does it. She never copies sounds, movements, or gestures (although maybe 7 months is too early). She still twists her legs tightly together and stiffens her arms and legs often. She frantically scratches on things (not normal scratching to explore like some babies), flaps her arms really hard nearly all day, twirls her wrists and flicks her fingers. She's not really interested in her toys, just tags, lights, and my hoodie strings. She shows pretty much no hunger cues and fights drinking milk every time. When she is drinking milk she'll fidget so much, and she always pulls her toes really hard and lets go to make her leg slam down repeatedly. She can't fall asleep on her own, she'll just scream and/or flap her arms really hard for hours instead of sleeping, so I have to rock her and during that time she has to grab everything and rub and scratch all over everything really hard until she falls asleep in my arms but wakes easily. Her eye contact is not bad, but I feel like it's getting less. She smiles easily which lights up my whole world. I can't stop worrying over all of this. Everything keeps pointing to Autism, and she matches sensory processing disorder (sensory seeking) one so much. Or, am I just on google too much? Is this possibly normal at all? Everything I hoped to enjoy with my baby I cannot enjoy like playing, feeding her, rocking her to sleep. My anxiety is constantly so high.

Autism is possible but likely too early to diagnose. I have a 14 year old with Autism and work with many other kids that have it as well. I promise all the struggle is so worth it. His toddler years were pretty challenging. I stressed, worried, freaked out, melted down. Some moments I thought I was going to lose my damn mind. Good news is, if it is Autism, there's so much help and support out there. it's something we know how to work with so much more effectively these days. Worst case scenario, it is not a death sentence for these kids. And it does get better! We still have hard days. But after we gained a better understanding of what was going on with my sons particular functioning and sensory issues and we got the right help on board, he is an incredibly well functioning teenager (even easier than my non-autistic child). I really can't describe how much he is a joy to parent. I've seen kids that were completely non verbal in their younger years go to being totally mainstream education and exceeding benchmarks in school. Worst case scenario, if it is Autism, it's a good day and age for it. Side note, I worked with a wonderful clinician who always theorized that Autism could be an evolutionary trait. These kids are in some ways sometimes better suited for the modernizing world than many of us neurotypical folks. If you haven't yet, talk to your pediatrician. Early intervention, Occupational Therapy, these things can all work wonders. thank you so much for your reply and encouraging words. It means a lot to me. I do hope if it's anything that requires help that where I live will have the resources. I feel like the particular state where I live isn't too kind on different of any type. Maybe I'm just not seeing it though. Thanks again! It's too early for autism diagnosis, so right now just enjoy her for who she is When she's a bit older, if she's still experiencing these behaviors you'll be able to find answers. Otherwise, she sounds like my youngest who I've considered may be on the spectrum. She seemed delayed with many things, wasn't that interested in her toys, didn't make much eye contact, I kind of had to push for any little bit of it. She has some sensory issues and the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard. Sleep? Lol. She'd wake up every 15 minutes screaming all night, and no hunger cues! I would literally be holding her, looking at her when she'd erupt in shrieks of hunger. Nothing would precede it. However, Autism or not, she's incredible. By 18m she had so many hundreds of words in her vocabulary that I'd stopped counting. She's now 20m, and some of the things that concerned me seem more that maybe she has just been struggling and frustrated with how limited being a baby has left her. Despite being premature, having some neurological concerns, and an infection that required a week of hospitalization at 6w, she was a full on walker at 10m. She's been jumping and getting off the ground forever. She's a great climber. She counts to 20, backwards from 10-1, knows her ABCs, recognizes her letters, numbers, shapes, colors, strings together multiple sentences and responds to my questions with sentences. (What are you doing? \"Putting sand in (the) mold.\") She sings the soundtrack of Frozen like it's her life story and I hear her singing Taylor Swift and Imagine Dragons songs she hears on the radio after a few plays. She understands small quantities \"I see birdies! Two birdies!\" \"Three crackers!\" and overall blows people away. But, she'd still be my sweet, incredible Cuppy Cake even if she wasn't speaking. Trying to help her be her best self has brought us a deep bond. She actually had some markers for genetic disorders at birth and I vowed to support her in every way I could. For the first 8m, I had no vision of who she is now. She even looks like a different person! She definitely wasn't copying our gestures, tones etc. once it started it was a total flood, 3+ new words a day. You're doing a good job. You're aware and taking notes. When and if the time comes, you'll be ready to support her with whatever she needs. In the meantime, what she most needs from you is the closeness of mommy lol hi! Thank you so much for your response either way. Still waiting on the final result, will keep this discussion updated :) sorry, I just realized you weren't asking me, haha! Very sleep deprived. Anyway, I hope all goes well with your little one! hi! I have not. She's almost 10 months now, and her development is pretty on track. Her arm flapping has decreased some, and she's doing ok with solid foods. She's very social now. Still not a fan of milk and is horrible with sleep. I pretty much gave up obsessing over the whole situation, because it seems like they can't really tell much until around age 2. She's changing so much each month, so I just kinda roll with it until then. It's good to be aware, but my anxiety is bad enough without this extra worry right now. hi mama! Just wondering if you've had her evaluated for autism yet? My girl sounds very similar. Just had her evaluated and I'm almost positive based on everything they told me they are going to say she is not autistic. However, I still feel like something is off. I am very sensitive to noise, so to stay calm I actually used some ear plugs to soften the cries and baby talk, and not take it out on my son. Don't hesitate to make yourself comfortable, you'll be a better mother for it, not a bad one! I tried gentle sleep training methods but no cry it out- honestly she would throw up and faint if she cried even while I changed her twin sister's diaper, then rally and start again. I couldn't do any CIO with her throwing up and fainting so it wasn't an option. I have major sensory issues. I need a clean home and organization and I've finally stopped losing my mind because of the tv now that I know that's what's making me kind of panic, if that's the right word for it. Now I can ask the older kids, can you please turn the tv down? And the round the clock touching is HARD with the super glue babies (Velcro doesn't describe this girl ) but it has gotten a lot better as she's gotten older, she wants to do more for herself these days. Both of my twins still have a thing about scratching me as they go to sleep. I still rock them and sing, and I have scabs on both arms even right now from their endless scratching. I have no idea why they do this, but it soothes them somehow. The one that's always seemed better adjusted to her surroundings used to scratch EVERYTHING as an infant. If she could reach a wall, scratch scratch scratch. It was endless. But now it's just my skin really. \"Just\", haha thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me and sharing your story. Your daughter sounds amazing! The sleep thing has certainly been brutal. Do you mind if I ask whether or not you ever attempted any sleep training? I think the worst of all this is maybe I have sensory issues of my own and the constant loud continuous noise and frequent jerky movements or sounds of certain things she scratches gets me highly overstimulated. I will push through literally anything for her, just wish it didn't have to be so hard. I have 2 boys with autism. They were incredibly chill babies, especially the older one who STTN at 5 weeks old. The most difficult of my boys was the middle one with ADHD. Autism can look very different in different children. That being said, 7-8 months is a bit young for a diagnosis. I'm sorry to hear about the problem. Yes, it's possible it's autism. My son whom is now 4 has autism. He doesn't talk much. He likes to tear things up. paper, diapers, his bed mattress. He's picky about what foods he'll eat. He is also getting evaluated for possible hearing loss.When he was a baby, he did exactly what your baby is doing right now.I had a supportive family to help out and get him to sleep, eat etc. So yes it is possible. Also.you can get ssdi to help with her needs.My daughter also has autism. She's 19 yrs now. gets ssdi and I'm her care taker. Don't be fooled by them blaming your age as the culprit. I was 24 yrs old when she was born They really don't know what causes it.I had heard 3 different things so far on my life.I heard pesticides causes it, age, now Tylenol. thank you for sharing! Do you mind if I ask whether or not you're able to live a somewhat normal life with them? Travel, school, going out, things like that? Did things get worse since he was a baby? and also do you mind if I ask what level autism he has? I completely understand if it's too personal Are you by chance located in California? We have regional centers that offer early intervention services (that include ABA). While it is too early for a diagnosis, she can be assessed and potentially receive ABA services to work on the behaviors. I have had children as young as 18 months come in with an Autism diagnosis. Have you considered having her evaluated for early intervention? Update! First of all, thank you to all who replied to me. My baby is 11 months now and most of my concerns are gone except for a couple of things. Since it's so early, I'm just going with the flow. Babies sure do change rapidly. hi I'm glad your concerns are lessening. It is possible something in the milk was irritating her and causing pain and discomfort. However if at any point after the age of 2 you feel like there are signs, I would suggest making quick recordings of the behaviour on your phone and popping them all into labelled folders eg: flapping, spinning, rocking etc so you have all the evidence you need if you decide an evaluation is needed. It will speed things along and make getting interventions so much easier xx - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [First YearHave a Gassy Baby?
