Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 2 Page 45 of 88 b. In addition to reviewing all programs proposed or occurring in countri es with The U.S. Department of State Travel Warnings, the Risk and Security Assessment Committee will review programs in locations where health, safety, or security may be of particular concern, or in regions/cities of individual countries with significant levels of health, safety or security concerns as identified by the U.S. Department of State, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention or any other reputable body or individuals that express a valid concern about the program or location. c. Prior to the anticipated international travel, and a fter consideration of all relevant factors, and when conditions warrant, the associate provost of International and Border Programs and/or the Risk and Security Assessment Committee, at the associate provost' s discretion, may recommend that a program at a particular site be suspended or shifted prior to departure. d. When the program is already underway or on site, and after consideration of all relevant factors and when conditions warrant, the associate provos t and/or the committee may either recommend that certain additional safety conditions be imposed, or that the program be suspended or shifted, and the participants brought back to the U.S. 3. Membership : The associate provost of International and Border Programs shall serve as the chair. In addition to the associate provost , the membership shall include the following position appointments: a. vice president of student success, or designee b. dean of graduate school c. general counsel or designee d. associate vice president of university communications/marketing services e. university risk manager f. associate dean of study abroad 4. Additional Resources.

For faculty -led study abroad programs, the faculty member leading the course, dean of the affected college, and department head/chair of the effected department; b. A faculty member with significant expertise in the effected country or region; c. In cases of significant health concerns, a medical professional. E. Procedures to Request Exception for Student Travel to Country Subject to Travel Warning: A request for exception may be made in writing by either the student or the faculty member in support of the travel. The request should be addressed to the associate provost of International and Border Programs, who may either review and recommend a response or refer to the Risk and Security Assessment Committee, consistent with the process outlined below. 1. The request should specifically address dangers or concerns mentioned in the Travel Warning, with reference to t he program's location, activities, and related implications. The request form is available at the IP website. 2. Upon receipt of the request, the associate provost may consider it and provide a recommendation to the executive vice president and provost for further action. Alternatively, the associate provost may convene the Risk and Security Assessment Committee in person, or solicit input from the committee members via email collaboration. If the committee proceeds with email collaboration, the requestor shall be invited to participate via email. 3. If the committee meets in person, t he student/faculty member making the request will be invited to present the request. In addition to evaluating the information the student/faculty member provides, the committee may draw upon other sources of information, such as: a. The U.S. Department of State and other bodies (e.g., the Center for Disease Control and Prevention or the Wo rld Health Organization, for health concerns); b. Other experts who know or travel in the country in question, for additional insight and an independent assessment of pertinent concerns; c. Additional State Department sources (e.g., OSAC information or desk o fficers); d. NMSU faculty already on the ground in the host country, or colleagues in those countries, can provide independent views regarding current or evolving conditions; and, Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 2 Page 46 of 88 e. Colleagues from other colleges with students or programs in the country. 4. The recommendation to either approve or deny the request for exception shall be forwarded by the associate provost for International and Border Programs, or designee to the executive vice president and provost.

G. Suspension(s) of Academic Program: 1. Any recommendation for suspension of an international program by the associate provost of International and Border Programs or by the Risk and Security Assessment Committee will include all relevant information and the reasoning in a memo to the executive vice president and provost. The executive vice president and provost will forward the recommendation, along with any independent recommendation, to the Chancellor , who will issue the final decision regarding suspension. 2. If a program suspension is imposed, it will remain in place until a status review has been conducted and justifies lifting it. 3. When the State Department lifts a Travel Warning, the associate provost and/or the Risk and Security Assessment Committee will undertake a status review of programs that had been suspended and make a recommendation for further action by the executive vice president and provost and Chancellor . Rule 2.70 - United Way The university participates in the annual community United Way Fund drive. Personnel are appointed by the Chancellor to contact university employees to support this endeavor. The purpose of t his program is to afford the university's employees (regular employees only) an opportunity to participate, either by cash contribution or payroll deduction, at one time and not be subjected to multiple solicitations throughout the year. Rule 2.75- Univer sity Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc. All gifts of money, securities, and other funds can be invested to the greatest advantage of the university if said gifts are made to the NMSU Foundation, Inc. for the sole use and benefit of the university. Therefore, to the fullest extent permitted by law and by any controlling documents, all gifts and donations to the university should be managed, invested, reinvested, and distributed by and through the NMSU Foundation. The Board of Regents recommends to all persons or corporations desiring to make gifts or donations for the benefit of the university and its respective campuses that such gifts or donations are made to NMSU Foundation, Inc. The return address furnished to donors and on all printed materials must be that of the NMSU Foundation, Inc., the Development Office, or the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement. All gifts received by the university, including gifts to any college, department or division, should be reported directly and immediately to the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement. Gifts in kind (noncash contributions) may be reported by memorandum or lett er; gifts of cash or securities should be delivered promptly to the Development Office for receipting and deposit. The Office of the Vice President for University Advancement will be responsible for providing an official receipt to the donor, for appropri ate acknowledgment, and for informing the appropriate campus personnel. However, departments awarding restricted gifts for student aid are entirely responsible for ensuring that all donor criteria, financial and otherwise, have been met. The board prefers that real estate and gifts -in-kind be given free of restrictions which would reduce the full range of educational benefits which could be realized from the gift. If restrictions are imposed upon the gift , or if the gift is such as to require costs of care, maintenance or upkeep, such gift must be first approved by the board or its designees before acceptance by the board . Gifts of real estate may be given through the NMSU Foundation, but are subject to th e policies and the procedures of the NMSU Foundation. A. Gift Income Spending Policy : The university recognizes the importance of private gift income in providing its colleges and departments the flexibility needed to achieve its goals and objectives. The university also recognizes that different colleges and departments will have varying needs and priorities for the use of the private gift income as they continue to develop and maintain quality programs. This policy is designed to provide those areas recei ving private gifts the maximum amount of latitude to address these differing goals and objectives while at the same time maintaining the fiduciary responsibility inherent in the acceptance of these Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 2 Page 47 of 88 funds. Gift income received by the university from any ex ternal source, including the NMSU Foundation, will be expended in compliance with this policy. In all cases, exceptions may be made if these types of expenditures are sanctioned by the Offices of the President or Executive Vice President and Provost for c ollege or university - wide functions. All expenditures must be for the enhancement or benefit of the university, in recognition of the university's official mission statement. In general, gift funds will be recorded in the current restricted fund, as they are externally restricted to purpose, even if internally unrestricted as to nature of expenditure. Only those gift funds which are received by th e university for any related university purpose, without restriction of any type, are to be recorded in the current unrestricted fund. Within this policy, restricted fund income will be subdivided into restricted and unrestricted gifts based only on the l evel of donor specification attached to the gift, as explained below. B. Restricted Gift Income : For the purpose of this policy, restricted gift income is defined as all gift income on which the donor has placed specific restrictions beyond the general purp ose for which the income is to be used. Thus, income designated for a specific college or department's general use will be classified as unrestricted gift income, as long as that college or department is given full authority to decide how the funds are to be best spent in compliance with the general guidelines detailed above. Any gift income which must be spent for a specific purpose, such as scholarships or travel reimbursement, or under any specific conditions, such as following a certain event or date, will be classified as restricted. All restricted gift income, if accepted and expended, will be expended according to the written restrictions of the donor, without exception. The Office of the Vice President for University Advancement will be responsib le for accepting these restrictions before the gift is accepted on behalf of the university. Following this approval, the documented restrictions will take precedence over the guidelines for disbursement of funds outlined below. C. Unrestricted Gift Income : For the purpose of this policy, unrestricted gift income is defined as all gift income received by the university and not classified as restricted gift income. Expenditures allowable from this category of gift income will be limited by applicable laws, statutes, and regulations, and by this policy. It will be the responsibility of the Business Office to identify gifts as unrestricted, and to verify that donor's intent related to the department within the university in which the funds are to be spent is honored. D. Authorization Structure : The standard approval structure in place for expenditure of non -gift funds will be followed for gift funds. All non -payroll expenditures are to be approved by the department dead (where applicable), dean or director, a nd Office of the Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance . All expenditures involving a payment for ser vices rendered by a university employee will be processed through the Office of Human Resource Services , following all existing authorization requirements for the given transaction. All requests for exception to policy will be directed initially to the Office of the Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance . E. Cash Disbursement Controls : All exi sting university internal controls will apply to disbursements made from gift funds. All requests for expenditure will be submitted on the appropriate form; separate vouchers exist for requesting disbursements directly from the university and the NMSU Foundation. All vouchers will be accompanied by invoice or receipt support, or the attestation of the individual claiming reimbursement if other documentation is not applicable. F. Guidelines for Disbursements of Funds : All gift income funds will be used by o r for the benefit of the university in fulfilling its mission of teaching, research, and public ser vice, including expenses sanctioned for the improvement of employee morale. All types of expenditures falling under these guidelines will be allowable, with the following exceptions: 1. Any payment in conflict with existing law, statute, or regulation applicable to private gift funds. 2. Charitable contributions made to entities or individuals external to the university. Where appropriate, expenses incurred by separate nonprofit organizations which could have legitimately been considered university expenses, such as those incurred by a separate student organization engaged in a university - related function, may be transf erred with the approval of the Office of Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance to the university. 3. Any duplicate payment for goods and ser vices, or reimbursement of employee expense. Duplicate payments include the reimbursement of actual tr avel expense to employees who have already received per diem payment through other sources. 4. Payment for university employee ser vices outside the payroll system. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 2 Page 48 of 88 5. Gifts made to university personnel except as recognition of ser vice to the university. 6. Loans to any individual, unless the gift was made for the specific purpose of establishing a loan fund. 7. Payment of fines imposed for violations of local, state, or federal law, unless resulting from university negligence. 8. Memberships in organizations, country clubs, or other expenditures for any individual, where it cannot be demonstrated that the expenditure is for the enhancement or benefit of the university. G. Endowment Trust : The Board of Regents approved the revocable Endowment Trust Agreement to cover the establishment of endowments, making it possible to take money that has been privately contributed to the NMSU Foundation for endowed chairs, professorships, or lectureships and match it with mo nies from the State of New Mexico. The monies may be placed together into a trust, managed by the NMSU Foundation in such a way that the NMSU Foundation retains title to the private money and the board retains title to the state money in a revocable trust . The board may designate a change in trustee at its discretion at any time or may dissolve the agreement if it desire s. The assignment may allow the NMSU Foundation its usual management fee as trustee. It must, however, contain provisions (1) for termin ation of the placement of all or part of these endowments in the trust at any time at the board 's sole discretion; (2) for annual accountings; and (3) for absolute authority on the part of the board for the disposition of each of the endowments (consistent with the terms of each particular endowment). H. NMSU Endowment Fund : This fund, managed by the NMSU Foundation, was established to enable faculty and friends to contribute to a permanent fund to strengthen the university's academic programs. Endowment funds are permanently invested and a portion of the annual earnings are made available to support the programs selected by donors as the beneficiaries. Earnings over and above the amount available for expenditure are added to the principal. Many contrib utions are received as memorials from those who wish to convey their sympathy upon the death of a relative, friend, or colleague. The university provides an official receipt for all gifts, and, when contributions are made in memoriam, informs the family t hat a memorial gift has been made. Amounts of the contributions are not disclosed. Faculty and staff may contribute through the Foundation via payroll deduction arranged through the Office of Human Resource Services . I. NMSU Foundation, Inc. : The NMS U Foundation, Incorporated, is a private, nonprofit corporation whose only purpose is to accept and administer gifts in support of the university. The NMSU Foundation is a tax -exempt corporation, registered with the appropriate state and federal agencies. Contributions to the Foundation are exempt for federal income tax purposes. The NMSU Foundation works closely with the university. Its directors, who are committed to attracting private resources for the benefit of the university, serve without compensa tion. Contributions may be made for annual operating expenses or for the endowment. J. University -Affiliated Organizations : Numerous organizations have been established to support the Board of Regents in a variety of ways and are separate, not -for-profit entities. The focus of the following policy statement is on those organizations whose primary functions are to solicit, manage, and distribute funds and other assets that are given to these organizations for the support of the university in general or sp ecific colleges or other program areas of the university. The university recognizes advantages of these organizations, such as: 1. Creating an opportunity for private individuals and organizations to invest in the enrichment of the programs with greater ass urance that the benefits of their gifts supplement, not supplant, state appropriations to the institution. 2. Providing a corporate structure for managing private gifts, including endowments and income -producing real property, that do es not jeopardize the university's tax-exempt status, create unnecessary unrelated business tax obligations, or create additional liabilities for the university. 3. Creating an effective forum for alumni and community leaders to participate in and contribute to strengthening the university through their participation in the solicitation, management, and distribution of private gifts and donations to the university. (Other separate entities have been established for purposes unrelated to soliciting or managing gifts and donations on behalf of the university ; i.e., the NMSU Research Park Corporation and Arrowhead Center, Inc., which engage in the commercialization of research productivity. However, this policy focuses on those organizations created to actively engage in raising fun ds for the university. ) Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 2 Page 49 of 88 K. Recognition : Any organization formed to represent the university or any college, department, or program area of the institution will receive approval by the university to represent it to prospective donors. A condition of any recognition of an organization will be that the organization agrees to conduct its business in concert with university policy for such organizations. A written agreement will be executed between the university and each organization, consistent with these policies but recognizing the specific significantly performing fund -raising functions until after the date of adoption of this policy (10/90) will be established as an arm of the NMSU Foundation, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Regents upon the r ecommendation of the Chancellor (or designee). L. Statement of Purpose : The purpose of the organization will be clearly defined as being for the sole benefit of the university, or one or more of its specific programs. In order for the university to be able to support the organizations and not be in conflict with the state 's anti -donation laws, the benefits to the university from the organization will be spelled out in the agreement. M. Structure of the Organization : Organizations may structure themsel ves in any manner they deem appropriate to fulfill their role and responsibilities to the university, with the following understandings: 1. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any amendments should have the approval of the university. 2. A regent, the Chancellor (or designee) may be included a s voting member of the governing board of the organization. 3. Unless specifically agreed otherwise by the university and the organization, the composition of the organization 's governing board will be such as to assure continuation of the organization as an independent, legal entity separate from the university. Normally, more than 50 percent of the governing board membership of the organization must be non -university employee s to assure continuation of the organization as an independent, legal entity separate from the university. 4. When an organization has a beneficial affiliation with an organizational unit, the university organizational unit should be expected to provide the staff support for the organization. No such organization will use funds received by the organization for the benefit of the university to employ staff independently of the university. The university and the organization may agree to allocate some of the income the organization earns to the university for the specific purpose of supplementing institutional staff support. This provision does not preclude the affiliated organization from directly retaini ng professional ser vices as is deemed necessary for the organization to fulfill its responsibilities to the donors and to the university, with the understanding that the retention of fund -raising and/or public relations consultants must be approved by the vice president for university advancement. 5. The affiliated organization 's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws should assure the retention of the organization 's legal status as a tax -exempt non -profit organization pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Inter nal Revenue Code, or any successor statute, if applicable. N. Solicitation of Gifts and Donations : Recognized affiliated organizations may organize and conduct fund -raising campaigns as they deem appropriate, except that major multi -year campaign solicit ation of gifts and donations to support new academic programs or ser vices, the major renovation of existing buildings, or the construction of new facilities may not be initiated without the prior approval of the NMSU system Chancellor . The initiation of any fund -raising campaign by any organization must be coordinated with the overall fund -raising activities of the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement to assure proper contact with potential donors. Each organization will, in concert with the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement, establish procedures for the review and acceptance of gifts and donations and for the coordina tion of solicitations and prospect contacts. The acceptance of any gift or donation that contains restrictions as to its use requires a matching fiscal obligation of the university, creates a future obligation of the university, or involves real property must be approved by the Chancellor (or designee). Although each organization would be expected to maintain records of gifts and donations received and to properly acknowledge such gifts, the university has designated the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement as the central record -keeping agency for all gifts and donations received on behalf of the university.

NMSU's rule on preferred names covers first and middle names; surnames may only be changed with a legal name change. Similarly, a preferred pronoun indicates how an individual would like to be referred to by others in lieu of their name; preferred pronouns may change over time. Some prefer gender -neutral or gender -inclusive pronouns when referring to or speaking with an individual. The following list of possible pronouns is n ot all inclusive: 1. he, him, his; 2. she, her, hers; 3. they, them, their and 4. xe, xem, xir.

Limitations on Use of Preferred Name : Certain academic programs or internships and placements may be governed by New Mexico State law and may limit the use of a preferred name; before entering a preferred name in the system, it is recommended that you spe ak with your dean or ASNMSU legal services attorney regarding these potential regulatory limitations. PART 3: INSTITUTIONAL USE OF PREFERRED NAME VS. LEGAL NAME A. Preferred Name : The preferred name will be used in lieu of the legal name wherever the legal name is not required, such as: learning management system class rosters degree audit system advisee lists email system online directory, unless the student has opted out of the directory ( following is the link to the FERPA page that references opting out of directory information: http://registrar.nmsu.edu/ferpa/ ). B. Legal Name : Use of the legal name (the name that appears on your passport, driver's license, birth certificate or U.S. Social Security card) is required for: admissions and registrar official records transfer credit federal, state, and institutional student financial aid housing contracts payroll benefit information student billing and the student account invoice (including e -bills) disciplinary action other legally binding requirements C.

Even though some processes require the use of the legal name, it is the intent that all offices use the preferred name as much as possible in general communications. It is possible that an online system may not display an individual's preferred name. A preferred name may not be used in an online system because the system must use the legal name or because the system has not yet been updated to use the preferred name. If you have a concern that a legal name is being used instead of the preferred name, please contact the Chief Information Officer a t cio@nmsu.edu . 9. More Information about Preferred Name : For questions regarding a preferred name, please contact the ICT Help Desk at help@nmsu.edu . 10.

Background: The operation of motorized vehicles (electric or combustion engine) in a university setting is always a challenge between providing adequate access to enable the operational needs of the campus to be met versus the pedestrian nature an d desired feel of a campus setting.

Legal Basis: State law establishes the ability for local jurisdictions to place restrictions on the operation of motorized vehicles on controlled access areas. The enforcement of these restrictions, once established, falls to the police dep artment. Violations of these controlled access restrictions will be cited in accordance with state law. C. Need for Controlled Access: Operation of motorized vehicles on sidewalks is a direct conflict with their primary intended use for pedestrian traffic. Furthermore it damages the sidewalks resulting in increased cost to maintain this infrastructure in a reasonable condition. Operation of motorized vehicles on turf areas damages turf and trees, thereby harming the investment made in the establishment and m aintenance of our landscaped areas of the campus. D. Valid Reasons for Access: There are valid reasons for operating motorized vehicles within controlled access areas: 1. Motorized wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (Segway Human Transporters), or other motorized equipment used to provide disabled access. 2. Response to emergencies. Emergencies include any action to protect human life; well -being and to prevent potential damage to property or to respond to utility outages. 3. Deliveries to or transport from specified buildings otherwise inaccessible. It is recognized that several facilities have no delivery access without travel through a controlled access area. These buildings are listed below. Access routes and access parkin g zones shall be established for these buildings, which shall be available for viewing at NMSU Controlled Access Area. a. Aggie Memorial Stadium b. Foreman Hall c. Academic Research C d. Guthrie Hall e. Branson Library f. Hadley Hall g. Chamisa Village h. Health & Social Services i. Computer Center Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 2 Page 79 of 88 j. Jett Hall k. Engineering Complex I E. Defined project specific access: Certain activities such as movement of heavy loads, athl etic events, special events, projects involving the remodel or construction of campus facilities and infrastructure require, by their very nature, limited entry to controlled access areas of the campus. This access route will be established by the project manager as best possible and signed accordingly during the course of the event/project life. F. Use of Turf Vehicles: Maintenance of the campus turf areas requires access by specialized turf vehicles. Nothing in this rule is intended to restr ict access to turf areas by these vehicles. G. Non-emergency Access by Police, Fire and Shuttle Vehicles: Access rights are given to Police and Fire response vehicles for training activities and patrol activities when access will increase the safety of camp us population and its real property assets. Limited access on approved routes is granted to vehicles providing shuttle service to the NMSU campus.

See Section E. 1. below b. \"Emotional Support Animal\" (ESA)\": An emotional support animal is a companion animal that may be permitted , if deemed to be a reasonable accommodation , for a person with a psychological disability , by either the Office of Institutional Equity or the NMSU Office of Student Accessibility Services (in coordination with the VPSS or designee of the community college, if applicable. See Section E. 3. below. c. \"Law Enforcement Animal\": A law enforcement animal is usually a dog , specially trained to assist law enforcement personnel with police work. See Section E. 4.below. d. \"Pet\": See Companion Animal. e. \"Service Animal\": A service animal is either a dog or a miniature horse that is individually trained to do work or perform specific tasks to assist a person with a psychological or physical disability. Service animals are distinct from companion animals, emotional support animals, or other assistive animals. See E. 2. below regarding a service animal's right to public access. f. \"Service Animal in Training\": A service animal in training is defined as either a dog or miniature horse in the process of being trained as a service animal. ( See Section E.2. d. below) g. \"Therapy Animals\": Therapy Animals are animals involved in Animal Assisted Interventions . These definitions were derived from Pet Partners . i. \"Animal Assisted Activity (AAA) Animals\": AAA animals are domesticated companion animals that may visit the university, with prior approval, to provide recipients an opportunity for social interaction, recreation, or educational or motivational benefits. Exampl es would include visits by a group of dogs and their handlers to a university residence hall during exam week. The AAA animals and their handlers receive specialized training by an appropriate organization (e.g. Pet Partners, Therapy Dogs International, Th erapaws.) ii. \"Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) Animals\": AAT animals are domesticated companion animals that assist professionals with goal -directed interventions involving treatment of clients. An example of this would be a handler and the AAT dog being pr esent in a room to assist a speech language pathologist, who is treating a client. The professional sets goals for the session, leads the session, incorporates the animal into the treatment session, evaluates the effectiveness of the Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 7 of 62 session, and document s the progress of the client being treated. Sometimes the professional will also be the handler, and utilize their own companion animal, which has been trained as an AAT animal. See Section E. 4. below. 2. \"Exotic Animal\": Exotic animals are wild, non -domesticated animals , not native to the United States of America, including but not limited to monkeys, tropical birds and certain species of tarantulas and snakes. 3. \"Handler\": A \"handler\" is the person in control of, and a person the university may hold responsible for the acts of a service animal, a service animal in training, or other assistive animal. The handler may or may not also be the owner of the animal. 4. \"NMSU Entity\", sometimes also referred to as \"unit\", is a general term which may refer to a college, a department or any other individual administrative unit within the NMSU system . 5. \"Owner\": A person who has legal custody of an animal covered by this Rule . The unive rsity will hold owners responsible for the acts of their animal. The owner may or may not also be the animal's handler. 6. \"University Housing\": University Housing refers to all housing units and attached yards, as well as to indoor and outdoor common are as under the authority of NMSU Housing and Residential Life. University Housing consists of Single Student Housing and Student Family Housing. 7. \"University Premises\": University premises refers to all land, buildings, or other indoor or outside space owned, leased by NMSU, or otherwise under the control of New Mexico State University. University owned property leased to other entities and not under the operational control of NMSU are not considered university premises for purposes of this Rule . 8. \"Wildlife\": Wildlife refers to non -domesticated animals native to the United States of America, including but not limited to coyotes, wolves, skunks, and certain species of tarantulas and snakes (i.e. rattlesnakes) . E. Rule Statements : 1.

Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 9 of 62 f. Unsupervised An imals: From time to time unsupervised animals may be encountered on a campus or other university property. In these situations, administrative or police action may be taken, for the protection of the public's safety, as well as for the safety and welfare of the animal. 2. Service Animals; Service Animals in Training: a. Public Access: A person with a disability who uses a s ervice animal shall be admitted to any university facility open to the public, including buildings and common carriers, subject to rare exception based on direct threat of significant harm to the health or safety of others. Service animals shall be at all times under the control of the owner, handler or trainer of the service animal. Questions or concerns relating to public access by a service animal, and requests for reasonable accommodation in the workplace or academic setting not involving a service animal should be referred to either the Office of Institutional Equity (employees and visitors) (575-646-3635 or equity@nmsu.edu ), or the Office of Student Accessibility Services, 575 -646-6840 or sas@nmsu.edu . i. The law does not require service animals to wear a ves t; however, NMSU encourages the use of a vest or other service animal identification. ii. Persons with disabilities who utilize a service animal are not r equired to register with any office, nor to request an accommodation, unless an additional accommodation is needed in the academic or work setting. iii. Persons with disabilities who use a service animal on university property shall not be required to pay a fee that others (without animals) are not required to pay. (e.g. pet deposits) ; iv. In an emergency requiring transportation or relocation of an owner, handler or trainer of a service animal or service animal in training, to the extent practicable, accommodati ons shall be made for the service animal or service animal in training to remain with or be reunited with the owner, handler or trainer. When accommodations cannot be made that would allow the animal to remain with the owner, handler or trainer, the servi ce animal or service animal in training shall be placed pursuant to the instructions provided by the owner, handler or trainer. v. Misrepresentation of an animal as an authorized service animal or service animal in training will be taken very seriously . See Section E. 9. b. Inquiries by University Representatives: When it is readily apparent that an animal is trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability (e.g. a dog is observed guiding a person with a visual disability), university representatives should not inquire about the service animal, unless t here is a separate concern about disruption or other issue. It is recommended that faculty, staff or students consult with either the Office of Student Accessibility Services or the Office of Institutional Equity regarding any perceived issues. i. In th e event that it is not readily apparent that an animal is a service animal, university representatives shall not ask about the nature or extent of the person's disability, but may make two inquiries, as permitted by guidance issued pertaining to the Americ ans with Disabilities Act: 1. Is the animal a service animal required because of a disability?, and/or 2. What work or task is the animal trained to perform? ii. University representatives shall not ask for documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained or licensed as a Service Animal; nor shall they ask the handler to demonstrate the tasks. iii. For university programs and/or classes held at non -NMSU facilities, the owner of the property may require notification or verification that the animal is a service animal. c. Control, Care and Maintenance: Subject to limited exceptions required due to a handler's particular disability, owners, handlers and trainers of service animals and service animals in training shall comply with the requirements of E. 1 and E. 5. relating to animal control, care and maintenance. d. Service Animals in Training: Based on New Mexico law, service animals in training shall be admitted to facilities open to the public on the same basi s that a service animal would be. e. Denial of Public Access: Any decision to exclude a service animal from a particular area of the university shall be made on a case -by-case basis, in coordination with the person with the disability; and if possible, also in coordination with either the Office of Student Accessibility Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 10 of 62 Services (for students) or the Office of Institutional Equity (for employees and visitors). See Also Section E. 1. c. above. f. ADA Complaint Resolution: persons with disabilities who believe t heir rights under the ADA are not being honored may file either an internal complaint of disability discrimination with the Office of Institutional Equity (575 -646-3635 or equity@nmsu.edu ), or may file an external com plaint with appropriate state and/or federal agencies. Internal complaints received will be promptly investigated and resolved. Appropriate corrective action will be taken for violations of this Rule , in correlation with the severity of the offense. 3. Emotional Support Animals Permitted in Restricted Areas : Federal law recognizes that under certain circumstances, the presence of a companion animal which provides emotional support may be granted by the appropriate university office (e.g. Office of Institutional Equity for employees and visitors; Office of Student Accessibility Services , for students) as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disabilit y. An example of an accommodation that might be found to be reasonable, depending upon the circumstances presented, would be waiver by university housing of its standard prohibition of companion animals, to permit an emotional support animal to reside wit h its owner with a disability. The university's standard procedures for assessing student requests for reasonable accommodation shall be applied, on a case by case basis, and result in an Accommodation Agreement that addresses the animal access issues. a. A request for an emotional support animal must be based upon medical documentation indicating that the animal's presence alleviates psychological symptoms or effects associated with the disability of its owner/handler. b. While the law requires that there b e a nexus between the person's disability and the comfort provided by an emotional support animal, it does not require the animal to be trained to perform specific task(s) directly for their handler. Emotional support animals may be permitted access only t o the areas specifically identified in an Accommodation Agreement authorized by the appropriate university office or other entity. c. Persons with disabilities authorized for an emotional support animal, by either the Office of Student Accessibility Service s or by the Office of Institutional Equity, shall carry a copy of the Accommodation Agreement with them. The use of a vest or other identification as an emotional support animal is encouraged. d. In the event that it is not readily apparent that an animal s hould be permitted access to a particular university venue, university representatives shall not seek disability related information, and if the animal is identified as an emotional support animal, may ask to see a copy of the Accommodation Agreement autho rizing access, or name of the university official or other entity granting similar approval. e. Misrepresentation of an animal as an authorized emotional support animal will be taken very seriously. See Section E. 9. f. Control, Care and Maintenance: Owners and handlers of emotional support animals are subject to the requirements of E. 1 and E. 5. relating to animal control, care and maintenance. g. ADA Complaint Resolution: persons with disabilities who believe their rights under the ADA are not being h onored may file either an internal complaint of disability discrimination with the Office of Institutional Equity (575 -646-3635 or equity@nmsu.edu ), or may file an external complaint with appropriate state and/or fede ral agencies. Internal complaints received will be promptly investigated and resolved. Appropriate corrective action will be taken for violations of this Rule , in correlation with the severity of the offense. 4. Working Assistive Animals : a. Therapy Animals: Therapy animals, also referred to as animals used in animal assisted interventions, (AAI) are distinct from emotional support animals and from service animals and do not have the same right to public access. Therapy animals are regulated by guideli nes determined by specific association s. (e.g. Pet Partners, Therapy Dogs International, Therapaws). Visits by this type of animal to university campuses and within buildings are permitted, subject to approval from the a ppropriate department hea d, director or equivalent administrator. See NMSU Counseling Center for \"Guidelines for Animal Assisted Interventions\". b. Law Enforcement Animals: Animals under the authority of law enforcement personnel, while actively responding to an actual or perceived event, are not subject to the provisions of this Rule . Their control, care and maintenance is governed by state and/or federal case law and is incorporated into the NMSU Police Department, Law Enforceme nt Canine Handbook , or other policies and procedures applicable to the specific law enforcement agency that owns the working animal. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 11 of 62 5. General Animal Welfare Requirements : NMSU abides by guidelines associated with basic animal welfare and promotes quality of life for all companion and assistive animals on university premises. The following principles listed below apply to the animals within the scope of this Rule , in order to ensure their physical, mental and emotional well -being. Additionally, owners/handlers shall comply with applicable county ordinance and state law. See Do\u00f1a Ana County Ordina nce The five freedoms listed at 1 -5 below, were adapted from the Farm Animal Welfare Council's Five Freedoms (www.fawc.org.uk/freedoms.htm ) originally developed to set standards for livestock welfare; however, they e ncapsulate the basic principles that are expected to be applied at NMSU to companion and assistive animals: a. Freedom from hunger and thirst: Companion and assistive animals shall be provided ready access to fresh water and be provided with a diet to max imize short and long term health. b. Freedom from discomfort: Because service animals are at their handler's side for a large part of each day, it is anticipated that the basic care of providing adequate shelter will be maintained. All companion and assisti ve animals residing or otherwise permitted on university premises shall be provided adequate shelter. c. Freedom from pain, injury, or disease: The owner/handler of the companion or assistive animal will ensure the physical health of the animal, including b ut not limited to avoidance of locations that may involve the use of hazardous materials (certain science labs) or interaction with NMSU livestock or horses; extended walking on asphalt or cement surfaces during summer months; as well as regular vet check -ups and vaccinations or titer testing for the following: rabies, distemper, parvovirus and bordetella. If the animal is unable to be vaccinated for health reasons, the owner/handler needs to have a document from the treating veterinarian stating that this is the case. d. Freedom to express normal behavior: The life of a service animal is one of work. However, its owner/handler should ensure that the animal be provided with an appropriate level of \"down -time\" or \"play -time\" in order to maintain the service a nimal's mental well -being. The use of positive training techniques is encouraged. e. Freedom from fear and distress: Service animals may be exposed to people, situations, or surroundings that companion and other assistive animals would not be exposed to. F or example, very crowded noisy hallways in university buildings. It is the responsibility of the animal's owner/handler to ensure that the animal has received effective training so that the animal not only behaves appropriately in these settings, but that the animal has had positive experiences while being exposed to these settings so it does not become stressed. Leaving companion and other assistive animals confined in quarters alone for extended periods of time may be a violation of this Rule , depending upon the specific circumstances. f. Other special issues to consider when tending to the welfare of service animals include: i. Respect for the aging of the animal, including any signs of cognitive or physical impairment, must be shown, including considera tion of the appropriate time to for retiring the animal from service duties; ii. Related to the provisions of subsection E. 5. e. above, owners/handlers should be aware of the potential sources of chronic stress to the animal, and consider the impact that such stress may have on the animal. This necessitates that the owner/handler pay attention to the warning signs of chronic stress in their service or other animal and take appropriate action to lessen the impact of the stress. This is particularly true if th e animal is expected to work for long periods of time in unpredictable settings doing stressful work (i.e., attending a football game where there are fireworks or cannon shots while being surrounded by many people, or having to perform physically or psycho logically demanding duties). iii. Additionally, owners/handlers are subject to the provisions of E. 1. c. i., regarding situations which pose potential health or safety risks to others or to their animal. Owners and handlers are encouraged to consider potential hazards carefully, and in advance, in order to decide whether or not an accommodation within an academic setting or workplace will be necessary o r feasible. The owner or handler should communicate as early as possible with the faculty member, employer or other person with authority if it appears a modification to protocols or to physical environments may be necessary for the protection of other pe rsons or the animal. 6. Establishment of Companion and Assistive Animals Committee: The Board of Regents hereby establishes the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee as a standing \"university board\" as defined by Policy 1.05.90 . Complaints and other matters of concern relating to the interpretation, application or enforcement of this Rule , or corresponding procedures, may be submitted to this committee for resolution. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 12 of 62 The committee's authority to review and resolve complaints concerning animals on campus is supplemental to other grievances which might be filed. a. Authority: The Companion and Assistive Animals Committee shall serve both as an advisory resource to the individual Rule administrators regarding the application and enforcement of this Rule , as well as a body that will assist the university community with dispute resolution as needed for issues involving animals on campus. The committee shall have no autho rity relative to teaching or research animals under the authority of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, governed by distinct federal regulations. Other than its advisory function, the committee shall have no authority to take action in matte rs where another university department has jurisdiction to act, such as the NMSU Police Department (a criminal case involving an alleged vicious animal) or the Office of Institutional Equity (exclusion of a service animal resulting in a complaint of discri mination in violation of the ADA). b. Membership: The Companion and Assistive Animals Committee shall be comprised of: each Rule administrator identified in Section C. ; one or more faculty or staff invitees of the Rule administrators, who have knowledge or expertise regarding service, companion and other assistive animals; the chair of the IACUC Committee or designee ( ex officio ), and a representative from the Office of General Counsel (ex officio) . c. Meetings: The Companion and Assistive Animals Committe e may be convened by any of its members, at any time necessary for the resolution of issues pursuant to this Rule . Representatives from the community colleges and or other faculty, staff or students in need of an advisory opinion or other assistance from t he committee may submit their issue in writing or request to present in person to the committee. 7. Dispute/Complaint Resolution : Any person may bring an issue of a Rule violation or other problem with an animal on campus to the attention of any of the in dividual Rule administrators ( See Section C. above), and/ or directly to the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee . a. Elements of Complaint or Other Concern: To the extent possible, complaints and other letters of concern shall provide date, time, and location of any alleged violation or incident; the party or parties charged, if known; any witnesses, if known; any other relevant facts; as well as the relief sought by the complainant. b. Complaint Prioritization: Complaints and other letters of concern will be processed in the order they are received, unless there is a health or safety risk involved, in which case, it will b e expedited. c. Receipt and Routing for Initial Review: The recipient of a complaint or other letter of concern shall coordinate with the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee , and route it for initial review by the appropriate Rule admini strator. Initial review may involve: i. Investigation of the facts by the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee , in coordination with the appropriate Rule administrator; ii. Exploration of avenues for resolution of the issues raised, including discussion, community education, mediation or other methods. iii. If the Rule administrator is able to resolve it in accordance with the Rule /procedures under their jurisdiction, the matter shall be closed. iv. If an issue is not resolved within 7 business days, it may be forwarded by any of the involved parties (the complainant, the respondent, the Rule administrator, the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee ) to the full Companion and Assistive Animals Committee for consideration and further action. d. Committee Review: If the complaint or concern is not resolved by the Rule Administrator or by the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee through discussions with or between the parties, the chair may convene all the members of the committee t o consider the matter. i. The committee shall hear from all parties. Contact shall be made through notice by personal delivery, email , other electronic means, or by US mail to the most current address on record with the university, if any. A copy of the complaint or other letter of concern shall be included with the communication, inviting comment or attendance at a meeting. Each party shall respond in writing indicating their preference. ii. If they do not wish to attend the meeting/hearing at which the matter will be discussed, the involved parties may submit a written position statement in lieu of attendance to be considered by the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee . Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 13 of 62 iii. The Companion an d Assistive Animals Committee or its individual members may be in a position to procure relevant evidence, and may contribute such to the hearing of the matter, in the interest of obtaining a fair result , provided that all parties are informed about the ma terial being considered, and have the opportunity to review and/or rebut it. iv. After consideration of the relevant facts, including submissions received from the involved parties, a majority of a quorum of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee will issue a decision, either verbally to the parties at the close of the meeting/hearing, or by way of a written decision within 7 business days from the date the hearing was held. v. The meeting/hearing shall be recorded. vi. The decision of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee shall be final. 8. Education of University Community : The Rule administrators, working in conjunction with the Office of Institutional Equity and/or the NMSU Office of Student Accessibility Services, will ensure that appropriate training is provided to faculty, staff and students regarding the law's requirements for non -discriminatory equal access, in order to increase mutual understanding and to reduce misunderstanding and/or conflict about where different types of animals are p ermitted to be on campus. 9. Misrepresentation of Animal as an Authorized Animal : The New Mexico Service Animal Act , NMSA 1978, Section 28 -11-6 et seq, makes it a crime to knowingly present an animal as a service animal or service animal in training when it does not meet the definition. Additionally, f alsification of documentation or other misrepresentation of an animal as a service animal, service anima l in training, emotional support animal or other animal permitted under these policies, in order to gain access to university facilities not otherwise open to companion animals, will be taken seriously. If reported or suspected, the appropriate university office will investigate . Administrative, disciplinary and/or criminal action will be pursued as warranted by the investigative findings . 10. Conflicts Involving Assistive and Companion Animals : It is recognized that presence of animals on campus may from time to time create problems for others. For example, the presence of a service animal, other assistive animal or companion animal may negatively affect others with allergies, respiratory impairments and other conditions. a. The facts relevant to each conflict situation will be assessed in order to balance the rights of each affected party, and to the extent feasible, the rights of each party will be honored, with or without accommodation of policies, procedures, course schedu les etc. b. When a conflict involves two animals, the public access rights of a service animal or service animal in training will likely prevail. Note: The New Mexico Service Animal Act makes it a crime to intentionally fail or refuse to control an unrestrained animal, which animal interferes with or obstructs the owner, trainer, or handler of the service animal or service animal in training. c. When a conflic t involves any person and either the owner, handler or trainer of a service animal or service animal in training; or involves any person and the service animal or service animal in training; the rights of the owner, handler or trainer and/or the rights of the service animal or service animal in training will likely prevail. Note: The New Mexico Service Animal Act makes it a crime to intentionally interfere with (i.e. harassment or obstruction) with the use of a service animal or service animal in training. d. Conflict resolution will be managed by the Office of Student Accessibility Services or the Office of Institutional Equity, as appropriate, for conflicts involving service animals and animals permitted as emotional support animals; those offices may utilize the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee in an advisory capacity. e. Conflicts involving companion animals may be directed to the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee for resolution by that committee. F. Related Procedures and Forms : Consiste nt with Policy and Rule 1.10, the policy administrators, in consultation with the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee, and approval from their respective vice president or equivalent administrator, may issue supplemental procedural guidelines and/or forms. Such procedures shall not conflict with th is Rule , and are intended to facilitate the implementation, appli cation, and enforcement . Such procedures and forms shall be posted at an appropriate NMSU website, and linked from this Section. Rule 3.07 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concern A.

It also includes all incidents of hate crimes, dating violence, and domestic violence. E. General Principles: 1. Early Reporting and Intervention: While potential incidents of violence are at the forefront of concern, this Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 15 of 62 Rule is intend ed to address individual behaviors that may be, or may become, a disruption to the environment, whether classroom, office, housing or other university facility. Outreach at an early stage is desirable to prevent violence in some instances, and to retain a n employee or student in more instances. This Rule is therefore designed to encourage the reporting of behaviors of concern before they lead to violence or other serious harm. In the unfortunate event that a critical incident should occur, administrators are not relieved of their duties under other policies and protocols (e.g. emergency notification and response; support to victims of violence; internal and/or police investigation into alleged misconduct; and student/employee disciplinary action and/or pu nitive consequences, including arrest). a. Any person, including university employees and students, who observes behavior of concern is encouraged to submit a report under this Rule . b. Persons who in good faith submit a report or take other action authorized by this Rule shall not be subjected to adverse action for having done so. c. It is acknowledged that some individuals may be both student and employee; in those situations, action will be taken in the best interest of the individual and the institution, and may include administrative action under either student policies/procedures or employee policies/procedures, or both. d. As part of a larger and institution -wide commitment to a secure campus and workplace environment, the university is committed to the development of preventive measures. In addition to the work of the CARE Committee, the Behavioral Intervention Team and/or NMSU Police Chief and/or designee; other examples include: pre -employment screening, employee assistance program, student support services, and other outreach and educational initiatives. e. The university's Office of Human Resource Services -Employee Management Services provides collaborative problem -solving assistan ce to supervisors and employees in the area of conflict resolution in an attempt to address and diffuse tensions caused by interpersonal disputes or other reasons, before disputes in the workplace reach a level at which violence may erupt. f. Individuals f ound to have intentionally and maliciously submitted a false report may be subject to appropriate administrative, civil or criminal action. 2. Retaliation Prohibited: Individuals who are found to have retaliated against any individual reporting or taking other action under this Rule , including encouraging or assisting another to report behavior of concern, may be subject to administrative, civil or criminal action as may be appropriate under the circumstances. 3. Establishment of the CARE Committee: To facilitate implementation and administration of this Rule , the Board of Regents formally recognizes and authorizes the Conduct Assessment/Response, and Education (CARE) Committee as a standing university board, alon g with its subcommittee, the Behavioral Intervention Team. See Official List of University Boards . 4. Role of the CARE Committee and the Behavio ral Intervention Team: The CARE Committee and Behavioral Intervention Team assess and coordinate response to reported behaviors of concern that do not pose an immediate threat of personal harm (to self or others), nor to property. These committees have be en established in part to facilitate the assembly of information from the distinct NMSU entities that may be privy to relevant information, in order to assist with the assessment for risk of harm. The CARE Committee defers to the Behavioral Intervention Te am and other qualified professionals the decision making regarding the nature and type of appropriate responsive action. a. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team do not provide counseling or medical advice or services, but each may act to refer individuals to such internal or external resources, especially in situations involving victims of violence. b. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team are not responsible for responding to campus emergencies. Emergency response is per formed by the appropriate public safety entities (e.g. police or fire), with consequence management (continuity of operations and disaster recovery) addressed by the Central Administration Response Team (\"CART\"), consisting of university executive administ rators ( See Rule 2.25 Emergency Preparedness and Response ) However, the CART or other public safety professional may request information or assistance from either the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team as needed when responding to or managing an emergency. This provision is not intended to affect or otherwise limit the authority of the individual members of the Behavioral Intervention Team to act in their professional capacity, or to take emergency medical action as permitted by state law. c. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team will work with other university offices and resources to publicize, throughout the NMSU system, the purpose and functions of the committee Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 16 of 62 and the protocols in place for reporting behavior of concern, including new employee and new student orientation at all campuses. d. The members of the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team are authorized to obtain information pertaining to a matter pending review by the committee or team about individuals from supervisors of the NMSU entities and from students for relevant information; supervisors and students shall respond cooperatively and timely to such requests, for the benefit of the person involved as well as for t hat of the institution. e. The Office of General Counsel provides legal counsel to the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team, and is included in their meetings as an ex officio member. f. All members of, as well as individuals involved with, proc eedings of the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team shall maintain confidentiality at all times as required by law, including professional licensing standards regulated by the State of New Mexico. F. Procedural Guidelines and Flowchart : As au thorized by Regents Policy 1.10 and former NMSU Policy 3.07, Section F., the following guidelines issued on April 13.2013 supplement this replicated Rule 3.07. See Also Flowchart at Dean of Students - Worried About Someone . 1. Review Procedures for Reported Behavior of Concern : The following are the essential procedures for the reporting, initial review of reports; fact gathering; assessment of risk by professionals; and action taken in response relating to reported behaviors of concern. See Also the corresponding Flowchart for an overview of the process. a. Report by Member of University Community: Memb ers of the university community report behaviors of concern that they may observe through the Office of the Dean of Students website, \"Worried About Someone?\" located at deanofstudents.nmsu.edu , or by phone to 575 -646-1722, or at the on -line reporting at concernreport@nmsu.edu . If the behavior of concern also constitutes a crime, or more importantly, poses a potential for imminent harm to a person or property, the individual reporting the behavior should call 9 11 directly. 2. Receipt of Report/Initial Review : a. Reports of behavior of concern shall be reviewed daily by the appropriate policy administrator: i. For student behavior of concern, the Dean of Students or designee; ii. For employee behavior of concern, the Asst. VP for Human Resource Services or designee; iii. For volunteer, vendor, visitor or other third party behavior of concern, the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee. b. The appropriate policy administrator shall provide an abbreviated review based upon the limited facts in the report and: i. If there appears to be imminent risk of harm to self or others, the matter shall be referred to the NMSU Emergency Dispatch, for appropriate medical or law enforcement response; ii. If there appears to be an immediate need, but no risk of harm, the matter shall be referred to the Behavioral Intervention Team for expedited fact gathering, assessment for risk, and responsive action. iii. If there appears to be no immediate need for either administrative, law enforcement or medical attention, the matter shall be referred to the next meeting of the CARE Committee. c. Fact Gathering: Absent an active emergency, it is the role of the CARE Committee, the Behavioral Intervention Team and the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee to seek addi tional information which may be known by other areas within the university and surrounding areas, and to share with all involved as appropriate, in order to best assess the behavior of concern and determine the level of risk of harm presented, if any. Add itionally, they may, but are not obligated to, contact the individual's emergency contact listed in the NMSU Emergency Notification System to obtain additional information from family or friends that may be familiar with the individual whose behavior has b een reported. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team members also will expedite the provision of available information to the designated NMSU Police personnel, as may be requested during emergent circumstances that arise from behavior of concern by a student or employee. d. Risk Assessment and Case Assignment: The following evaluation classifications identified by Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 17 of 62 Deisginger and Randazzo are adapted by this policy to assess any risk of harm that a behavior of concern may present. Cases m ay be assessed and re -assessed dependent upon the circumstances of each case, and as each develops. i. EXTREME RISK (Level 1): Appears to pose an immediate threat of violence or self -harm. REQUIRES immediate containment, law enforcement or emergency medica tion, target protection, and/or a Threat Management Plan. Matters assessed at Level 1 will be assigned to the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee to coordinate law enforcement action and/or emergency medical assistance. The NMSU Police Chief and/or designee will take the lead in coordinating all Risk Level 1 Threat Management Plans. ii. HIGH RISK (Level 2): Appears to pose a threat of violence or self -harm but lacks immediacy or specific plan. REQUIRES a Responsive Action Plan. Matters assessed at Level 2 will b e assigned to the Behavioral Intervention Team, for development of a Responsive Action Plan, which will be implemented and monitored by the Behavioral Intervention Team, in conjunction with the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee. iii. MODERATE RISK (Level 3): Does not appear to pose a threat of violence or self -harm at this time, but exhibits behaviors or circumstances that are likely to be disruptive to the community. REQUIRES active monitoring and referrals. Matters assessed at Level 3 will be ass igned to the Behavioral Intervention Team, for development of a Responsive Action Plan, which will be implemented and monitored by the Behavioral Intervention Team, with assistance from the CARE Committee or the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee, as may be requested. iv. LOW RISK (Level 4): Does not appear to pose a threat of violence or self -harm at this time, nor is a significant disruption to the community expected. REQUIRES passive monitoring and referrals as appropriate. Matters assessed at Level 4 will b e referred to the CARE Committee to develop a Responsive Action Plan. v. NO IDENTIFIED RISK (Level 5): Does not appear to pose a threat of violence or self -harm at this time, nor is the person a significant disruption to the community expected. No monitoring is required. Matters assessed at Level 5 will be referred to the CARE Committee to open a file and store the information for future reference. e. Case Worker Responsibilities: For each Responsive Action Plan, a single case worker will be identified by the Behavioral Intervention Team or the CARE Committee as the primary contact for communications and documentation. i. The case worker shall lead and/or coordinate implementation of the plan, which shall be reviewed on a regular basis to determine effectiveness, and whether or not plan modifications are necessary. ii. In the event that an individual's behavior results in arrest for criminal misconduct or hospitalization for a condition that contributed to the behavior of concern, the role of the case worker is to m onitor the status and to work as closely as the individual will permit regarding their release and the individual's plans to return to the work or academic environment. iii. The case worker will be responsible for documenting and reporting progress implemen ting the responsive action plan, as well any new developments, to the NMSI Police Chief and/or designee, to the Behavioral Intervention Team or CARE Committee, or chair, as appropriate. iv. The Chair of the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team w ill coordinate with affected faculty, staff or students as needed, while also respecting the involved individual's wishes regarding privacy and confidentiality; when exigent circumstances exist, the law will be followed and proper documentation will be mai ntained. f. Police Communication: Upon successful execution of a Threat Management Plan, the matter will be appropriately referred by the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee to the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team for re -assessment of the risk level. g. File Closure: A matter will be closed if evaluated as a level 5, and there is no further development changing that status for six months. i. A Threat Management Plan, or a Responsive Action Plan, may be modified or continued for as long a s the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee or Behavioral Intervention Team decides is appropriate, and during which time the matter will remain open and pending periodic review and reporting to CARE Committee by the case worker. ii. If the risk assessment indica ted no need for either a Threat Assessment Plan nor for a Responsive Action Plan, the matter will remain open for a period of six months; if there are no subsequent Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 18 of 62 developments during that time, the file will be closed and stored in the office of the appr opriate policy administrator. iii. All matter assessed or re -assessed as Level 5 will remain open for six months and if there are no subsequent developments during that time, the file will be closed and stored in the office of the appropriate policy administra tor. h. Documentation and Custodian(s) of Records: The chair of the CARE Committee and the chair of the Behavioral Intervention Team will work with the assigned case workers to ensure that proper documentation is prepared and maintained. i. The official custodian of the CARE Committee's records, including meeting notes and Level 4 and 5 cases assigned to case workers, is the Dean of Students. ii. The official custodian of the Behavioral Intervention Team records, including and limited to Level 2 and 3 cases assigned to case workers, is the appropriate policy administrator for the type of individual (e.g. student, employee or third party visitor). iii. The official custodian of Level 1 Threat Management Plans and related records, and all other criminal records which might relate to cases assessed at any risk level pursuant to this policy, is the NMSU Chief of Police and/or designee. i. Retention of Records: The documentation related to reported cases, responsive action plans (if created), and/or a ny administrative action taken as a result of reported or observed behavior of concern will be maintained for ten years following file closure, in the office of the appropriate record custodian, unless New Mexico or federal law require retention for a long er period.

REVISION HISTORY : Policy recommended by University Administrative Council 04.14.15; policy a dopted by Board of Regents 05.08.15 . 3.19.30 Addressing Concerns Relating to Ethical Conduct Individuals who have concerns about the propriety of a situation or about the conduct of a university employee or someone acting on behalf of the university , are expected to consult with appropriate university officials (that is, the person to whom the individual whose conduct is in question directly reports or, in the case of someone acting on behalf of the university, the chair of the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities, or when a regent is invol ved, the Chancellor ). Confidentiality about individuals reporting violations of these standards will be maintained whenever possible and employees shall be free from retaliation for voicing concerns. Rules 3.20.10 - 3.20.38: Conflicts of Interest and Conflicts of Commitment in General (See Rule 3.75 Non Work Related Use of University Resources , 3.92 Sales and Solicitation , 4.50 Outside Employment and/or Activities , 4.60 Public Affairs Participation , 5.30 Faculty Consulting , 7.05 Educational Opportunities for Employees and Their Families , and 8.25 Professional intentionally omitted) Rule 3.20.1 0 - Principles Both individual members of the university and entities controlled by the university have a vital need to recognize and deal with conflicts of interest and/or commitment. Such conflicts may compromise or have the appearance of compromising t he integrity of university -related activities and have unforeseen effects on those activities. Even if there is no perceptible effect on the activity, any apparent inability of the university to avoid and/or resolve conflicts of interest invites outside criticism and supervision. Such supervision could result in the loss of the university's Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 22 of 62 ability to decide its own direction. Conflicts of interest may be primarily financial or may involve th e use of one's position and powers for non -monetary self -interest. Such conflicts may be personal or relate primarily to the institution or its constituent organizations or involve an individual whose behavior is inextricably linked with her or his offici al position, such as an upper -level administrator or a member of the Board of Regents . In any of these situations, the general principles remain the same; 1) disclose always, 2) manage when possible; and 3) prohibit when necessary and where management is not possible. A. Disclose always: It is vitally important that individuals provide a clear picture of their activities and complete forms accurately and in a factually correct manner so that potential or actual conflicts of interest can be identified. Simi larly, if situations change, disclosure needs to be made within 15 working days (see section 3.20. 15 of this Rule ). The university is under no obligation to manage, as opposed to prohibit, a conflict of interest disclosed by someone other than the individ uals primarily involved. B. Manage when possible : The vast majority of conflicts can and are managed through removing at least one of the parties from the conflict situation. For example, an individual might recuse him or herself from the review process on a proposal, have another individual become principal investigator or abstain from participating in a particular promotion or tenure situation. The preference of the institution will be to provide management solutions to a conflict of interest that will r emove or isolate the conflict. However, such management is not possible when disclosure is not made. C. Prohibit when necessary and where management is not possible : In some few cases, it will not be possible to manage a conflict and the individual or orga nization will have to withdraw from the activity. In some cases, university policy or rules and/or state or federal law allows no solution other than prohibition. For example, no member of the Board of Regents may act as a vendor of goods or ser vices to the university (Board of Regents Bylaws and Section 21 -1-35, NMSA 1978). Rule 3.20.15 - Procedures and Remedies in Cases of Conflicts of Interest and/or Commitment [Amendment presented to the Administrative Council 04.13.10; ratified by the Board of Regents 07.20.10 ] It is the responsibility of all persons covered by this Rule to report any real, apparent or potential conflict of interest or commitment to their supervisor s. The primary means of doing this is through the completion of the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form upon hire and on an annual basis, with disclosure updates submitted on the basis of changes in circumstance. Additional policies, as set forth in Sectio n 3.21.26 of this Rule , are applicable to conflicts arising from sponsored activities but are based upon the annual disclosure requirement. A. Procedure: Each person covered by this Rule is required to complete, sign and submit a Conflict of Interest Disclosure form upon hire with any NMSU entity; as new conflicts arise during employment by NMSU; and on an annual basis as requested by the Office of Human Resource Ser vices. Completed forms will be reviewed and approved by the applicable supervisor (and only require next level supervisor review as defined below). Disclosure forms submitted containing no conflicts require only one level of review and approval. Disclosure forms submitted containing one or more (real or perceived) conflicts of interest require two levels of review and approval. In addition, a plan to manage or eliminate the conflict(s) must be submitted. If a conflict of interest or commitment exists for which no management plan is possible, the supervisor is required to recommend a plan of acti on. Conflicts of interest and c ommitment that have been submitted may be reviewed by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities as necessary. Maintenance of the form is the responsibility of the Office of Human Resource Ser vices. B. Paths Towards Remedies: There are two basic conditions that influence the path taken to remedy a conflict of interest or commitment. These may be summed up in the questions: 1) did the conflict arise as part of a sponsored activity? and 2) who disclosed the conflict? These questions must be asked together, as a conflict may be self -disclosed or disclosed by others and may or may not arise as part of a sponsored activity. The first question that determines disposition of conflicts of int erest and/or commitment is whether or not the conflict arises from a sponsored activity. The treatment of conflicts in non -sponsored activities will follow normal personnel procedures as outlined in Rule 4.05 Appeals /Grievances and Policy 4.25 Due Process , drawing informally on the ad vice of the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities as desired. Resolution of conflicts arising from sponsored activities shall be gov erned by the procedures set forth in Section 3.21.27 of this Rule . The second question is whether the individual(s) involved in the conflict made the disclosure prospectively or as part of a timely update, or whether someone else has brought the conflict to the university's attention. In cases disclosed by the individua l(s) having the conflict, the university will generally try to manage the conflict in a manner agreeable to the parties involved and in agreement with applicable Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 23 of 62 university policies and state and federal laws. The person(s) identified as having the conflic t may elect to manage the conflict by participating in measures that will guard the integrity of the situation. Such measures require the approval of the relevant dean, vice president or vice provost or (in the case of sponsored activities, the Committee o n Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities). The person(s) involved may choose or be told to withdraw from the activity or situation that creates the conflict. In some cases, the supervisor and appropriate dean, vice president or vice provost and, if applicable, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities, shall approve the action taken. When someone other than the individual(s) involved in the conflict brings an existing conflict to the attention of the university, the university is under no obligation to try to remedy the conflict and may require that the individual(s) withdraw from the activity or situation creating the conflict. In addition, the individual(s) may be required to repay monies that have been obtained in a situation involving a conflict of interest or commitment. Other sanctions up to and including termination of an individual's employment, may be imposed; subject to the appeals process outlined in Policies 4.05 Appeals/Grievan ces and 4.25 Due Process . Rule 3.20.20 - Definition of Terms The definitions and example listed below are intended to aid university employees and appropriate review bodies in identifying conflicts of interest. Identifying conflict situations and documenting steps taken to manage these conflicts serve to protect the employees and the institution, as well as ensure that the university will remain eligible for government sponsored research. Rule 3.20.22 - Member of the University Community Members of the university community includes regents, employees (administrators, faculty, staff, student employees) and others acting on behalf of the university (including those acting on behalf of university controlled entities such as the NMSU Foundation). Rule 3.20.23 -Relatio nships For purposes of this Rule , the term \"relationships\" shall mean and include the following : A.

Rule 3.20.27 -Conflicts of Interest Conflicts of interest occur when there is a competition between a member of the university community's private interests and the member's professional obligations to the university such that an independent observer might reasonably question whether the mem ber's professional actions or decisions are determined by any considerations other than the interests of the university . In this context, the term member of the university community also includes that member's family members, close personal friends and bu siness partners and corporate professional associates, as listed in Section 3.20.23 . A. Examples of conflicts of interest may include but are not limited to: 1. The presence of a real or apparent incentive for the faculty or staff member to decide an issue in such a way as to have the opportunity for a financial interest in the result. 2. A faculty o r staff member having a significant financial interest in a concern that is in direct competition with the interests of NMSU. 3. Procuring good s or ser vices for NMSU from a concern in which an NMSU regent, administrator, faculty or staff member or member of their family has a significant financial interest. 4.

Rule 3.20.28 -Conflicts of Commitment Full-time faculty and staff of New Mexico State University owe their primary professional allegiance and their primary commitment of time and intellectual efforts to the education, research and ser vice programs of NMSU. Conflicts of commitment occur whenever the time devoted to external activities adversely affects a faculty or staff member's capacity to undertake NMSU responsibilities, including maintaining appropriate time and accessibility as define d by the requirements of the job. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 25 of 62 A. Examples of conflicts of commitment may include but are not limited to: 1. Maintaining full -time paid employment at another institution/organization that interferes with work performance and/or attendance. ( See Rule 4.50 Outside Employment and/or Activities ) 2. Excessive (not more than one day per week, on average) private consulting or advisory committee ser vice, even if it is in the public interest or pro bono. 3. Taking on a significant management role in a non -NMSU entity as part of consulting activities. 4. Holding an elective political office. B. Examples of permitted activities may include but are not limited to : 1.

Rule 3.20.3 2 through 3.20.28 - Rules for Specific Situations (3.20. 29-31 intentionally omitted) Rule 3.20.32 -Nepotism Members of a family may be employed by the university except when one individual will directly supervise the work of the other. If one member of the family is to be employed in the same department as another, approval shall be obtained from the executive vice president and provost prior to any offer of emplo yment. Under no circumstances will a supervisor evaluate a family member. Rule 3.20.33 - Faculty or Staff as Students When a university faculty or staff member enrolls in a program to earn a degree at the university, a potential for conflict of interest may arise as a result of the dual role as student and as a faculty or staff member. Persons in this status who are seeking degrees or certificates must demonstrate that the potential for conflict of interest will not compromise the quality of their progra m of study. Approval of cognizant department heads and deans will be required. In any case, supervisors should never have the responsibility of grading individuals whom they supervise. In the case of graduate degrees or certificates, such programs must also be approved on a case -by-case basis by the dean of the Graduate School with the concurrence of the executive vice president and provost . When appropriate, the dean may confer with th e Graduate Council about the potential for conflict of interest in such programs. The graduate dean may require a specific representative on such a graduate committee, possibly including off campus representatives, as a condition for approving programs. Rule 3.20.34 - Relatives and Significant Others as Students Faculty of NMSU may not place themselves or be placed by others in situations in which they supervise, evaluate, teach or grade the work of members of their families enrolled in courses offered by the university main campus and/or its community college campuses unless the cognizant department head and dean or equivalent approves a plan to manage the conflict. The same regulation applies to individuals with whom the faculty member is in a consensua l relationship ( See Section 3.22). Supervisors of faculty need to adopt the same procedure to manage situations in which the faculty they supervise teach members of the supervisors' family. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 26 of 62 Rule 3.20.35 - Participation in Committees A conflict of interes t can exist during the execution of routine committee ser vice activities when they involve family members of close professional associates or friends. Normally, recusal from the committee's decision is the preferred way to manage these conflicts. Example s of conflicts of interest in committee ser vice work might include but are not limited to: A. Serving on employment selection committees when a family member (as defined above), friend or close professional associate from outside the department concerned is applying for the position. B. Serving on selection committees or promotion and tenure committees when a person who is or has been involved in a grievance relating to the committee member is applying for promotion or tenure. C. Serving on the promotion and tenure committee when a family member is applying for promotion or tenure. D. Serving on the graduate committee for a family member of a close professional associate. Rule 3.20.36 - Requests Made to Subordinates In order to prevent individuals from being pl aced in a position of conflict between the needs of the institution and those of supervisors, persons in a position of supervisory authority over another individual may not ask that individual to perform duties that benefit the supervisor or a family membe r in a way that does not directly relate to the official duties of the employee or supervisor. An example of such a request would be for a supervisor, including a faculty member, to ask that a subordinate nominate the supervisor or anyone else for an awar d. Another example might be suggesting that a subordinate purchase something to support a school activity of the supervisor's child. Rule 3.20.37 - Sales and Solicitations Sales and solicitations by individuals or organizations on university property tha t result in personal financial gain are expressly prohibited except as noted in the Rule 3.92 Sales and Solicitation . Rule 3.20.38 -Procurement No member of the Board of Regents or any employee, either directly or indirectly, shall sell to the university any supplies, equipment, ser vices or insurance or receive any commission or profit on account thereof, and all such persons are prohibited from being parties directly or indirect ly to any such contract. The university shall strictly comply with all state statutes and federal regulations to include, but not limited to, NMSA 1978 Section 21 -1-35 and NMSA 1978 Section 13 -1-190. Further guidance may be found under Section 4 of the NMSU Business Procedures Manual . Rule 3.21 - Conflicts of Interest and Com mitment in Sponsored Activities, Generally Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment that arise from Sponsored Activities are of special concern because they almost always involve or implicate entities outside of the university community (and thus are more prone to public scrutiny), are frequently governed not only by university policies but also by governmental conflict - of-interest regulations and are subject to special disclosure requirements administered by the vice president for research . The principles, definitions and policy or rule statements set forth above in Policy 3.19 Conflict of Interest - Ethical Conduct and 3.20 Conflicts of Interest and Conflicts of Commitment in General apply also to this Rule 3.21 Conflicts of Interest and Commitment in Sponsored Activities . Specific guidance on conflicts of interest in sponsored activities is set forth below. Rules 3.21.05 through 3.21.40 - Conflicts of Interest and Commitment in Sponsored Activities 3.21. 05 Conflicts in Sponsored Activities that Arise from Financial Interests Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment in sponsored activities generally arise when an investigator or family member has a significant financial interest in, or a consulting arrangement with, a private business concern or other organization that is or may be affected by the sponsored activity. Some examples of this kind of conflict situation include, but are not limited to: A. Engaging for sponsored researc h a business firm in which the investigator or family member involved in the research project has a significant financial interest. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 27 of 62 B. Purchasing major equipment, instruments, materials or other items for sponsored research from a private firm in which the i nvestigator involved in the research has a significant financial interest. C. Engaging a private consulting f irm in connection with sponsored research where the investigator involved in such research has a consulting arrangement with or significant financial interest in a competing consulting f irm. D. Acceptance by an investigator involved in a sponsored research project of gratuities or special favors from a firm or other organization with which the university does business in connection with the sponsored research. E. Utilization of privileged information acquired by an investigator in connection with sponsored research for personal gain, or to economically benefit a business concern in which the investigator or family member has a significant financial inter est. F. Sponsorship of research by a business firm in which an investigator involved in the research has a significant financial interest. G. In the absence of disclosure and express sponsor approval, employment of, or an offer of employment to, a family membe r of an investigator involved in sponsored research by either the sponsor of, or an organization engaged in, the research project. H. Receipt by a family member of an investigator involved in a sponsored activity of a scholarship, fellowship, work/study bene fit, or other financial aid, which is funded by or through the sponsored activity. Rule 3.21. 10 - Conflicts in Sponsored Activities that Arise from Personal Interest An actual or perceived conflict of interest or commitment may also arise from situations that may have a significant impact on an investigator involved in sponsored research, even though the situation does not involve a significant financial interest. These non -financial conflict situations frequently involve personal interests or relationshi ps that are or may be affected by sponsored activities. Some examples are: A. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored activity where the investigator or a family member of the investigator acts as a non -paid advisor to, or board member of, the sponsoring entity. B. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored activity in which a family member is engaged as a human subject, student researcher or other non -paid participant. C. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored activity that includes testing and validation of new technology developed by a family member of the investigator. Rule 3.21. 15 - Other Conflict Situations in Sponsored Activities It is important to realize that any number of other kinds of conflict situations can arise in the context of sponsored projects, some of which may be undeterminable at the outset of the project. Investigators involved in sponsored activities must be cognizant of the need to monitor project developments in order to identify potential or perceived conflict situ ations as they arise and to disclose them or facilitate their disclosure as soon as possible. Examples of other kinds of conflict situations might include: A. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored research project becomes so extensive during the cour se of the project that other obligations to the university are neglected, thus creating a conflict of commitment. B. An investigator's responsibility for multi -disciplinary sponsored research project gives rise to nepotism issues when a family member employe d in a different university department falls under the investigator's supervisory authority in the context of the project and no disclosure of and express sponsor approval for such arrangement is in place. C. An investigator's loyalty to a family member ( See Rule 3.20.23 Relationships ), close personal friend or a professional associate employed elsewhere results in sponsored research being conducted elsewhere which could and ordinarily would be conducted within the university, to the disadvantage of the university and its legitimate interests. Rule 3.21.20 - Governmental Conflict of Interest Regulations Concerning Sponsored Activities Any research or other project that is sponsored or funded by a governmental agency is likely to be subject to agency Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 28 of 62 regulations or guidelines covering conflicts of interest as well as university policies. The federal Office of Management and Budget has p romulgated rules, applicable to all federally funded grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, which define conflicts of interest and the financial thresholds applicable to them and which require grant recipients to maintain written stan dards of conduct governing real or apparent conflicts of interest. These rules are found in OMB Circular No. A -110, Sec. 42. Most federal departments and independent agencies have formally adopted these rules and codified them in various sections of the Code of Federal Regulations. A few agencies have adopted supplementary conflict of interest guidelines applicable to their own grant administration procedures. Two agencies, the National Science Foundation and the Public Health Ser vice, have established specific financial disclosure requirements and disclosure review and conflict of interest management procedures applicable to grants from those agencies. The guidelines and requirements set forth in this Rule 3.21 C onflicts of Interest and Commitment in Sponsored Activities are intended to implement and comply with these federal conflict of interest rules, so that compliance with this university Rule will generally assure compliance with governmental requirements. I nvestigators are urged, however, to familiarize themselves with the conflict of interest rules adopted by agencies sponsoring their research activities. Rule 3.21.2 5 - Disclosure Procedures for Sponsored Activities Each person engaged in an area of sponso red research and covered by this Rule is responsible for determining whether any actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest or commitment exists . The principal investigator of each specific sponsored activity, in consultation with all other participants in the activity, is responsible for determining whether any possible conflicts exist with respect to such activity and for so indicating on the Ne w Mexico State University Proposal Award Form submitted to the Office of the Vice President for Research at the time approval for such activity is sought. If any possible conflicts are identified, the person or persons having the conflicts should attempt to resolve them in advance of submitting the activity proposal for review and approval, but in any event must concurrently disclose them for review by the Conflict of Interest Committee during the pre -award process. Disclosure shall be made by submitting the individual's current annual Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form with the approval documentation provided to the Office of the Vice President for Research. If a new conflict of interest or commitment arises during the course of sponsored work, the per son having such conflict must submit an updated disclosure form. The Office of the Vice President for Research shall furnish such disclosure forms to the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities. Rule 3.21. 30 - Review and Resolution of Conflicts of Interest Relating to Sponsored Activities A. Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities : The Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities shall be a standing committee consisting of the vice president for research , the director of a college/unit research center or institute director designated by the vice president for research and three faculty members appointed by the vice president for research and approved by the Faculty Senate. One member of the committee shal l not be involved in sponsored research. B. Committee Authority and Functions : 1. The Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities shall meet as necessary to review all disclosure statements and decide in each instance whether: a. There is no potential conflict of interest; or b. There was a conflict of interest, which has since been resolved; or c. There is a conflict of interest that has not been resolved. 2. In making these determinations, the committee, at its discretion and under conditions of confidentiality, may seek the ad vice of additional persons. 3. The committee will exercise care at all times to ensure confidentiality and to protect the safety and privacy of persons involved in or affected by the review. 4. If the committee determines th at there is an unresolved conflict of interest: a. The appropriate dean, vice president or vice provost will be notified; b. The committee will work with the affected principal investigator and other key personnel, including affected departmental personnel, to determine how the conflict should be managed so the sponsored activity can proceed if at all possible; and c. Acceptance of an award for the affected sponsored activity will be delayed pending resolution of the Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 29 of 62 conflict. 5. In order to effectively manage or rem edy a conflict of interest, the committee may impose conditions or restrictions to control, reduce or eliminate the possibility that the conflict will affect the objectivity of the sponsored research or other activity. Examples of conflict of interest man agement options include: a. Public disclosure of the conflict. b. Divestiture of conflicting financial interests or placement in a blind trust. c. Escrow of a conflicting equity interest until appropriate triggering conditions are met. d. Disqualification of the conflicted individual from management, supervisory or other affected responsibilities for the sponsored activity. e. Prohibition of the conflicted individual's involvement in affected aspects of the research or other activity. f. Severance of business relationsh ips that create the conflict. g. Monitoring of research or other affected activities by independent reviewers. Rule 3.21. 35 - Appeals from Decision Concerning Conflicts of Interest Arising from Sponsored Activities A sponsored activity may not be accepted in the event that the committee is unable to fashion a remedy for a specific conflict of interest and the conflict remains unresolved. In such case, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities wi ll notify the appropriate dean, vice president or vice provost . Appeal of the decision to not accept an award or to accept it subject to conditions in furtherance of a specific management plan, may be made to the executive vice president and provost , who will consult with the principal investigator and the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities prior to making a final determination. A final determination on appeal of a conflict of interest decision will be made within 30 days of the da te the appeal was taken. A final determination on appeal shall be achieved before the university accepts a sponsored activity. Rule 3.21. 40 - Retention of Records Concerning Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities [Amendment presented to the Administrative Council 04.13.10; ratified by the Board of Regents 07.20.10 ] The Office of the Vice President for Research will maintain records of all conflict of interest disclosures and all actions taken with respect to such disclosures for either: A. A period of three years following the final close -out of the affected sponsored activity or the resolution of any governmental action relating to such sponsored activity or the underlying conflict of interest, whichever comes later; or B. As otherwise provided by law. The original disclosure forms will be retained electronically by the Office of Human Resource Services as part of the employee's official personnel file. Rule 3.22 - Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships A. Rule Statement: It is the Rule of the university that employees with direct teaching, supervisory, advisory or evaluative responsibility over other employees, students and/or student employees recognize and respect the ethical and professional boundaries that must exist in such situations. Consensual re lationships can create conflicts of interest that impair the integrity of academic and employment decisions. Such relationships also contain the potential for exploitation of the subordinate employee, student or student employee and the possible professio nal or academic disadvantage of third parties, and can subject both the university and individuals to liabili ty. Therefore, the university strongly discourages consensual relationships between supervisors and subordinates, teachers and students, and advis ors and students. Should such a relationship develop, the faculty member, supervisor or advisor has the obligation to disclose its existence to an immediate supervisor and cooperate in making alternative arrangements for the supervision, evaluation, teach ing, grading or advising of the employee, student or student employee. B. Scope: This Rule applies to all NMSU employees including faculty, staff and student employees. C. Definitions: 1. A consensual relationship is a mutually acceptable, romantic an d/or sexual relationship. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 30 of 62 2. A conflict of interest arises when an individual with the authority and responsibility to evaluate the work or performance of an employee, student or student employee acquiesces or engages in a consensual relationship with the em ployee or student. 3. An employee is defined as any individual, whether paid or not, who is listed and active on the university 's Human Resources Management System. This includes all faculty, staff and student employees to include affiliated faculty and associated employees. D. Reporting Responsibility: In the event a conflict of interest exists arising from a consensual relationship, the individual in the supervisory, teaching or advisory position shall immediately notify the supervisor about the relationship and cooperate with the supervisor in making arrangements necessary to resolve the conflict of interest. Notification of the consensual relationship shall be provided in writing and signed by both parties involved. E. Supervisor Responsi bility : A supervisor who is notified shall take immediate steps to alter the conditions that create the conflict of interest caused by the relationship. In most instances, this will be accomplished by providing an alternative means for the supervision, t eaching, advising and/or evaluation of the subordinate employee, student or student employee. A supervisor who becomes aware of a consensual relationship that has not been declared shall investigate and take action as appropriate and required by this Rule . Both parties in the relationship and the supervisor shall sign the resolution. All documentation will be maintained in a departmental file. F. Failure to Report or Cooperate : Employees in positions of authority who enter into or continue consensual relationships without reporting them, or who fail to cooperate in efforts to eliminate the conflict of interest resulting from a consensual relationship may be subject to disciplinary action, which may include counseling, letters of warning, reprimand, su spension or termination. In the event that a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct is reported by the subordinate party regarding an unreported relationship, there will be no presumption that the relationship was consensual in nature. G. Grievance of Disciplinary Actions : Disciplinary actions imposed for violations of this Rule may be grieved or appealed by the individual who is disciplined pursuant to existing university policies and procedures. H. Assistance : Questions regarding this Rule should be directed to the assistant vice president for human resource services. Rule 3.25 -Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus. (See also Policies 1.20 Gender Equity Policy and Statement of Principles , 3.22 Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships ; (Amendments r ecommended by the Administrative Council 02.11.14; approved by the Board of Regents 03.10.14 .) A. New Mexico State University (NMSU) is dedicated to providing equal opportunities in areas of employment and academics without regard to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, serious medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, spousal affiliation or protected veteran status as outlined in federal and state anti - discrimination statutes. As a federal contractor, NMSU's affirmative action program also supports this effort. The following is a listing of applica ble federal and state laws: 1. Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 2. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended 3. Civil Rights Act of 1991 4. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 5.

The Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) is designated as the office that receives and processes internal discrimination complaints within the NMSU system. The NMSU OIE website will include office address, location and contact information: http://eeo.nmsu.edu/ C. Title IX Notice: 1. NMSU does not discriminate on the basis of sex in education programs and activities; Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 is a federal law that states: \"No person in the United Sta tes shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 2. Title IX prohibits: a. Sexual misconduct (including sexual violence) b. Sex discrimination (gender bias) c. Sexual harassment d. Retaliation 3. Title IX applies to students, staff and faculty. Title IX requires reporting from \"responsible employees\" for which purposes of policy can be defined to include: a. Those with authority to address and remedy sex -based discrimination and harassment; and/or b. Those with responsibility to report sexual misconduct to a supervisor and OIE; and/or c. Those who a student would responsibly believe have such authority or obligation. 4. In cases involving harassing speech, assessing Title IX applicability to off -campus behavior will require a two -prong test: a. Does NMSU have control over the harasser (subject to our rules) and b. Does NMSU have control over the context of the har assment (on our property, in our programs, on land we lease or control, or at events we sponsor) 5. NMSU will reserve the option to take off -campus jurisdiction in cases involving sexual violence, sexual assault, or rape that involve students or employees. 6. The Chancellor will designate an administrator to serve as the NMSU Title IX Coordinator, whose duties will include overseeing all Title IX complaints and identifying and addressing systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints. 7. Inquiries concerning the application of Title IX may be referred to the NMSU Title IX Coordinator or the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education. The NMSU OIE website will include the NMSU Title IX Coordinator's name, office add ress, telephone number, and e -mail address as well as the link to the Office for Civil Rights. D. Campus Violence Elimination Act (Campus SaVE Act) Notice: NMSU does not tolerate any sexual violence to include intimate partner violence which can be defined as any physical, sexual, or psychological harm against an individual by a current or former partner or spouse of the individual. Such sexual violence covers domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. The Campus SaVE Act complements and is a compani on to Title IX and assists with the response to and prevention of sexual violence in higher education. The Act provides a framework for educational institutions to address incidents of sexual violence occurring on-campus, on public property within and adj acent to campus, and at non -campus properties like off-campus student organization housing, campus sponsored events and remote classrooms. Specifically, the Campus SaVE Act outlines provisions for the following: Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 32 of 62 a. Transparency: Students or employees repo rting victimization will be assisted by campus authorities in reporting a crime to law enforcement and with obtaining or enforcement of no contact directives or restraining orders. Employees and students should be aware of bystander intervention which inc ludes taking action to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against another person. Individuals who make reports will be provided options and assistance in changing academic, liv ing, transportation and working situations if requested and reasonably available. Further, a resource guide will be provided which includes information on counseling, health, local advocacy and legal service agencies. The range of any possible disciplinar y actions or sanctions and procedures may be found in the NMSU Student Code of Conduct and/or the NMSU Policy Manual . b. Accountability: Provide a fair investigation and resolution of complaints. Additionally, both accuser and accused may be accompanied du ring proceedings by an advisor of their choice and both parties will receive written outcomes of disciplinary hearings at the same time. c. Education: Conduct initial and ongoing awareness programming for students and employees that addresses issues of prim ary prevention, definition of consent, reporting, bystander intervention and risk reduction. d. Inquiries concerning the application of the Campus SaVE Act may contact any of the following: Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) Executive Director; the NMSU Police Department Victim's Assistance Coordinator or the Dean of Students. The NMSU OIE website will include the most current names, office address, telephone number and e -mail address as well as the link to the Office for Civil Rights. E. Discrimination Policy: 1. NMSU is committed to providing a place of work and learning free of discrimination and harassment on the basis of a person's age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, serious medical condition, sex, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, or spousal affiliation. Where a violation of policy is found to have occurred, NMSU will act to stop the conduct, to prevent its recurrence, to remedy its effects, and to discipline those responsible in a ccordance with the NMSU Policy Manual and/or NMSU Student Code of Conduct. 2. No employee or student, either in the workplace or in the academic environment, should be subjected to discrimination which includes inappropriate conduct. Even one incident may constitute a violation of policy. It is expected that students, faculty and staff will treat one another and campus visitors with respect. 3. It is against NMSU policy to discriminate in any aspect of employment or education, which includes, but is not limited to: a. hiring actions and terminations; b. compensation, assignment, or classification of employees; c. transfer, promotion, layoff, or recall of employees; d. job advertisements; e. recruitment actions; f. testing; g. grading; h. acceptance or participation in an academ ic program or activity; i. use of university facilities; j. training programs; k. benefits; l. retirement plans, and paid and unpaid leave programs; m. housing; n. academic accommodation; o. employment accommodation; Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 33 of 62 p. financial aid; q. other terms and conditions of employment 4. Determining what constitutes discrimination under this policy will be accomplished on a case by case basis and depends upon the specific facts and the context in which the conduct occurs. Some conduct may be inappropriate, unprofessional, and/or subject to disciplinary action, but would not fall under the definition of discrimination. The specific action taken, if any, relating to a particular instance depends on the nature and the seriousness of the conduct that is reported. 5. Discriminatory practices inclu de, but are not limited to: a. discrimination on the basis of a person's age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, sex, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, serious medical condition or spousal affiliation; b. retaliation against an individual for engaging in a protected activity such as filing a charge of discrimination, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices; c.

Even one incident may constitute a violation of NMSU po licy. 3. Determining what constitutes sexual harassment under this policy is dependent upon the specific facts and the context in which the conduct occurs. Some conduct may be unprofessional and/or subject to disciplinary action, but would not fall under th e definition of sexual harassment. The specific action taken, if any, depends on the nature and the seriousness of the reported conduct and may include disciplinary processes. 4. Under this policy, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other non - verbal, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual or gender bias nature, constitute a violation of policy when: a. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic status; b. Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for academic or employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to participate in an activity; or c. The conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's acade mic or work performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment in which to work or learn. 5.

Employees and students may file an internal discrimination complaint with OIE within fifteen (15) working days from the date of the incident(s). Individuals may use the NMSU Internal Discrimination Complaint Form to submit their complaint. The use of this form facilit ates the gathering of information that is necessary to assess the complaint. The OIE Executive Director (or designee) may extend the filing date of a complaint beyond the fifteen (15) working days if there are extenuating circumstances. 2. OIE will provide the option to the complainant of pursuing their complaint through an informal (which may include mediation) or formal process (submittal of the complaint). The formal internal discrimination complaint will be subject to an initial review to determine if t he complaint will proceed to the investigation. If the initial review finds that the complaint will not be accepted for investigation, the OIE Executive Director (or designee) will inform the complainant in writing of the decision. The complainant may ap peal the decision in writing to the Executive Vice President and Provost (or designee) within five (5) working days of receipt of the notification letter. 3.

Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 36 of 62 K. General Information 1. Supervisors: If anyone in a supervisory, managerial, administrative or executive role or position, such as a supervisor, department chair, or director of a unit, receives a complaint of alleged discrimination or sexual harassment, or observes or becomes aware of conduct that may constitute discrimination or sexual harassment, that person must immediately contact OIE. 2. Employees: An employee who believes that he or she has been subjected to di scrimination or sexual harassment by anyone is encouraged, but it is not required, particularly if it may be confrontational, to promptly tell the person that the conduct is unwelcome and ask the person to stop the conduct. An employee is not required to d o this before filing a complaint. A person who receives such a request must immediately comply with it and must not retaliate against the employee. If the employee feels uncomfortable about discussing the incident with the immediate supervisor, the employ ee should feel free to bypass the supervisor and file a complaint with OIE. 3. Students: A student who believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination or sexual harassment by anyone is encouraged, but it is not required particularly if it may b e confrontational, to promptly tell the person that the conduct is unwelcome and ask the person to stop the conduct. A student is not required to do this before filing a complaint. A person who receives such a request must immediately comply with it and m ust not retaliate against the student. If the student feels uncomfortable about discussing the incident with the faculty member, department head, dean or director of an administrative unit, the student should feel free to bypass the person and file a comp laint with OIE. When discriminatory conduct involves a crime of violence or a non -forcible sex offense, FERPA permits NMSU to disclose to the alleged victim the name of the alleged perpetrator, any violation found to have been committed and any sanction i mposed). In the event a student is found to have engaged in sexual harassment of another student, NMSU will disclose to the student who was harassed, information about the sanction imposed on the student when the sanction directly relates to the harassed student. 4. Internal NMSU Units: Internal units such as the Dean of Students Office, Housing and Campus Life, Athletics and community colleges will promptly contact and consult with OIE when knowledge is obtained relating to potential discrimination or sexual harass ment. 5. Non-employees and non -students : Individuals who are neither NMSU employees nor NMSU students and who believe they have been subjected to discrimination or sexual harassment by an NMSU employee during the employee's work hours or by a NMSU student o n campus or at a NMSU -sponsored event may utilize the complaint process set forth above. L. Prompt Attention: Complaints of discrimination or sexual harassment are taken seriously and will be dealt with promptly, impartially, and equitably. Where discrimin ation is found to have occurred, NMSU will act to stop the reported conduct, to prevent its recurrence, to remedy its effects, if any, and to discipline those responsible. M. Confidentiality: NMSU recognizes that confidentiality is important. However, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. The administrators, faculty or staff responsible for implementing this policy will respect the privacy of individuals reporting or accused of discrimination or sexual harassment to the extent reasonably possible and wi ll maintain confidentiality to the extent possible. Examples of situations where confidentiality cannot be maintained include, but are not limited to, necessary disclosures during an investigation, circumstances where the NMSU is required by law to disclos e information (such as in response to legal process), or when an individual is in harm's way. To the extent provided by law and university policy, documents concerning a discrimination Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 37 of 62 investigation and investigative results are not subject to public disc losure. Investigative materials and documents contain matters of opinion related to the working relationship between NMSU and its employees. Documents protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Privacy Act of 1974, the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act, etc. are not subject to disclosure. N. Supervisor Responsibilities: 1. Every supervisor (includes faculty in academic setting) has responsibility to take reasonable steps to prevent acts of discrimination or sexual harassment , which include, but are not limited to: a. Monitoring the work and school environment for signs that discrimination or harassment may be occurring; b. Refraining from participation in, or encouragement of actions that could be perceived as discrimination or harassment (verbal or otherwise); c. Stopping any observed acts that may be considered discrimination or harassment, and taking appropriate steps to intervene, whether or not the involved individuals are within their line of supervision; and d. Taking immediate action to minimize or eliminate the work and/or school contact among individuals where there has been a complaint of sexual harassment, pending the completion of the investigation. If a supervisor (or faculty in academic setting) receives a complaint of a lleged discrimination or sexual harassment, or observes or becomes aware of conduct that may constitute discrimination or sexual harassment, the supervisor (or faculty in academic setting) must immediately contact OIE. Failure to take the above action to prevent the occurrence of or stop known discrimination or harassment may be grounds for disciplinary action in accordance with provisions of the NMSU Policy Manual . O. Relationship to Freedom of Expression: NMSU is committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression. Vigorous discussion and debate are fundamental rights and this policy is not intended to stifle teaching methods or freedom of expression. Discrimination or sexual harassment, however, is neither legally protected expression no r the proper exercise of academic freedom; it compromises the integrity of this institution, the tradition of intellectual freedom and the trust placed in the institution by its members. Rule 3.30 - Disability Accommodation (See also Policies 3.25 Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus ) The university is dedicated to providing reasonable accommodation to qua lified university employees and applicants for positions in accordance with state and federal laws. Qualified individuals with disabilities are protected from discrimination in hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, job training, fringe benefits, and other aspects of employment. Accessibility to buildings, programs, and ser vices will also be safegua rded to the extent that an undue financial hardship is not imposed on the university . The university also provides reasonable accommodation for temporary impairments, such as those that may result from pregnancy. The accommodation process begins when an employee (or applicant) communicates the need for an accommodation. The completion of the Petition for Accommodation Form, available at the Office of Institutional Equity/EEO, facilitates the initiation of the accommodation process. REVISION HISTORY: Provisionally amended b y the Chancellor 06.24.15; ratified by Board of Regents 07.21.15. Rule 3.31 - Distribution of Effort There are competing demands on the energies of a faculty member (for instance, research, teaching, committee work, outside consult ing). The way in which a faculty member divides effort among these various functions does not raise ethical questions unless the university or government, industrial, or business agency supporting the research is misled in its understanding of the amount of intellectual effort actually devoted to the research in question. A system of precise time accounting is incompatible with the inherent c haracter of the work of a faculty Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 38 of 62 member, since the various functions performed are closely interrelated and do not conform to any meaningful division of a standard work week. On the other hand, if the research agreement contemplates that a staff member will devote a certain fraction of effort to the government, industrial, or business sponsored research, a demonstrable relationship between the indicated effort of responsibility and the actual extent of involvement is to be expected. Research administerin g agencies in the university have established simple procedures of accounting which indicate the proportion of the investigator's time spent on sponsored research. Each administering agency will inform the investigator of the procedures developed to assur e that proposals are responsibly made and complied with. 3.40 Drug -Free Workplace [Amendment approved by the Ad ministrative Council 07 .08.08; adoption of the amendment ratified by the Board of Regents 07.15.08 ] The university is a recipient of federal grants and contracts in excess of $100,000 and is subject to the provisions of the Drug -Free Workplace Act of 1988, the special Drug -Free Workforce rules promulgated by the Department of Defense, and the Drug Free Schools and Comm unities Act.

Free exchange of ideas is a refl ection of the university's public land -grant heritage, interest in diverse points of view, and commitment to excellence in education and research. NMSU encourages free expression and peaceful assembly, provided they do not disrupt the university missions or functions. The type of forum, described below, will determine the level of restriction, if any, which may be imposed on free expression activities within the forum. Restrictions must be content neutral, typically geared to time, place and manner. The type of forum for a given location may vary, based on the circumstances relating to the nature of an event or function scheduled to occur at the location. 1. Public Forums are areas that traditionally have been open to the public, such as parks, sidewal ks, and lobbies as well as other areas that become public forums by university designation. Free expression and civil discourse are encouraged in public forums, and any regulation of expression within a public forum must be narrowly tailored to serve a c ompelling state interest. 2. Limited Public Forums are areas open to the public or a segment thereof (including through the purchase of admission), but where there is a specific purpose. The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purp ose for which it was created may justify some limitations that are narrowly tailored to allow the event or activity to continue and/or achieve its intended purpose. Any limitations must be consistent with the spirit of this policy. Legitimate limitations include subject matter and classification of participants (students, student government representatives, faculty, etc.). Limitations must be reasonably related to a definite and substantial university interest. Any limitations must be content neutral, an d aimed solely at reducing or preventing disruption to the activity that would cause a definite and measurable interruption to the intended purpose, or protecting other clearly compelling university interests (e.g., public safety). If a limited public foru m serves more than one purpose, the university may prioritize the purposes for which it may be used, e.g. a campus auditorium may give priority to theater productions. Expression within a limited public forum is permitted consistent with the Procedural Gu idelines administered by the Office of Campus Activities. 3. Non-Public Forums are areas not open to the general public and where expression by those permitted to be there may be reasonably limited, in a content neutral manner, to that which is compatible with the purpose and nature of the location. (Examples include faculty and administrative offices, classrooms, residence hall rooms, and archive and special collections of libraries.) 4. Disruption of university functions or activities: Regardless of the t ype of forum, free expression activities and events shall not materially or unreasonably interfere with the education, research, public service, and outreach missions of the university, office operations, or sleep of residents. 5. Modes of Free Expression : The university recognizes that there are many different modes of free expression, including distribution and posting of literature; group speech activities such as rallies, parades and demonstrations; electronic sound amplification, chalk, symbolic speech (e.g. nudity, fire, and/or weapons); and electronic communication. The limitations described in the Procedural Guidelines pertaining to the various types of expression are intended to safeguard personal safety and the university's missions, and not to ham per freedom of expression. See Section F . 6. Respect for Rights of Others: a. Prohibition of Third Party Interference with Right to Free Expression: Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, university employees, students, and other members of the public shall not interfere with the rights of freedom of expression by others perm itted by this policy. Alleged violations of rights afforded by the U.S. and N.M. Constitutions, recognized by this policy, will be taken seriously and investigated promptly and objectively. b. Retaliation Prohibited: Retaliation against individuals who ha ve exercised the rights granted by the First Amendment, recognized through this policy, is strictly prohibited. Any such claim should be reported immediately to an appropriate university official to register a complaint. Generally, the Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 44 of 62 Office of the Dean of Students and the Office of Human Resource Services -Employee and Labor Relations administer student and employee grievances, respectively. Such claims will be taken seriously, investigated independently, and if substantiated, will be grounds for correc tive or disciplinary action, appropriate to the circumstances. 7. Respect for University Property and Functions : In exercising the right of free expression and peaceful assembly, individuals must also accept the responsibility of following the laws related to the safety of people and property. Outdoor and indoor activities must follow all applicable fire codes an d other local, state, and federal laws. See Section F., regarding Procedural Guidelines , which may clarify limitations intended to safeguard missions and personal safety, and not to hamper free expression. 8. Interface with other laws and regulations: There is inherent tension that exists between competing public policies affecting individual rights. A detailed examination of statutes and regulations which protect individuals from sexual harassment, discrimination, hostile environment and other discriminat ory conduct is beyond the scope of this Freedom of Expression policy . This policy is not intended to insulate persons from accountability for their actions if their conduct discriminates, harasses or otherwise creates a hostile environment based on any cl ass protected by federal and state anti -discrimination laws. ( See Also Policy 3.25, Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus ). Nothing in this policy is intended to provide a defense in any action against a third party by an alleged vict im of defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy, assault, or any other civil or administrative claim. 9. Dispute Resolution: The successful implementation of this policy will depend upon the university community's education and engagement, including but not limited to understanding which types of planned activities require advance permission, and what to do if an event or expressive activity is questioned. The Procedural Guidelines (See Section F.) provide some hypothetical scenarios within the Frequ ently Asked Questions (FAQ's) to provide guidance about how this policy should be applied. Because time will often be of the essence when issues arise involving this policy, the informal methods listed below are available to supervisors, students, employe es and members of the public in order that individuals may seek a policy clarification or interpretation in advance, in order to resolve issues in a mutually professional and amicable manner, rather than through more adversarial grievance or litigation met hods. These methods include and are not limited to: a. A single point person will be designated by each NMSU campus president to serve as the liaison between members of the university community and/or the public and the Policy Administrators listed under S ection C, in order to resolve issues expeditiously. b. Individuals may request clarification of the policy or the Procedural Guidelines by contacting the designated point person. The designated point person will promptly respond to acknowledge the inquiry, and as appropriate or needed, may consult with any of the Policy Administrators prior to providing an interpretation to the individual. c. If the individual(s) wishes to appeal the interpretation provided by the designated point person, such notification mu st be given to the point person either in writing or via email. The point person will then call a meeting of the Policy Administrators (or any subset, depending upon availability) and the individual(s) as soon as practicable, which meeting may be conducte d telephonically or electronically. The decision of the Policy Administrators will be rendered within one working day of the meeting and communicated to the individual via email or other contact information supplied by the individual. d. Students and emplo yees also have recourse to file grievances against those who they feel may have restricted their rights under this policy, and sh all follow the applicable student or employee grievance policy if the above steps have not resolved the dispute . 10. Sanctions : a. Individual Consequences for Conduct Not Protected by Constitution or This Policy: Nothing in this policy protects expressive activities which: i. constitute criminal, defamatory, or discriminatory misconduct; ii. contain true threats of violence or imminent harm; or iii. seek to incite, or intentionally incite, a fight. Individuals engaging in such conduct may face criminal prosecution, civil lawsuit, and/or disciplinary action. ( For example, see Policies 3.10; 3.25; 5.47, 8.30 ). This policy does not provide a defense to individual liability for such prohibited conduct. b. Disclaimer of Liability: NMSU shall not be liable for any injuries to participants or third parties caused by individuals or groups engaging in fre edom of expression activities. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 45 of 62 c. Damage or Injury: If property damage or personal injury occurs, individuals or groups determined to be responsible may be subject to appropriate administrative, civil, or criminal action, for the purpose of covering the univ ersity's costs associated with the damages. Additionally, while generally NMSU wishes to facilitate free discussion, nothing in this policy is intended to eliminate any rights of persons to pursue any legal remedies they may have under local, state, or fe deral law. d. Unattended or abandoned materials: Materials used for free expression activities (literature, signage, etc.) shall not be left unattended. Any items that are left unattended for more than thirty (30) minutes may be removed by the university at the owner's expense. Signage promoting or providing directions to an event are allowed on the preceding day for a morning event or on the day of an afternoon or evening event, will not be considered to have been left unattended, and shall be removed by t he event organizers at the conclusion of the event. Permission for posting or leaving of materials outside of the above restrictions may be granted on a case -by-case basis by the Office of Campus Activities. F. Procedural Guidelines : To facilitate the impl ementation, administration and enforcement of this policy, the policy administrators identified above may develop and issue supplemental Procedural Guidelines consistent with this policy, which may include protocols, FAQ's, forms, flowcharts, etc.. The P rocedural Guidelines utilized in the application or enforcement of this p olicy shall be either outlined below in this Section, and/or posted at an appropriate NMSU website, and linked from this section.

G. Electronic Communication (e.g, Email, Social Media) : Similar to public spaces, electronic communication may fall within a public, limited public, or non -public forum . The prote ctions set forth in Policy 3.63 extend to electronic communication, with similar limitations. Where a site owned, operated, or otherwise controlled by NMSU is limited to certain members or subject matters, speakers must be authorized participants whose co mmunications are germane to the stated subject matter.

( See Policy 3.63, Freedom of Expression ) 3. Food Service Rule for Sales/Solicitations/Acquisition : The university food ser vice contractors are granted the right to operate/conduct food ser vices on the university campus. Clarification of this right is necessary, however, in view of the many activities conducted on the campus which involve food products, and which may or may not conflict with contractual obligations of the university to the contractors. The follow ing food ser vice Rule outlines the conditions under which student, staff or faculty activities may involve food and beverage ser vices: a. Student groups and university departments must seek and receive approval for any food events not catered by the univer sity food ser vice providers by completing an Activity Request Form from the Department of Campus Activities. b. No off -campus firm or agency may be contracted to provide or to cater food ser vice to university students, staff, administrative groups, conference s, or visitors in Corbett Center Student Union or other locations on university property where the primary university food ser vices contractor is providing food ser vices. c. Non-university vendors providing ser vices in approved locations on campus other tha n athletic facilities must be pre -certified by the director of housing and dining ser vices and rebate to the Office of Housing and Dining Ser vices a commission of seven percent of all sales applicable to the campus event. d. Student groups and university units or offices may secure prepared food products from off -campus sources to serve on the campus when all of the following conditions are met: i. The products are served exclusively to the members and guests of the sponsoring organization at private gatherings, such as club meetings. ii. The products are served or sold in a manner or under conditions that are not construed to be in competition with the university food contractors. (The sale is construed to be in competition when the seller is soliciting the same consumer prospects as those sought or being ser viced by the university food contractors and offering products similar to those provided by the contractors.) iii. If food is prepared in the homes of participants and is served pot luck, it shall be only for the participants and their personal guests and constitute a private gathering where the general public is not invited. e. Individuals on campus may secure food from those off -campus vendors who provide delivery ser vice (e.g., pizza or other campus delive ry products) when done on an individual order basis. Any other delivery policies for individual buildings or facilities shall apply ( e.g., a residence hall's Rule ). f. Given health, safety, and liability concerns, raw food may not be secured for preparation and distribution on campus unless approval is obtained in writing from the director of campus activities and from the Public Health Division (per following paragraph): Organizations granted approval for a public event where the preparation, sale, or distribution of food products is conducted must apply for and receive a State of New Mexico Food Purveyors License. The license must be obtained from the Public Health Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 55 of 62 Division of the State Health Department, Office of Health Facilities Licensing, 1170 North Solano Drive, Las Cruces, New Mexico, in accordance with the New Mexico Food Ser vice Sanitation Act, Chapter 309, Laws of 1977. A copy of the license must accompany the Activity Request Form or other request for conducting the event. Failure to secure th e license constitutes automatic disapproval of the request. D. General Fund -Raising Rule for Student Organizations, University Departments, and Other Affiliated Groups : Raising funds from private sources is an important means of supplementing the various programs in teaching, research, extra -curricular, and ser vice activities. The university recognizes and encourages the efforts of campus groups in this regard, but also recognizes the necessity to establish guidelines which aid in coordinating these activ ities to avoid conflicts, duplication, violation of laws or regulations, or activities which reflect negatively on the university. This Rule applies to fund -raising/solicitation of individuals and business firms by student organizations, departments, and agencies of the university as well as other groups which are affiliates of the university. It does not pertain to proposals for research support addressed to government agencies supporting research that are covered by existing university policies and proc edures. 1. Proposals for fund -raising activities from university departments, agencies, academic classes and other affiliated groups must be submitted in writing to the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement no less than 2 weeks prior to the activity. Proposals shall include the purpose, budget plan, amount sought, prospective donor or donors, and a time schedule for the activity. 2. Fund -raising activity proposals from recognized student organizations will be initiated with the director of campus activities by completing an Activity Request Form. 3. Approved fund -raising activities are to be coordinated through the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement or the Department of Campus Activities in a manner appropriate to each activity/project and in accordance with Rule guidelines stated herein. 4. Organizations incorporated outside the university which raise funds for a university department, agency, or unit are requested to confer with the vice president for university Advancement before commencing to fund-raise. 5. Approved activities must comply with all university, city, state, and federal laws, ordinances, and regulations, including taxation; and it shall be the responsibility of the activity sponsor to become aware o f applicable requirements. 6. Internal operating policies related to fund -raising events in specific facilities shall have jurisdiction when an event is held in these facilities ( e.g., residence halls, Corbett Center, Pan American Center). 7. No member of the sponsoring organization or participant in the activity shall receive personal financial gain from it. Reimbursement of planned, bona fide expenses of the activity (labor or materials), however, shall not be considered as personal gain. In no case sha ll an employee receive payment for personal ser vices (labor) unless prior written approval is obtained from the executive vice president and provost . 8. All funds raised through an activity and deposited in NMSU Foundation, Inc. accounts shall be administe red in accordance with policies and procedures of the NMSU F oundation. 9. Fund -raising at university events is not permitted unless specific approval is sought and granted through the director of campus activities in consultation with the vice president for university advancement. 10. On- campus fund -raising involving the sale of merchandise or ser vices must receive the prior approval of the director of campus activities in order to avoid contractual, operational, or jurisdictional conflicts. 11. Expectations: It is expected that all fund -raising events held on or off campus will be conducted in a manner which reflects positively on the sponsor and the university. While it is recognized that the type of activities will vary greatly, event sponsors are urged to avoid telephone solicitation, door -to-door sales or solicitations, and direct collections at civic or ser vice organization meetings off campus. These methods are often over -used and may be counterproductive. Caution is also advised in the repetitious sol icitation of businesses or prominent citizens for the same reason. ( See Rule 2.70 United Way for exception.) Rule 3.98 - Smoking [Amendments approved by the Administrative Council 05 .09.06; adoption of amendments Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapte r 3, Page 56 of 62 ratified by the Board of Regents 09.08.06 ] A.

Smoking Permitted Areas : Smoking is permitted outdoors on university property except during organized events which have been designated as \"No Smoking\". Individuals choosing to smoke outdoors must be 25 feet from doorways, open windows, enclosed walkways, and ventilation systems to prevent smoke from entering enclosed buil dings and facilit ies, and to prevent public access from being denied to an individual with a respiratory medical condition. In accordance with Housing and Residential Life policies, smoking is permitted in those units which constitute private residences; when everyone in the shared residence is a smoker or at the discretion of each family housing unit. Fraternities and soror ities will work toward an agreement, consistent with university policy during the 2006 -07 school years. D. Education and Ser vices for Smokers : In light of numerous adverse health effects associated with active smok ing, and with exposure to second hand s moke, the university will provide educational ser vices to faculty, staff, and students about the hazards of smoking and information and ser vices on quitting smoking.

The university provides eligible faculty members with a fair and expeditious process by which faculty membe rs may seek redress for grievable issues and may seek resolution of disagreements/disputes arising in the workplace. The following protocols describe the manner in which faculty grievances will be received by a body elected by the Faculty at large known as the Faculty Grievance Review Board (FGRB); accepted or declined; mediated; and/or heard more formally by a faculty peer hearing panel made up of members of the FGRB which issues factual findings and recommendations, and the university's chief academic officer issuing a final decision. The university encourages the early resolution of disputes in the work place through informal discussion. For matters not resolved in the Pre -Grievance Resolution stage, this Rule provides structured mediation and grievan ce hearing procedures for resolution by peer and administrative review. Retaliation against any person attempting dispute resolution in accordance with this Rule or against those who may be called upon to participate in the resolution process is prohibite d; such allegations will be independently investigated and if substantiated, will be grounds for employee discipline.

If one or more of the witnesses has a close relationship with one of the hearing panel members, disqualification of the hearing panel member from service shall not be automatic, but shall be decided by a m ajority of the quorum of panel members based upon the specific facts of each case. c. If the grievant, respondent, or a witness has had prior contact with either the assigned mediator or a hearing panel member, disqualification of the mediator or panel member from service shall not be automatic, but shall be decided by a majority of the quorum of panel members based upon the specific facts of each case. 2. Early Disclosure of Conflict and Voluntary Recusal: Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 4, Page 11 of 30 a. Any FGRB member selected to serve as either the mediator or as a member of the hearing panel in a grievance matter shall disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest immediately, or as soon as it is realized, in order that it may be resolved prior to the informal or formal grievance processes. b. A party sha ll also raise the issue of an actual or potential conflict of interest relating to a mediator or FGRB hearing panel member as soon as the conflict is known. c. After consideration of the relevant facts and positions of the parties, if it is determined that a conflict exists sufficient to call into question the impartiality of the FGRB member, the resolution will be either voluntary recusal by the individual alleged to have the conflict or by substitution of a different individual by the FGRB Chair. 3. Process to Resolve Alleged Conflict of Interest: a. In the event a conflict of interest issue is raised and not resolved amicably by substitution of another individual, the FGRB Chair shall give notice of the potential conflict to the parties and proceed to resolve th e issue as expeditiously as possible. b. If a challenged mediator or hearing panel member agrees that the conflict is sufficient to render the member unable to participate in a fair and impartial manner, the individual shall be excused from further participat ion. c. If the challenged mediator or hearing panel member disagrees that there is a conflict sufficient to affect impartiality, the matter will be decided by the Faculty Senate Chair. i. Each party may provide their position on the issue and comment on the posi tion of the other party. Other evidence may be considered if relevant or needed to decide the issue; however, the parties are entitled to know and comment on any other evidence considered by the Faculty Senate Chair in making the decision. ii. If a mediator i s excused based on a finding of conflict of interest, the FGRB Chair shall select a replacement. iii. If a hearing panel member is excused based on a finding of conflict of interest, the FGRB Chair shall select a replacement from the FGRB. F. Time Deadlines After a Grievance has been Accepted : Each step of the grievance process is intended to be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Requests for extensions of time may be made by any party or official involved in the process.

The final decision maker shall ensure that the Office of Human Resource Services, Employee and Labor Relations (HRS -ELR) receives the complete Grievance Record for storage and maintenance in accordance with the university's records retentio n policies, once the final decision has been issued to the parties. 1. The grievance record shall not be filed in the official personnel file. The grievance record will be stored in a grievance file with the Office of Human Resource Services, Employee and Labor Relations.

That replication was t he first step in a project to restructure and update NMSU system policies and procedures into a Regents Policy Manual and a distinct set of Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU, which will contain operational guidelines for management. We apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by this duplication. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 4 of 77 CHAPTER 5 - HUMAN RESOURCES -FACULTY POLICIES 5.05 - Academic Freedom The quest for truth often leads the scholar into difficult and untried territory. As a dealer in ideas, the teacher or researcher comes often in conflict with prevailing belief of large segments of society and even with those of colleagues. Yet, because of the practical benefits of scholarly activity, it is profoundly important that this diversity of ideas be not only tolerated, but encouraged. The right to support unorthodox positions, arrived at through scholarly investigation, free from coercion or re prisals, is fundamental to the continued progress of society. The right to pursue unpopular lines of inquiry and express new and unaccepted ideas falls within the framework of a special set of guarantees called academic freedom. In granting these guarant ees, society expresses a willingness to risk the consequences because history confirms that the risk is outweighed by the benefits stemming from such a policy. Scholars are entitled to full freedom in the conduct of their research and publication of the r esults, and full freedom in the classroom to discuss those topics in which they are professionally experts as determined by their credentials. The exercise of this freedom carries with it the burden of corollary responsibilities. Scholars must not knowin gly misrepresent facts. They must be careful in their teaching not to introduce controversial matter bearing no relationship to their subjects. They must exercise appropriate restraint and guard against distortions and inaccuracies. Outside their academ ic roles, as private citizens, scholars have no special privileges. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As persons of learning and educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. Hence they should at all times be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for th e opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution. Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good and not to further the interest of either the individual scholar or the insti tution as a whole. The Board of Regents recognizes that it is not possible to define, with any great precision, the limits of academic freedom in the complex world of ideas. The gray areas are practically endless and the final judgment of what is acceptab le and reasonable must be left by society to the academic community itself. The scholar's own colleagues and institution must bear the brunt of public criticism, have the most to lose from withdrawal of public trust, and are, therefore, in the best positi on to balance the issues of academic freedom and responsibility. Rule 5.06 - Administrative Reviews Each dean or community college executive officer is responsible for preparing, scheduling, delivering and retaining appropriate administrative reviews of associate deans, department heads, directors and their equivalent. In addition to annual performance evaluations, administrative reviews are scheduled to occur every few years to determine an incumbent 's performance as an administrator. Administrative re views are often coordinated by a third party (such as NMSU 's Institutional Research) and may include written evaluation by both internal and external constituents. Rule 5.06.10 - Administrative Review of Deans and Community College Presidents [Amendment recommended by the Administrative Council 07.27.11; approved by the Board of Regents 08.22.11] A. Policy : 1. Academic deans and community college presidents are due to be reviewed within six months of the third anniversary of their first appointment to their appointment as academic administrator and every fifth anniversary thereafter, under the criteria prepared by their supervisor. 2. Reviews may be conducted at a shorter interval, at the discretion of the supervisor. 3. In exceptional circumstances, faculty or staff may petition the supervisor of the academic dean or community college president to conduct an administrative review outside of the normal review cycle. B. Procedures : 1. Prior to each review, the supervisor wil l request a written and/or oral evaluation of the person(s) being reviewed from the faculty, staff and any other relevant constituencies. 2.

Rule 5.06.20 - Administrative Review of Associate Deans and Community College Academic Officers A. Policy : 1. Associate deans and community college academic officers will be reviewed within six months of the third anniversary of their first appointment to the position, and at least every five years thereafter, under the criteria prepared by their appropriate supervisor. 2. Reviews may be conducted at a shorter interval, at the discretion of the a ppropriate supervisor. In exceptional circumstances, faculty or staff may petition the appropriate supervisor to conduct an administrative review outside of the normal review cycle. 3. Prior to each review the appropriate supervisor will request a written e valuation of the associate dean or community college executive officer from each faculty and staff member in the unit and obtain any other pertinent input from relevant constituencies (either on campus or off campus).

The appropriate supervisor will do the following: a. evaluate the information b. create a summary c. conduct an evaluation session with the individual being evaluated d. share the summary with the relevant faculty and staff e. transmit a summary to the dean and executive vice president and provost Rules 5 .15.10, 5.15.20, 5.15.30, 5.15.40, 5.15.50, and 5.15.60 - Appointments (See also Rule 4.30, Hiring ; Search Committee Guidelines ) Rule 5.15.10 - Appointments - Defin itions of Faculty Appointments (See Rule 4.30.10 -Hiring - Definitions ) Rule 5.15.20 - Appointments - Graduate Faculty The ultimate responsibility for the quality of the graduate program resides in the graduate faculty, individual departments offering graduate work, and the cognizant dean. The dean of the Graduate School is responsible for the administration of the Gradua te School's policies. Staff members qualified to perform the functions of the graduate faculty are nominated by the heads of their departments for approval by the cognizant dean and the dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate Council shall maintain a s tanding committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments comprised of three senior graduate faculty currently serving on the Graduate Council. The standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments shall review and make recommendations to the dean of the Gradu ate School on appointment of faculty nominees to the graduate faculty. This standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments also shall review appointment criteria as needed. Approval will be granted in recognition of the staff Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 7 of 77 member's active interes t in graduate work as demonstrated by continual study, creative activity, and successful teaching. Appointment to the graduate faculty will normally require that the individual have an earned doctoral degree. The qualifications of each new member of the graduate faculty will be given comprehensive review by the department head, cognizant dean, and the dean of the Graduate School at the end of 3 years. The qualifications of each graduate faculty member will be reviewed every 3 -5 years by the department he ad, cognizant dean, the Graduate Council standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments, and the dean of the Graduate School. Selection of instructors to teach courses at the 450 -499 level is left to the department head and college dean; however, suc h persons must have at least a master's degree. Any exceptions to this policy must have prior written approval of the dean of the Graduate School. Graduate students may not assign grades to other graduate students in courses numbered above 450. Selectio n of individuals to teach courses numbered 500 and above is left to the department head and the college dean. The individual must have an earned doctorate, or a master's degree with extensive experience, and have evidence of creative activity. Any except ions to this policy must have the prior written approval of the dean of the Graduate School. Members of the graduate faculty chair all graduate committees, direct master's theses, direct doctoral dissertations, teach 600 -level courses, serve as representa tives of the dean of the Graduate School, serve on educational specialists' exams, and serve on doctoral exams. Any exception to the above policy must be approved in writing by the dean of the Graduate School. Before an individual is appointed to the gra duate faculty, evidence of creative activity, in addition to the doctoral dissertation, is required. In implementing this approach, the department heads, the deans and the dean of the Graduate School will review all members of the graduate faculty in thei r colleges and invoke the review clause on individuals not meeting the minimum requirements. Rule 5.15.30 - Appointments - Joint A. Written Agreement : At the time of joint appointments, a written agreement is signed by the faculty member and administrative heads of the participating departments. The agreement entails the nature and extent of reciprocal commitments between the faculty member and each aca demic department. The agreement serves as a guide in the evaluation process and defines the role of all parties in that process. B. Role of the dean of the Graduate School : The dean of the Graduate School coordinates and ensures equity in the evaluation of joint appointees. C. Procedures : 1. All joint faculty are assigned to one college for administrative purposes. This college is responsible for initiating all forms, but signatures of both deans and both department heads are required on all forms. 2. A copy o f the joint appointment agreement will accompany formal appointment papers forwarded to the executive vice president and provost for action. 3. A mutually agreed -upon statement of goals for the faculty member is prepared at the beginning of each annual evaluation period. These goals serve as the evaluation criteria for the period. The goals statement is arrived at by consultation between the faculty member and the department heads involved. 4. The faculty member submits duplicate statements of achievemen ts (e.g., faculty evaluation forms) to the department heads at the end of the evaluation period. 5. The department heads, in consultation, prepare a single evaluation and recommendation to be forwarded to the appropriate dean or deans. 6. Recommendation at the college level is made in consultation with department heads and deans involved in the joint appointments. 7. The time periods for all steps in the evaluation process are the same as those set by the executive vice president and provost for all faculty. Rule 5.15.40 - Appointments - Nontenure -Track [Amendment ratified by of Regents 10.07.07] 14 -08/09 p assed by the Faculty Senate 04.30.09; adopted by the Administrative Council 07.14.09; ratified by the Board of Regents 07.29.09] [Amendment, waiving the limitations on retention of part time faculty through Spring 2011, a pproved b y the Administrative Council 02.09.10; adoption of amendment ratified by Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 8 of 77 the Board of Regents 07.20.10][Amendment, further extending the waiver of the lim itations through Dec. 2012, recommended by the Administrative Council 04.12.11; adoption of amendment approved by the Board of Regents 05.06.11][Proposition 07 -12/13 passed by the Faculty Senate 12.06.12; approved by the Board of Regents 01.28.13] [Amendmen t recommended by the Administrative Council 06.11.13; approved by the Board of Regents 06.20.13] Non-tenure -track faculty will be employed to teach, do research, or perform other work assignments. They may be employed full -time or part -time, with regular or non-regular status. All appointments and renewals are subject to need , availability of funding and terms of appointment . The initial employment base period of a non-tenure -track faculty member may be renewed depending on funding availability, needs of t he employing unit, and the results of performance evaluations. Persons in non-tenure -track faculty positions may only be hired into tenure -track positions following a national search. In the event that they are hired into tenure -track positions, their service in non-tenure -track positions shall not normally count toward tenure. (See Policy 5.90 Promotion and Tenure ). A. College Faculty : The titles of college instructor, college assistant professor, college associate professor, and college professor are used for non-tenure -track faculty hired primarily to teach courses for the university, altho ugh they may at times serve in an administrative or supervisory capacity or be assigned to research. They must have master's degrees or equivalent experience in the field but do not always have terminal degrees. Regular College Faculty appointments are renewable annually for an unlimited time. Although employing units are not obligated to renew or to give a reason for nonrenewal of a college faculty contract, hiring departments are encouraged to promote an environment of stability by renewing contracts o f college faculty when warranted by the need of the department and the performance of the faculty member. College faculty members shall be evaluated annually. Regular college faculty are eligible for salary increases and promotion to the next rank accordin g to policies, procedures, and criteria set by the university and their colleges and departments. (See Employment Base and Status below ). College faculty are listed in the university catalogs under their assigned departments and are eligible for privileges accorded other faculty, such as ID cards, library privileges and faculty parking. They are eligible to apply for membership in the gradua te faculty and, if accepted, supervise theses and dissertations while a member of the graduate faculty. College faculty are eligible to serve as principal investigators on grants and proposals. As provided for in the Faculty Senate Constitution, college fa culty can serve on the Faculty Senate. B. Research Faculty: The titles of research assistant professor, research associate professor, and research professor are used for persons who are hired to engage in research activities and have qualifications simi lar to those held by tenure -track faculty of comparable ranks. A clear statement of justification as to why it is in the university's best interest to grant research faculty status will be noted on the hiring forms by the department head and forwarded th rough the academic dean to the executive vice president and provost for each research faculty appointment. Salaries are normally contingent on external funding, though a department or college may fund the salary of a research faculty member from internal f unds for a short time while external funds are being sought. Research faculty members are evaluated annually and are eligible for salary increases and promotion to the next rank according to policies, procedures, and criteria set by the university and thei r colleges and departments. Research appointments are renewable annually for an unlimited time provided funding is available and annual evaluations demonstrate acceptable job performance. Research faculty are listed in the university catalogs under thei r assigned departments and are eligible for privileges accorded other faculty, such as ID cards, library privileges and faculty parking. They are eligible to apply for membership in the graduate faculty and, if accepted, supervise theses and dissertations or serve as the dean's representative while a member of the graduate faculty. Research faculty may serve as principal investigators on grant proposals. At the discretion of their department head or equivalent administrator, they may retain their research f aculty status without pay while funding is being sought. C. Affiliated Faculty : When it is in the best interests of the university, individuals who are financially independent of the university may be associated with and provide support or services to o ne or more university programs without receiving monetary compensation (e.g., no salary, per -course or hourly pay provided). A clear Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 9 of 77 statement of justification as to why it is in the university's best interest to grant affiliated faculty status will be noted on the hiring forms by the department head and forwarded through the academic dean to the executive vice president and provost for each affiliated faculty appointment. The term (not to exceed 12 months), rank, and other conditions and expectations of th ese honorary appointments will be determined for each individual appointee. The criteria upon which the determinations are based vary depending upon the background of the appointee, the nature of the discipline represented, and the needs of the university. In general, persons appointed should have qualifications commensurate with the corresponding rank of tenure -track faculty appointees. An appointment end date no later than 12 months from date of hire must be identified at the time of appointment or renewa l. Affiliated faculty appointments may be renewed annually. Affiliated faculty may be listed in the university catalogs under appropriate departments and affiliated faculty receive the faculty I.D. card and library privileges in recognition of their contri bution to the university. E. Extension Associate: An individual hired into a Cooperative Extension Service position in regular or non- regular status, full -time or part -time, funded principally (50 percent or more) by grants or other nonpermanent funds m ay be designated an extension associate. An individual hired with less than the master's degree may also be designated as extension associate. That individual may also be given the courtesy title of college instructor, college assistant professor, college associate professor, or college professor. An extension associate cannot obtain tenure. When an extension associate either receives a master's degree and/or recurring state funds become available, an extension associate may be considered for appointment to tenure -track status following normal appointment rules. Extension associates may be notified of nonrenewal with proper notice: those in the first year of service will have 3 months' notice prior to their anniversary date; those in the second or more years of service will have 6 months' notice prior to their anniversary date. F. Prior Service: Non -tenure -track faculty have duties and/or qualifications and/or expectations different from tenure -track faculty. Consequently, service in the non -tenure -track p osition will not normally count towards tenure in any subsequent tenure -track appointment. G. Employment Base and Status: The fixed -period base for employment of a non -tenure -track faculty member is a time period that may be a semester, an academic year, or a fiscal year, and the amount of assigned effort may be figured on the basis of hours per week, credits per semester, or credits per academic year. The full -time hourly basis is 40 hours per week. The full -time credit basis is 12 credits per semes ter or 24 credits per academic year, except in the community colleges, where the full -time credit basis is 15 credits per semester or 30 credits per academic year. The full -time equivalent (FTE) fraction for a non -tenure -track faculty member employed on an hourly basis is the ratio of the number of hours assigned per week to the basis of 40 hours/week. The FTE fraction for a non -tenure -track faculty member employed on a credit hour basis is the ratio of the number of credits allocated during the applicable base period to the full -time credit basis applicable for that base period. An FTE fraction of .75 or greater is considered full -time, while an FTE fraction less than .75 is considered part - time. A non-tenure -track faculty member employed as temporary an d averaging an FTE of .67 per college or more over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible to be considered for a regular non-tenure -track appointment after appropriate advertising. If not converted to regular appointment, the employee's FTE must aver age less than .67 per college during each of the ensuing 2 consecutive academic years. A temporary faculty member averaging less than .67 FTE per college over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible for renewals of temporary appointments after appropr iate reviews and approvals. Temporary appointments require an appointment end date on the hiring form no later than 1 calendar year after the hiring date. All temporary appointments are limited to 1 year at a time. If there is no break in service, both reg ular and temporary non- tenure -track appointments may be renewed without advertising, after appropriate reviews and approvals. H. Special Application for Non -tenure -Track Temporary Community College Faculty: A non-tenure -track faculty member employed as temporary and averaging an FTE of . 67 per college or more, over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible to be considered for a regular non-tenure -track appointment after appropriate advertising. (For benefits, See Salaries/Benefits ) If not converted t o regular appointment, the employee's FTE must average less than .6 7 per college during each of the ensuing 2 consecutive academic years. A temporary faculty member averaging less than .67 per college over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible for r enewals of temporary appointments after appropriate reviews and approvals. I. Qualifications: Qualifications for appointment of non-tenure -track faculty are to be determined in such a manner as to be flexible enough to meet the particular needs of each unit utilizing such faculty, but minimum Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 10 of 77 qualifications shall be a master's degree or equivalent experience in the field or related field for the junior ranks of instructor and assistant professor, and an earned doctorate or equivalent experience in the fi eld or related field for the senior ranks of associate professor and professor. J. Appointment and Nonrenewal: Each regular or non-regular non-tenure track faculty member will be given a copy of the employing conditions, generally as an offer notification . At the time of first hire at the university, each regular or non-regular non-tenure -track faculty member should read this section of policy , as well as the non-tenure -track promotion procedures of the appropriate college. Nonrenewal of a non-tenure -track appointment may be without implication of criticism or specification of cause. An appointment end date on the initial offer notification constitutes written notice of the end date of the appointment. In such a case, the individual concerned sh ould be informed as soon as possible whether the individual will be offered subsequent employment following the appointment period , either as a renewal of a regular appointment or in non-regular status. Successive year renewals of regular appointments tha t specified an appointment end date may be made without advertising the position. If such a regular appointment is not renewed for at least the succeeding semester, then it must be re -advertised. The minimum written notice of nonrenewal of a regular app ointment that does not include an appointment end date on the offer notification will be as follows: During the first year of service in regular status (9 - or 12 -month basis), 3 months' notice will be given before the end of the academic year (9 -month empl oyees) or the fiscal year (12 -month employees). After the first year of service, 6 months' notice before the end of the academic year (9-month employees) or the fiscal year (12 -month employees) will be given. Non-tenure -track faculty members employed witho ut an ending date whose employment is contingent upon the availability of non -I&G funds shall be given at least 30 calendar days' notice of nonrenewal. Providing proper notice of nonrenewal is given, the university does not have any legal obligation to pro vide funding for any non-tenure -track faculty member beyond the current appointment period . However, employing units are strongly encouraged to attempt to maintain a stable job environment for this type of appointment. A non-tenure -track faculty member may be dismissed for cause at any time that the member's conduct becomes inimical to the students, the faculty, the educational program, or the university. The executive vice president and provost must approve any involuntary termination for cause. A non-tenure-track faculty member will have the right to appeal human resources decisions, which directly affect the member, according to university appeals procedures. ( See Policies 3.25 Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Mis conduct on Campus ; 4.05.50 Faculty Grievance Review and Resolution ; and 5.47 Faculty Discipline and Appeal Process ) Any non-tenure -track faculty member who proposes to resign shall give written notice to the immediate supervisor at the earliest time possible. K. Salaries/Benefits: Employing units will offer salaries to prospective college faculty on the basis of qualifications, availability of funding, and supply vs. demand, subject to the administrative approval procedures in effect for prospective tenure -track f aculty. Salary scales for non-regular part-time, non-tenure -track faculty will be set each year for the Las Cruces campus and for the community colleges by the executive vice president and provost. Exceptions to the rates must be approved by the executive vice president and provost. These rates will be made available to all faculty. Non-tenure -track faculty who are in regular status are eligible for benefits as defined in Chapter 7. L. Evaluation, Promotion, Salary Adjustments: Each regular and non-regul ar non-tenure -track faculty member will be evaluated annually during the term of employment if the employment is renewed for more than one academic semester. The evaluation will be based on those duties described under the terms of employment as agreed upo n by the individual and supervisor under the general headings of teaching or research or professional service or administrative duties, or some combination thereof. A copy of the written evaluation will be given to the faculty member. Promotion in rank and salary adjustments will be made on the basis of the above - mentioned written evaluations and the availability of funds. Meritorious performance may be rewarded by encouraging non-tenure -track faculty to apply for a tenure -track faculty position. College faculty in regular status shall participate in the merit system. Each college will develop separate policies, procedures, and criteria for the promotion of non-tenure -track faculty. These are s ubject to final approval by the executive vice president and provost. These promotions will be handled in the same time period and with documentation similar to that for tenure -track faculty promotions. M. Voting Privileges: The tenured and tenure -track faculty in employing units of the university will decide which types and ranks of non-tenure -track faculty may vote on (1) routine departmental matters, and (2) policy matters. Should a question arise whether an issue is routine or policy, the tenured and tenure -track faculty will decide. Non-tenure -track faculty will not vote on any faculty personnel matters. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 11 of 77 N. Guidelines: As a guideline, the total FTE of non-tenure -track faculty with the job titles of college instructor, college assistant professor, and college associate professor shall not exceed 25 percent of the total FTE for tenured, tenure -track, and non-tenure -track faculty on the main campus (community colleges excluded). Distinction will be made, if possible, between teaching and non -teaching non-tenure -track faculty in any given monitoring period. ( See section below) O. Monitoring: During each fall and spring semester the executive vice president and provost shall provide the following data to the chair of the Faculty Senate: The number of i ndividuals employed by the university holding academic rank by headcount and FTE, by contract type (tenured, tenure -track, non-tenure -track ), by job title and rank for each academic rank unit on the main campus, for each of the community colleges, and for all other organization units. Where these numbers include individuals whose primary employing unit is different from the academic rank unit, these data will be footnoted appropriately. The chair of the Faculty Senate will present these data to the Committe e on Committees for analysis and monitoring with respect to the above guidelines. P. Exempt Employees Hired as Part -Time Faculty: Exempt employees who wish to teach a university class for remuneration may do so if the class meets outside regularly sched uled working hours (normally 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday) and approval has been obtained from the employees supervisor and the Dean, Vice President or Campus President. Exempt employees teach ing a course for remuneration during his/her regular working hours is normally inappropriate, and rather, a percentage of the person's regular salary should be paid by the beneficiary unit for the duration of the teaching service. ( See guidelines under Policy 5.30 Consulting and 5.25 Supplemental Employment and Compensation. ) Rule 5.15.50 - Appointments - Postdoctoral [Amendment ( FS Proposition 02 -10/11 ) passed by the Faculty Senate 10.07.10; recommended by the Administrative Council 10.12.10; approved by the Board of Regents 10.29.10] [Amendment recommended by the Administrative Council 06.11.13; approved by the Board of Regents 06.20.13] A. Postdoctoral Appointment Defined : A postdoctoral appointment is a classification for those individuals who are exemplary scholars, who have recently been awarded a doctoral degree, and who wish to continue their education and research experience under the direction of a university facult y member. B. Recruitment Considerations: The recruitment process for a post doctoral appointment shall include consideration of any individual who expresses an interest in such an appointment. Advertising on a local, national or international basis is o ptional. C. Terms of Appointment: Appointments contemplate 1 .0 FTE employment for at least one (1) year, renewable annually, and not to exceed a total of five (5) years, absent an exceptional circumstance. Exceptions to reduce FTE percentage, to not less than .50 FTE, or to deviate from the minimum term of one (1) year or the maximum term of five (5) years, will require the written approval from the appropriate dean or equivalent administrator and the vice president of research. The annual term of employm ent shall be specific in the appointment letter or in other Office of Human Resource Services documentation. The postdoctoral appointee shall receive the benefits and privileges associated with regular employment, including leave accrual. D. Annual Rene wal Required (Lack of Renewal Confirms End of Term Appointment): Sixty (60) days advance notice of annual renewal shall be given. A failure to give timely notice shall not prevent a renewal, but lack of notice of annual renewal constitutes confirmation of the end date specified on the annual appointment letter or other Office of Human Resource Services documentation. E. Termination of Employment Prior to End of Appointment Term: An annual post doctoral appointment may be terminated prior to the end of th e termination date specified in the appointment letter or other Office of Human Resource Services documentation for two reasons: 1. For just cause, in accordance with the university's procedures governing involuntary termination of regular faculty; or 2. Loss or reduction in funding affecting the position. F. Grievance Rights: If it becomes necessary for an individual holding a post doctoral position to file a grievance, Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 12 of 77 the faculty grievance procedure at 4.05.50 Faculty Grievance Review and Resolution will apply. If the post doctoral appointee's complaint involves unlawful discrimination, then Policy 3.25 Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus or other applicable university anti -discrimination policies and procedures will govern. Rule 5.15.60 - Appointments - Qualifications A. General Qualifications for Appointment (Main Campus) : Common elements to be considered in appointment, differing onl y in degree in all ranks, are as follows: 1. Teaching : This element is difficult to define precisely, but is commonly considered to include the teacher's knowledge of the field; awareness of development in the field; skill in arousing interest and evoking responses in students; skill in stimulating students to think critically, to understand the interrelationship of fields of knowledge and the application of knowledge to human problems; skills in integrating domestic and international knowledge and insights into class content; and skill in raising students' awareness about the domestic and international social, political, economic, and ethical implications of their courses of study. 2. Research: This element is composed, in part, of the person's re search or other creative work that indicates professional merit and interest. The results of this activity will find expression normally through accepted channels or media in the respective professional fields or in the person's teaching. Teaching and re search are ordinarily closely related; it is difficult to comprehend how a person can teach well without having firsthand understanding of how the knowledge of the field is discovered. The research performance of faculty will be based on domestic and/or i nternational scholarly activity. Annual performance evaluation of any faculty member will recognize that success in research may require long -term efforts. Promotion and tenure and annual performance raises will give equivalent consideration to research effort and success, whether domestic or international. 3. Service: This element includes the person's general contributions to the organization and development of the university, and ser vices to any local, state, national, or international agency or institution needing the specific benefits to be derived from the person's professional knowledge and skills. B. Specific Qualifications for Appointment (Main Campus) : In the following statements of required time in each rank, IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PERIODS STATED ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS MINIMUM AND NOT AS MAXIM UM, UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. It is recognized that the time served in a rank at another institution should be taken into consideration. It is also recognized that the evidence of compe tence differs for various fields, to some extent, and standards of judgment cannot be rigidly uniform. 1. JUNIOR RANKS ( See also Policy 5.15.40, A ppointments - Nontenure -Track) a. Instructor: This rank should be given to persons with advanced training who have demonstrated scholarly/creative ability. Usually, the individual will not yet have demonstrated ability to do both teaching and research independently. An instructor must have knowledge of the particular c ourse materials and should have some intellectual vision; but need not be expected to have acquired a significant understanding and original point of view or philosophy of the general subject. In addition to such general considerations, as stated above, t he specific degree requirements for this rank will normally be the master's degree or the equivalent, and except under unusual circumstances the instructor will be encouraged to be studying toward a terminal degree. b. Assistant Professor: To be considered f or this rank, a person must have demonstrated ability in the field. It is strongly believed that a relationship exists between teaching and research, and that a good teacher or researcher must constantly remold the materials of the courses or projects in the light of new knowledge derived from the person's own creative scholarship as well as that of others. An assistant professor may be expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment of the general field of the discipline, in add ition to a comprehension of the whole. In addition to such general considerations as stated above, specific degree requirements for advancement or promotion to the rank of assistant professor and, of course, applicable to the senior ranks as well, NORMALL Y will be the doctor's degree. Outstanding experience and recognition in the profession outside the academic field may be considered as the equivalent of the degree requirement. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 13 of 77 2. SENIOR RANKS . Appointment or promotion to either senior rank should represe nt an implicit prediction on the part of the department, college, and the university that the individual so appointed will make sound contributions to teaching and learning during the remainder of the individual's life. Senior rank status should occur onl y after careful investigation of the candidate's promise in scholarship, teaching, research, leadership, and learning. By this statement it is meant that serious attention must be given to the caliber of the candidate's professional stature, for this will probably be the key factor in determining the extent to which past performance in teaching and creative work may be expected to carry on through continuing and enlarged contributions. Ser vices rendered to communities and agencies or organizations in the pe rson's professional capacity shall be considered in assessing qualifications for advancement to senior ranks. a. Associate Professor: This person's views contribute to departmental policy. An associate professor should have competence and mature outlook ov er a fairly large part of the whole field. To be considered for this rank a person should expect to serve for at least 4 years as an assistant professor under normal circumstances. A candidate for an associate professorship is expected to have demonstrat ed capacities in the lower ranks and should offer evidence that teaching and research have kept abreast of times in method and subject matter; that a greater degree of maturity has been attained and that there has been a retention of interest in competent teaching and research. Furthermore, the candidate must have shown evidence of productivity and competent scholarship beyond that completed for the degree of the doctorate. b. Professor: Appointment of individuals to professorships is obviously the most crit ical step in determining the future of the academic caliber of the university. There should, therefore, be clear understanding of the functions and qualifications of individuals in this rank. A professor through teaching, creative activity, and ser vice should have demonstrated substantial command of the whole field, sound scholarship, and a mature view of the discipline. Appointment or promotion to professor should not be considered to be forthcoming merely because of years of ser vice to the university (it should not be expected based on any number of years as an associate professor) or because a continuous contract is achieved. Rather, a person being considered for a professorship is expected to have maintained all of the qualities and conditions requi red for tenure and the associate professor rank. In addition, a professor should exhibit special stature in the discipline, leadership and substantial strength in all areas -teaching, creative activity, and professional ser vice. In the recommending proced ures the department head and the faculty member shall submit information as follows: i. Special Stature in the Discipline : Teaching Performance: Data indicating performance, including innovation, enthusiasm, and contributions to activities designed for the improvement of instruction. Peer and student evaluation may be useful ingredients in determining teaching performance. Creative Activity: Lists of publications, exhibits, recitals, etc. Peer evaluation both on and off campus. The direction of graduate students where appropriate to the individual's discipline. Professional Ser vice: Information showing involvement in state, regional, national, and international groups within the field and contributions to the university. Objective data showing prestige and recognition among the practitioners of the discipline. ii. Leadership: Information showing initiative, perseverance, and originality and skills in human relations. Initial appointments for faculty employed with the rank of professor may also include co ntinuous contract. C. General Qualifications for Appointment (Community College System) : The following qualifications are listed in the order of their relative importance: teaching is more important than professional ser vice; professional service is more important than other ser vice; other ser vice is more important than research. 1. Teaching: This element is commonly considered to include the teacher's knowledge of the field; awareness of and the application of developments in the field; skill in arousing i nterest and evoking responses in students; skill in stimulating students to think critically, to understand the interrelationship of fields of knowledge and the application of knowledge to human problems; and skill in awakening students to a realization of the social, political, economic, and ethical implications of their study. 2. Professional Ser vice: This element includes, above all, the faculty member's ser vice with respect to the organization, development, and welfare of the community college and the university. This element also Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 14 of 77 includes ser vice to any individual or group needing the specific benefits of the faculty member's professional knowledge and skills. 3. Other Ser vice: This element allows a faculty member to be recognized for ser vice to the general welfare of the community which is interrelated with the welfare of the community college. 4. Research: Research or other creative work is not required at the community colleges. However, those faculty members who produce research and/or cre ative work should be encouraged, and such work should be considered for appointment, promotion, and tenure considerations. The academic credentials of all community college instructors will be reviewed by the community college program coordinators (when appropriate), division heads, and the chief instructional officer to meet the guidelines established by the main campus departments. Instructors must also be approved by the campus executive officer and the executive vice president and provost . D. Specifi c Qualifications for Appointment (Community College System) : In the following statements of required time in each rank, it should be emphasized that the periods stated are to be considered as minimum and not as maximum, under normal circumstances. It is recognized that the time served in a rank at another institution should be taken into consideration. It is also recognized that the evidence for various fields, to some extent, and standards of judgment cannot be rigidly uniform. 1. JUNIOR RANKS a. Instructo r: This rank should be given to persons with the necessary education and/or experience to teach within the community college concept. b. Assistant Professor: To be considered for this rank, a person must have demonstrated the ability to teach effectively in the person's field. It is strongly believed that a good teacher must constantly remold the course or project materials in light of new knowledge derived from the teacher's own creative scholarship, as well as that of others. To be considered for this ra nk, a person should expect to serve at least 3 years as an instructor under normal circumstances. An assistant professor may be expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment of the general field of the discipline, in addition t o a comprehension of the whole. 2. SENIOR RANKS . Appointment or promotion to either senior rank should represent an implicit prediction on the part of the community college that the individual so appointed will make sound contributions to teaching and learning during the remainder of the individual's life. It should be made only after careful investigation of the candidate's promise in teaching, professional ser vice, other ser vice, and, if applicable, research and/or creative ser vice. By this statemen t, it is meant that serious attention must be given to the caliber of the candidate's professional stature, for this will probably be the key factor in determining the extent to which past performance in teaching and ser vice may be expected to carry on thr ough continuing and enlarged contributions. a. Associate Professor: An associate professor occupies a position adjunct to that of the professor. This person's views contribute to community college policy. An associate professor should have competence and mature outlook over a fairly large part of the professor's whole field. A candidate for an associate professorship is expected to have demonstrated capacities in the lower ranks and should offer evidence that the candidate's teaching has kept abreast of times in method and subject matter, that a greater degree of maturity has been attained, and that there has been a retention of interest in competent teaching and ser vice. To be considered for this rank, a person should expect to serve for at least 4 year s as an assistant professor under normal circumstances. b. Professor: Appointment or promotion of individuals to professorships is obviously the most critical step in determining the future of the community college system and the university. There should, therefore, be a clear understanding of the functions and qualifications of individuals in this rank. A professor through teaching and ser vice should have demonstrated substantial command of the professor's whole field, sound scholarship, and a mature view o f the discipline. Promotion to professor should not be considered to be forthcoming merely because of years of ser vice to the community college and the university (it should not be expected based on any number of years as an associate professor) or becaus e a continuous contract is achieved. Rather, a person being considered for a professorship is expected to have maintained all the qualities and conditions required for tenure Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 15 of 77 and for the rank of associate professor. Additionally, a professor should exhib it special stature in the professor's discipline, in leadership, and in both teaching and ser vice. Rule s 5.20, 5.20.10 and 5.20.20 - Assignments Rule 5.20 - Assignments - General It is the policy of the university to provide conditions under which high quality instruction, research and ser vice may be expected to occur. The faculty and administration recognize that quality education is based on and will occur as the result of interaction and contact between professionally competent faculty and adequ ately prepared students. Statements in this manual which are concerned with assignment of faculty load and with the award of academic credit are expressed generally in terms of the amount of contact occurring between faculty and students . In practice, many academic efforts, having little or nothing to do with the amount of contact per se , are nevertheless quantified and rewarded in terms of the credit hours. Such cases are covered by prior approvals among students, faculty and administrators. This polic y is based on the following: A. Teaching : Refers to activities related to courses given in a current term, such as meeting scheduled classes, grading, preparing lectures, evaluating students, reading student papers, academic advising, supervising teaching assistants, and supervising laboratorie s. Ordinarily, scheduled class meetings will equal at least 750 minutes per semester per credit hour. Refers to the statewide non -credit teaching activities of members of the Cooperative Extension Ser vice, and other university faculty members, such as conducting seminars, meetings, workshops and consultations with ranchers, farmers, businessmen, homemakers, community leaders and other citizens of the State, and the preparation of educational materials -bulletins, newsletters, news articles, radio and tel evision programs, and self-teaching programs. B. Research and Other Creative Endeavors : Refers to activities in the faculty member's area of responsibility related to a specific project, such as performing a professional skill, writing or developing research proposals, statistical consulting, writing articles and/or books and/or reviews, c reating a new art form(s), performing departmental and/or sponsored research, giving recitals, maintaining an artistic skill. C. Professional and Public Ser vice: Refers to activities related to maintaining expertise in a professional field and activitie s performed to benefit the community outside the institution, respectively. Specific activities in this category include attending professional meetings and/or seminars, editing a journal, serving as an officer in a professional society, consulting, perfo rming professionally as in plays or orchestras, participating in lectures or seminars for the public, and involving oneself in community activities such as civic clubs, agricultural or urban extension ser vices. D. Internal University Activities : 1. General contact with students, such as: counseling; preparing recommendations; participating in social interaction; recruiting students; sponsoring student organizations; meeting with parents; attending student recitals; coaching intramural or intercollegiate ath letics; directing the band, orchestra, student plays, debate team, or other student groups. 2. Committee participation, such as: attending departmental meetings; Faculty Senate; promotion and tenure committees; planning committees; or admission committees. 3. Administrative duties, such as: performing the duties of a department head, dean, vice president , or any other administrator; keeping records; preparing minutes; writing and answering memoranda; assigning faculty course loads; preparing budgets; gathering data; helping during registration; interviewing candidates for faculty positions; advising on library purchases; escorting visitors. Rule 5.20.10 - Assignments - International (See also 2.69.1 International Travel Rule ) A. Internalization Generally : Internationalization is the incorporation of international content, materials, activities, and understanding into teaching, research, and public ser vice functions of universities to enhance their Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 16 of 77 relevance in an interdependent wo rld. The major elements of the strategy being used to internationalize our university are: 1. Defining international goals/objectives. 2. Determining specific actions/activities relating to goals/objectives. 3. Identifying individuals/units which have lead responsibilities for implementing activities. 4. Formulating a strategy for the implementation of activities. B. Internationalization Policy : The current emphasis is seeking a balance between the concepts of cooperation and competition. This new emphasis pla ces a major responsibility on the U.S. universities for providing relevant educational experiences for their students so that they are equipped to compete, become gainfully employed, and participate effectively as citizens in the new and emerging world env ironment. The principal purpose of university's internationalization strategy is to systematically and incrementally change the institution to better serve current and future needs of the institution's clientele. C. Assignment of Faculty to International Programs : The nature and requirements of the international assignment will be carefully reviewed and understood by university administrators and the faculty member before beginning the assignment. Accomplishments during assignment to international project s will be given consideration in evaluating annual performance, merit increases, promotion, and advancement to continuous contract. In future evaluations, consideration may be given to how knowledge and insight gained during an international assignment ar e integrated into the faculty member's teaching, research, and outreach responsibilities after returning from this assignment. ( See also Policy 5.65 F aculty Exchange ; and Rule 2.69 International Travel ) Rule 5.20.20 - Assignments - Teaching Load (See also 5.45.30 Department Heads - Teaching Loads ) [Amend ment effective 07.01.09(FS Proposition 05 -08/09 ) passed by the Faculty Senate 10.30.0 8; approved by the Administrative Council 11.11.08 ; adoption of amendment ratified by the Board of Regents 07.29.09 ] [Amend ment effective 07.01.09 (FS Proposition 19 -08/09 ) passed by the Faculty Senate 04.30.09 ; approved by the Admin istrative Council 07.1 4.09; adoption of amendment ratified by the Board of Regents 07.29.09 ] A. Purpose : Faculty members perform a wide variety of tasks determined by the requirements of their discipline and by the mission of the university. Accordingly their workload will vary from individual to individual and over time for a particular individual. The purpose of the Faculty Workload Policy is to establish a fair and equitable allocation of workload among faculty taking into account the interests of the faculty and the needs of the university. Recognizing the complex role played by faculty in the university setting, the primary responsibility for establishing workloads shall rest with the departments or equivalent administrative unit . B. Scope of Application : The rules set out here apply to faculty time financed from instruction and general (I & G) funds. Faculty time not financed by I & G funds is not covered by these rules. Faculty time partially funded from I & G shall be prorated . C. Teaching Load, Generally, for NMSU LC Faculty : A faculty member employed on the Las Cruces (Main) Campus budgeted exclusively from I&G funds will normally be responsible for the equivalent of teaching 12 credits per semester. The faculty member may be expected to participate in some scholarly and crea tive activity, professional and/or public ser vice, or internal ser vice to the university. Significant work of this kind reduces the faculty member's responsibility for formal instruction. D. Teaching Load, Generally, for Community College Faculty : The teac hing load for community college faculty members will usually be the equivalent of 15 credits a semester or from 27 to 30 credits an academic year The teaching load shall be prorated for short courses or courses taught over part of a semesters. E. Equitable Distribution of Workload : 1. Executive Administration: The executive vice president and provost and Chancellor shall seek to allocate faculty resources among departments or equivalent administrative units, taking account of internal and external constraints, so as to distribute workload in a fair and equitable manner. Factors that may be Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 17 of 77 considered in allocating r esources include accreditation, workloads at peer institutions, national disciplinary norms, and retention of faculty, the needs of new programs, credit hour production, legislative mandates, and other factors. 2. Dean or Equivalent: Within each college or equivalent unit, the college dean or equivalent administrator shall seek to allocate faculty resources within their college or equivalent unit in order to achieve a fair and equitable workload. When inequitable workloads arise, it shall be the responsibili ty of the dean or equivalent administrator to rectify the inequality. F. Departmental Workload Policy : 1. Departments and equivalent units will specify how they determine teaching loads. Departmental or equivalent unit workload policy will be 1) developed by the department faculty in collaboration with the department head and approved by the dean or equivalent administrator, 2) contained in written departmental guidelines, and 3) distributed to all faculty in the department. Department guidelines shall clearly specify the method by which teaching load is distributed. The dean or equivalent may ask for revisions to the departmental workload policy. 2. In determining teaching load, the departmental or equivalent unit workload policy shall consider the impact of: courses with a lab component; career path of the instructor; tenure and promotion; workloads at peer institutions; national disciplinary norms; faculty retention; relative proportion of graduate and undergraduate instruction; supervision of master's these s or doctoral dissertations; student advising and retention activity; mentoring activity, individual faculty member's scholarly and creative productivity; service productivity; new preparations; method of course delivery; class size; help from graduate ass istants; administrative and/or ser vice assignments; team teaching; and methods of grading. Given the importance of graduate programs to the mission of the university, special consideration must be given to support of graduate programs. Other factors specif ic to particular departments or disciplines may also be considered. G. Annual Determination of Individual Faculty Teaching Load /Right to Appeal : The teaching load for each faculty member will be determined annually by the department head or equivalent administrator through a process that follows established departmental or equivalent unit policy and involves an element of negotiation. The agreed up on teaching load for each faculty member will be articulated in writing and signed by the faculty member and the department head or equivalent administrator, and shall be included in the faculty member's personnel folder. If agreement on these responsibili ties cannot be reached, the faculty member may appeal the case in accordance with university procedures. ( See Rule 4.05.50, Faculty Grievance Review and Resolution ) In an appeal situation, if a change in acade mic responsibilities will affect the faculty member for more than one semester, the appeals procedure must have been completed before the reassignment can be made or continued. H. Considerations for Variance : The percentage breakdown of time allocated to each academic activity may vary among faculty members. 1. The allocation will be based on the average time required for the satisfactory performance of the activity. 2. Courses such as thesis, dissertation, resea rch, special problems and independent study are not automatically considered to be the equivalent with teaching typical graduate or undergraduate courses. When such activities are included in the teaching load, the department head or equivalent administra tor and the affected faculty member shall collaboratively determine course equivalency consistent with the department teaching load policy. 3. In collaboration with faculty in their department or equivalent unit, and subject to approval by the college dean or equivalent administrator, department head or equivalent administrator may make adjustments to faculty teaching loads if those adjustments increase load equity and are at least revenue neutral. Adjustments to teaching loads within programs should result in or maintain load equity, should respect the career paths of faculty, and should not place an extra teaching burden on junior faculty who are preparing for tenure review. When a faculty member is assigned special duties above the normal load, arrangemen ts will be negotiated between the faculty member and concerned administrators to determine the amount of additional compensation, if any, to be received. 4. When considering individuals for tenure, promotion in rank, merit pay increases, research/ser vice awards, Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 18 of 77 and/or endowed chairs/professorships, departmental workload policy and an applicant's teaching load history must be presented to reviewing bodies and individuals. An applicant's teaching load and its potential impact on scholarly and creative act ivities, and ser vice must be considered in the review process. I. Cooperation : The successful application of these guidelines depends upon maintaining goodwill between faculty and administrators. Rule s 5.25, 5.25.10, 5.25.20, 5.25.30, 5.25.40 and 5.25.50 - Compensation (See also Policy 5.94. 20-Intellectual Property and Patents ; Policy 5.92-Reassignment of Administrators/Department Heads ) Rule 5.25 - Compensation, Generally A. Policy : 1. Salary increases are determined after the legislature has appropriated funds for the operation of the university. 2. It shall be the policy of the university that all promotions shall include a fixed percentage salary increase, irrespective of other salary increases, currently six percent of the mean salaries of ranks currently held. (For example, an assistant professor being promoted to associate professor would receive an increase equal to six percent of the current mean salary of all assistant professors). 3. After promotion dollars are determined, the remaining funds shall be distributed proportionally to each college and community college (unless the community college allocation is separate from the main campus alloc ation) based on their current salary pool. 4. Allocation of funds for salary increases will consider performance (based on the annual performance review) and base salary adjustments. B. Procedures : 1. The department head makes a salary recommendation to the co llege dean. 2. When final salary determination has been made and approved by the department head, deans and executive vice president and provost , the appropriate administrator will inform the faculty member in writing about the member's next year's salary, including a breakdown of base adjustment, performance and/or promotion increments. 3. Faculty hired after January 15 will not receive a salary adjustment. Anyone hired prior to that date and after October 1 would be eligible for a base adjustment during t he years a base adjustment is given. 4. Faculty salary and salary increase information shall be made available to the tenured and tenure -track faculty in the form of tables reflecting increases by rank for the university and each college. 5. Salary letters are issued by the Office of the President . 6. The percentage increase in salaries to each college and department is public information which is available upon request. 7. Each year the executive vice president and provost shall report to the faculty on how raise dollars were distributed. The report will include the executive vice president and provost 's recommendation for each college's base and merit salary adjustment proportions. Furthermore, the report will include th e actual base and merit proportions made by each college dean. Rule 5.25.10 - Compensation - Continuing Education Courses It is the policy of the university that providing life -long learning through continuing education is an important part of its mission. In order to encourage faculty to participate in these activities, the faculty may earn extra compensation for teaching in continuing education programs in lieu of consulting. The extra compensation will Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 19 of 77 normally be paid at a rate of 0.00278 X 9 -month salary per hour of instruction. This rate is based on the assumption that 12 credits per semester, for two semesters, for 15 weeks is the normal load for an academic year. [0.00278 '1/(12 x 2 x 15)] - maximum rate. For purposes of E -Hire Forms , these hours must be kept separate from for -credit hours. Rule 5.25.20 - Compensation - Department Heads (See Policy 5.25.40 Compensation - Summer ; Policy 5.92 Reassignment of Administrators/Department Heads ) Rule 5.25.30 - Compensation - Distance Education/College of Extended Learning A. Distance Education Definition : Distance Education at N ew Mexico State University is defined as the formal education process of delivering instruction so that students physically remote from the campus of program origin and/or instructor may participate. Course or program delivery may include face -to-face interaction and/or synchronous or asynchronous written, electronic or other media forms. NMSU's four -year campus distance education courses must be approved through the college and the Office of Distance Education/College of Extended Learning. NMSU's two -year campuse s will develop their own approval process. B. Faculty/Staff Compensation: With faculty input, each college and two -year campus will provide written guidelines regarding its practices for compensation faculty who provide distance education courses. An infor mational copy is to be forwarded to the vice provost for distance education and dean of the college of extended learning by August 1st of each year and made available to faculty in the college or two -year campus. These college and two -year campus guidelin es may reflect varied factors that include, but are not limited to, market demand for distance education courses, current compensation of individual faculty and the distance education modalities used in the courses. Faculty may be compensated for teaching distance education in one of two ways, Differential Compensation and/or Supplemental Compensation. 1. Differential Compensation : a. Differential compensation involves compensation for preparation of new distance education courses/programs and is determined by each college. b. This compensation may also be made available to faculty to maintain existing courses or programs. c. Faculty member s may also receive differential compensation for teaching a distance education course. Differential compensation for teaching distance education courses may be provided as reassigned teaching time, release from other responsibilities, additional salary, graduate assistance support, full or part-time support personnel, stipends for contractors/vendors, etc. d. The form of compensation is at the discretion of the college administrator after consultation with the faculty member. e. Differential compensation may also be provided for faculty members who travel to an off -campus site to teach distance education courses in addition to approved university travel compensation. f. University travel compensation as an addition to differential compensation is to be based on the distance traveled to teach the course and the number of trips made in any given semester for the expressed purpose of teaching the course or advising students in a course or program. 2. Supplemental Compensation : Faculty members who teach a distance edu cation course as an overload may receive supplemental compensation as presented in 4.70 Supplemental Employment/Compensation or negotiated with the appropriate college dean. a. Any contract course is expected to b e self -supporting including fringe benefits. Faculty compensation for contract courses must follow appropriate university policy and rules . b. Instructors who travel to remote sites shall be compensated for their travel at the mileage and per diem rates dete rmined through university travel policy and rules . C.

Rule 5.25.40 - Compensation - Employee Recognition Program (See Rule 8.15.10 - Employee Recognition Program ) Rule 5.30 - Consulting (See also Rule 8.25, Consulting -Exempt Staff ; Rule 4.70, Supplemental Employment/Compensation ; Rule 3.20, Conflicts of Interest and Conflicts of Commitment ) A. Definitions : The following definitions, policies, and procedures will be applied to all full -time faculty members: 1. University : New Mexico State University. 2. Consulting : Services for compensation, not disbursed by the university, in an employee's area of specialization. 3. Consulting time : That time afforded a faculty member during the faculty member's normal working hours. 4. Full-Time and Part -Time: A faculty member employed for an FTE fraction of 0.9 or greater is considered full-time, while an FTE fraction of less than 0.9 is considered part -time. B. Consulting Policies : 1. Consulting by full -time faculty should be considered secondary to the performance of the faculty member's assigned duties. 2. Written notification is required for consulting. Written permission is required for consulting time. 3. Consulting time shall not average more than 1 day per week during the months of full -time employment excluding those days when university offices are officially closed. 4. Consulting is to be conducted in an ethical manner that should not create a conflict -of-interest situation. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 21 of 77 5. University facilities, equipment, personnel or supplies which are not freely available to the general public will not be used in consulting without proper arrangements for reimbursement. 6. Additional assignments performed during norma l university working hours, and for which an employee receives supplemental compensation, will be counted against that faculty member's allowed consulting time and must be approved by all cognizant administrators. C. Procedures /Right to Appeal : 1. The facu lty member shall submit a written notification of consulting to the faculty member's immediate supervisor (usually the department head) prior to initiation of consulting. At times, consulting opportunities arise when it is not possible to immediately subm it a written notification (such as weekends or holidays). In those cases, the faculty member is expected to make every possible effort to submit the notification on the next regular business day for the university. 2. The immediate supervisor is responsible for notifying the appropriate dean or director of those faculty members who have submitted notification of consulting. 3. The faculty member shall obtain prior written permission for consulting time from the faculty member's immediate supervisor and appropriate dean or director. The request for consulting time must be acted upon within 5 working days. 4. Prior written approval and financial arrangements for reimbursement must be obtained from the immediate supervisor before university facilities, equipment, personnel or supplies may be used in consulting by the faculty member. These arrangements will be reviewed by the appropriate dean or director and may be disapproved, with cause. 5. Causes for denial of consulting privileges include, but are not limited to: a clear conflict -of-interest situation, unprofessional conduct by the faculty member negatively reflecting on the university, significant interference with assigned university duties, consulting time exceeding an average of 1 day per week, or misuse of university facilities, equipment, personnel or supplies. 6. The faculty member may appeal decisions to the Faculty Grievance Review Board. 7. Additional policies not in conflict with the above may be developed and implemented by the college faculties and administrations. Rule 5.35 - Deans (See also Policy 1.05.50 University Administrative Council ; Policy 1.05.60 Academic Deans Council ) Rules 5.45, 5.45.10, 5.25.20, and 5.25.30 - Department Heads (See also Policy 5.06.30 Administrative Review of Department Heads ; Policy 5.25 Compensation ; Policy 5.92 Reassignment of Administrators /Department Heads ) Rule 5.45 Department Heads, Generally A department head serves at the discretion of the dean/director, with the concurrence of the executive vice president and provost . All academic departments are administered by department heads under the cognizance of the college dean, graduate dean, if appropriate, and the executive vice president and provost . A. Department Head Increment : It is the policy of the university to provi de additional stipends for those administering the academic departments, based upon the number of full -time faculty, part -time faculty, and graduate assistants supported from instruction and general funds. It is understood that this increment is included in the original offer to department heads just joining the faculty and is relinquished if the individual gives up the department head responsibilities. B. Faculty Rank : Department heads are academic administrators, with faculty rank, but eligible for con sideration under all policies applying to the faculty. For example, some department heads have been promoted to a higher rank and some have been tenured, but obviously the promotion and tenure considerations were in keeping with Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 22 of 77 their positio ns as members of the faculty. C. Length of Appointment : For department heads who are 12 -month employees, the year is from July 1 to June 30. Department heads that have negotiated a 9 -month appointment come under the policies of the regular faculty with respect to al l pay and fringe benefits and normally are excluded from summer teaching. Department heads observe the administrative calendar. D. Salary Determination : When an internal candidate is selected, department head salary normally is determined by multiplyin g the 9 -month faculty salary by 12/9 and adding the department head increment. E. Summer Session : (See 5.25.40 Compensation - Summer ) Rule 5.45.10 - Department Heads - Leaves A. Annual Leave : Department heads are treated the same as all other 12 -month employees, except for those provisions pertaining to teaching responsibilities. For example, regular full -time employees, including department heads, are granted 22 working days annual leave a year beginning with the date of employment. Unused annual leave may be accumulated but shall not exceed more than 30 working days. However, all department heads are urged to take annual leave each year because it is felt that administrators need this ti me off to ensure their continued effectiveness. A change in assignment of a 12 -month person to less than annual regular employment within the university will result in payment of any unused leave up to 30 days. Also, a department head that terminates or r etires from the university will be paid for unused leave up to 30 working days. Accurate annual leave records for department heads must be maintained in the deans' offices. B. Sick Leave : Under the 12 -month plan for department heads, the sick leave Rule s are observed. Regular full - time employees are granted 12 working days of sick leave a year which may be accumulated up to 800 hours per year. A department head returning to a 9 -month faculty contract is not eligible for unused sick leave, but comes un der the sick leave policies for the faculty. Accurate sick leave records must be maintained in the deans' offices. C. Annual/Sick Leave for Acting Department Heads : Nine -month faculty who serve temporarily in exempt positions such as acting department head should be changed by Personnel Action Form from faculty to exempt staff for the period. Consequently, they will earn sick leave and annual leave at the regular 12 -month rate, or at 9/12, 10/12, or 11/12 adjusted rates as applicable during the time o f administrative ser vice. If the faculty member returns to 9 -month faculty status afterward, another Personnel Action Form should change the status again from exempt staff to faculty. D. Sabbatical Leave : Sabbatical leave for department heads is determined by a formula prorating the time they have been on 9 - and 12 -month contracts during the previous 6 years counted towards the sabbatical leave. E. Summer Sabbatical Leave : A department head gains eligibility for sabbatical leave as indicated in the sabbatical leave section(s) of this manual, and may elect to take such leave in segments. Each leave segment should be of sufficient length to permit a significant planned accomplishment. When segments are used, the accrual for the next sabbatical le ave begins with the end of the year in which the first segment was taken. The entire sabbatical leave will be charged to the departmental salary budget. Rule 5.45.20 - Department Heads - Responsibilities The following responsibilities of the department head are to be accomplished, insofar as possible, within budget and policy /rules restraints. A. Academic Leadership : The department head is expected to be the academic leader of the departmental faculty. The department head is responsible for ensuring that highly qualified faculty are employed. Also, the department head ensures that official transcripts, including highest degree earned are obtained for every new faculty member's official personnel file (routed through the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost ). Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 23 of 77 Insofar as possible, the kind of atmosphere in which the faculty can do their best work in teaching, research, and service should be maintained. B. Faculty Development : Leadership of the faculty implies working clos ely with the faculty on the development and sustenance of departmental courses and the stimulation and encouragement of faculty development. A performance evaluation of each faculty member will be carried out at least once a year and should be made in the positive vein of professional development. Evaluation of the progress of tenure -track faculty should be made in con sultation with senior department faculty and in accordance with the highest national standards of faculty performance. C. Professional Con tacts: The department head is responsible for encouraging the national and international professional contacts of the faculty within the constraints of the departmental budget. This implies appropriate travel and bringing well -known professionals to the campus. D. Teaching Support : The department head has no more important task than ensuring teaching excellence. Encouragement and support of good teaching must be given to faculty, especially new faculty. Copies of current syllabi will be maintained in the department head 's office. The department head is responsible for ensuring an effective departmental evaluation of teaching, and for advisement of student departmental majors. E. Effective Management : The department head must ensure the effective administration of the department, including keeping the faculty fully informed of department, college, and university matters. Routine and special reports, including grade reports and other matters, must be ha ndled accurately and on time. Effective supervision and development of the department budget is important. The department head will keep the faculty informed on budgetary matters. All research and program contracts should be carefully supervised, both f or fiscal integrity and academic appropriateness. F. Departmental Advocate/College and University Steward : The department head is expected to be an advocate of the department, yet at the same time appreciate the concerns and priorities of the college and university. The most important department activities in the development of faculty, programs, research, and ser vice are done in close partnership with the office of the dean of the college. G. Liaison to Dean : The department head is responsible to the dean of the college for all the activities of the department. The dean should be kept apprised of all department activities and problems. H. Policy Compliance : The department head is responsible for ensuring that department, college, and university policies, rules and procedures are enforced. I. Role in Recruitment : The department head will inform the search committee chair if an underutilization memorandum is received from the Office of the executive vice president and provost for purposes of meeting affirmative action goals. The Search Committee Guidelines will be provided by the department head for tenure - track faculty positions. J. Supervision of Graduate Assistants : Graduate assistants are recommended for appointment by the department head. The appointment requires approval of the college and graduate dean. Three letters of recommendation are required for the approval. Specific orientation and training of graduate assistants are the responsibilities of the department head. Graduate assistants work under the close supervision of faculty. The policy on academic freedom does not apply to the ser vice expected of graduate assistants. The assignment of teaching duties to graduate assistants is the responsibility of the department head. Such assignment requires that the department head ascertain that the graduate assistant is fully qualified and that the work performed by the graduate assistant be closely supervised by a member of the faculty responsible for monitoring the assigned tasks associated with the graduate assistant 's teaching responsibility. Only those graduate assistants proficient in English may be assigned to teaching or teaching -related activities. Rule 5.45.30 - Department Heads - Teaching Requirements Minimum teaching for FA/SP/SI/SII Number of courses of 3 credits or equivalent* Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 24 of 77 Doctorate granting departments 3 Master granting departments 4 Bachelor granting departments 5 *Adjustments With the approval of the dean, an adjustment of one fewer course than the above number of courses may be made by any department that qualifies for three or more points as listed below. Points With 100 or more majors 1 With 15 or more graduate students 1 With $300,000 in grants or more and/or $20,000 in gifts in each year 1 With 15 or more faculty 1 With 30 or more faculty 1 Rule 5.47 - Faculty Discipli ne and Appeal Processes [Amendment deleting material from policies 4.05.50 and 5.98 to establish this policy recommended by FS Proposition No. 13-10/11A, passed by the Faculty Senate 0 3.03.11 ; the University Administrative Council recommended , as further amended , on 04.12.11; policy adopted by the Board of Regents 05.06.11.] [Amendment recommended by the Faculty Senate in Proposition No. 13-11/12A approved 04.05.12; approved by the Board of Regents 06.21.12] A. Purpose : To establish policy and p rocedures by which allegations of serious faculty misconduct, or inability to perform essential functions of the job, may be addressed equitably, expeditiously and without violating the principles of academic freedom or due process. B. Scope: This policy applies when serious misconduct, or inability to perform essential functions of the job, is reasonably suspected of any tenured, tenure track, or regular, non -tenure track faculty within the NMSU System. 1. This policy does not apply to situa tions involving unsatisfactory job performance covered by other policies regarding the quality of teaching/advising, research/scholarship or outreach/ extension or service. ( See 5.87 Post-Tenure Review ; 5.90 Promotion and Tenure ; 5.98 Tenure Track and Tenure policies) 2. This policy does not apply to situations involving the voluntary or involuntary retreat to a faculty position from an appointment as academic administrator, because such appointments are within the discretion of an executive administrator. 3. This policy does not apply to situations involving non -renewal of the annual faculty contract. C. Policy Administrator : The Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost, jointly with the Office of Human Resource Services, administers this policy. D. Definitions a nd Roles: 1. \"Clear and Convincing Evidence\": Clear and convincing evidence means evidence that makes the fact to be proven highly probable or reasonably certain. To prove a fact by clear and convincing evidence is evidence stronger than a \"preponderanc e\" and yet less than \"beyond a reasonable doubt;\" for evidence to be clear and convincing, it must instantly tilt the scales in the affirmative when weighed against the evidence in opposition and the fact finder's mind is left with an abiding conviction th at the evidence is true. (See Also subsection K. 3.) Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 25 of 77 2. \"Day\": When a time limit refers to \"day\", it refers to business rather than calendar days (Monday through Friday), and excludes official university holidays. 3. \"Dean\": When the policy refers to dean, it will include the equivalent ranks to dean, for academic units other than a college or library . It also will mean the designee serving in lieu of the dean, who may be designated by the Faculty Senate chair and assistant vice president for human resources, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, due to a conflict of interest on the part of the dean or dean equivalent. The dean serves as the informal pre -determination hearing officer. ( See subsection L., below). 4. \"Investigative Ad ministrator\": When the policy refers to the \" investigative administrator \", it refers to the individual who performs or coordinates the confidential investigation into the allegations against the faculty member, including issuance of the investigative repo rt. ( See subsection H. below). The investigative administrator also consults with the Office of H uman Resource Services and/or Office of General Counsel regarding the appropriate level of corrective action warranted, if any; prepares the notice of propos ed corrective action; and presents the matter to the pre -determination officer (the dean). ( See subsections H - K below.) The investigative administrator will usually be the immediate supervisor, or academic department head. It may also mean someone designated to serve in lieu of the immediate supervisor, in the event of a conflict of interest. (i.e. if the investigative administrator is implicated in the alleged misconduct.) In cases involving alleged discrimination in violation of federal or state l aw or university policy, it means a representative from the Office of Institutional Equity. In cases involving alleged embezzlement or other white collar type criminal activity, the investigation may be conducted by law enforcement, the Office of Internal Audit or other expert in the field. In these instances, the investigative administrator will coordinate with the involved supervisor, and HRS in order to determine the facts and the appropriate corrective or disciplinary action. 5. \"Preponderance of the Evidence\" : Preponderance of the evidence means the greater weight of the evidence . To prove a fact by the greater weight of the evidence means one must be persuaded that what is sought to be proved is more probably true than not true. Evenly balanced ev idence is not sufficient. (See Also subsection K. 3. ) E. Policy Overview: This section lists generally the steps which shall guide faculty and administration in the rare instance that serious misconduct, or inability to perform essential job functions, is r easonably suspected of a faculty member. More detail regarding each process is provided throughout this policy. 1. Administrative Leave. [ no time frame indicated and will vary] (See Section G.) 2. Internal Investigation. [no time frame indicated and will vary based on complexity] (See Section H.) 3. Assessment of Appropriate Correctiv e Action. [no ti me frame indicated and will vary] (See Section I.) 4. Assembly of Evidence and Notice of Intended Corrective Action. [no time frame indicated] (See Section J.) 5. Pre-Determination Hearing (Decision by Dean). [20 days or less from receipt of request for hearing, unless extension] (See Section M.) 6. Post-Determination Appeal Hearing (Decision by Executive Vice President and Provost). [45 days or less from receipt of N otice of Appeal, unless time extension] (See Section N.) 7. Final Review (Decision by Chancellor ). [20 days or less from receipt of Request for Final Review, unless time extension] (See Section O.) A flow chart indicating the steps in the investigative, corrective action and appeal processes involved in the case of serious misconduct or inability to perform essential job functions alleged against a faculty member may be viewed at Appendix 5 -C to Regent s Policy Manual - Faculty Discipline and Appeals Process Flow Chart. F. Alternative Dispute Resolution : At any stage in the processes described herein, if mutually agreed to between the parties, the disputed matter may be stayed as the parties attempt to resolve the dispute through an alternate method of dispute resolution, including but not limited to the following methods: mediation, settlement facilitation, or other negotiated resolution outside of the formal hearing processes provided for herein. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 26 of 77 G. Administrative Leave : When a faculty member is reasonably suspected or otherwise accused of serious misconduct constituting just cause under this policy, the faculty member may be placed on paid administrative leave pending a confidential investigation, in accordance with the following protocol: 1. These decisions will be made on a case by case basis by the department head or equivalent supervisor, in conjunction with the Office of H uman Resource Services , and based upon the facts alleged in each matter, including the potential risk of harm to students, others or the institution. 2. Approval from the assistant vice president of human resource services or designee is required to place any faculty member on paid administrative leave or to relocate, or to r eassign job duties, pending the investigation. The dean will be notified about the pendency of the internal investigation, but not about the factual details. 3. In lieu of paid administrative leave, a faculty member may be temporarily relocated to an alternate work environment or be assigned to perform alternate job duties, provided such temporary job modification will not in any way impede the investigation. 4. A faculty member placed on paid administrative leave shall remain available for communications from NMSU, and otherwise be ready to report to work upon request. If the faculty member has a need to be absent during a period of administrative leave, the facu lty member shall obtain the appropriate approval. H. Confidential Investigation : The allegations, and any defense raised by the faculty member in response to the allegations, shall be investigated fully and fairly, within a reasonable amount of time, and as confidentially as possible; based upon the circumstances involved in each matter. 1. The investigative administrator shall consult with the assistant vice president of human resources or designee and/or the university general counsel for guidance and support relating to the performance of the internal investigation. 2. The faculty member a ccused shall be provided notice of the charges at the appropriate time during the investigation, which may be when the investigation begins, or may be later, depending upon the nature of the allegations. The faculty member shall be given an opportunity to respond to the charges during the investigation process. 3. The investigation shall be documented with factual findings and supporting evidence. The evidence may consist of witness statements or summaries, documents, audio or video recordings or photogra phs, or other exhibits. The investigative report, including supporting documentation or other evidence, shall be delivered to the assistant vice president of human resource services. The investigative administrator shall retain the investigative work pape rs, investigative report and supporting documentation or other evidence in a confidential and secure location. 4. The investigative administrator shall confer with the assistant vice president for human resource services and/or the office of university gen eral counsel to decide whether or not the findings warrant corrective administrative action. 5. As soon as practicable, the charged faculty member shall be informed generally regarding the results of the investigation. 6. If the faculty member is exonerate d by the investigation, then no documentation referencing the investigation shall remain in the official personnel file, unless requested by the faculty member. 7. If corrective action is going to be pursued, the faculty member will be provided a copy of the investigative report and access to the supporting documents at the time that the corrective action is formally proposed. 8. In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good faith, report reasonably suspected misconduct, th e university prohibits retaliation in any form to be taken against the reporter or any person who cooperates in the investigative process. A complaint of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the initiation of a separate internal investigation to b e conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource Services, and if substantiated, will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 27 of 77 termination of employment. 9. If the investigative report reflects that the alleged misconduct was no t substantiated, the university will make efforts to restore the reputation of the faculty member, to the extent feasible and desired by the faculty member. Additionally, and depending upon the circumstances, the university may initiate a separate internal investigation in the event the investigative report indicates that the initial report of suspected misconduct or any testimony given as part of the internal investigation may have been intentionally falsified. If deliberate falsification of such a compla int or testimony is substantiated, it will be grounds for disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of employment. I. Just Cause Required : Just Cause, capable of being proven by the standard of proof set forth at subsection K.3, is required before suspension without pay, reduction in salary, or involuntary dismissal may be imposed. Just cause includes dishonest behavior, gross or habitual neglect of professional responsibilities, willful violation of NMSU policy, use of any improper influence to secure a promotion or privileges for individual advantage or any other serious misconduct causing or creating the potential for harm to person, property or the institution. Just Cause may also be unrelated to any miscon duct on the part of faculty, and could include a loss of licensure and/or clinical admitting privileges required for the performance of one's academic duties; or the medical inability to perform essential functions of the job. J. Administrative or Corrective Action : Corrective or other administrative action may be taken for serious misconduct or inability to perform the essential functions of one's job, if substantiated by the applicable standard of proof through the investigative fact finding process. 1. The types of administrative action anticipated by this policy include one or more of the following: written warning, mandatory attendance at training, suspension without pay, reduction in salary, and involuntary dismissal. 2. The range of corrective actio n which may be imposed for misconduct is not intended to require progressive discipline; rather, it is intended to allow the severity of the corrective action to match the seriousness of the policy violation or misconduct. The corrective action, if any, t o be imposed will vary depending upon the severity of the misconduct substantiated by the investigative findings. 3. The investigative administrator and the assistant vice president of human resource services shall coordinate regarding the appropriate leve l of corrective action or other administrative action, and if it does not warrant suspension without pay, reduction in pay, or involuntary dismissal, shall decide whether other corrective or administrative action is appropriate. 4. If suspension without pa y, reduction in salary or involuntary dismissal is supported by the investigative report and recommended by the investigative administrator, the due process hearing requirements outlined in the remainder of this policy shall apply. K. General Description of Due Process : A recommendation to dismiss from employment or to reduce salary attributable to regular faculty employment are serious corrective actions implicating one's property rights, which is why just cause and due process are required before such acti on may be taken. 1. Due process requires fair and timely hearing processes, before an impartial hearing official or body. The faculty member charged with misconduct and facing serious disciplinary action is entitled to a pre - determination hearing, at which the relevant facts are presented by the parties, and determined by a hearing officer to be accurate prior to proceeding with the proposed corrective action. This ensures that the faculty member has had an adequate opportunity to present a defense to the claims and the evid ence; it also ensures that the decision makers have an accurate understanding of the facts underlying the recommendation. 2. The faculty member also has the right to a post -determination appeal to the executive vice president and provost, as well as the ri ght to request a final review by the Chancellor . 3. At the pre -determination hearing and any subsequent appeal, the burden of proving just cause by the applicable standard of proof is on NMSU. The standard of proof shall be clear and convincing evidence f or all infractions, except for disciplinary action proposed for discrimination proscribed by federal and state Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 28 of 77 law, which matters are investigated by the university's Office of Institutional Equity; the burden of proof when discrimination constitutes the g rounds for which the disciplinary action is being taken shall be preponderance of the evidence. (See subsections D.4. and D.5.) L. Time Deadlines and Extensions: The pre -determination, appeal and final review processes will be conducted as expeditiously a s possible. 1. At the request from a party, a one -time extension of the time deadline may be granted, after notice to the other party and consideration of that party's position relative to the request. 2. If the request for the time extension is from a heari ng Faculty Appeals Board member, the chair of Faculty Senate may grant a reasonable extension, with notice to all parties. 3. A second or subsequent request for time extension from any party or from a Faculty Appeals Board member will only be granted in exc eptional cases, after consideration of the basis for the request and the respective positions of the parties. The Faculty Appeals Board or Faculty Senate chair may deny a request for extension, in the best interest of the institution, even if no party opp oses it. M. Pre-Determination Process: [25 days or less from date of issuance of notice letter or memo, unless time extension granted] 1. Notice of Proposed Administrative Action. The investigative administrator or other uninvolved supervisor shall issue a letter or memo to the faculty member notifying the grounds for the recommended corrective action, and attach a copy of the investigative report. If for some reason, there is not a document entitled, \"investigative report\", the charges against the faculty member and the evidence substantiating the charges shall be provided. Guidelines for investigative reports are available in the Office of Human Resource Service or the Office of the General Counsel . The notice letter or memo shall explain the faculty member's right to attend an informal pre -determination hearing, and be delivered by hand -delivery or by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested. 2. Right to Attend Pre -Determina tion Hearing. [5 days for faculty to confirm attendance at hearing] A pre - determination hearing will be convened by the dean or Dean's Advisory Committee, as appropriate ( See 3 a. below), in order to review the recommended action together with the evidence , and to hear the faculty member's position in response thereto. Within five (5) days of the documented receipt of the written notice of proposed administrative action, the faculty member shall notify the dean's office in writing whether or not the facul ty member will attend the hearing and/or be represented by legal counsel. The faculty member shall also indicate whether or not the use of the Dean's Advisory Committee is requested. ( See 3. a. below) If the faculty member chooses to not attend the informal fact finding hearing, a determination will be rendered in the faculty member's absence. 3. Informal Pre -Determination Hearing : [15 days or less] An informal fact finding hearing shall be heard by either the dean or by the Dean's Advisory Commit tee, within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice letter or memo, as follows: a. Option to Utilize a Dean's Advisory Committee : The use of the Dean's Advisory Committee may be requested by the faculty member whose conduct is subject of the proceedi ngs, or initiated at the discretion of the dean. The Dean's Advisory Committee shall consist of three members of Faculty Senate selected by the Faculty Senate chair. If utilized, it will assist the dean by hearing the evidence and the parties' respective positions, and by rendering findings of fact and recommendations. i. If utilized, the Dean's Advisory Committee shall hold the hearing no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice letter or memo to the faculty member. ii. If utilized, the Dean's Advisory Committee shall render written findings and recommendat ions, with the record, to the dean or designee and to the faculty member within five (5) days from the hearing; Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 29 of 77 b. Hearing by Dean : If neither the dean nor the faculty member elects to utilize the Dean's Advisory Committee, the dean shall conduct the pre -determination hearing within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice letter or memo. c. Legal Counsel : If the faculty member is represented by legal counsel, the university may also utilize legal counsel. The role of the attorneys during the pre -determination hearing is not to actively participate or present, but to advise and provide support. d. Conduct of Pre -Determination Hearing : At the pre -determination hearing, the faculty member will be given the opportunity to respond to the charges and to the evidence, including the submission of documentary and other evidence, such as any witness statements collected. In the event the faculty members informs the dean in advance of the hearing that an NMSU employee is a necessary witness and will not cooperat e in providing a statement, NMSU will make arrangements for the witness to be available either in person or through other telephonic or technological means. 4. Issuance of Determination : [10 days or less] Within ten (10) days from the pre -determination he aring or from receipt of the Dean's Advisory Committee's findings and recommendations, as appropriate, the dean shall issue a determination to the parties, with a copy to the assistant vice president of human resource services and to the university's gener al counsel. The dean may uphold, modify or reject the proposed administrative action. 5. Notification of Right to Appeal. The determination shall notify the faculty member of the right to appeal. If the faculty member does not appeal, a copy of the determ ination shall be sent to the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost, as well as filed in the faculty member's official personnel file. N. Post-Determination Appeal : The aggrieved faculty member may appeal the determination of the dean in accord ance with the policies and procedures below. 1.

Rule 5.86 - Performance Evaluation (See 5.45 Department Head - Review and 5.35 Deans - Review above, as well as 5.15.40 Appointments - Nontenure -Track ) A. Policy Statement : The performance of each faculty member will be reviewed at least once a year by the department head, comparable administrator, or a committee. This review will include a written report submitted by the faculty member. The form(s) of this report shall be determined by individual colleges ( community colleges ) in consultation with their departments. The department head or comparable administrator shall report the results of this review to the indivi dual being reviewed. These results shall serve to establish the goals for the following year. A written copy of the evaluation shall be given to the faculty member. B. Procedures for the Faculty Performance Evaluation System : 1. Each college uses its own performance evaluation form. Early in each fall semester the department head or comparable administrator supplies each faculty member with a form. At this time the department head confers with new faculty members concerning the recording of objectives an d goals and the general use of the form. In the case of continuing faculty members, the department head or faculty may request a conference for the purpose of revising or updating objectives previously agreed upon. Department heads will share the above a greements in writing with the faculty member. 2. Department heads are expected to meet with all new and returning faculty members regarding progress toward promotion and tenure and to certify in writing to the appropriate dean that these meetings have occurred. Specific evaluative comments in each of th e three areas of performance are required, as well as Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 34 of 77 separate comments about progress toward tenure and toward promotion. 3. Each faculty member completes a written form detailing and citing accomplishments in the broad categories of teaching, research and/ or creative scholarship, and ser vice during the performance evaluation period. The type, method of collection, and disposition of evidence regarding effectiveness of teaching is of particular importance, and faculty should consult with department heads co ncerning collection of this evidence. The performance evaluation form, along with any supplemental material, is submitted by each faculty member to the faculty member's department head. 4. The department head reviews the faculty performance forms, prepares a written evaluation based upon accomplishments reported as compared with previously set goals and objectives (a copy of this report will be shared with the faculty member), and confers with appropriate deans to achieve consensus on the written recommendat ion and the prepared summary to be discussed with the faculty member. Following the conference with the dean, the department head meets with the faculty member to discuss all aspects of the performance evaluation, addressing separately the person 's progre ss toward promotion, progress toward tenure, strengths, and weaknesses. This conference also serves to set goals and objectives for the ensuing year. No mention shall be made at this conference of the recommendation in terms of dollars. These goals and objectives will be placed in writing, with a copy to the faculty member. 5. At community colleges with program coordinators, the coordinator performs the duties of a department head in the evaluation process. The coordinator will confer with the community college executive officer, who in turn confers with the executive vice president and provost . 6. Department heads formulate recommendations where appropriate regarding promotion and tenure on the basis of policies stated in this manual. These are communicat ed to the college dean. 7. Each college generates its own time schedule for accomplishing the above items, within the parameters of the university calendar. 8. It will be the function of the Faculty Senate to legislate policy regarding the Faculty Performance Evaluation System. Rule s 5.87.1 through 5.87.7 - Post-Tenure Review [Policy (Proposition 22-05/06 ) passed by the Faculty Senate 05 .04.06; policy adoption ratified b y the Board of Regents 09.08.06] 5.87.1 Introduction The Post -Tenure Review Policy ensures that all tenured faculty members will receive an annual review and that those with either exceptionally fine performance or serious deficiencies in one or more areas will be identified. Special achievement shall be rewarded in a manner determined b y each college or community college campus. For a tenured faculty member who receives two successive unsatisfactory annual reviews with identified and uncorrected serious deficiencies, this policy provides a mechanism to establish a remedial program for c orrecting the deficiencies. The legislation to which this policy responds is particularly concerned with the quality of teaching, and that fact shall be considered when taking any action under this policy. In particular, faculty whose teaching needs impr ovement will be urged to take advantage of \"programs designed to assist faculty members in enhancing their teaching skills.\" ( NMSA 1978 , Section 21 -1-7.1) 5.87.2 Annual Reviews Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 35 of 77 A. Annual Review for Tenured Faculty : Tenured faculty members annually partic ipate in and receive an extensive examination of their teaching, their research and scholarly output, and their ser vice as part of the annual review process conducted in accordance with 5.86 Performance Evaluatio ns of the Policy Manual. This annual review document shall be labeled the Post Tenure Review of each tenured faculty member. This Post Tenure Review shall weight the three areas of teaching, scholarly work, and ser vice in proportion to the percentage eac h category is given in the faculty member's allocation of effort for a given year. B. Post Tenure Review Not Applicable for Full Time Administrators : Administrators who hold tenured faculty rank are reviewed on the performance of their faculty duties (teach ing, research, and ser vice). Administrators who have no assigned faculty duties will not be reviewed under this policy. 5.87.3 More Complete Post -Tenure Reviews A. Notification to Faculty Member about Deficiency : If, in the judgment of a superior, the annual review for a tenured faculty member shows a serious deficiency in the performance of that faculty member, the superior shall inform the faculty member in writing of the deficiency as well as recommend actions t he faculty member might take to address the issue. B. Deficiency Not Rectified: If the deficiency or deficiencies continues for two or more years and if the faculty member has not taken the corrective actions, one of two possible courses of action may ens ue: 1. The faculty member may request that the superior submit the record of poor performance and suggested actions to the other tenured faculty members of the unit for consideration in a more complete review, or 2. If the faculty member does not request the r eview, the superior may initiate such a review with the concurrence of a majority of the tenured faculty in the academic unit. C. Goal of and Procedures for More Complete Review : The more complete review shall have the aim of identifying strengths and weakn esses of the faculty member in teaching, research, and ser vice. 1. This review shall be undertaken by the departmental promotion and tenure committee. 2. If there is no departmental promotion and tenure committee for that unit, the review will be undertaken by the equivalent college -level promotion and tenure committee as specified in 5.90 Promotion and Tenure of this manual. 3. Student evaluations must be considered when evaluating the faculty member's teaching, along with other factors. 4. If the reviewers conclude that the faculty member's performance is not seriously deficient, the faculty member shall be so informed and a s tatement of the finding placed in the faculty member's personnel file. 5. If serious deficiency is found, a specific remedial program shall be developed in consultation with the faculty member that includes procedures, criteria for evaluating progress, and a reasonable timetable. If the faculty member's teaching needs improvement, such a program might include participation in programs offered by the Teaching Academy, mentoring by a recipient of teaching awards, intensive study of videotaped classroom sessions , etc. When research and publication needs improvement, collaboration with another faculty member and participation in workshops on publishing might be indicated. However, in accordance with NMSA 1978 , Section 21 -1-7.1, part E( 1), any remedial effort can be no shorter than two years in length. 5.87.4 Enhancement Program Whether or not a tenured faculty member accepts the recommendation to participate in a teaching or scholarly work enhancement program, and whether or not the member performs well in the program, the faculty member's performance will be judged on subsequent teaching and scholarly work. 5.87.5 Frequency of Review The more complete review shall not be initiated for any tenured faculty member more frequently than once every Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 36 of 77 five years. 5.87.6 Persistent Teaching Deficiencies If a tenured faculty member's teaching deficiencies are considered by the executive vice president and provost to be very serious and to have been uncorrected at the conclusion of the agreed time period, and further, if there is evidence that the faculty member's teaching performance has deteriorated since the award of tenure such that the faculty member's teaching performance is now typically unsatisfactory, the executive vice president and provost shall recommend loss of tenure for the faculty member in question. If tenure is to be revoked, the university shall follow the processes specified in 5.98 Tenure Track and Tenure for Involuntary Termination of a Continuous Contract, subject to the safeguards of 4.25 Due Process . 5.87.7 Reporting Every year, each academic dean and the chief community college executive officer of each campus shall report to the executive vice president and provost .

And the number of faculty whose tenure have been revoked Rules 5.90.1 through 5.90.7 - Promotion and Tenure (for listing of specific topics, See Regents Policy Manual, Chapter 5 Table of Contents) (See also NMSU Policies we bsite for postings of Procedural Clarifications from the Office of the Provost relating to this policy ) [Amendment (FS Proposition 18 - 06/07 to be effective 08.01.08 )passed by the Faculty Senate 05.03.07 and Amendment (FS Proposition 16 -07/08 to be effect ive 08.01.08) passed by the Faculty Senate 03.06.08; ratified by the Board of Regents 07.15.08] 5.90.1 Introduction A. Promotion and tenure decisions are the means by which NMSU rewards and retains its most valued scholars, sustains excellence in its in structional disciplines, and fulfills its mission to advance knowledge. The quality of faculty accomplishments in teaching and advising (or its equivalent), scholarship and creative activity, extension, outreach and service largely determines the quality of the university as a whole. The granting of tenure or promotion to associate or full professor represents a prediction by the university that the individual concerned will continue to make substantial contributions to the profession and the university. B. The processes involved in promotion and tenure rely upon basic principles in order to be effective. Above all, the promotion and tenure processes must be fair, transparent, and participatory. These values mean that decisions must be made without regard to race, national origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 37 of 77 beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates, taking care to avoid conflicts of interest, structural, institutional, o r habitual thoughts and patterns that could lead to discrimination. NMSU values the richness that inquiry based upon intellectual and cultural differences brings to the university community. C. Each principal unit must develop written standards by the end o f the Spring Semester of 2008 based on criteria developed by that principal unit subject to the approval of the dean or equivalent administrator. Criteria and procedures must be clear and readily available to all participants and must be followed by all p articipants at each level of the process. Therefore, it is imperative that clear standards for annual performance evaluation, promotion, and tenure be articulated and broadly publicized. Applicants for tenure or promotion must be judged on their performa nce of the duties assigned to them, following agreed -upon allocations of effort. The process needs to involve broad consultation by groups and individuals with successively broader views of the mission of the university, and provide the opportunity for ap peal. In order to achieve fairness, transparency, and broad -based participation, all of the parties must base decisions on the documentation called for by this policy. D. This policy relies on the four types of scholarship defined by Ernest L. Boyer (1990) in his book \"Scholarship Reconsidered\" 1, namely, the scholarships of discovery, of teaching, of integration, and of engagement. Broadening the definition of scholarship (See 5.90.4.2 Scholarships and Creative Activity ) reflects the changing roles of faculty members in teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, extension, outreach and service. E. This policy takes effect at the beginning of the Fall Semester, 2008. 5.90.2 Glossary Key terms used throughout this document are defined here. A.

B. Departmental and Principal Unit Postings : 1. To promote the transparency of the process, each principal unit shall post on its website its written policy document aligned with the Guiding Principles, Criteria, and Policies outlined in this policy. 2. Websites will also contain links to the university's promotion and tenure documents, as well as to each of the department websites. 3. In addition, each department shall post on its website its current statement of goals, objectives, and expectations as these relate to promotion and tenure (sometimes called a functions and criteria statement). These shall be agreed upon by the faculty in each department and approved by the responsible dean or comparable administrator. C. Policies to be Provided to Eli gible Faculty : A written copy of promotion and tenure policies will be given to all tenure -track, tenured, college and research faculty who are eligible for consideration for promotion or tenure. 5.90.3.2.1 Conflict of Interest - (See Policies 3.19 Conflicts of Interest - Ethical Conduct and 3.22 Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships ) 5.90.3.3 Performance Evaluation The annual performance evaluation is a component of the promotion and tenure process. This multi -layered evaluation system relies on consistency at each level of review. The performance of each faculty member, including college faculty, will be reviewed at least on ce a year. The performance evaluation provides documentation of expectations and a record of faculty performance relative to stated expectations . The form of the evaluation is determined by the college or community college and shall align with promotion and tenure expectations. ( See 5.90.5.1 Performance Evaluations and 5.90.6 Post Tenure Review ) 5.90.3.4 Allocation of Effort A. Service to Mission : The amount of effort that faculty members regardless of rank or position devote to the various aspects of their duties necessarily varies, and any fair promotion and tenure process will recognize these variations. A successful process considers whether the faculty member is effectively serving the mission of the university, as defined by a department's criteria and the individual's agreed upon goals and objectives. This Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 40 of 77 means, for example, that the efforts of a faculty member made in response to admini strators or committees are taken into account during promotion and tenure evaluation and are not discredited. B. Fairness Despite Variance in Duties : One faculty member may devote more time to teaching at one point than at another. The efforts of two facul ty members may vary at the same points in their careers according to their particular strengths and department needs. Faculty assignments in different departments will also vary. It is fundamentally unfair, for example, to expect the same amount of schol arship and creative activity, service, extension, or outreach from a faculty member teaching one class a semester as from another faculty member teaching three classes a semester or several large lecture classes. C. Equitable Treatment : In order to ensure e quitable treatment, every faculty member will complete an allocation of effort statement as part of the annual evaluation process. ( See also 5.20.20 Assignments - Teaching Load ) When determining the allocat ion of effort, decisions must be made without regard to race, national origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates. Further, for the a llocation of effort statement to be accurate and useful, administrators at all levels must understand and take an active role in avoiding institutional factors that could produce an undue burden on untenured faculty members and those from underrepresented groups in the allocation of effort process. D. Use of Allocation of Effort Statement : Each college shall develop and use an allocation of effort statement as specified in 5.90.5.1 Performance Evaluations . These statements shall be a part of the faculty member's tenure and/or promotion portfolio, and all aspects of the agreed upon efforts shall be factored into the recommendation made at each step of the process. 5.90.3.5 The Professorial Ranks A. Instructor: 1. Demonstrates expertise within their discipline through practical, applied, and/or related experience. 2. Individuals new to this rank may not have demonstrated ability to conduct independent scholarship and creative activity, but there must be substantive evidence of likely success at university teaching or its equivalent. 3. Instructors may be working toward a terminal degree. 4. An instructor's job description primarily relates to teaching or its equivalent and usually does not include scholarship and cre ative activity. 5. An instructor is not eligible for tenure, except at the community colleges. B. College Faculty: A person holding a college faculty appointment is eligible for advancement in rank but not eligible for tenure. C. Assistant Professor: 1. Normally holds the highest terminal degree in their field of expertise. 2. Outstanding experience and recognition in a professional field may be considered the equivalent of the terminal degree. 3. An assistant professor is expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment of the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole. 4. Assistant professors are tenure -track faculty members hired on a yearly, renewable contract for a maximum of seven years. 5. During the sixth yea r, assistant professors typically are evaluated for promotion and tenure simultaneously, having submitted their portfolio at the beginning of that year. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 41 of 77 6. However, an assistant professor may elect to apply for tenure or promotion at any time with the writ ten approval of department head and dean or their equivalents. 7. The application for tenure may occur only one time. D. Associate Professor : 1. An associate professor is often a mid -career faculty member who has been awarded tenure. 2. If a faculty member is initially employed at the rank of associate professor without tenure, the probationary period may vary depending upon agreements stipulated in writing at the time of initial hire. 3. Once tenured, associate professors may hold this rank indefinitely or apply for promotion. 4. Promotion to professor should not be considered to be forthcoming merely because of years of service to the university, or because tenure has previously been awarded. 5. In accordance with the principal unit's timelines, a faculty member may present a promotion portfolio in any given year. 6. An associate professor must demonstrate competence, continuous progress, and maturity over a large part of the academic field. 7. It is expected that evidence showing high quality of teaching and scholarship and creative activity has been provided and is current. E. Professor: 1. A professor, sometimes referred to as a \"full professor,\" has established disciplinary, intellectual, and institutional leadership. 2. The professor demonstrates command and a mature view of the disciplinary field as evidenced by teaching and advising (or its equivalent) or similar experience, scholarship and creative activity, service, extension, or outreach . 3. Faculty members initially hired at the rank of professor are often given tenure on appointment. 5.90.3.6 Flexibility in Tenure -Track Normally, before being considered for tenure, eligible faculty members serve six consecutive probationary years. The probationary period begins with the first year of the contract. Note that according to 5.98 Tenure Track and Tenure , \"New tenure -track faculty reporting for duty after the last Friday in September (12 -month employees) or the second Friday in October (9 -month employees) will not receive a temporary contract....\" The first contract will be issued at the beginning of the next contract period, which will constitute the first year of the probationary period toward tenure. During the sixth year, a case for tenure and/or promotion is made by the faculty member and considered by the university. Those ach ieving tenure are awarded a continuous contract at the end of their sixth year, while those not awarded tenure are given a one -year terminal contract for their seventh and final year of employment at NMSU. There may be exceptions, however, to shorten or l engthen the normal six -year probationary period. 5.90.3.6.1 Credit for Prior Service A. Faculty members with previous teaching and advising (or its equivalent), service, extension, outreach, scholarly, and/or administrative experience at another institution may have some or all of that experience taken into consideration on appointment at NMSU. B. With executive vice -president and provost approval, and particularly when tenure has been granted to a candidate at another institution, tenure may be accorded at th e time of initial appointment to the university. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 42 of 77 C. Prior probationary service at another institution may count towards the six -year probationary period at NMSU, but usually only up to a maximum of three years. D. Any expedited schedule must be recommended b y the department head and dean and agreed to by both the executive vice -president and provost and the faculty member at the time of appointment. E. The details of such credit for prior service, the resulting length of the probationary period, the timing of any third -year review, and the period for the tenure application process, shall all be stated unambiguously in the appointment letter. 5.90.3.6.2 Extension of the Probationary Period When requested in writing within one year of the qualifying event by the faculty member, leaves of absence can lead to postponement of the tenure decision date; however, modifications in that date require the recommendation of the department head and dean and the approval of the executive vice -president and provost. Facult y responsibilities may be negotiated when the extension is requested. An extension may be granted up to two times, so long as the total pre -tenure probationary period does not exceed eight years. Exceptions to this limit can be made under extraordinary c ircumstances if approved by the executive vice -president and provost. Candidates must be held to the same standards of performance when the probationary period has been extended as candidates whose probationary period was not extended. The probationary p eriod may be extended, upon written request, under the following circumstances: A. Leave of Absence without Pay: Probationary faculty members may request in writing a leave of absence without pay, usually not to exceed one academic or fiscal year. Prior to initiating the leave, affected faculty may request in writing a probation extension of one year. B. Military Leave of Absence: Involuntary induction into the armed forces entitles the faculty member to a leave of absence to cover the term of military service. Such leave constitutes valid grounds for requesting an extension of the tenure decision date. Similarly, a faculty memb er's voluntary participation in a military reserve program may lead to periodic or prolonged absence sufficient to affect the faculty member's performance ( e.g., annual active duty training, or active duty training or participation when a reserve unit is c alled to active duty) that constitutes valid grounds for extension of the tenure decision date. C. Medical Leave of Absence: Probationary faculty members with a serious personal illness or providing prolonged, substantive care for a chronically ill famil y member may request in writing an extension of the tenure decision date, usually for one year. D. Family Leave of Absence or Exceptional Family Responsibilities: Upon written request, probationary faculty members who become parents will receive a one -year automatic extension of the tenure decision date. Such an extension does not require that the faculty member take a leave of absence. E. Catastrophic Events: Probationary faculty who have experienced a catastrophic event such as a fire or flood or who must aid family members in such situations may request in writing an extension of the tenure decision date. F. Jury Duty: Prolonged jury service, when significantly affecting a faculty member's performance, constitutes a valid reason to petition for ext ension of the tenure decision date. G. Other, as Negotiated : Extensions for other reasons may be negotiated. 5.90.3.6.3 Reduction of the Probationary Period A. Tenure Upon Initial NMSU Appointment : Faculty members who have worked in a teaching and advising (or its equivalent), service, extension, scholarly, and/or administrative role at another institution may have some or all of that work taken into consideration on appointment at NMSU. With executive vice -president and provost approval, and particularly w hen tenure has been granted to a candidate at another institution, tenure may be accorded at the time of initial appointment to the university. B. Expedited Tenure Schedule : Prior probationary service at another institution may count towards the six -year probationary period at NMSU, but usually only up to a maximum of three years. Any expedited schedule must be recommended by the department head and dean and agreed to by both the executive vice -president and Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 43 of 77 provost and the faculty member at the time of app ointment. The details of such credit for prior service, the resulting length of the probationary period, the timing of any third -year review, and the period for the tenure application process, shall all be stated unambiguously in the appointment letter. In such instances, no extension of the probationary period will be granted unless the request falls in one of the categories mentioned in 5.90.3.6.2 Extension of the Probationary Period . C. Committee, Department Head and De an Supported Appeal for Early Tenure Review : Current faculty may request the length of the probationary period be shortened. Such an appeal requires the written request of the faculty member, positive recommendations of the department promotion and tenur e committee as determined in the spring review, department head, and dean. If this tenure application is not successful, the candidate's contract is not renewed according to the provisions of Policy 5.98 Tenure T rack and Tenure . 5.90.3.6.4 Part -Time Faculty and Tenure A. Retention of Tenure Upon Move from Full Time to Part Time : Tenured, full -time faculty members who move to part -time status may retain tenure. 1. Retention of tenure in such a case requires the written request of the faculty member, positive recommendations of the department head and dean, and approval of the executive vice -president and provost. 2. While this policy encourages departments to accomm odate reasonable requests for part -time appointment, part-time appointments are not an entitlement, and requests may be turned down. 3. Pending availability of funding and the approval of the department head, dean and executive vice -president and provost, the faculty member may return later to full -time tenured status. ( See subsection D. below) B. Procedural Guidelines : 1. When a full -time, tenure -track position becomes part time, the time in rank is prorated based on full -time equivalent (FTE). 2. As with full -time faculty, the maximum probationary period for part -time faculty members is the equivalent of six FTE years, with the tenure decision to be made before the end of the six full -time years of service. For example, a tenure -track candidate wi th a 0.50 FTE appointment must apply for tenure at the end of the 11th year. 3. Part-time tenure -track faculty must be held to the same standards of performance relative to FTE as full - time faculty. 4. If denied tenure, a faculty member on part -time appointment has only one year of continued part -time employment beyond the denial. C. Regular Part Time Appointment Defined : Faculty members whose regular appointments are less than 0.50 FTE do not accumulat e probationary time toward tenure. D. Return from Part Time to Full Time : When recurring state funding is available, a tenure -track, part -time faculty member may apply for a full -time tenure track position and, if hired, apply earned tenure -track FTE from p rior years toward tenure and promotion in the full -time position. 5.90.3.6.5 Joint Appointment (with Dual Primary Responsibilities) In appropriate circumstances, a faculty member may be appointed in two departments or colleges. The faculty member with a joint appointment has a memorandum of understanding from all involved units. The memorandum of understanding stipulates the expected workload and allocation of effort distributed between the two departments; identifies the principal unit where tenure resides or will reside if applicable; defines the responsibilities of the faculty member in each unit; and indicates the term of appointm ent. The memorandum must explain the process for performance and promotion and tenure reviews, renewal of the joint appointment, and salary increases. Each unit must provide recommendations in annual, probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews. In join t appointments with Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 44 of 77 centers or institutes, the tenure home must reside in a principal unit. In joint appointments with two or more academic units, one unit must be designated, by mutual agreement, as the tenure home. 5.90.3.7 Mid -Probationary Review Tenu re-track faculty members may request a formal mid -probationary review by those principal units that make such an option available. The mid -probationary review is an optional opportunity to obtain feedback on the tenure - track faculty member's performance a nd is used to identify specific activities to enhance the candidate's progress toward promotion and tenure. The review is formative, intended to assist tenure -track faculty in achieving promotion and tenure and should take into account the allocation of w ork effort during the three years reviewed and be based upon the principal unit's criteria. The outcome must not be used as a determinant for setting merit pay or for contract continuation decisions. Principal units should See 5.90.5.4(6) Common Elements ) for additional information 5.90.3.8 Community Colleges, Library, and College Faculty The community colleges (other than Do\u00f1a Ana Community College, whose division committees function as department committees), and the library faculty should begin their promotion and tenure deliberations with a committee that acts as a college -level committee. Specific variations are described below. 5.90.3.8.1 Community Colleges A. Mission and Corresponding Emphasis in Evaluation Process: The mission of NMSU's community colleges is to provide open access to quality education and support economic and cultural life in prescribed service areas. Community colleges provide traditional liberal arts education, vocational and technical training, contract training, community interest classes, and developmental education. Every effort is made to keep programs and curricula flexible, in order to accommodate varied and expanding community educational needs. Since the community college's primary rol e is the dissemination of information, more emphasis is placed on teaching and advising (or its equivalent), in the evaluation process. B. Tenure Committees : Due to their size, the organizational structure for tenure review at the Alamogordo, Carlsbad, and Grants campuses consists of a tenure committee at each campus that evaluates and makes recommendations to the campus executive officer. 5.90.3.8.2 The Library The NMSU library faculty is expected to meet university requirements for academic appointment an d promotion and tenure considerations. For these purposes, the category of librarianship is equivalent to the teaching and advising category. The NMSU Library places the highest value on the element of librarianship. Librarianship includes, but is not l imited to the organization of knowledge, the understanding and use of technology as it relates to the information field, teaching, library management, service delivery, and building collections. 5.90.3.8.3 College Faculty College faculty may hold ranks as described in 5.90.3.5 Tenure, Promotion and the Professorial Ranks and are eligible for promotion. A college faculty position can be converted to a tenure -track position when sufficient recurring funds are available and a national search is conducted. In relation to the promotion of college faculty, an understanding of the following guiding principles is necessary: A. Criteria for Promotion : College Faculty should be evaluated for promotion based on the allocation of thei r effort to the areas of teaching and advising, service, scholarship and creative activity, or extension and outreach, service, and the relative mix of these duties. B. Development of Promotion Procedures : Colleges must develop specific promotion procedures for their college faculty. The protections for College Faculty are the same as those given tenure -track faculty and tenure faculty in 5.90.5.1 Performance Evaluations and 5.90.5.4 Common Elements - 5.90.5.8 Appeals . C. Representation on Committee : Committees for promotion of college faculty must include college faculty representation. D. Appropriate Stand ards for Promotion : The different role played by college faculty should be recognized in the promotion process, and the standard for promotion should be appropriate given the role of college faculty. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 45 of 77 5.90.4 Criteria for Promotion and Tenure When consider ing applicants for promotion and tenure, serious attention will be given to performances in the applicable areas of teaching and advising (or its equivalent), scholarship and creative activity, service, extension and outreach, and where applicable, leaders hip. The relative importance of each of these areas varies according to the cumulative allocation of effort statements. Each area is vital to the university's ability to achieve its mission, and the performance of a faculty member will be viewed as an in dication of future contributions. 5.90.4.1 Teaching and Advising A. Elements of Teaching as Essential Criterion : Teaching is central to NMSU's mission. For those who teach, effectiveness in teaching and advising is an essential criterion for tenure and for advancement in rank. The teaching and advising category includes all forms of university -level instructional activity, as well as advising undergraduate and graduate students, both within and outside the university community. Such activities are comm only characterized by the dissemination of knowledge within a faculty member's area of expertise; skill in stimulating students to think critically and to apply knowledge to human problems; the integration and application of relevant domestic and internati onal, social, political, economic, and ethical implications into class content; the preparation of students for careers in specific fields of study; and the creation and supervision of appropriate field or clinical practicum's. B. Responsibilities of Teachin g and Advising : Teaching and advising responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, preparation for and teaching of a variety of courses, seminars, and other academic learning experiences; non -credit workshops and informal instructional activities ; course and program development; team or collaborative teaching; web -based instruction, both on and off campus; supervision of student research, performances, or productions; service on graduate student program and research committees; field supervision and administration of field or clinical experiences; production of course materials, textbooks, web pages and other electronic aids to learning; and others. C. Forms of Faculty Advising : Faculty advising may take the form of assisting undergraduate or gradua te students in the selection of courses or careers, assisting learners in educational programs on and off campus, mentoring students, serving as faculty adviser to student groups, research and teaching advising, as well as other forms. 5.90.4.1.1 Evaluati on of Teaching A. Evidence By Which Teaching Effectiveness is Assessed : Teaching is a complex and multifaceted activity. Therefore, several forms of evidence should be used to assess comprehensively teaching effectiveness. Each form of evidence should car ry a weight appropriate to its importance in evaluating teaching. Such documentation must demonstrate command of subject matter, continuous growth, and development in the subject field, the ability to organize material and convey it effectively to student s, assessment of student learning, revision and updates of curricula, and the integration of scholarship (for faculty who produce scholarship) and service with teaching. Materials appropriate for evaluating teaching should include: (a) evidence from the i nstructor, (b) evidence from other professionals, (c) evidence from students, and (d) evidence of student learning. B. Principal Units To Develop Guidelines : Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines for its teaching faculty that define teaching res ponsibilities and specify required evidence documenting teaching effectiveness. Specific data to be included in the evaluation packet will be determined by each principal unit. 5.90.4.1.2 Evaluation of Advising For promotion and tenure considerations, performance in such activities must be documented and evaluated. Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines regarding the responsibilities and documentation requirements for its faculty who advise. 5.90.4.2 Scholarship and Creative Activity [Amend ment (FS Proposition 09 -09/10 to be effective 07.01.01) passed by the Faculty Senate 02.04.10; presented to Administrative Council 04.13.10; ratified by the Board of Regents 05.07.10] Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 46 of 77 A. Rationale : Scholarship and creative activity involves discovering and creating, teaching and disseminating, and applying knowledge and skills to worldly concerns. This understanding is grounded in Boyer's concept of the four scholarships: (1) the scholarship of discovery involves processes, outcomes, and the passionate comm itment of the professoriate and others in the university to disciplined inquiry and exploration in the development of knowledge and skills; (2) the scholarship of teaching involves dynamic, reciprocal, and critically reflective processes among teachers and learners at the university and in the community in which their activity and interaction enriches and transforms knowledge and skills, taught and learned; (3) the scholarship of engagement refers to the many and varied ways to responsibly offer and employ knowledge and skills to matters of consequence to the university and the community; and (4) the scholarship of integration is the process by which knowledge and skills are assessed, interpreted, and applied in new and creative ways to produce new, richer, and more comprehensive, insights, understanding, and outcomes. B. NMSU Definition of Scholarship and Creative Activity : Scholarship and creative activity is both activity and product, employing dynamically interacting processes of discovery and creation, t eaching and dissemination, engagement and application, and integration, in the pursuit of fulfilling the mission and vision of NMSU. Products developed through these processes, are public, open to peer review, and available for use by others. Scholarship and creative activity can take many forms, including but not limited to refereed publications. At NMSU's community colleges, scholarship and creative activity includes scholarship that is also evidenced by professional development activities that dissemi nate knowledge to the college's learning communities. C. Acknowledgement of Land Grant Mission : This definition reflects the university's mission as the state's land - grant university, serving the needs of New Mexico's diverse population through comprehensiv e programs of teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, extension and outreach, and service. It addresses the breadth and diversity of scholarly and creative activity among faculty, staff, and students through which this mission is fulfill ed. D. Use of Technology is a Factor in Evaluation Categories : The dissemination and creation of scholarly work using technology is becoming increasingly important. Accordingly, it is important that promotion and tenure committees recognize this when evaluating a candidate's portfolio. The rapid pace at which technology changes makes it difficult to use a single set of evaluation criteria to fit all cases encountered. Technology often crosses the rigid boundaries of teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, service, extension, and outreach, and as such, it must be evaluated in as many of these categories as appropriate. Flexibility in evaluation of the candidate's technology efforts is paramount. Reviewers must be aware of expectatio ns placed on the candidate at the time of hiring and during annual reviews and are encouraged to evaluate technology - based scholarship and creative activity using appropriate criteria. 5.90.4.2.1 Evaluation of Scholarship and Creative Activity All schola rly activity and outcomes, regardless of funding source, must consider the following criteria adapted from Diamond 2: A. The activity's purposes, goals, and objectives are clear. The objectives are realistic and achievable. It addresses important questions i n the field. B. The activity reveals a high level of discipline -related expertise. The scholar brings to the activity a high level of relevant knowledge, skills, artistry, and reflective understanding. C. Appropriate methods are used for the activity, includi ng principles of honesty, integrity, and objectivity. The methods have been chosen wisely, and applied effectively. It allows for replication or elaboration. D. The activity achieves its goals and its outcomes have significant impact. It adds consequent ially to the field. It breaks new ground or is innovative. It leads to further exploration or new avenues for exploration for the scholar and for others. 2 Diamond, Robert M. (2002). Serving on promotion, tenure, and faculty review committees: A faculty guide, 2nd ed.). Bolton, MA: Ankar Publishing. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 47 of 77 E. The activity and outcomes have been presented appropriately and effectively to its various audience s. F. The activity and outcomes are judged meritorious and significant by one's peers. G. The scholar has critically evaluated the activity and outcomes and has assessed the impact and implications on the greater community, the community of scholars and on one 's own work. The scholar uses this assessment to improve, extend, revise, and integrate subsequent work. 5.90.4.3 Extension and Outreach Extension and outreach are essential to the university's mission because they disseminate information to the public; help the state by promoting economic development through the dissemination of new technologies and best practices; and serve as a basis for sustainable, community -oriented, informal education that addresses local needs through faculty affiliated with each county government in New Mexico. The central role of extension and outreach is recognized in that several principal units are dedicated to these functions. There are also numerous faculty members in other units for whom extension and outreach are major c omponents of their duties. 5.90.4.3.1 Evaluation of Extension and Outreach A. Collaborative Effort : Extension and outreach work is collaborative by nature. Faculty should provide evidence of collaboration with whomever necessary to identify local needs, g arner resources, discover and adapt new knowledge, design and deliver programs, assess clientele skill changes, and communicate program results. Collaborative effort should also include networking with other university faculty in identified areas of progr am discovery, development, and delivery, including applications to teaching and advising where appropriate. B. Evaluation Guidelines : To evaluate extension and outreach scholarship the following guidelines are recommended: 1. Faculty must provide evidence of extension and outreach scholarship in order that these [collaborative] efforts are recognized. 2. The documentation should provide evidence that the work is: a. creative and intellectual; b. validated by peers; c. communicated to stakeholders; and d. have an impact on stakeholders and the region. 3. Components of extension scholarship include: a. developing programs based on locally identified needs, concerns, and/or issues; targeting specific audiences; b. setting goals and objectives for the program; c. reviewin g current literature and/or research for the program; d. planning appropriate program delivery; e. documenting changes in clientele knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and/or skills; f. conducting a reflective critique and/or evaluation of the program; g. validation of the program by peers and/or stakeholders; and h. communication of results to stakeholders and decision makers. 5.90.4.4 Service Service is an essential component of the university's mission and requires that the faculty member contribute to the organization and development of the university, as well as provide service to any local, state, national, or international agency, organization, or institution needing the faculty member's professional knowledge and skills. 5.90.4.4.1 Evaluation of Servic e The type and amount of service that a faculty member performs should be determined in consultation with the appropriate administrator(s). All relevant activities in which a faculty member participates should receive appropriate consideration for promoti on and tenure decisions. Service contributions should be evaluated based on how they are applied and how they draw upon the professional expertise of the faculty member. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 48 of 77 5.90.4.5 Leadership In demonstrating leadership, candidates must show that they are having an impact as evidenced by the candidate's scholarship and creative activity, and by contributions to the advancement of the university which may include administrative roles in which considerable and well -documented contributions to the university h ave been made. 5.90.4.5.1 Evaluation of Leadership Leadership is characterized by: (1) contribution to the mission of the college or university and to the faculty member's profession; (2) participation in the distribution of responsibility among the membe rs of a group; (3) empowering and mentoring group members; and (4) aiding the group's decision -making process. 5.90.5 Policies 5.90.5.1 Annual Performance Evaluation and the Promotion and Tenure Process 5.90.5.1.1 Performance evaluation policies in the principal units shall include the following elements: A. A statement that Performance Evaluations are conducted annually. B. A timeline consistent with the timeline for promotion and for tenure as described in 5.90.5.9 University Timeline for Promotion and Tenure . C. The requirement that a department head or comparable administrator annually meet with all faculty members regarding progress toward promotion and tenure, the recording of objectives and goals, and the depart ment faculty evaluation format. D. An opportunity for the faculty member to submit a written statement in response to annual performance evaluations. E. A procedure for transmitting the performance evaluation, along with any supporting material, from the facu lty member to the faculty member's department head F. A procedure for transmitting a written copy of the department head's or comparable administrator's review to the individual being reviewed and to the dean or equivalent administrator. G. A procedure to cer tify in writing to the appropriate dean or comparable administrator that a meeting with each faculty member has occurred. 5.90.5.1.2 Performance Evaluation Forms. Performance evaluation forms in the principal units shall include the following elements: A. Allocation of Effort Statement: 1. The allocation percentages will be agreed upon by the faculty member and the department head, and will be approved annually by the faculty member's department head and dean. If agreement cannot be reached, the dean or eq uivalent administrator may assign the allocation of effort, and the faculty member may appeal through existing university procedures. ( See also 5.20.20 Assignments - Teaching Load ) 2. The allocation of effort statement and percentages may be altered during the year with the mutual agreement of the faculty member, department head, and dean to reflect changing circumstances, such as service on a particularly time -consuming committee or grant, time for scholarship and creative activity, emergency teaching and advising assignments, etc. 3. At the minimum, this statement shall contain the following elements: Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 49 of 77 a. Percentage of effort devoted to teaching and advising or its equivalent, scholarship and creative activity, ser vice, and extension and outreach. (The total percentage shall be 100%, but any category may be zero percent.) b. The number of semester credit hours, student enrollment, and level of courses. c. A statement of what the principal unit considers a full teaching a nd advising load. d. If the principal unit utilizes a weighting, ranking, or scoring system, the value assigned to each category must be indicated. The values must be calculated proportionately to a candidate's allocation of effort. B. Current Position Descrip tion. C. Submission from Faculty Member: A written section submitted by the faculty member detailing and citing accomplishments in relation to the criteria for promotion and tenure. D. Written Review b y Department Head or Equivalent: A written review from the department head or comparable administrator including specific commendations, concerns, and recommendations in each of the areas of performance, as well as separate comments about progress toward promotion and tenure. 5.90.5 .2 Implementation of the Promotion and Tenure Process A. Requirement for Departmental Promotion and Tenure Committee : Each department shall have a department promotion and tenure committee except as follows: the University Library, as well as the Alamogo rdo, Carlsbad, and Grants community colleges, do not use department promotion and tenure committees; rather, promotion and tenure actions in these units begin with the college promotion and tenure committee. In the Do\u00f1a Ana Community College, a division p romotion and tenure committee functions in the same manner as a department committee. B. Requirement for Departmental Promotion and Tenure Policy : Each department shall have a written policy for promotion and for tenure. This policy shall be in accord ance with 5.90.3 Guiding Principles , shall include criteria and procedures for promotion and for tenure, and shall be consistent with its college's criteria and procedures for promotion and tenure. The department's criteri a and procedures shall be determined collaboratively by the faculty and department head subject to approval by the college dean. C.

Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 58 of 77 5.90.6 Post Tenure Review (See 5.87 Post Tenure Review ) 5.90.7 Forms Relating to Promotion and Tenure See Promotion and Tenure Documents Rule 5.92 - Reassignment of Administrators/Department Heads Due to the larger scope of responsibility of most administrative positions, the reassignment of an administrator with faculty rank to a faculty position normally results in a reduction of salary. Several fa ctors are considered in making the salary determination, including the level of faculty salaries in the department where the reassignment occurs. Normally, department heads who have less than 4 complete years return to 75 percent of their base salaries (no t including department head increment), and department heads who serve 4 or more years return to 80 percent of their base salaries. Again, several factors are considered in making the salary determination, including the level of faculty salaries in the de partment where the reassignment occurs. Rules 5.94.10 through 5.94.40 - Research (See also Chapter 3 Code s of Conduct Policies ) [Amendments restructuring and revising Policy 5.94 in its entirety, as recommended by the University Research Council on 01.28.11 and by the Administrative Council on 03.09.11, were approved by the Board of Regents on 03.14.11] 5.94.10 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Research A. Research Philosophy : Research is an important component of every academic activity, and is, therefore, the source of content for quality instructional programs. New Mexico State University recognizes research as essential to the vitality of the university and undertakes the support of research as part of its i nstitutional responsibility. The mission statement expresses the importance of research as one of the university's core functions: New Mexico State University is the state's land -grant university, serving the educational needs of New Mexico's diverse population through comprehensive programs of education, research, extension education, and public service . The university promotes academic inquiry and protects academic freedom for those engaged in it. This includes the support of research and off -campus study as potentially valuable experiences for faculty and students. These experiences may take the form o f sabbaticals, internships, intensive study of specialized techniques, and conducting research at specialized facilities. These opportunities offer researchers considerable flexibility in their training and promote valuable contacts among faculty members, students, the university, industry and other research institutions. B. Protections in Research Involving Human Subjects : It is the policy of the university to protect the rig hts, wellbeing, and personal privacy of individuals participating in research proj ects, while also maintaining a favorable climate for the conduct of scientific inquiry and protecting the interests of the university. The university has established the Institutional Review Board to regulate the participation of human subjects in research , consistent with federal law. ( See 5.94.30 D . below.) All research conducted at or by the university, regardless of funding source, shall adhere to the requirements of the Institutional Review Board and the following tenets: 1. The university, including its faculty, staff, contractors and student body shall be responsible for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects. 2. No human subject involved in a research activity shall be exposed to unreason able risk to health or well - being, in order to ensure the subject's physical and mental safety and well -being. 3. All participation by human subjects shall be voluntary; no subject will be coerced in any way to participate in a research project. A request by any subject to withdraw from a research activity shall be honored promptly without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, within the limits of the research. 4. The confidentiality of information received from subjects i n experiments or respondents to questionnaires shall be protected, both during and after the conduct of a research activity, consistent with applicable law. 5. In research which involves more than minimal risk, or which involves substantial stress or disco mfort, such Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 59 of 77 risk, stress or discomfort shall be carefully explained in advance to the subject. The researcher(s) shall be satisfied that the explanation has been understood by the subject, and that the written consent of the subject, is obtained and kept as a matter of record. The researcher(s) shall be responsible for ensuring that method used to obtain informed consent (written, audio -recorded, witnessed) is the most appropriate for the participant, and for providing appropriate evidence of informed con sent consistent with the approval granted by the Institutional Review Board and with applicable federal law. 6. Research involving special subject populations (e.g., persons under the age of 18, or mentally disabled or disadvantaged persons) may be conduct ed as long as a qualified guardian signs the consent form. C. Protections in Research Involving the Use of Animals : As a land grant institution, it is the university's role to conduct, if not lead, research designed to optimize the use of animals in the service of man, and to advance human and animal welfare. Consistent with applicable law and regulations, the univers ity supports the use of animals in research, education, and as agricultural resources, provided that the usage is reasonably expected to advance knowledge about human or animal welfare. It is the university's policy to meet all federal and state standards and regulations applicable to animal use. The university has established the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee to administer policies and procedures regarding university care and use of vertebrate animals. ( See 5.94.30 Research Oversight and Risk Management E. below) Any concerns regarding the use or care of animals by the institution should be addressed to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. D. Protection of Sensitive Information . [Amendment recommended by the Administrative Council 09.13.11; approved by the Board of Regents 10.10.11] Research units, including but not limited to the Physical Science Laboratory, receive many sponsored awards in which information provided by the sponsor or generated by or in connection with the research effort may be considered sensitive: classified, controlled unclassified, and/or proprietary. Units keeping or using sensitive information should adopt appropriate procedures for its protection and train faculty, staff, and students whose positions require access to such information. All employees shall comply with applicable laws, university policy, and contractual agreements regarding non -disclosure of sensitive information. (See 3.65 Protection of Sensitive Information , NMSU Business Ethics Handbook , and the Physical Science Laboratory's Code of Ethic s and Standards of Business Conduct , p. 9.) 5.94.10 Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Research A. Definition of Research Misconduct : Research misconduct is academic misconduct, dishonest behavior, or any form of unethical practices involving an act of deception whereby one's work or the work of others is misrepresented. Other terms, such as research fraud or scientific misconduct, are subsumed within the term academic misconduct. Research misconduct is distinguished from honest error and from ambiguities of interpretation that are inherent in the scientific process. The principal element of research misconduct is the intent to deceiv e others or misrepresent one's work. Research misconduct may also involve wrongful acts or omissions relating to non -compliance with applicable law or regulation, a failure to report known misconduct or retaliation against others involved in the reporting , investigation or correcting misconduct. Research misconduct may take numerous forms such as, but not limited to: 1. Falsification of Data : Fabrication, willful suppression and/or distortion of data with the intent to falsify results. 2. Plagiarism : The use of the work of another without proper acknowledgment. 3. Improprieties of Authorship : Improper assignment of credit, such as excluding other authors, inclusion of individuals as authors who have not made a definite contribution to the work publi shed, or submission of multi -authored publications without the concurrence of all authors. 4. Misappropriation of the Ideas of Others : Unauthorized use of privileged information (such as violation of Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 60 of 77 confidentiality in peer review), however obtained. 5. Violation of Generally Accepted Research Practices : Deceptive practices in proposing, conducting, or reporting research. 6. Material Failure to Comply with Governmental Requirements : Serious, repeated, willful violations of governmental requirements arisi ng from law, statute, regulation, or agreement. Regulations include, but are not limited to, those governing the use of funds, care of animals, human subjects, and biological, chemical, pharmacological, and radiological materials. 7. Inappropriate Behavio r in Relation to Research Misconduct : Unjust and malicious accusation(s) of misconduct, failure to report misconduct, withholding or destruction of information or evidence relevant to a claim of misconduct, or malicious retaliation against persons involve d in the allegation or investigation of misconduct. B. Scope of Policy : This policy applies throughout the university system to faculty, staff and students involved in research and research -related work regulated by federal law or sponsored externally. S uch research includes, but is not limited to, research involving human subjects, vertebrate animals, biohazardous agents and/or recombinant DNA. Research projects involving the surveying of other students, university personnel, or members of the general p ublic fall within the scope of this policy, unless exempted by federal law. Academic misconduct alleged against a student generally will not be covered by this policy, unless it falls within the above scope, and will instead be addressed pursuant to the Academic Misconduct policy housed in the NMSU Student Handbook. C. Duty to Report : Individuals with a reasonable factual basis to believe that a researcher has committed an act of research misconduct prohibited by this policy are obligated to report such occurrences to a supervisor not involved in the alleged misconduct. Such reports o f suspected research misconduct shall be forwarded to the vice president for research for prompt investigation, and subsequent corrective action and reporting, if warranted by the investigative findings. If the reporter, the supervisor, or the vice presid ent have reason to suspect that a crime may have been committed, the report shall also be made to the NMSU Police or other appropriate law enforcement for a separate and distinct criminal investigation . (See also subsections I and J below.) D. Preliminary Internal Investigation : If an appropriate oversight committee (Institutional Review Board, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institutional Biosafety Committee, or Radiation Safety Committee) reports misconduct substantiated by an investigation with factual findings, this shall serve as the internal preliminary investigation. In all other cases, the vice president for research will refer the reported matter to the appropriate college dean and associate dean for research, or equivalents, to con duct a preliminary internal investigation into the alleged misconduct. The investigation will be conducted confidentially. Within twenty (20) business days from the initial receipt of the report of potential academic misconduct, the evidence and any re commended findings shall be forwarded to the vice president for research. During the preliminary investigation stage, the funding agency will not be notified, except as may be otherwise required by law or written agreement. E. Action on Results of Prelimi nary Investigation : The vice president for research shall consider the evidence and the recommended findings of the preliminary investigation, and initiate further action as follows within twenty (20) business days from the date the evidence and the findi ngs were received. 1. If the vice president for research concludes that no infraction occurred, the matter will be dismissed. This decision, including all supporting documentation, will be reported to the Office of University General Counsel. 2. If the vice president for research concludes that an infraction occurred, but was not an unanticipated problem, did not involve serious or continuing non -compliance with federal regulations or university policy , rules or procedures , and did not involve a suspension or termination of an approval granted by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president for research will refer the matter to the college dean or Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 61 of 77 appropriate vice president for disciplinary action or other admini strative corrective action, as warranted by the factual findings. 3. If the vice president for research concludes that the matter may involve an unanticipated problem, a serious or continuing non -compliance issue, or a suspension or termination of an appro val granted by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president for research shall refer the matter for a confidential formal investigation, at which time the funding agency and/or the appropriate federal or state oversight agency will be notified b y way of an Initial Report. The Initial Report shall indicate that either follow up reports or a final report, or both, will be forthcoming as soon as practicable under the circumstances. 4. If the vice president for research concludes that a crime may be implicated, the matter shall be immediately reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency for a separate and distinct criminal investigation. F. Formal Investigation : The confidential formal investigation will be conducted by an ad hoc committee to be convened and chaired by the vice president for research. The committee shall consist of the appropriate college dean and associate dean for research or equivalents, the appropriate department head, and three faculty or exempt staff members from the Uni versity Research Council, selected by the university research council chair. Substitutions, in the event of conflict of interest, will be made by the vice president for research or the executive vice president and provost, as appropriate. This formal inve stigation should be completed within two months from the date the committee is formed. The committee shall gather relevant documentation; interview witnesses with relevant testimony, including the person charged with the misconduct; preserve any physical evidence; and prepare an investigative report summarizing all evidence in the form of factual findings. The final draft investigative report shall be shared with the person charged with the misconduct, and that person shall be given a minimum of five busi ness days to respond. G. Action on Results of Formal Investigation : Consistent with the results of the formal investigation, the vice president for research and/or the appropriate college dean or vice president shall take appropriate, university - wide corr ective action to ensure that similar incidents do not recur, and shall coordinate with the Office of Human Resource Services regarding disciplinary action, if any, to be taken. H. Notifications and Record Retention : All documentation of the preliminary in quiry and formal investigation, if any, shall be maintained in the office of the vice president for research for at least three (3) years and must, upon request, be provided to authorized government personnel. The university shall comply with notification requirements imposed by funding agency regulations and agreements. I. Anti-Retaliation : In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good faith, report reasonably suspected academic misconduct in research, the university prohibits retaliation in any form to be taken against the reporter or any person who coopera tes in the investigative process. A complaint of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the initiation of a separate internal investigation to be conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource Services, and if substantiated, will be gro unds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. J. False or Unfounded Complaints : If the preliminary or formal investigative report reflects that the complaint of academic misconduct in research was not substantiated, the unive rsity will make efforts to restore the reputations of the researcher who was accused of having engaged in misconduct. Additionally, and depending upon the circumstances, the university may initiate a separate internal investigation in the event the invest igative report indicates that the initial complaint or any testimony given as part of the internal investigation, may have been intentionally falsified. If deliberate falsification of such a complaint or testimony is substantiated, it will be grounds for disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of employment. 5.94.20 Intellectual Property and Patents New Mexico State University recognizes that faculty and staff members create commercially valuable intellectual property as part of their teaching, scholarship, research, and service duties. University administration strives to foster a work environment t hat will motivate the creation and commercialization of intellectual property, by providing advice and assistance to originators of intellectual property, by entering into cost and benefit sharing intellectual property agreements with its faculty and staff , and by assuring compliance with such agreements.

The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall ensure that \"biosafety activities that fall within the responsibility and scope of the Institutional Biosafety Committee\" that are official university business conducted by a university employee at a non -university facility have been approved by the non - university facility and adhere to the university biosafety requirements. G. Radiation Safety Committee : 1. General Principles : a. The use of radioactive materials and x -ray emitting machines at the university is regulated by federal, state, local and university entities. The Radiation Control Bureau of the New Mexico Environment Department (Bureau) is the primary regulatory authorit y. b. The Bureau issues Radioactive Material Licenses and X -Ray Certificates of Registration that define the conditions for use of radioactive materials and/or radiation producing devices at university facilities. c. The university has established the Radiat ion Safety Committee to serve as a review and approval body for the use of radioactive materials on campus or for university research purposes, and to provide and enforce safety guidelines for the use of radioactive materials or sources and of x -ray genera ting equipment at the university. University employees responsible for the use of radioactive materials in their research, operations, and/or teaching (whether conducted by employees, students, or others) must submit a proposal of their activities to the Radiation Safety Committee for approval. d. No program proposed or acquisition of radioactive materials shall be initiated until the proposal is approved by the Radiation Safety Committee. All staff and students participating in activities involving radioa ctive materials shall meet certain training requirements specified in the Radiation Safety Manual , available at the Environmental Health and Safety web site, and shall work within the permit granted by the Bureau and the Radiation Safety Committee's guidel ines. 2. Membership : a. A minimum of three technical members of the Radiation Safety Committee are appointed by the vice president for research upon recommendation from the radiation safety committee chair. The members of the Radiation Safety Committee shall be representative of areas of the university where personnel are using radioactive materials or radiation emitting equipment. The radiation safety officer, a regular position of the Environmental Health and Safety Department, is an official member of the Radiation Safety Comm ittee. All members of the Radiation Safety Committee, including the chair and the radiation safety officer, will be voting members. The radiation safety officer advises the Radiation Safety Committee on every aspect of the radiation safety program. b. The radiation safety committee chair is appointed by the vice president for research and serves as the committee liaison to that office. The committee shall select a vice chair to conduct business in the absence of the chair, or in place of the chair if and when the chair has an application before the committee, or other conflict of interest. c. Members of the Radiation Safety Committee are appointed for two -year renewable terms. The radiation safety officer is a continuous position appointment. The Radiatio n Safety Committee may Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 73 of 77 also include ex -officio non -voting members who may be invited to serve when their expertise is required and can supplement the deliberations of the Radiation Safety Committee. 3. Functions and Responsibilities : a. The Radiation Safety Committee advises the vice president for research on radiation safety policy , rules a nd procedures at the university. The Radiation Safety Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all applications from research investigators and teachin g faculty whose activities involve the use of radioactive materials/sources and x -ray generating equipment. b. The Radiation Safety Committee is vested with the authority to thoroughly review and make recommendations to the vice president of research regard ing: i. qualifications of applicants requesting permission to use or supervise the use of radioactive materials or radiation equipment; ii. applicants' training and experience in the context of the plans for the work requested, including consideration of the types and quantities of materials, and the methods of use; iii. all training courses that an applicant, or first -time user, attends to overco me any deficiencies in training; and iv. efforts of each applicant to maintain exposure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) when considering the use of byproduct material. c. The Radiation Safety Committee will (a) ensure that the users justify their proc edures, exposure potential and that individual and collective doses will be ALARA; and (b) encourage all users to review current procedures and develop new procedures as appropriate to implement the ALARA concept. d. The Radiation Safety Committee will dele gate authority to the radiation safety officer for enforcement of radiation safety policies and procedures. If the Radiation Safety Committee overrules the radiation safety officer, it will record the basis for its action in the meeting minutes. e. The Rad iation Safety Committee must meet at intervals not to exceed 12 months to review radiation policies and procedures and their implementation. A quorum for a meeting would require attendance of the chair, the radiation safety officer, and the committee memb er whose field of expertise is necessary to assure all safety aspects have been addressed. 5.94.40 Responsibilities and Accountability for Sponsored Project Awards A. Administrative Responsibility : 1. Principal Investigator Defined : The principal investigator is the individual responsible for the intellectual direction of a research project and the training of graduate students. This responsibility includes the conduct of the project, fiscal and administrative accountability, and a dherence to the requirements of all relevant laws, regulations, policies, procedures and agreements. If a project has multiple investigators (lead principal investigator and co -principal investigators), they shall share the responsibility and accountabili ty for leading and directing the project, both intellectually and logistically. 2. Eligibility to Serve as a Principal Investigator : Eligibility to serve as a principal investigator on an externally sponsored award is generally limited to those regular em ployees of the university including: (a) those with faculty rank, including college faculty and research faculty as well as administrators with faculty rank such as (but not limited to) the president, executive vice president and provost, vice presidents, deans, and associate deans, and (b) research and development technical staff. There may be instances when it is in the best interest of the university to have other persons serve as principal investigators, such as temporary employees, affiliated faculty or emeritus faculty. Exceptions to the requirements that a principal investigator must have both (a) regular employee status and (b) either faculty rank or employment as research and development technical staff may be made with written approval of both th e relevant dean or director, and the vice president for research. A student may serve as a co -principal investigator, but may not serve as the lead principal investigator on a project. B. Sponsored Project Proposal Process : 1. Proposal Preparation : Proposa l preparation is the responsibility of principal investigators and their units, Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 74 of 77 working in cooperation with the Office of Grants and Contracts. The Proposal/Award Form or a similar automated system, as designated by the vice president for research, will b e used by all principal investigators and project directors seeking externally sponsored project funding. This form will be processed in the early stages of proposal development. This is a mandatory form, and no research proposal will be signed or sent ou t from the university unless this form is signed by the appropriate administrative officers or designated representatives. Responsibility for proposal preparation includes developing budgets consistent with relevant cost accounting standards and obtaining appropriate certifications, permits ( e.g., for drug use), and permissions (e.g., use of humans and animals in research). 2. Proposal Submission : Proposal submission is the sole responsibility of the Office of the Vice President for Research. Principal investigators should timely submit funding proposals through their unit to the Office of Grants and Contracts, with sufficient advance notice to a llow for their proper review, approval and submission to funding agencies. C. Acceptance of Sponsored Project Award : Award documents are received by the Office of Grants and Contracts for final review, negotiation and formal acceptance. Only the vice presi dent for research (or designee) has the authority to accept an award, negotiate and to sign award agreements related to sponsored programs, including amendments, modifications, budget changes, principal investigator changes, and extensions to existing agreements. D. Maintenance of Sponsored Project Records : Records of sponsored project awards and related certifications, permits and permissions, as well as of non -financial deliverable reports to sponsors, are maintained by the Office of the Vice President f or Research through the Office of Grants and Contracts. This includes coordinating the production, submission and retention of reports and records generated in the closeout of sponsored award agreements. Financial records of sponsored awards and related reports, invoices and financial reports, are maintained by the Office of Administration and Finance, primarily through the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office. E. Accountability for Sponsored Award Transactions : Transactions on sponsored project awards s hall be approved by the principal investigator and the dean, director, or designee of the college or other unit. The Sponsored Projects Accounting Office, in cooperation with the principal investigators and their respective units, fiscally monitors sponso red awards, reviews and prepares financial reports, and receives and disburses funds. F. Accou ntability for Property Acquired t hrough a Sponsored Project Award : The principal investigator, department head, dean or director, and university property adminis trator shall be accountable for acquisitions and dispositions of equipment and other property acquired through sponsored project awards. Any such property will be recorded on the university's inventory at a minimum, for property to which the university do es not acquire title, until the expiration of the award period. A determination as to whether title to property acquired under sponsored awards vests with the sponsor or with the university at the end of the award period should be included in the award ag reement, rather than negotiated at award termination. The university property administrator will be kept informed of any amendment to the initial determination regarding property ownership, so that the university's inventory may be updated and the necessa ry final property reports prepared. Rule 5.96 - Searches for Academic Administrators [Amend ment (FS Proposition 11 -08/09 ) passed by the Faculty Senate 04.02.09; approved by the Administrative Council 04.14.09 ; adoption of amendment ratified by the Board of Regents 09.25.09 ][Amend ment (FS Proposition 04 -09/10 ), passed by the Faculty Senate 11.05.09; ratified by the Board of Regents 02.01. 10] A. Guidelines and procedures for a search may be found in the Search Committee Guidelines , copies of which are available in departmental offices or through the Office of Institutional Equity/ OIE. B. Faculty members shall serve on search committees for academic administrative positions. They will be nominated and ele cted for this specific purpose. C. The executive vice president and provost will inform the chair of the Faculty Senate about nonacademic administrative searches, and the chair may request similar faculty representation. D. All academic administrative positi ons at the department head (or equivalent) or above level, including that of the Chancellor , require a search to be filled permanently. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 75 of 77 E. A sea rch at the department head (or equivalent) or associate dean levels may be done externally or internally. F. Searches for all positions at the dean (or equiv alent) level must allow external applicants. G. Internal candidates, including interims, are allowed to apply for any position. H. In all cases where external and internal candidates apply for the same positi on, these applicants will be treated equally. There is no assumed preference for internal applicants. I. The provisions of this policy do not limit the Board of Regents when negotiating a contract for interim president . Rule 5.98 - Tenure Track and Tenure (Continuous Contract) Amend ment ( FS Proposition 06 -08/09 ) Passed by the Faculty Senate 01.15.09; adoption of amendment r atified by the Board of Regents 07.29.09] A. Tenure Home : Tenure at the university is placed in a specific depart ment/program/community college where the criteria for each individual's tenure are established. Tenure at the community college means at the community college, not on the main campus. There is no obligation to bring the person to the main campus if the p erson's position ceases to exist at the community college. B. Initial Appointment : Excerpts from this manual regarding promotion and tenure will be presented to each new member of the faculty* prior to appointment and the faculty member's acceptance of an appointment indicates understanding and acceptance of the provisions of the contract as specified in this manual. Information regarding social security, retirement, hospitalization, disability, and life insurance will be presented to each prospective member of the faculty prior to appointment and acceptance of the conditions of employment. The patent policy for the university staff will be presented to each prospective member of the faculty prior to appointment, and acceptance of the appo intment indicates understanding and acceptance of this policy. C. Temporary Contracts (Issued by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost ): Contracts which cover an employment period of either 9 months or 12 months are issued as follows: 1. Contracts are issued to full -time tenure -track faculty members.* Full -time is interpreted to apply to tenure - track faculty members who are released no more than 1/4 time to duties other than academic and/or research programs and/or academic administration . Unless prior approval for exception is obtained from the department head, dean, and executive vice president and provost , it will be considered that all other faculty are less than full -time and occupy non-tenure -track positions. 2. Nine -month contracts cover the period from the opening faculty meeting in the fall to the date final grade reports are due for the spring semester; 12 -month contracts are issued effective July 1 and terminate on June 30 of the following year. Temporary contracts are presumed to end at the conclusion of the stated term. The terms shall be stated in contractual form and a copy retained by the university and the appointee. 3. New tenure -track faculty reporting for duty after the last Friday in September (12 -month employees) or the second Friday in October (9 -month employees) will not receive a temporary contract. Instead, the dean will prepare an agreement for the new faculty member's signature covering employment for the remainder of the year (this form to be submitted with the i nitial Personnel Action Form). The first contract will be issued at the beginning of the next contract period, which will constitute the first year of the probationary period toward tenure. *Interpreted as including all tenure -track and tenured members of the instruction staff and the Agricultural Experiment Station staff; all Cooperative Extension Ser vice state staff members; the Research Centers' staffs; and any others whom the Board of Regents may designate. D. Probationary Period : The probationary period [may also be referred to as the trial, or provisional period] (1 year at a time) for personnel with or without previous experience agreed upon from other institutions of higher education will ordinarily not exceed 6 years. At the discretion of the adm inistration, the trial period may be Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 76 of 77 shortened. Thereafter, there shall be a presumption of permanence in employment and the requirement of cause as indicated below assigned for dismissal. E. Nonrenewal of Contracts and Termination of Appointment: In the process of evaluating performance and issuing temporary contracts, it may be necessary not to renew a temporary contract. 1. During the trial period, non -renewal of the contract may be without implication of criticism or specification of cause. 2. The reason for non -renewal will be stated, if so requested by the faculty member subject to non -renewal. The reason is only to be communicated if requested by the faculty member. The choice of the manner of notification (verbally or in writing) is to be ma de by the faculty member. The faculty member must request the reason for non -renewal prior to the end of the faculty member's contract. 3. Prior to non -renewal, the department head, or comparable administrator, must consult with the promotion and tenure com mittee of the department before any recommendation of non -renewal is forwarded to the dean. The consultation is to be in the form of a meeting and the department head or comparable administrator must identify the faculty member(s) at risk for non -renewal. In addition, the department head or comparable administrator must provide the committee with all relevant information, to the extent allowed by law, related to the non -renewal. 4. Notification of the non -renewal of short -term or non -continuous appointment i s made in writing according to the following schedule: a. for faculty members in their first year of ser vice at this university - 3 months or more before the end date of their contract; b. for faculty members in their second year of ser vice at this university - 6 months or more before the end date of their contract; c. for faculty members who will have 3 or more years of ser vice at this university at the time of nonrenewal - 1 year or more before the end date of their contract. A Contract Status Form must be p rocessed by the department head for the nonrenewal of a temporary contract prior to the deadlines established for notification. The employee should acknowledge receipt of such notification by dating, signing, and returning the Contract Status Form. F. Volun tary Termination of a Temporary Contract : Any staff member who proposes to resign shall give written notice to the administration at the earliest time possible, but in no case later than 30 days after the staff member receives written notification of the terms of the next year's contract, or 3 months prior to the start of the following academic year, whichever is later, except when mutually agreed upon by the individual and the administration. The faculty member should inform the department head in writing. The department head will inform the dean, who in turn will notify the executive vice president and provost . The department head should then submit a terminating Personnel Action Form at the earliest possible date. If death is the reason for termination, payment will be made for all unused annual leave accrued at the time of death to a maximum of 52 working days of leave. If a person listed by the promotion and tenure committee does not wish to be considered for promotion or tenure, the person must so indicate to the department head in writ ing. However, if the person is in the fifth year of tenure -track ser vice, withdrawal from consideration for tenure must be accompanied by written notice of resignation effective at the end of the sixth year of ser vice (this notice to be received by the department head before the end of the fifth year of ser vice). G. Involuntary Termination of a Temporary Contract : See 5.47 Faculty Discipline and Appeal Process H. Change to Continuous Contract : The department head initiates the Contract Status Form to accomplish the change from temporary to continuous contract. All recommendations for tenure must be accompanied by notification to the executive vice president and provost from the dean of the r esult of the faculty committee vote. When tenure is awarded, it is awarded in the unit that initiated the request for tenure (continuous contract). No temporary appointment can become continuous without the official action of the university administratio n. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 5 Page 77 of 77 I. Continuous Contracts : A continuous appointment is not a matter of right, but is made after the provisional period has been completed successfully, providing the individual's ser vices are needed. Such an appointment is made by the issuance of a new contract at the time of continuous appointment or shortly thereafter, and the contract becomes the abiding instrument governing employment, except that the terms may be modified from time to time by endorsement. Continuous contracts are issued by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost following receipt of an approved Contract Status Form. Continuous contracts are not reissued until there is a promotion in rank. Each sprin g an official contract amendment (salary letter) is issued by the president 's office which informs the faculty member of final performance evaluation and annual salary for the ensuing year. Once a faculty member has been appointed to a continuous contract , that faculty member will retain continuous contract status even though the faculty member accepts appointment at less than full time. J. Transfers : Normally there are four types of transfers of faculty members within various agencies of the university : 1. A faculty member leaving an instructional/research department to serve in a different instructional/research department. Under these circumstances, the individual may be given credit toward a continuous contract for the years served in the earlier depa rtment. With proper departmental and college vote, and the completion of a Contract Status Form by the new department, tenure may be transferred with a faculty member from one department to another. 2. The transfer of a faculty member from a non -instruct ional division to an instructional division or vice versa. Under these circumstances, years of ser vice in the prior position will not necessarily count toward a continuous contract in the new position. Proven performance in the first position, under thes e circumstances, might not assure that the individual would be able to render satisfactory professional ser vice in the new area of assignment. 3. The transfer of a faculty member from the university community college campuses to an instructional division on the main campus or vice versa. Under these circumstances, years of ser vice in the prior position will not necessarily count toward a continuous contract in the new position or assure appointment in an equivalent rank. Proven performance in the community college or main campus position might not assure that the individual meets the rank requirements of the new position. 4. The transfer of a faculty member from one community college to another : Under these circumstances, the individual may be given credit towards a continuous contract and rank for the years in the previous community college. K. Voluntary Termination of a Continuous Contract : The section ab ove on voluntary termination of temporar y contracts also applies to continuous contract employees. L. Involuntary Termination of a Continuous Contract : See 5.47 Faculty Discipline and appeal Process .

We apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by this duplication. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 3 of 23 6.05 Academic Units - Creating, Reorganiz ing, Relocating, Eliminating (See also Policy 2.50 Naming Policies ) A. Definition of Academic Unit : For the purpose of this policy an academic unit is defined as a college, a department, an undergraduate major, a graduate degree program, or a library, whether these units are located on the main or a community college . B. Reviews/Recommendations and Appro vals Required : Any proposal to create, reorganize, relocate or eliminate an academic unit must be submitted for review and recommendation by the Faculty Senate, the Academic Deans Council, and the Chancellor to the Board of Regents for their consideration and action. C. Initiation of Proposal to Create, Reorganize, Relocate or Eliminate an Academic Unit : Proposals to create, reorganize, relocate, or eliminate an academic unit formally originate with a bill submitted to the Faculty Senate. The proposed leg islation shall follow the procedure specified in Faculty Senate Constitution ARTICLE IX Propositions for Consideration of the Constitution of the Faculty Senate, except that no such proposal will be considered as emergency legislation. D. Effective Date of Change : If approved, the creation of a department will be effective either January 1 or July 1 following the approval. E. Procedure for Implementation : After approvals from the appropriate authorizing bodies are obtained ( i.e., Faculty Senate, Academic De ans Council, etc.), the requesting department head/director must submit an Organization Change Request Form to the Office of Human Resource Ser vices for processing. The form must be submitted with all relevant documentation attached no later than November 30 (for January 1 effective date) and May 31 (for July 1 effective date). F. Creation of New Colleges : The creation of a new college is a decision based on the weighing of a number of criteria, including those below. An attitude of flexibility, reality, a nd organizational feasibility should be maintained in applying these criteria. The structure of the entire university, if a new college is formed, is an important consideration. 1. There should be a documented professional need for the college in the state and region. a. Rationale : This can be expressed through increasing student enrollment in programs that would be part of the new college, or an obvious need for professional graduates of the college as expressed by state and local groups who desire to hire these professions. 2. The proposed college should be of a recognized profession or group of disciplines. a. Rationale : The new college should give a desirable added professional recognition and development in the area of the new college. 3. At the outset, the new college shall have a minimum student enrollment of 250 with demonstrated ability to reach an enrollment of 500 within a 3 - to 5-year period and a sufficient number of faculty to make it a viable administrative unit within the univers ity. a. Rationale: After several development years, the quantity of faculty and students should be sufficient to lend themselves to a quality of organization, instruction, and ser vice that will provide a viable thrust to the university. The quality and quantity of the faculty in the proposed college should be capable of maintaining with distinction an academic undergraduate and graduate program. 4. The university must be willing to make the commitment to furnish financial support for an additional college. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 4 of 23 a. Rationale : This should include an adequate budget to provide for an expanding staff at the college level and funds for additional housing at a professional level. G. Changing a Department or Group of Departments into a School : The proposed school should incorporate more than one area of specialization or should offer more than one degree (may include interdisciplinary cooperative efforts or more than one department). The proposed school should be an administrative and support unit with unde rgraduates and graduate students and an established, nationally recognized teaching and research program. The administrative head of a school may be called a chair, a head, or a director, but this person's administrative level will be equal to that of a d epartment head. The legislation must contain a clearly stated and convincing justification for the name change, and must have support of the department and college faculty and administration. H. New Academic Unit : There should be a documented academic/educ ational need for the academic unit, including but not limited to, an increasing student enrollment or significant employment opportunities for graduates in that field. The new program(s) should be consistent with the mission of the university and the coll ege in which it will be located. There are sufficient faculty and resources to staff the program. I. Relocation or Reorganizing an Academic Unit : Proposals to relocate a department must meet all of the following criteria: 1. The relocation will produce a mor e homogenous set of programs and departments in both colleges. 2. The relocation will enhance the professional identity of the program or department involved 3. The relocation will not cause undue hardship for other academic units. 4. The faculty and administrators directly affected are in agreement. 5. Such a change will better serve the university community, clients, and/or the mission of the university. 6. Address the transfer of resources, courses taught, and the faculty rank and tenure (or years to tenure) of those individuals being transferred. 7. If a unit is being relocated to another college, there should be significant support from the unit being transferred and the unit receiving the transferred personnel/resources. J. Elimination of an Academic Unit : Proposals to eliminate an academic unit must meet the following criteria: 1. A significant decline in enrollment, either as measured by number of majors or student credit hours. 2. The resources are needed by programs or departments with much higher enrollm ent or student credit hour production. 3. In evaluating a proposal to eliminate an academic unit, the unit's contribution in the areas of teaching, research, and ser vice shall be considered. K. Undergraduate Program Changes : (See 6.35 Curricula Changes ) All undergraduate program changes, including those of associate degrees, will be reported by the appropriate college representative at the fall curriculum meeting of the Associate Deans Academic Council. If applicable, adequate library resources and support ser vices should be confirmed. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 5 of 23 6.10 Academic Units/Programs (Procedures for Change) (See Appendices 5 -A and B for flowcharts of both academic and nonacademic change procedures) See also Policy 2.50 Naming Policies 6.15 Articulation Agreements A. The decision to participate in an articulation agreement with another institution(s) rests with the faculty. B. For those articulation agreements that are initiated by the New Mexico Higher Education Department, the administration will appoint a representa tive to the HED Statewide Articulation Task Force. The representative will consult closely with faculty in individual departments on discipline -specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements. Department faculty must approve an y changes which affect how credit is awarded in their discipline prior to implementation. Faculty approval is not required if the proposed changes are already reflected in the Course Transfer Matrix established by the Office of the Registrar. ( See Transfer Credit in Undergraduate Catalog ) C. In cases where a change in the current HED Articulation Agreement will affect the university's general education requirements, the representative will consult closely with the General Education Committee prior to signing any articulation agreements. The General Education Committee must approve any changes affecting the structure of the university' s general education curriculum prior to its implementation. D. For those articulation agreements initiated by a university department or college, the initiating department or college will consult closely with the faculty in individual departments on discip line- specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements. Department faculty must approve any changes in how credit is awarded in their discipline prior to implementation. Faculty approval is not required if the proposed changes ar e already reflected in the Course Transfer Matrix established by the Office of the Registrar. ( See Transfer Credit in Undergraduate Catalog ) E. The Board of Regents endorses the concept of articulation between 2 and 4-year colleges and universities. At the university, the evaluation of transfer students' transcripts has been done by one central office for over 15 years. By centrally evaluating these transcripts, the majority of the problems with respect to articulat ion have been resolved. In addition, the university has prepared academic transfer guides for all two -year institutions in the state of New Mexico. To promote the continuous efficient, forward progress of students through the educational system of New Me xico, the board endorses practices and matrices which facilitate the intrastate transfer of credit and support the development and implementation of a statewide articulation plan. To this end, students awarded the Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree from an accredited New Mexico postsecondary institution will be accepted at the junior level* in baccalaureate degree - granting institutions. *Students will be allowed to register as juniors. They may be required to take lower division course work to fulfill specific baccalaureate degree requirements. This interpretation will be published in catalogs and student transfer guides. 6.16 Authorized Absences Students making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are representing the university at a university sponsored event ( e.g., ASNMSU president represents the university at legislative session, student -athletes competing in university scheduled athletic events, or educational field trips, and conferences). Authorized absences do not relieve the student of class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsorin g department. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 6 of 23 6.20 Class Cancellation Classes are not to be canceled without prior approval of the appropriate department head and dean. 6.25 Class Disruption/Interruption Any disruption or interruption of classes is to be reported promptly to the department head, who will in turn inform the dean and the dean will inform the executive vice president and provost . 6.26 Class Schedules and Catalogs A. Minimum Class Time : The minimum class meeting time is 750 minutes per credit hour per semester. A chart of minimum class meeting times follows. For more information, contact the Scheduling Office . Course Length Credit Hours Meets 1 Time/Week Meets 2 Times/Week Meets 3 Times/Week Meets 4 Times/Week Meets 5 Times/Week 16-weeks 3.0 (2250 min.) 2 hrs 30 min 1 hr 15 min 50 min 40 min 30 min 6-weeks 3.0 6 hrs 25 min 3 hrs 15 min 2 hrs 10 min 1 hr 45 min 1 hr 25 min 5-weeks 3.0 7 hrs 30 min 3 hrs 45 min 2 hrs 30 min 2 hrs 1 hr 30 min 4-weeks 3.0 9 hrs 25 min 4 hrs 45 min 3 hrs 10 min 2 hrs 20 min 1 hr 55 min 9-weeks 3.0 4 hrs 20 min 2 hrs 10 min 1 hr 25 min 1 hr 5 min 50 min 8-weeks 3.0 4 hrs 45 min 2 hrs 25 min 1 hr 35 min 1 hr 15 min 60 min Short -course 1.0 2 hrs 30 min A credit equals 1 hour of class per week during a semester. To convert laboratory clock hours to credit hours, divide the laboratory clock hours by 2. Thus a course designated as (2+2P) could be evaluated as 3 credits. (See Chapter 5, Faculty - Assignments for other p roportional credit calculations ) B. Use of the Term \"Variable\" : The term variable in the class schedules and catalogs shall be reserved for the following courses only: 599, 600, 699 and 700. C. Listing of Credits : Courses showing credits X -Y (for example, 1 -3) are limited to a maximum of 9 credits. That is, they may be listed for 1 -9 credits, but not 1 -10. Following the course description or title there should be a statement in regard to the maximum credit which may be taken for any given semester and the total maximum credits. D. Printing Format : In the printed class schedule the word variable following a course shall be applied to those courses in paragraph B. above. Courses referred to in paragraph C. a bove will be scheduled 1 -3, 1-4, etc., according to the maximum credit which may be taken for any given semester. E. Authority of Chair of Associate Deans' Academic Council : The chair of the Associate Deans Academic Council may approve the offering of new courses on a one -time-only basis if the courses are to be used in programs with special outside funding, or under the following circumstances: 1. The course responds to a special circumstance that could not be anticipated ( e.g., to take advantage of the expertise of someone hired in a professorial chair, such as the Gerald Thomas Chair). 2. The course responds to specific needs in a grant recently received. 3. Changes in certification requirements dictate immediate changes in the curriculum. F. Review by University Curriculum Committee : College deans are to urge department heads to submit to the University Curriculum Committee special topics courses at the lower division, upper division and (if applicable) graduate levels. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 7 of 23 G. Approval Authority of Associate Deans' Academic Council : Associate Deans Academic Council approval of course changes for the ensuing catalog automatically authorizes scheduling of these courses during the semesters preceding the publication of the catalog if requested by so indicating on the course change form o n the line marked starting date . H. Adherence to Class Schedule : Faculty members will meet each class at the place listed in the schedule unless they have approval from the department head to meet elsewhere. (This especially pertains to changing a class to any off -campus location.) 6.30 Commencement A. Ceremony : Two ceremonies may be held at the end of each semester, one ceremony on Saturday morning for three colleges and one Saturday afternoon for the other three colleges. Graduate students will participate with their respective colleges, but all graduate students in each ceremony will sit and be identified together. One honorary degree may be awarded at each ceremony. B. Symbolic Commencement : Candidates for degrees sign applications which clearly state that the awarding of degrees is subject to completion of all requirements and cannot be interpreted as a commitment. Commencement ceremonies for the associate degrees awarded by the community colleges will be arranged by the respective community co llege. C. Academic Regalia : Each college may approve distinctive symbols to be worn by the top 10 percent of its graduates at commencement. Only one such symbol may be worn by each graduate. In addition, the student with highest honors in each college may wear a crimson -colored gown. No other symbolic additions to academic regalia are allowed without the approval of the Academic Deans Council. 6.35 Curricula Changes A. All new courses, course changes (description, credit, prerequisite, etc.), and course d eletions are approved by the Associate Deans Academic Council, prior to being placed in the catalog or in the Schedule of Classes. This includes courses offered at the community colleges that meet for less than a full semester. A special meeting is calle d when appropriate to consider interim courses and other course changes approved for review by the chair of the Associate Deans Academic Council. Deadlines for having this information to appropriate offices will be announced and enforced. The chair is em powered to act for the committee on a one -time-only basis in the case of extenuating circumstanc es. B. Although a grade of D is \"passing\" but \"below -average\" work, it is recognized that in some courses , and sequences of courses highly cumulative in nature, b elow -average work is not adequate preparation for the subsequent courses. In such cases the Associate Deans Academic Council may approve a prerequisite specifying \"a grade of C or better in the prerequisite course.\" C. A department wishing to initiate a new course, delete a present course, or introduce changes in descriptions, credits, or prerequisites must submit the request to the cognizant dean on the NCR form designed for this purpose. (These forms, commonly called \"flimsies,\" are available in the deans ' offices.) Format guidelines for flimsies are also available in the deans' offices. D. Summary sheets, in alpha -numeric order by prefix, provide a cover list of changes. (For example, a number change BIOL 116 to BIOL 119; a title change CHEM 199, Intro. to CHEM to Elementary Chem; a credit hour change PE101, 1 cr to 2 cr; a prereq. Chan ge E T 101 to E T 112; a course deletion GEOG 206; or a new course.) Copies of summary sheets and flimsies are distributed by each dean as follows: Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 8 of 23 # of summary sheet copies # of flimsy copies AGHE 9 9 A&S 24 5 BA&E 6 2 ED 7 4 ENGR 8 2 HSS 2 2 Executive Vice President /Provost 1 1 Catalog Editor 1 1 Graduate School 1 1 Scheduling 1 1 Library 1 E. Objections to any change cited on a flimsy are resolved prior to the meeting of the Associate Deans Academic Council. If this is not possible, a written statement must be submitted to the committee chair prior to the day of the meeting. Automatic approva l of the committee will be extended to all courses for which there are no written objections. Any dispute regarding a flimsy that cannot be resolved by the Associate Academic Deans Council will be referred to the executive vice president and provost for a final decision. F. The recommendations of the Associate Deans Academic Council are reported immediately to the departments by the deans. An approved copy of the NCR form is distributed to the scheduling office, cognizant dean, and the cognizant departmen t head. Courses which have not been offered for 5 years are subject to automatic deletion by the scheduling office. Before initiating deletion, the scheduling director prepares a list of such courses, and departments may request that they be maintained i f suitable justification exists. 6.40 Course Material/Textbooks A. Course Material : Department heads are responsible for having on file a course outline for each course offered by the department. Each professor is responsible for course content and selection of required materials (textbook(s), supplementary printed material, equipment , supplies) for the course. The professor is obligated to keep course costs to the student as low as possible. The department head is responsible for the approval of bookstore requests, requests for supplementary materials, and for the coordination of re quirements for multiple sections. The department head should be cognizant of course costs to students and advise the professors should such costs appear to be excessive. B. Textbooks : All textbook orders from faculty must be channeled through the depa rtment head for signature and approval and then forwarded to the bookstore manager. The bookstore manager will review departmental requests for textbooks and order as per the department head's request. Order quantities may be increased or decreased by th e bookstore manager if previous enrollment or sales history indicates that it is necessary. Department heads must notify the bookstore manager immediately when additional sections are opened or courses canceled. Faculty will not be allowed to order and/o r sell books on or off campus without written approval from the appropriate dean and the bookstore manager. Before a faculty member may require students to buy a textbook or other material authored or coauthored by that faculty member, approval from the d epartment head is required. The department head may convene a committee of department faculty to consider the matter. If the department head is the author/coauthor of the required textbook or other material, a committee of department faculty will conside r the matter and make a recommendation to the dean, whose approval will be required. Supplementary materials, published or unpublished, produced by departments or individuals for sale to students will be sold through the university Bookstore or through other vendors who are authorized to purchase such materials from departments only, not from individual faculty members. Payment by the vendors shall be made to the department upon receipt of an appropriate departmental voucher or invoice. Faculty and sta ff members may request reimbursement from their departments for their expenses. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 9 of 23 6.45 Course Prefixes A. Proposals for New Course Prefixes : Colleges or departments may propose new course prefixes through appropriate channels to the executive vice president and provost .

Majors : New majors, including those of associate degrees, are endorsed by the Academic Deans Council, and then approved by the Faculty Senate and the Board of Regents . A major is defined as a recognized area of study in which there is an extensive and well -developed curriculum offered at the university, as well as adequate library resources and support ser vices. A major may include courses from more than one departme nt, but as a minimum it must consist of at least 24 credits in the major field, of which 18 credits must be upper -division courses. A student may take a double Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 6, Page 17 of 23 major. In this case, the student must meet all of the requirements in the catalog for each deg ree. Courses taken outside of the two major fields may be used to fulfill the conditions of both degrees. B. Supplementary Majors : In addition to a major, a student may elect to undertake a supplementary major. The academic colleges offer supplementary majors in areas where sufficient numbers of courses of a closely -related nature are available so as to constitute a significant body of study. The minimum requirements for a supplementary major are 24 credits taken from the catalog listing for the field of study, of which 18 credits must be upper -division courses. C. Minors : A student may also minor in a particular area. A minor is based on courses that encompass a recognized field of study. As a minimum, a minor must consist of 18 credits of course work, of which 9 credits are at the upper -division level. Upon approval of the dean of the college, departments may offer a minor that meets these requirements by describing it and receiving approval from the dean of the college. Departments may require that certain courses be a part of a minor and may exclude other courses. Acceptable minors are those listed in the catalog for a department. If a particular minor is not offered by a department, a student may petition for the recognition of that minor at the time of filing for a degree. If the department and the college conc erned approve, they will notify the student and the registrar to that effect. Succeeding catalogs will then list that department as offering the particular minor and the requirements that must be met. 6.84 Military Science Coordinator A.

Priorities : 1) The first priority must be student and program needs . As resources permit, courses needed by the students to complete program s in a timely fashion should be offered . 2) After student needs, continuing tenured and tenure -track faculty will have priority in teaching assignments. B. Development of Departmental Policy : Departments will have the flexibility to develop their own policies after priorities #1 and #2 above have been met. The departmental policy must be written and available to all departmental faculty and other interested parties.

The employee must hold a job other than temporary job. (The job need not be permanent.) 2. The employee must leave employment for the purpose of going on active duty. 3. The employee must not remain on active duty longer than 5 years, unless the p eriod beyond 5 years is active duty during a war or declared national emergency or active duty in support of a critical mission. Ser vice beyond 5 years required to complete initial period of obligation ser vice from which a person by no fault of their own is unable to obtain release within the 5 year limit. 4. The employee must be discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions. 5. The employee must apply for re -employment as follows: a. If the period of military ser vice was less than 31 days, the ser vice member must report to the university not later than the beginning of the first full regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day following completion of the period of ser vice plus 8 hours, after a period allowing for safe transportation from place of ser vice to residence. b. If the period of military ser vice was more than 30 days but less than 181 days, the ser vice- member must apply for re -employment not later than 14 days after mi litary service is completed, or the next full calendar day when such application becomes possible.

Injuries/illnesses sustained during the active duty period will not be covered by the university health plan. These conditions would b e covered by the Veterans Administration. 6. An attorney general's opinion, rendered after the passage of this law, points out that it does not pertain to temporary employees. 7. Dates for such leave must have prior administrative approval within the depar tment and retained with internal leave records. 8. Annually is defined as federal fiscal year. Rule 7.20.60 Leaves - Professional (Without Pay) A. Eligibility : After 3 years of ser vice and with the approval of appropriate department head and administrators, any regular full -time exempt staff member or any faculty member of regular appointment with rank of instructor or above may submit an application for professional leave without pay, normally not to exceed 1 year, for the purpose of undertaking some project that will directly benefit the university and the person's professional development. These benefits must be detailed in the application. B. Use of Accrued Annual Leave : If the leave without pay is approved, all annual leave should be used before the professional leave without pay begins. C. Non-Accrual of Leave During Period of Professional Leave Without Pay : Annual and sick leave do not accrue during professional leave without pay. D. Professional Leave Absence is Unpaid : All days, including legal holidays, in the period between the date the professional leave commences and the date the employee returns to work are taken without pay. E. Insurance Premiums Contribution by NMSU : The university will contribute the employer's portion of insurance premiums during the leave period. F. Performance Evaluation : In cases where the individual enters a contract with a state or federal agency, such agreements must provide for a calendar -year evaluation to be prepared by the appropriate supervisor in that agency and forwarded to the appropriate department head or supervisor. G. Effect on Tenure Process : Periods of professional leave without pay normall y will not apply toward the probation ary period for tenure . All conditions of professional leave without pay, including the status of the individual upon return to the university and (if appropriate) the effect of this period on tenure and promotion eligibility, must be in writing prior to t he leave period. Rule 7.20.65 -Leaves - Records Supervisors are responsible for tracking and approving annual leave, and sick leave usage for all persons reporting directly to them. The official leave tracking program of the university is Employee Self Service. The annual leave record will be forwarded with the Personnel Action Form when an employee terminates or is placed on leave without pay. Rule 7.20.70 - Leaves - Sabbatical [Amendment recommended by the Administrative Council 06.11.13; approved by the Board of Regents 06.20.13 ] Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 29 of 44 A. Purpose : The purpose of a sabbatical leave is to promote professional growth and increased competence among faculty members by subsidizing significant study and research, creative work, or some other program which is jud ged to be of equivalent value and which cannot be accomplished during the fulfillment of normal academic duties and responsibilities. All departments and colleges including community colleges are encouraged to participate fully in the sabbatical program. B. Qualifications and Options : Application for sabbatical leave may be made by any tenured full -time faculty member (above the rank of instructor) with at least 12 regular semesters of full -time ser vice at the university without a sabbatical. A faculty m ember who is in the last year of the probationary period may be considered for sabbatical leave if a favorable decision on tenure has already been made. Sabbatical leave may be taken in conjunction with earned annual leave, personal leave, or educational l eave without pay. Personal leave and educational leave without pay must comply with university policies. In instances where, for good and sufficient institutional reasons, a sabbatical leave is delayed (not to exceed 2 years), the faculty member will beco me eligible for a succeeding sabbatical leave after an equivalently reduced period. A faculty member should be given as much notice as possible if a sabbatical leave cannot be approved for the time frame requested. Sabbatical leave is available under the following options: 1. One semester at no reduction in annual salary. 2. One full cont ract year at 60 percent salary (Those within 5 years of retirement should consult the Employee Benefits Office about the possible negative impact on the retirement benefit formula.) 3. Semester II (spring) of 1 year and Semester I (fall) of the following year, at 30 percent annual salary for each semester of leave. When a person has served as both a 9 -month and 12 -month employee in the 6 -year period immediately prior to the requested sabbatical, the amount of time allotted for the sabbatical will be prorated. A faculty member employed on a continuing basis on a 12 -month contract may take a 6-month leave at full salary or a 12 -month leave at 60 percent salary. C. Applicatio ns: Sabbatical leave will not be granted automatically upon the expiration of the necessary period of ser vice. Rather, a qualified faculty member shall, normally at least 6 months in advance of the leave, submit an application and proposed leave program to the department head or chair, with evidence of research, creative activity, or other academic achievement, including publications, to support the program of work which is planned for the sabbatical period. Also, this program shall give reasonable promi se of accomplishing the major purpose of the leave. Request for a sabbatical leave should be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the benefits to the faculty member, university, and the state resulting from the sabbatical leave. For main campus facul ty, the approval of the cognizant dean, is required. For community colleges , the approval of the division dean, CAO and CEO are required. In addition to the work plan, the leave application should include: (1) a statement regarding choice of options; (2) departmental verification that during the applicant's absence, teaching, research, and ser vice duties can be managed by the department; (3) a statement concerning compensation to be received during the leave. A faculty member on sabbatical leave at full pay usually will not take other paid employment during the leave; and (4) a clear statement of the benefit of the proposed leave to the university. A person on sabbatical at 60 percent time usually will not take more than 40 percent time employment. Howe ver, it is recognized that such employment may be necessary for or enhance the leave. In such cases, a request to take compensated employment should be included in the proposal submitted and must have administrative approval. The evaluation of an applicat ion should be based on whether the planned program satisfies the aims and goals explicitly set forth in the Purpose statement above. These aims and goals may be independent of geographical location of the leave activities and, therefore, the place of the faculty member's residence during leave should be only one factor in considering the merits of the application. However, to ensure that the sabbatical experience provides opportunities not otherwise available to the main campus faculty member, the sabbat ical period will normally include a component of study/work away from the home institution. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 30 of 44 D. Related Conditions : Time toward each new sabbatical begins immediately after return to full -time service regardless of the semester of return. The sabbatica l leave will not adversely affect salary increases or promotions. Institutional participation in faculty retirement and group insurance will be continued for staff on sabbatical leave with pay. A faculty member on sabbatical leave may request, through th e department head, travel support for participation in professional meetings. Consideration will be given if the faculty member is an officer of the professional organization or is to participate in some other significant way. Educational or other leaves are excluded as time counted toward eligibility for sabbatical leave. Twelve -month faculty will accrue annual and sick leave (at 60 percent for those on 60 percent pay) and will report annual and sick leave as usual. E. Departmental Implementation : Lon g-range department plans should consider the necessity of, and provide for, temporary absences for sabbatical leave. The initial leave discussions and concomitant management of duties is primarily a matter for discussion and approval by the concerned depa rtment. However, in transmitting the final leave request to the dean and provost , the department head should provide assurance that all student needs will be served by the department during the faculty member's absence. In some departments, the absence o f one faculty member might place an undue load on the other department members. After a department has taken every step possible to plan for sabbatical leaves, it should submit its proposal to the dean for consideration. The administration will attempt t o accommodate these special cases. F. Procedures : 1. At least 6 months prior to the requested leave period (exceptions to be considered on a case -by- case basis), application for sabbatical leave is submitted to the department head on a Request for Leave Form and includes the supporting materials detailed in the Application section. 2. Preliminary approval is obtained when signatures of the department head, cognizant dean, dean of the Graduate School are affixed to the Request for Leave Form. For community college faculty, preliminary approval is obtained when signatures of the department chair, division dean, CAO and CEO are affixed to the Request for Leave Form. A supplementary contract, stipulating that the faculty member is obligated and agrees to retur n to the university to serve a period of 1 year, and failure to do so would require immediate full refund of all salary paid by the university during the leave, is prepared and sent to the facult y member. Upon receipt of the s igned supplementary contract, final approval of the leave is granted and the faculty member is notified. G. Post Sabbatical Obligations : Sabbatical leaves will be approved only with the clear understanding that at the completion of the sabbatical and/or supplemental leave, the facul ty member will return to the university for a period of ser vice of 1 year. Failure to do so will require immediate full refund of all salaries and benefits costs paid by the university during the sabbatical, and repayment for any annual leave accrued and used during the extended leave. Within the first semester upon return from the sabbatical, the main campus faculty member shall submit to the provost , through the department head and dean a full report of the research, creative work, publications, or othe r results of the period of leave. This final report should contain a brief summary of the proposal, including a review of the objectives, as well as a summary of what was accomplished. An explanation should be given in the event that some objective(s) we re not met. This report will be incorporated in the faculty member 's annual written report and may be used in the annual performance evaluation process. The dean will forward the report with both the dean's and department heads comments to the provost regarding the overall value of the sabbatical to the faculty member and to the university and indicating the extent to which the sabbatical plan was accomplished. Community College faculty will submit a similar report to the Campus President through their immediate supervisor. Rule 7.20.75 Leaves - Sick A. Twelve -Month Exempt and Nonexempt Employees : 1. Regular full -time employees shall be granted 12 working days of sick leave a year. This is prorated for half time or more employees. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 31 of 44 2. Non-regular employees are not eligible for sick leave. 3. Leave will be earned from the first day of employment and may be used as it is earned. 4. Hours worked over 40 hours per week do not accrue either annual or sick leave. 5. Employees may accrue and b ank 100 working days (800 hours) of accumulated sick leave (prorated for less than full -time employees and for any partial months by annual 9 -month employees). On July 1 every year, any employee who has accumulated more than 100 working days of sick leave will have the sick leave balance reduced to 100 days. 6. A department may require supporting documentation for any usage of sick leave any time abuse of sick leave is suspected. Any grant of sick leave in excess of 3 consecutive working days should be su pported by a medical certificate or other evidence administratively acceptable. Abuse of sick leave may be grounds for immediate dismissal. 7. Annual leave will be applied (if available) against sick leave in excess of the allotted sick leave days, but sick leave will not be applied against annual leave in any case. 8. Sick leave accrued after July 1, 2016, will have no cash value and will not re sult in a payout benefit. 9. Those employees who accrued more than 600 hours of sick leave prior to July 1, 2016 will retain the sick leave payout benefit that was in place on June 30, 2016, but only with respect to those hours accrued prior to July 1, 201 6. This sick leave payout benefit shall be referred to as a \"grandfathered\" benefit. Any employee with a grandfathered sick leave payout benefit who terminates, retires or converts from a 12 -month pay base to an academic faculty pay base will be paid, in accordance with the formula in effect on June 30, 2016, for any then remaining grandfathered sick leave benefit (calculation based on the lesser of the leave balance on July 1, 2016 or the leave balance on the date of separation). The formula in effect o n June 30, 2016 stated: payment will be made at a rate of 50 percent of the employee's straight -time hourly salary, multiplied by the number of sick leave hours accrued over 600 , to a maximum of 200. The payment may not exceed 50 percent x hourly rate x 2 00. (According to Educational Retirement Board rules, this payment will not be included in the 5 -year average salary used for the retirement benefits calculation.) 10. Sick leave will be transferred from one department to another with the employee. 11. Sick leave may be used when the employee's absence is reasonably required for the treatment of or recovery from illness or injury. Sick leave may also be used when the employee's absence is reasonably required as the result of pregnancy, childbirth, or a medi cal condition related to pregnancy or childbirth. Sick leave may be used when the employee's presence is reasonably required for the care of dependents during illness or recovery from injury. For this purpose, dependents are defined as spouse, children, or immediate family members any of whom normally reside in an employee's household and who are dependent upon the employee for support and maintenance. A physician's statement may be required to support the usage of sick leave for the employee or dependen ts. Employees on Family and Medical leave must use any available sick leave concurrently with Family and Medical leave, pursuant to Rule 7.20.45. An employee will not be compensated for a missed day from work if the employee does not have accrued paid leave available. B. Nine -Month Staff Employees : Regular nine -month staff employees may earn 9 days of sick leave a year (8.00 hours per month worked, prorated based on job FTE). Annual leave or sick leave for regular nine -month staff employees may be used only during the regular employment period they are scheduled to work each fiscal year. Leave is prorated for less than full -time eligible employees. C. Nine -Month Faculty Employees : [Superseded by Rule 7.20.42 - Faculty Care Leave.] Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 32 of 44 Rule Administrator: Office of HRS -Benefit Services Scope: NMSU System Effective Date: July 1, Benefits. 10.21.15: B oard of Regents approved Policy 7.15.05 as initial Rule 7.15.05.

Rule 7.20.80 - Leaves - Sick Leave Bank A. This program establishes a Sick Leave Bank for eligible participating university employees affected by a personal medical emergency , and who have insufficient paid sick or annual leave to cover required work absences . Only university employees who are eligible to accrue sick and annual leave may elect to participate in the Sick Leave Bank benefit. B. A personal medical emergency is defined as an unusual and catastrophic medical or immediate family medical emergency that is likely to require an employee's absence from duty for a prolonged period of time and to result in a substantial loss of income beca use of the unavailability of paid leave. C. Only those items allowable under the university Sick Leave Rules are covered by the Sick Leave Bank. D. The bank allows employees to share the risk of severe circumstances by donating to a common pool of leave. E. Members of the pool are required to enroll in the long -term disability insurance program as a protection against income loss while recovering from a severe medical condition. The long -term disability policy covers total disability after a waiting period of 135 consecutive calendar days or 100 work days. F. The maximum a recipient can receive from the Sick Leave Bank is 70 days per personal emergency with no more than one withdrawal from the bank per fiscal year or per personal emergency. No more than 70 days can be withdrawn for a particular medical condition. G. Employees would be wise to maintain a balance of at least 30 days of combined sick and annual leave to cover them during the first 30 days of personal emergency or total disability. The Sick Lea ve Bank does not provide for the first 30 days of the personal emergency; these are the responsibility of the employee and are covered by the employee's sick and annual leave or leave without pay.

Return to Work Program: The New Mexico Return to Work Program permits qualified NM ERB retirees to return to work, without limitations being placed on annual earnings or on the FTE percentage. a. For employees who retired after January 1, 2001: i. The NM ERB retiree must not work for NMSU (or any other LAU) for 12 consecutive Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 37 of 44 months; and ii. Prior to the date of re -employment, the retiree/prospective employee must have submitted a notarized Return to Work application to the NM ERB, and have received NM ERB approval, verifying the retiree's eligibility to participate in the Return to Work program. b. For employees who retired before January 1, 2001, and since that time have not voluntarily suspen ded their retirement benefits, or were not required to suspend their benefits (e.g. worked less than .25 FTE and/or earned less than $15,000 per fiscal year): i. The 12 consecutive month layout requirement does not apply; and ii. Prior to the date of re -employ ment, the retiree/prospective employee must have submitted a notarized Return to Work application to ERB, and have received ERB approval, verifying the retiree's eligibility to participate in the Return to Work program. c.

Consistent with NMSA 1978, \u00a7 22 -11-25.1 E., both the Return to Work retiree, and NMSU shall pay to the fund an amount equal to the amount of the member contributions that would have been required under NMSA 1978 \u00a7 22 -11-21 if the re -employed member had been a non-retired employee. Contributions paid pursuant to this section shall not be refu nded to the employer or to the employee. 3. Return to Work Exception: As described below, the NM ERB does not consider limited employment with an LAU to fall within the Return to Work Program. a. ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DCP retirees, may work for an LAU without satisfying the Return to Work Program requirements if the retiree earns less than the greater of (i) $15,000 or (ii) an amount equal to 0.25 FTE (i.e., 25% of the full -time equivalency) of annual salary of the position in which the retiree will work after retirement (the \"Return to Work Exception,\" a/k/a \"Greater of 0.25 FTE Return to Work Exception\"). See Rule NMAC 2.82.2.11 (B). (The earnings limit is calculate d on a fiscal year basis from July 1 to June 30). (Retirees working under the .25 FTE provision, whether from the Defined Benefit Plan or the Alternative Retirement Plan must be working .25 or less than a Full time Equivalency.) A retiree who works under the Return to Work Exception is not required to apply for the Return to Work Program and will not have to pay member contributions. Time worked under the Return to Work Exception does not qualify for the 12 consecutive month break in service or layout requ ired for the Return to Work Program. If the retiree's earnings exceed $15,000 or the retiree's workload exceeds 25% of what is considered full time employment, the retiree no longer is eligible for the exception and must return to active status and pay con tributions (non -refundable) at the rates established for active members. See Also Subsections E. 5. b. and c. below. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 38 of 44 b. As indicated above, Alternative Retirement Plan retirees may work for an LAU pursuant to the NM ERB's Return to Work Exception. Retired A lternative Retirement Plan participants who exceed the limitations of the Return to Work Exception will be required to pay contributions (non -refundable) at the rates established for active members as required by NMSA 1978 \u00a7 22 -11-25.1 (E). See Also Execu tive Director's Policy Regarding Contributions By Retirees Working Pursuant to the Return to Work Program, Return to Work Contribution . See Also Subsections E. 5. b. and c. be low. 4. Consequences for Violation of NM Educational Retirement Law: a. If a NM ERB retiree returns to employment without first completing twelve consecutive months of retirement or otherwise fails to complete other requirements for the Return to Work Progra m, the retiree's retirement benefits may be immediately suspended, and the retiree will also be required to pay the fund a sum equal to the retirement payments received while the retiree was ineligible, plus interest at the rate set by the Educational Reti rement Board. b. Retirees under the Alternative Retirement Program who return to work also must comply with the Return to Work Program or the Return to Work Program Exceptions. See Section 22-11-25.1 (E) NMSA 1978 of the Educational Retirement Act and all a pplicable NM ERB Return to Work rules, including Rule NMAC 2.82.5.15 and Rule NMAC 2.82.2.11 (B). See Also Executive Director's Policy, Return to Work Contribution . c. Before the re tiree's monthly retirement benefits will be resumed, the retiree member must certify to the NM ERB that the retiree has ceased the employment that would violate the Return to Work rules. d. If the retiree member desires to re -qualify for the Return to Work program, the retired member shall complete the required minimum break in service. 5. Additional Requirements for Re -Employment of NM ERB Retirees: a. Upon re -employment under the NM ERB Return to Work program, NM ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DC P (Alternative Retirement Plan) retirees, shall provide to the Office of Human Resource Services, a copy of the approval granted by the NM ERB, finding the retiree eligible for participation in the Return to Work program. b. Upon re -employment, and in accord ance with the state's rule on the Return to Work exception, NM ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DCP (Alternative Retirement Plan) retirees, shall be limited to less than the greater of (i.) $15,000 or (ii) an amount equal to the 0.25 FTE (i.e., 25 % of the full -time equivalency) in a fiscal year. It shall be the responsibility of the retiree to ensure that the NM ERB Return to Work Exception limits are not exceeded; NMSU will not be responsible for any administrative consequences imposed by the NM ERB in the event that the limitations of the exception are exceeded. c. NM ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DCP (Alternative Retirement Plan) retirees, who work for more than one local administrative unit covered by ERB are obligated to inform each employer about all NM ERB -covered jobs. The law requires the earnings of all NM ERB -covered jobs to be combined in the determination of whether the retiree complies with the Return to Work Exception limit on earnings and/or the 0.25 FTE. NM ERB retirees who earn more than the applicable limits or who work more than 25% of the full time equivalency (FTE), will be returned to active status in the Defined Benefit Plan, even if the retiree originally retired under the Alternative Retirement Plan . To avoid disruption in receipt of retirement benefits, the NM ERB retiree should e nsure that the salary earned and the percentage FTE worked do not exceed the limits set by the NM ERB. See Subsection E. 5. b. above. d. NM ERB retirees shall be subject to the same hiring policies and procedures as other prospective applicants, if re -employ ed, including the competitive hiring process required for certain positions. However, NM ERB retirees returning to faculty positions may only be employed as college non -contract faculty. e. NM ERB retirees who are hired in a regular or non -regular term position will accrue the same number of annual leave days per fiscal year (prorated based on FTE) as regular Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 39 of 44 employees . All earned annual leave must be used or forfeited by June 30th of every fiscal year. Retirees will not be paid any annual leave upon termination of employment with the university.

The NMSU Supervisor Accident Investigation Report form should be utilized and routed through the next level supervisor or Department Head to Environmental Health and Safety. Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the adequacy of the actions taken to avoid reoccurrence of loss within thirty days from receipt. When a more complex investigation will be required due to the nature or severity of the incident, the personnel investigating or the timelines may be extended by the Executive Director of Environmental Health and Safety in consultation with the Office of General Counsel. PART 5: RETURN TO WORK; MODIFIED DUTY PROGRAM; REASONABLE ACCOMODATION; AND INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION A. Temporary Assignment to Modified Work Duties : The university will assist qualified employees as they transition back into the workforce by providing a modified duty assignment for a temporary period as may be feasible. Modified duty assignments may require job duties outside the employee's usual job description or work unit. This authorization to assign employees to modified job duties does not require nor authorize the creation of a distinct job classification. Assignment to modify duty assignment w ill be done in coordination with the university's Workers Compensation Specialist to ensure that sound claims management procedures have been accomplished, and that legal mandates have been met. Vacant positions resulting from job related injuries or illnesses shall not be filled, except by temporary em ployment unless one of the two following situations exists: 1. If there is a documented medical diagnosis or evidence that an employee with a job -related injury or illness has reached maximum medical improvement or that the employee's impairment or condition is permanent and that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the particular job. No employee will be terminated from employment because of a job -related injury or illness or physical circumstances resulting from a job -related injury or illness unless the university has provided advance notice to the state risk m anagement division. 2. If there is a critical need and that need cannot be satisfied with temporary employment, and the employer has made a \"good faith\" effort to do so. B. Determination of Availability of Modified Work Assignment within Home Department or H ome Division : The modified duty assignment will be determined by way of a coordinated effort between the Workers Compensation Specialist, the employee's immediate supervisor, and the Dean, Vice President or equivalent or designee. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 7, Page 43 of 44 C. Determination of Avai lability of Modified Work Assignment Within NMSU System : If there is no modified duty opportunity within the home department or home division, the Workers Compensation Specialist will coordinate with the appropriate personnel in the offices of Human Resou rce Services and Institutional Equity to ascertain whether or not a modified duty assignment or other reasonable accommodation is available outside the division, within the university system under the ADA Petition for Accommodation process. D. Position Fun ding: The home department and/or division is responsible for continuing to fund the injured or ill employee's job position while the employee is assigned to temporary modified duty, unless otherwise arranged by authorized university personnel. E. Length o f Modified Duty Assignment : Modified duty assignments generally will be of less than ninety (90) days duration, but may be extended with the approval of the university's Workers' Compensation Specialist, with concurrence of the appropriate supervisor and vice president, dean or equivalent administrator. The fact that the university has provided a temporary assignment to modified job duties should not be construed as reasonable for purposes of a permanent accommodation under the ADA accommodation process. F. Consequences for Declination of Offer of Modified Duty Assignment or Other Lack of Cooperation : An employee who declines an offer of a modified duty assignment or otherwise fails to cooperate with reasonable requests or directives relating to the univer sity's efforts to accommodate the injury and assist the worker in transitioning back to work, may result in a loss of workers compensation benefits or in involuntary separation from employment based on inability to perform the essential functions of the jo b, in accordance with the university' rules and subject to the requirement to provide advance notification to the New Mexico State Risk Management Division, Workers Compensation Division. See Part 4, H. 1. above. PART 6: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES A. Employee Responsibilities : Employees subject to this policy shall: 1.

If a donor serves on the committee for which his/her donation is under consideration, the donor must be in the minority of the representation on the committee in order to avoid tax consequences. All emplo yees must have an equal opportunity to compete for bonuses and awards based on the eligibility criteria of an approved program. The Office of Human Resources will review and approve all departmental ERP's , with the exception of awards provided from donated funds. Because of the university's status as a public employer, tax issues and state regulations, rewards are defined as either a bonus or an award . Exceptions to the following guidelines must be approved by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost . B. Bonus: A bonus is defined as recognition for exceptional performance of duties and responsibilities above and beyond the normal scope of an employee's assigned duties and responsibilities.

As state employees are not entitled to receive gifts, certificates for such a wards shall be called \"award certificates\". 6. If donated funds are the source of an award, the Office of University Advancement must be consulted prior to the presentation of the award. Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 8, Page 8 of 18 7. Awards paid from restricted/unrestricted funds and donated fun ds are taxable and are processed through a One Time Payment Request.

These awards are subject to the granting agency's criteria and guidelines and will not require a central o ffice review. 8.15.15 Hardship Differential Pay [Policy approved by the Administrative Council 07.11.06 ; policy adoption ratified by the Board of Regents 09.08.06 ] A. Rule Statement : Hardship differential p ay is extra compensation occasionally paid to employees assigned to work for a fixed period of time on a specific project to meet an objective, and under extraordinary working conditions. B. Procedural Guidance : 1. Management should attempt to schedule staff and faculty such that excessive overtime and hardship to the employee is avoided; the hardship differential pay addresses those situations where this cannot be avoided. 2. Extraordinary working conditions include situations when the employee is required to work an inordinate number of hours beyond the normal forty (40) hour work week, or to work under unusually risky and/or hazardous conditions, or to work away from home thr ough a holiday. Such working conditions should not be the norm, and payment of extra compensation is justified due to the significant hardship placed on the employee during the period of time necessary to meet the work objective. 3. In order to receive ha rdship differential pay, the appropriate dean, vice president or designee and the Office of Human Resource Services must approve it in writing. 4. The amount of the hardship differential pay will be a differential over and above the employee's regular salar y, to be paid for the duration of the project. a. Hardship differential pay will be included in the calculation of overtime compensation for nonexempt employees. b. The differential for exempt and faculty employees shall not exceed their regular base rate of pay. Rule 8.20 - Compensatory Time, Overtime, and Holiday Pay (See also Chapter 4 -Hiring - Definitions -Employees Exempt ) [Amendment ratified by the Board of Regents 10.22.07] A. Employees Exempt from Overtime : Any individual employed in a bona fide executive , administrative, or exempt capacity, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, may be exempted from compensatory time or payment of overtime. Employees so exempted shall be termed exempt. All other ca tegories will be termed nonexempt. Exempt/nonexempt status will be determined by a review of the specific description of duties for the position in question. Positions having like classifications may receive different exempt/nonexempt classifications bas ed on the specific duties and responsibilities required. The Office of Human Resource Services may be contacted for information regarding exempt/nonexempt status on any position. B. Overtime Administration : A director/department head may prescribe reaso nable periods of overtime work to meet the needs of an operation. A nonexempt employee may only work more than 40 hours a week after having obtained prior approval or instructions from the appropriate supervisor. Complete records of overtime for employee s will be maintained in each department or office. C. Overtime Payment : Nonexempt employees as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act ( See Chapter 4 Human Resources - General - Hiring Definitions ) are eligible to be compensated or given compensatory time for overtime. Upon election by the employee, overtime work may be compensated in the form of overtime pay or compensatory time off. Normally, employees who are eligible for payment of overtime will not work in exces s of a 40 -hour week. To prevent a backlog, Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 8, Page 9 of 18 workloads should be adjusted by determining needs sufficiently in advance so that temporary help may be hired. The university has no contractual obligation to pay overtime or approve compensatory time. If it becomes necessary for nonexempt employees to work more than 40 hours in a week, the following will apply: 1. All regular, non -exempt, employees shall be paid for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours during a work week at the employee's regu lar rate of pay and at an additional 0.5 times for the overtime hours worked or be paid for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours during a work week at the employee's rate of pay and earn comp time at an additional 0.5 times the overtime hours wor ked. 2. When regular, part-time, employees are required to work more than their normal scheduled hours, but less than 40 hours per week, they will be paid for additional hours (at straight time rates) up to a total of 40 hours in a work week.

When temporary employees are required to work more than their normal scheduled hours, but less than 40 hours per week, they will be paid for additional hours (at straight time rates) up to a total of 40 hours in a work week. All time worked in excess of 40 hours shall be paid at the employee's rate of pay and at an additional 0.5 times the overtime hours worked. D. Holiday Pay : Any nonexempt employee required to work on one of the official holidays and who does not receive a day off in lieu of the holiday, may be compensated at one and a half times the regular hourly rate in addition to the holiday pay regardless of the number of hours actually worked during the normal work week. If compensatory time, in lieu of payment, is granted for work performed on a holiday, it shall be granted at the rate of one and one half times the number of hours worked regardless of the number of h ours actually worked during the normal work week. An employee whose normal work schedule does not include a day designated as an official university holiday may receive a day off in lieu of the holiday during the same work week in which the holiday falls. Payment for a holiday, annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, compensatory time, or compassionate leave will be considered as hours worked only during a work week in which an official university holiday occurs. Otherwise, in order to be paid at the overtime rate, actual hours worked must be in excess of 40 hours for an employee's work week. If holiday hours and actual hours worked exceed 40 hours in a workweek, calculation of overtime hours will exclude holiday premium hours already compensated . E. Overtime Reporting : Nonexempt employees eligible for payment of overtime who are required to work in excess of 40 hours per week will report overtime hours worked on the university Compensation Overtime Report at the end of the pay period. The method for computing overtime is stated on the form. F. Compensatory Time (Comp Time) : The purpose of compensatory time is to provide an alternative to cash payment of overtime. A nonexempt employee may only work more than 40 hours a week after having obtained pr ior approval or instructions from the appropriate supervisor. 1. Upon election by the employee, overtime work may be compensated in the form of compensatory time off. When such form of compensation is elected, the employee shall be paid for all hours worke d in excess of forty (40) hours during the work week (hereinafter \"overtime hours\") at the employee's regular hourly rate of pay and earn comp time at an additional .5 times the overtime hours worked. The university shall designate two (2) opportunities ea ch year for employees' to elect to receive comp time for overtime hours worked, to be effective on January 1 and July 1. 2. The date to be taken as comp time off shall be scheduled by agreement between the supervisor and the employee. Supervisory approval for the use of comp time shall not be unreasonably withheld. A supervisor may direct that an employee use accrued comp time. 3. A maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) hours of comp time may be accrued in a fiscal year. Comp time earned for overtime and re ported by the payroll deadline shall be accrued at the next regularly scheduled pay day. An employee may request payment of accrued comp time at Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU Chapter 8, Page 10 of 18 any time, which shall then be paid at the next regularly scheduled pay day. All comp time must be used or paid by the end of each fiscal year or prior to transfer or termination. 8.20.05 On-call Pay [Policy approved by the Board of Regents 10.22.07] The university may assign and employee to on -call status in accordance with the following: A.

Allocation of Monthly Interest Earnings : The monthly earnings on these pooled investments are allocated to various university accounts in accordance with externally mandated requirements (e.g., bond resolutions) and other internal designations. Nothing he rein shall prohibit separation of bond proceeds, reserve funds, or other non-discretionary funds from the pooled investment fund. The SVPAF approves all such internal designations. The allocation is based upon the monthly cash balance in each of these univ ersity funds, with the remaining balance of the pooled earnings being allocated to the unrestricted current fund. C. Percentage of Cash Balance Invested; Discretion of SVPAF : Under this method, all of these designated university funds (other than the curren t unrestricted fund) will be presumed to have 100% of their cash balances invested in the pooled investment account, unless the SVPAF determines that lesser percentage is to be utilized for a given fund.
