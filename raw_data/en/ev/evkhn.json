Links WMU's holistic health and contemplative well-being program was one of the first of its kind in the nation. It has evolved over the years with our understanding of holism. Through appreciation of research and ongoing experiences of contemplation, we seek to stay abreast of the field in offering students the best professional training and personal development available. The program equips you for career advancement in health and human service fields and provides opportunities for enrichment and personal growth. It prepares you to assess issues and implement interventions from a perspective that considers all aspects of existence. It allows you to recognize the value of self-care and the necessity of finding their own meaning for and purpose in relationships, work and life. We offer an [undergraduate minor](/holistic/academics/undergrad) and [four specialty graduate certificates](/holistic/academics/grad) to enhance work in a variety of careers or to inspire better self-care. News and Events A Mindfulness Meditation Club is meeting every Thursday over Webex at 6 p.m. Meetings are typically 30-45 mins long and include a period of meditation and time for discussions and conversations. They are a great opportunity to relax and take a break from the busyness of life, to breathe and practice mindfulness. About the labyrinth The labyrinth here at the College of Health and Human Services was built around 2014 by a Lee Honors College student for his senior thesis. It was approved by the Faculty Senate, Landscape Services, and by the dean of CHHS. Staff from Landscape Services consulted with the student during the site finding and development process. The labyrinth, located just outside the building's atrium on the east side of the building, is open for anyone to use, but it is used most by classes offered by the Integrative Holistic Health and Wellness Program. Teaching assistantships Admitted graduate students who would like to apply for teaching assistantships to teach HOL 1000 - Choices in Living should apply by January 31.
