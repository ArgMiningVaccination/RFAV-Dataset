And if you're growing herbs, you'll enjoy tastier and more nutritious home cooking as well! Culinary Indoor Herb Garden Many kitchen gardeners love the convenience of indoor herbs, as they are low maintenance, pretty and don't require a lot of space. The ideal location of your indoor herb garden is in your kitchen, where you could snip the herb and use it in whatever you are cooking. To grow indoor herbs, you need as much light as possible. Be sure to use a saucer or liner under your pot, to protect your surface and allow the water to drain. Herbs do not grow as well if the water sits at the bottom of the pot. Some excellent choices include: basil, chives, lemon balm, mint, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage and thyme.
