The list of research projects for this report was collated by auditing the online Research Governance Service (RGS) reports for new projects that were approved to commence in the 2018 calendar year, i.e. those that had site authorisation. Many projects during this time may have received ethics approval but were still submitting an application to governance, or were pending an outcome from the governance review. The list of publications was collated following detailed searches on key investigators for 2018 published works. Any publications that stated an affiliation with SMHS or a SMHS site were included in this listing. From the SMHS Chief Executive This report highlights the diverse volume of research activity being conducted across SMHS sites during 2018, and the associated research translation activities occurring via publications. During the year, there have been significant upgrades to the WA Health Research Governance Service (RGS), to incorporate the monitoring function and publications component and the migration of all pre- RGS projects. RGS now provides SMHS with a comprehensive online tool in which to approve, manage and report on our research projects and activity. SMHS research projects include sponsored clinical drug trials, national and international collaborative trials and locally initiated projects aiming to improve patient outcomes. Research is critical to SMHS and the community it serves. It is a credit to our investigators that this research often has impact beyond the local setting, with the outcomes of these projects having national and international significance for patient quality and safety or clinical and lifestyle outcomes.SMHS held its inaugural Research Showcase on the 29 November 2018; a fantastic day of 'sharing, collaborating and celebrating' research and our researchers. The event was kindly sponsored by the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research and Spinnaker Health Research Foundation. Thank you to all the wonderful presenters for giving their time and expertise to support this event and congratulations to the award winners Dr Samara Baldwin and Jocelyn Drinkwater . I look forward to building on and improving the research culture in SMHS during 2019, by involving our research community in delivering the activities outlined in the SMHS Research Operational Plan (2018-2020) , and creating a research environment in which we can all be proud. Mr Paul Forden Chief Executive, SMHS. 4 SMHS Research Report 2018Executive summary 1 SMHS Strategic Plan 2017-2020 linkThe SMHS Board has outlined research as a key enabler to deliver on its strategic priority of Excellence in the delivery of safe, high quality clinical care. 1 It is also recognised that research is a pivotal enabler of the other four strategic priorities of SMHS: \u0084Provide a great patient experience \u0084Engage, develop and provide opportunities for our workforce \u0084Strengthen relationships with our community and partners \u0084Achieve a productive and innovative organisation which is financially sustainable. This report aims to capture research activity occurring in SMHS during a calendar year. In 2018, the majority of research in SMHS has been conducted at Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH); however, a significant number of projects involve collaboration across SMHS sites including Fremantle Hospital (FH) and Rockingham General Hospital (RGH). Research activity \u0084152 projects were approved to proceed at SMHS sites in 2018; 68 of which were approved by the SMHS Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (45 per cent) \u008410 waivers of consent were granted by the SMHS HREC \u00842 projects were not authorised to proceed due to participant consent issues \u008426 projects did not proceed as they were placed 'on-hold', withdrawn or closed \u0084452 publications were sourced that have an affiliation noted with SMHS or a SMHS site. Acknowledgements This report was developed with contributions from: \u0084researchers from multiple departments as detailed within this report \u0084SMHS/EMHS Library team \u0084SMHS Communications team \u0084SMHS Research, Support and Development Unit (RSDU). 5 SMHS Research Report 2018Overview 6 SMHS Research Report 2018Research environment The research environment within SMHS has experienced several large scale changes and some exciting new developments to enable research activities and empower researchers: Research Advisory Group (RAG) \u0084RAG is an informal gathering of SMHS staff who share and present their research projects and discuss issues or concerns regarding conducting research in the organisation. This group was established by Professor Merrilee Needham as a forum for bringing staff together and collegiately resolving issues or barriers for research. SMHS Research Advisory Committee (RAC) \u0084RAC is comprised of a multi-disciplinary group of staff whose main aim is to deliver on the actions outlined in the SMHS Research Operational Plan (2018-2020) , and advise executive on research matters. Research Governance Service (RGS) \u0084RGS is the WA Health Information Technology platform that manages all Ethics and Governance submissions and approvals across WA Health. In August 2018, the monitoring component went live which ensured that all amendments, safety and annual reports are managed within RGS. In November 2018, all active projects from the old Access database were migrated into RGS, which means that all projects can be managed in one repository with the same processes. This provides a true picture of the research activity across sites and standardises and streamlines workflows. Workflow management tool \u0084In April 2018, an in-house workflow management tool was developed and implemented in the RSDU office for managing workflow tasks and queues more effectively. This system is an adjunct to the RGS system and assists the team to manage queues and priorities, rather than using Excel spreadsheets or hand written notes. The system has been extremely effective in helping the team to manage demand, communicate progress internally and externally and improve key performance indicators for approvals and amendments. 7 SMHS Research Report 2018SMHS research activity Details of research project activity in SMHS during 2018 are described in the tables below. Table 1: 2018 projects approved to proceed in SMHS Dates Activity SMHS 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018Site Authorisation approved 152 Table 2: 2018 projects approved to proceed at each site in SMHS Dates Activity FSH FH RGH 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018Site Authorisations 139 26 9 *Note that a project can be conducted across multiple sites Table 3: 2018 projects not authorised to proceed Dates Activity SMHS 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018Projects not authorised 2 Table 4: 2018 projects that did not progress ('on-hold', withdrawn or closed) Dates Activity SMHS 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018Projects not progressed 26 8 SMHS Research Report 2018Waiver of Consent 2 NHMRCThe National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) highlights in the National Statement2 that \"depending upon the circumstances of an individual project it may be justifiable to employ a waiver of the consent requirement, rather than seeking explicit consent\". In order to apply for a waiver of consent investigators must respond to Section 2.3.10 of the National Statement highlighting the need for a waiver as well as an analysis of the associated risks and benefits of the project. A waiver of consent can only be granted for low risk projects which pose no more than the risk of discomfort to participants; this does not include any novel interventional research. A waiver can only be granted by a meeting of the full HREC. The SMHS HREC granted 10 waivers of consent in 2018, as per Table 5, which is a decrease from 30 waivers of consent granted in 2017. This is partly due to the legal issues regarding consent for research that were raised across WA Health during 2018. The majority of projects that were granted a waiver of consent in 2018 all included de- identified or non-identifiable data which poses negligible risk to participants. The NHMRC requires that a brief description of all projects with a waiver of consent is publically available. Table 5: Waiver of consent projects PRN/project titleBrief description of study and rationale for the approval of a Waiver of Consent 1. RGS 777 Characteristics and outcomes of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia in Western AustraliaUses de-identified, retrospective data to examine clinical and laboratory prognostic markers for all patients diagnosed with AML at a tertiary hospital in Western Australia, to determine which are most predictive of survival in this population. 2.

RGS 812 Post Cardiac Surgery Leukocytosis - an investigation of aetiology and patient outcomesThis study seeks to investigate markers for the post- cardiac surgery inflammatory response using a modern cardiac surgery database, and the clinical implications of this. This is a retrospective observational case series. The data in this study is de-identified, but taken from identifiable patient medical records, and therefore is of low risk 4. RGS 813 Comparing on pump and off pump coronary bypass surgery and long term cancer outcomesThis study seeks to investigate if there is an association between the use of cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery and long-term cancer rates. Data will be sought as a data linkage analysis using the ANZCTS National Cardiac Surgery Database and the Australian Cancer Database. This is a retrospective observational case series. The data in this study will be de-identified, taken from database records with data linkage with the national cancer registry, and therefore is of low risk 5. RGS 848 Australia and New Zealand Emergency Laparotomy Audit Quality ImprovementThe Australia and New Zealand Emergency Laparotomy Audit Quality Improvement (ANZELA-QI) project is an initiative to provide real-time data on the management of emergency laparotomies in these two countries, to empower clinicians and hospitals to improve the quality of care provided to the vulnerable and sizable cohort of patients that undergo these procedures each year. Waiver of consent was granted with condition that every attempt should be made to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants. 6. RGS 1008 Non-iatrogenic, non-traumatic spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhoeaAims to identify the key features on history and examination in patients presenting with non-iatrogenic, non-traumatic spontaneous CSF otorrhoea in order to further characterise this growing cohort and to describe the significance of radiological imaging and biochemical markers in the diagnosis of spontaneous CSF otorrhoea.

De-identified research data is stored off site. 9. RGS 1370 Review of Australian prescribing practices of Eribulin (RAPPER STUDY BCRC122)This is a negligible risk, retrospective study where the primary objective is to determine the pattern of care of Eribulin use by medical oncologists in Australia who manage metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients, especially in relation to the line of therapy in which Eribulin is used and comparing real-world survival outcomes to published literature. A de-identified case report form is used. 10. RGS 1368 The clinical and economic impact of a preoperative anaemia and iron deficiency clinic in elective colorectal surgeryA retrospective observational study to compare hospital outcomes in patients admitted for colorectal surgery prior to and after program implementation. The specific objectives study are to assess how many appropriate red blood cell transfusions are avoidable by identifying and appropriately managing iron-deficiency anaemia; determine whether preoperative anaemia screening and management is associated with an improvement in patient outcomes; and assess whether preoperative anaemia screening and management is cost-effective. Data is non-identifiable and uses existing, routinely obtained data. 11 SMHS Research Report 2018Research showcase The inaugural SMHS Research Showcase was held in November 2018. The day encouraged researchers to 'share, collaborate and celebrate' their research achievements and consisted of three events: \u0084Breakfast Research Forum \u0084Three Minute Project Competition for novice investigators \u0084Evening Gala and Awards Ceremony. The breakfast forum, themed 'Lifestyle factors in disease management', was well attended by staff and the community. Associate Professor Glenn Arendts who spoke on 'How to stay out of my emergency department as you age' and Dr Oyekoya Ayonrinde : 'Fatty Liver Disease Risk - Traversing the risks from maternal and childhood factors', shared their extensive body of work in a collegiate and interactive session, which generated robust discussion and sparked interest in future collaborations. An expert panel consisting of Professor Bu Yeap (Chair), Associate Professor Andrew Maiorana and Nurse Unit Manager Jo Camilleri added significant input from their experiences in the areas of diabetes research, exercise physiology and staff burn-out respectively. The Spinnaker Research Foundation sponsored the Three Minute Project Competition , aimed at encouraging emerging researchers to communicate their research outcomes in a lively engaging format: 1.

As Head of Audiology at Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH) and an active researcher for the past 11 years, Dr Tavora-Vieira's work has resulted in change to internationally accepted practice, benefiting audiology patients worldwide. Dr Tavora-Vieira's research has placed FSH on the international stage in the field of hearing restoration, with the largest number of cochlear implant recipients with single- sided deafness in the world, and resulted in Therapeutic Goods Administration approval for this clinical application. \"Providing the best possible care to my patients is what continues to drive my research,\" Dr Tavora-Vieira said. \"Routinely incorporating research into my daily work has permitted me to deliver that higher level of care our patients deserve. It is an absolute privilege for me to see the results of my research being implemented and benefiting my patients. \"My research commitments are first and foremost dedicated to my patients and my team who have helped with every single research project.\"Dr T\u00e1vora-Vieira's belief in equity of health services access and commitment to evidence-based practice is exemplified by the introduction of an advanced scope audiology clinic to reduce the ENT outpatient waitlist and a telemapping service to remediate hearing impairment in remote patients. Under the care of Dr Tavora-Vieira and her team, patients have experienced significant improvements in quality of life as a result of improved hearing. Dr Dayse Tavora-Vieira's thirst for knowledge and a strong determination to provide the best possible care for her patients exemplify the SMHS vision of Excellent health care, every time.Dr Dayse Tavora-Vieira and the team. 16 SMHS Research Report SMHS Research Report 2018Projects 18 SMHS Research Report 2018Research projects Table 6 provides details of 152 research projects that were approved to commence at a SMHS site during 2018, using the site authorisation decision date from RGS reporting (RGO extract, SMHS, 2019-01-25), and data from the completed project list in SHIMS (local IT system to manage research workflow queues).

FSH medical oncologist Clinical Professor Adnan Khattak is one of five researchers awarded the Department of Health funded fellowships that will enable him to pursue research. Drugs that stimulate the immune system can significantly improve a patient's survival outcome but these medications are expensive, don't work for all patients and can cause debilitating side effects such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and skin rashes. Professor Khattak said currently there was no way of telling which patients would benefit from the drugs which can cost up to $10,000 per dose. \"I hope to overcome this by identifying predictive markers and using these to develop a simple blood test,\" Professor Khattak said. \"Blood tests are minimally invasive so can be performed regularly to monitor the cancer as it evolves and to identify the mechanisms of drug resistance.\"The study will compare how certain markers in the blood differ between patients who respond well to the immunotherapy drugs and those who don't.\" The markers of most interest to Professor Khattak are tumour cells that circulate in the blood of cancer patients and genetic defects that can be detected as certain protein expressions. \"Having a reliable means of predicting which patients would benefit from immunotherapies will not only spare many from undergoing treatments that would not help them and could even be harmful, but would also provide significant savings to the health system.\" Fiona Stanley Hospital medical oncologist Clinical Professor Adnan Khattak and patient Jane Bartlett undergoing immunotherapy. 23 SMHS Research double-blind, placebo- six-month study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sarizotan in patients with Rett of Subcutaneous vs. Intravenous Administration of Daratumumab in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple MyelomaDr Bradley Augustson (CPI) Dr Matthew Wright (PI)SCGOPHCG Other WA 507 IPATunity130: a double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized phase III study of ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel as a treatment for patients with PIK3CA/ AKT1/PTEN-altered, locally advanced or metastatic, triple-negative breast cancer or hormone receptor- positive, HER2-negative breast cancerDr Janine Lombard (CPI) Dr Hilary Martin (PI)Northern Sydney LHDFSH 511 Pilonidal Sinus Disease: Western Australia Metropolitan Health Services - Definitive Surgical Practice Preferences, Outcomes and Patient PerspectiveDr Munyaradzi Nyandoro (CPI/PI)SMHS FSH FH RGH Other WA 527 Assessment of effectiveness and side effects following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumoursDr FSH NIVORAD nivolumab and stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, progressing after first or second line chemotherapyProfessor Sankha Mitra (CPI) Dr 536 A Randomized, Double-blind, Phase 2 Trial to Assess Safety and Efficacy of Lenvatinib at Two Different Starting Doses (18 mg vs. 14 mg QD) in Combination with Everolimus (5 mg QD) in Renal Cell Carcinoma Following One Prior VEGF-Targeted TreatmentDr Shirley Wong (CPI) Dr Simon Troon (PI)Melbourne HealthFSH Other national 537 Apical pitch perception and single-sided II of Single Agent Nivolumab, Combination Ipilimumab + Nivolumab in Metastatic Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ANZUP1602)Dr Craig Gedye (CPI) Dr Thomas Ferguson (PI)Northern Sydney LHDFSH 552 Prospective Biobank of Immunological and Non-immunological factors associated with renal allograft and patient outcomesDr Ashley Irish (CPI/PI) RPH FSH Other WA 554 Long-term Outcomes of Lignocaine Infusions for PostOperative Pain (LOLIPOP) Pilot StudyProfessor Tomas Corcoran (CPI/PI)SMHS FSH FH Other WA 556 COMPARE Constraint Induced or Multi-Modal aphasia rehabilitation: An RCT for stroke related chronic aphasiaAssoc.

Professor Yates is a full time surgeon with clinical interests in arthroplasty, infection, implant design, trauma and joint preservation of the hip and knee. He has also developed an international reputation for his research and development into these areas, amounting to more than 100 journal publications and conference presentations. His orthopaedic research has been a high priority in his career, completed on top of his clinical work, in a quest to always ensure the patient is receiving the best possible treatment. \"I forever look to improve things, challenge the status quo and ask the difficult questions. This allows me to continually learn but more importantly helps to improve patient outcomes,\" Professor Yates said. A large component of orthopaedic research at FSFHG is safety studies for hip and knee implants with the prime aim of finding the best solution for patients. \"Australian orthopaedic research is highly respected globally due to our regulation requirements. We lead the way in research into implants with the majority of this work undertaken at Fremantle Hospital as the prime site for elective orthopaedic surgery for South Metropolitan Health Service,\" Professor Yates said.Professor Yates has taken his research to the next level through the design and development of more than three implants. \"These hip and knee implants are now in use globally, with another two in production. As a surgeon, I see the different needs of our patients, so it was a natural progression for me to tailor a solution.\" Infected joint replacements is one of the biggest costs associated with joint replacement surgery, which has encouraged Professor Yates and his infectious disease colleagues to develop an international study based at Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH). \"This is the biggest study we have done in our research group, with FSH being the highest recruiting site amongst the 900 cases and 22 centres involved,\" Professor Yates said. \"Finding a better treatment pathway for infected joints, which is the major complication of implant failure is estimated to save upwards of $80,000 per patient!\"Professor Piers Yates 27 SMHS Research Report 2018RGS PRNTitle CPI/PI Lead HRECSite(s) 677 Preventing Premature Entry to Aged CareMerilyn Ma (CPI) Melissa Edwards (PI)SMHS FSH 686 Focussed biliary ultrasound by surgical registrars acute surgical unitDr Oscar Aldridge (CPI/PI) SMHS FSH 700 Diabetic foot INfection LonGitudinal Outcome study (DINGO)Dr Ed Raby (CPI) Dr Laurens Manning (PI) Dr Paul Ingram (PI)SMHS FSH FH Other WA Other national 709 A multicentre, randomised controlled Trial of Exenatide versus standard care in Acute Ischemic Stroke (TEXAIS)Professor Chris (CPI) Dr Darshan Ghia (PI)Austin HealthFSH Other national 713 User experience of adult Outpatient Department Oncological services at Fiona Stanley Hospital: Exploring the ethnic minority perspectiveDr Hilary Martin (CPI/PI) SMHS FSH 715 Exploring general surgery patient's experiences to develop an individualised prehabilitation exercise program and targeted education - a qualitative studyAssoc.

The incidence of diabetes and its healthcare burden is considerable, with diabetic foot ulcers accounting for more hospitalisations than any diabetic complication. Despite best practice management, many patients still experience physical, psychological, and financial health outcomes. The study was proposed by The University of Western Australia medical students Marcel Nejatian, Blake Sanchez and Salar Sobhi, and runs in parallel with clinical care provided by the Fiona Stanley Hospital Multidisciplinary Diabetic Foot Ulcer Team. The team won the Excellence in Clinical Care category at the inaugural 2019 South Metropolitan Health Service Excellence Awards for its outstanding delivery of safe, high quality clinical care. \"This was our first experience designing and conducting a research project and at the start the whole process seemed overwhelming,\" Marcel Nejatian said. \"The easily accessible, one-on-one support provided by the SMHS Human Research Ethics Committee team streamlined the entire process, especially the ethics approval and governance processes.\" Consultant endocrinologist Professor Bu Yeap supervised the study and connected the medical students with other research collaborators.\"This study, led by medical students and supported by both hospital and university staff from multiple disciplines, highlights the role of research in improving patient care,\" Professor Yeap said. \"It also firmly cements Fiona Stanley Hospital as a centre of excellence for medical research,\" he said. The study has been an invaluable opportunity for the students to design, conduct and deliver high quality research while building relationships with new colleagues and future mentors. \"We've networked with numerous medical and allied health staff from different specialties, developed project management skills and improved our patient communication and clinical skills,\" Marcel said. \"Given our journey, we recommend anyone looking at conducting high quality research should consider SMHS - their support of the research environment is exceptional.\"Dr Emma Hamilton and Professor Bu Yeap with student researchers 33 SMHS Research Report 2018RGS 2, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Randomized Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Sotatercept (ACE-011) Versus Placebo When Added to Standard of Care for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)Assoc.

The research is led by Professor Dickon Hayne, Head of Urology for South Metropolitan Health Service, who first piloted the study at Fremantle Hospital. Professor Hayne said bladder cancer was a major public health problem with more than 2500 Australians diagnosed every year, yet bladder cancer was one of the most under- researched cancers. \"Bladder cancer is the only major cancer in Australia with a five year survival rate that has declined in the past 20 years. We are working on how we can improve these outcomes by determining the best possible treatment,\" Professor Hayne said. The trial will test whether combining placing chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments into the bladder are better than standard immunotherapy treatment alone for localised bladder cancer. \"If this intervention is effective, it would reduce deaths from bladder cancer, reduce the need for complete surgical removal of the bladder and improve quality of life,\" Professor Hayne said.\"The new combination of drugs tested in this trial would likely become adopted as the standard treatment method in Australia and internationally.\" Professor Hayne conducted the pilot study at Fremantle Hospital leading to Cancer Australia funding for the first stage of the trial, which recruited 180 patients nationally. The $1.6 million in funding from National Health and Medical Research Council, the most competitive and prestigious research funding scheme in Australia, will fund the second stage of the trial recruiting a total of 500 patients over the next three years. \"We have been working on this study for almost a decade, which shows the patience and persistence required to perform meaningful clinical trials,\" Professor Hayne said.Professor Dickon Hayne 36 SMHS Research Report 2018\"Preliminary findings support the new treatment method and this next stage will show if it is indeed the best option and will provide us with truly vital, lifesaving information. \"This trial has already established Australia's first collaborative network of urologists conducting trials in bladder cancer and we are proudly the first large scale clinical trial in this field in Australia.\" Patients will be recruited from 15 centres across Australia, including Fiona Stanley Hospital. 37 SMHS Research double-blind, placebo- investigate the efficacy and safety of Injectafer\u00ae (ferric carboxymaltose) as treatment for iron deficiencyAssoc.

Protocol ZU545102 42 SMHS Research Report 2018In Focus Clinical trials to unlock treatment for liver disease Finding a treatment for his patients is what drives gastroenterologist and hepatologist Dr Koya Ayonrinde, who has been researching non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its severe form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), for more than a decade. Leading four international clinical trials at Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH) Dr Ayonrinde has his sights set on contributing to finding a treatment to help people with NASH. NASH is present when there is inflammation and scarring of an already fatty liver that is not due to alcohol. It is a more severe form of NAFLD, which affects about 25 per cent of the population, including 15 per cent of teenagers in Perth. Dr Ayonrinde said NASH increases the risk of other chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart attack and stroke and is on the rise. \"We have seen an increase in prevalence of NASH. In the South Metropolitan Health Service catchment, the population has a high prevalence of risk factors for NAFLD and NASH, consequently rates of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer developing from NASH are rising,\" Dr Ayonrinde said. NASH is commonly seen in overweight or obese people, those with diabetes or pre diabetes, abnormal cholesterol levels or high blood pressure and is commonly associated with an unhealthy diet and inadequate exercise. Yet Dr Ayonrinde said intervention beyond lifestyle changes was needed. \"Finding a way to improve the health of our patients is critical as there is no approved treatment for NASH in Australia, yet it is a $35 billion a year disease worldwide, which is flying under the radar,\" Dr Ayonrinde said. \"One in 20 people with NAFLD will have NASH, of those one in 10 people will progress to liver cirrhosis, while about one in 250 will develop liver cancer. We hope by identifying this cohort of people early and intervening with treatment, such complications can be reduced. \"We currently have four clinical trials underway at FSH, testing different drugs to determine which can help reduce the burden of disease on sufferers and the community.\" FSH is one of the highest recruiting sites for these clinical trials in Australia, with almost 20 participants. Participants are required to undergo a pre- screening biopsy to confirm diagnosis of NASH, then take oral medication once a day. Follow up assessments and a repeat biopsy mid-way and at the end of treatment help assess for efficacy. Study participation varies between the clinical trials, but can range from two to seven years, which includes follow up visits. Dr Ayonrinde continues his quest into this burgeoning disease and is hopeful of an outcome for patients soon. \"These trials are a good opportunity to examine a disease without treatment and one that is not well understood, as we have a real potential to make a difference with later interventions.\"Dr Koya Ayonrinde 43 SMHS Research Report 2018Publications SMHS Research Report 2018 44Publications The publications listing below provides details of 452 published works by SMHS researchers, or researchers who have conducted research at an affiliated SMHS site.
