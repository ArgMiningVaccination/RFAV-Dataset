In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 19 overweight (BMI > 27 kg/m2) subjects aged 50-70 years with an impaired glucose tolerance received two four-week interventions, i.e., herbal or placebo with a four-week wash-out between interventions.

After both interventions, urine was collected to measure treatment exposure using LCMS-based metabolomics and whole genome gene-expression in adipose tissue of 13 subjects. The herbal intervention did not affect plasma glucose triglycerides, cholesterol, blood pressure or the augmentation index but showed a trend towards an increased insulin, HOMA-IR and postprandial insulin levels (p = 0.054, p = 0.056 and p = 0.095 respectively).

Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-13-00260)]. T2D has a genetic component, but lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise play an important role in the onset and one of the major determinants of T2D is obesity [ [1](#B1-nutrients-13-00260)]. Metabolic disorders such as T2D are very complex and are often the result of a misbalance in the interplay between several organs such as liver, adipose tissue and muscle. Numerous drugs are currently prescribed to treat T2D, each targeting different organs and/or signaling routes. As an example, metformin suppresses hepatic inhibit glucagon release via incretin release. Other type of drugs targeting metabolic health-associated conditions such as dyslipidemia or hypertension are also often prescribed. [2](#B2-nutrients-13-00260)]. Based on their analysis, 88 single chemical entities isolated from 72 medicinal plants have been introduced into modern therapy, many of which have the same or a similar therapeutic purpose as their original ethno-medicinal use. Some of these plant-derived compounds are still widely used as single agents or in combination formulations in prescription drugs. [3](#B3-nutrients-13-00260)]. Incorporation of coriander into the diet lowered blood glucose levels in diabetic mice [ [4](#B4-nutrients-13-00260)]. Consumption of Fagopyrum esculentum (Buckweat) Morus alba (white mulberry) leaf extract is able to lower plasma cholesterol levels in rats [ [5](#B5-nutrients-13-00260), [6](#B6-nutrients-13-00260)]. Nasturtium officinale (Watercress) may have beneficial effects on vascular function [ [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00260)]. However, almost all scientific evidence is based on results of in vitro or animal models. Some human parallel-designed intervention studies with herbs have been performed but a meta-analyses reported that due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes the authors were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the efficacy of the treatments [ [8](#B8-nutrients-13-00260)]. Another important aspect of herbal supplement use is the combination of different herbs. Where most research in vitro and in animal models has been performed with individual herbal compounds, herbal supplements available in real life are often composed of a combination of herbs. Similar to diets, a combination of herbs can be expected to target different cellular pathways and signaling routes. A powerful strategy to understand how bioactive compounds may affect cellular processes is by using transcriptomics. The general access to genome-wide screening techniques, besides the essential physiological measurements, allows the identification of affected metabolic pathways. Likewise, metabolomic analysis of plasma [ [9](#B9-nutrients-13-00260)] or urine [ [10](#B10-nutrients-13-00260)] samples can be used to check for the actual uptake of and exposure to herbal metabolites and to correlate urine metabolite profiles to T2D parameters in order to identify possible bioactives. [11](#B11-nutrients-13-00260)]. An example of such a traditional Ayurvedic herbal preparation is Mohana Choorna (MC), which is currently used for the treatment of early stages of T2D. The question remains whether these herbal treatments are really able to prevent T2D or improve clinically accepted T2D-related parameters. The use of such herbal preparations in disease treatment is therefore viewed with great skepticism by the scientific community. However, the increased usage of these alternative Ayurvedic treatments emphasizes the importance of studying the efficacy of these herbal supplements following an internationally accepted scientific approach with proper controls. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethics Statement 2.2. Subjects 2.3. Study Design [Figure 1](#nutrients-13-00260-f001)). During the 4 week intervention, subjects consumed three times a day one capsule with either the herbal supplement or the placebo before a meal. Subjects received both interventions in a random order with a wash-out period of 4 weeks between both interventions. Fasting blood samples were collected and vascular measurements were performed before and after each intervention period. Subjects were also subjected to an 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after each intervention period (Glucomedics, Beldico, Duiven, the Netherlands). Blood samples were collected 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after consumption of the glucose drink to measure glucose and insulin responses during the OGTT. We also measured vascular function 60 and 120 min after the OGTT. After both intervention periods, we collected an adipose tissue biopsy and a 24 h urine sample. Adipose tissue collection was voluntary and participants were able to participate in this study without donating a biopsy. 2.4. Herbal and Placebo Supplement [Table 1](#nutrients-13-00260-t001)). This particular mixture was selected because it was developed as a treatment for T2D and because of the potential efficacy of the individual herbal compounds described in the literature ( [Table 1](#nutrients-13-00260-t001)). Placebo capsules were filled with microcrystalline cellulose (Fagron, Capelle aan den Ijssel, The Netherlands). Both herbal and placebo capsules contained 500 mg and were identical in size and color (Fagron, Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands). Herbal supplements were screened for any potential harmful toxins (Europroxima BV, Arnhem, The Netherlands). This rapport was included in the medical ethical dossier and all tested mycotoxins and microorganisms were within acceptable levels. 2.5. Metabolic Parameters and Differentiated Leukocyte Count 2.6. Measures of Vascular Function [36](#B36-nutrients-13-00260)]. 2.7. Adipose Tissue Collection and RNA Isolation 2.8. Microarray Processing and Analysis [37](#B37-nutrients-13-00260)]. Microarrays were analyzed using the reorganized oligonucleotide probes, which combine all individual probes for a gene [ [38](#B38-nutrients-13-00260)]. Expression values were calculated using the robust multichip average (RMA) method and normalized by quantile normalization [ [39](#B39-nutrients-13-00260), [40](#B40-nutrients-13-00260)]. Genes with normalized signals >20 on >10 arrays were defined as expressed and selected for further analysis. Microarray data are registered as GSE164934 in the Gene Expression Omnibus. Data were further analyzed with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [ [41](#B41-nutrients-13-00260)] to identify regulated gene sets. Gene sets with an FDR Q-value < 0.25 were visualized in Cytoscape (Cytoscape 2.8.3) and gene sets containing overlapping genes were cluster-based on an overlap coefficient cut-off of 0.5. 2.9. Urinary Metabolomics [10](#B10-nutrients-13-00260)] and subsequently analyzed using high resolution LC-MS. An UltiMate 3000 U-HPLC system (Dionex) was used to create a 45 min linear gradient of 5-75% acetonitrile in 0.1% FA in water at a flow rate of 0.19 mL min-1. Of each extract, 5 \u00b5L was injected and compounds separated on a Luna C18 column (2.0 \u00d7 150 mm, 3\u00b5m; Phenomenex) at 40 \u00b0C. A Q Exactiveplus-Orbitrap FTMS (Thermo) was used to detect eluting compounds: the FTMS was set to detect masses at a resolution of 70,000 in negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode over a range of m/z 90-1350. Raw LCMS data files were subsequently processed in an untargeted manner using the dedicated Metalign-MSClust workflow described previously [ [42](#B42-nutrients-13-00260)], including unbiased peak picking, alignment and assembling of mass signals likely derived from the same metabolite. This unbiased processing resulted in 3498 putative compounds detected in ESI-negative mode, each characterized by a specific in-source mass spectrum, including the putative molecular ion, its isotope(s) and possible adducts and in-source fragments, at a specific retention time. The data of this untargeted metabolite profiling was subsequently used for statistical analyses to identify possible urine metabolite markers for (I) actual herbal intake and (II) T2D parameters. 2.10. Statistical Analysis [43](#B43-nutrients-13-00260)]. Effect of the intervention on the OGTT response curves was also determined by comparing the change (week4-week0) in the response curve between interventions by using the \"interaction treatment*postprandial time\" as a fixed effect. A least significant difference (LSD) posthoc analysis was performed if significant differences were detected by the model. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. [44](#B44-nutrients-13-00260)]. Gene sets with a false discovery rate (FDR) Q-value < 0.25 were defined as significantly regulated. [45](#B45-nutrients-13-00260)]. [46](#B46-nutrients-13-00260), [47](#B47-nutrients-13-00260)]. This method compresses the information in the independent variables (e.g., the urine metabolites) in a subspace, relevant to the prediction, and then performs least squares regression. 3. Results 3.1. Subject Characteristics [Table 2](#nutrients-13-00260-t002). Participants did not gain or lose weight during the study (p = 0.146) and compliance to the treatment was high; 95.3% of the herbal supplements and 96.0% of the placebo supplements were consumed during the intervention. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of volunteers based on their 24 h-urine metabolite profiles, representing nearly 3500 compounds, shows that herbal supplementation did not result in a different urine metabolite profile across volunteers when comparing placebo treatment and herbal treatment, but rather indicates large individual differences unrelated to treatment (variable directions of treatment effects in PCA) ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-13-00260-f002)). Herbal supplementation did not affect plasma levels of liver function enzymes ALAT (p = 0.218) and ASAT (p = 0.319). 3.2. Parameters Leukocyte Count [Table 3](#nutrients-13-00260-t003)). Insulin, HOMA-IR and postprandial insulin levels showed a trend towards an increase after 4-week herbal intervention (p = 0.054, p = 0.056 and p = 0.095 respectively). Leukocyte numbers were not affected by the 4-week herbal intervention ( [Table 3](#nutrients-13-00260-t003)). 3.3. [Table 3](#nutrients-13-00260-t003)). Aix and DBP decreased in response to the OGTT, but the change in OGTT response during the intervention was not different between the herbal and the placebo groups ( [Table 4](#nutrients-13-00260-t004)). 3.4. Urine Metabolites 3.5. Whole Genome Adipose Tissue Gene Expression Analyses [Supplementary S1](#app1-nutrients-13-00260)) and 7 were downregulated ( [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-nutrients-13-00260)). A large cluster, containing 113 up-regulated gene sets, was involved in inflammation signaling pathways and immune function. The individual changes in expression of the genes that were significantly changed by the herbal supplementation in this cluster are depicted in [Supplementary Figure S1](#app1-nutrients-13-00260). Other up-regulated clusters included ( [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-nutrients-13-00260)). Two downregulated gene sets were involved in peroxisomal lipid metabolism, but no genes within these gene sets were significantly changed after herbal supplementation compared to placebo ( [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-nutrients-13-00260)). To identify common upstream regulators of the affected genes, we performed an upstream regulator analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Two upstream regulators were identified after herbal supplementation compared to placebo; the BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa whereas the Homeobox protein Nkx-2.3 gene (NKX2-3) was inhibited. 4. Discussion [48](#B48-nutrients-13-00260)]. Changes in these gene sets and accompanying genes are therefore potential indicators for early disturbances in adipose tissue health after herbal supplementation. As an example, the expression of inflammatory gene sets in adipose tissue are usually increased in obese individuals, whereas caloric restriction is able to lower this expression [ [49](#B49-nutrients-13-00260), [50](#B50-nutrients-13-00260), [51](#B51-nutrients-13-00260)]. Although the outcomes are relatively consistent, to what extend these MC-induced changes in gene expression profiles are predictive for development of T2D remains to be elucidated. [52](#B52-nutrients-13-00260)], high-fat shakes [ [36](#B36-nutrients-13-00260), [53](#B53-nutrients-13-00260)] and after both low and high carbohydrate meals [ [54](#B54-nutrients-13-00260)]. These results may suggest that energy intake leads to neural- and/or hormonal-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation. 5.
