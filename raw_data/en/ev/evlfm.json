Anthropological, linguistic, and psychological dimensions of African American culture are embedded within complementary evaluations of educational controversies surrounding the teaching of (standard) English to American slave descendants, including the Ebonics controversy and its relevance to larger questions of social efficacy, and the affirmative action debate that has consumed the nation. Students will work individually or in groups to produce a major intellectual artifact (e.g., a term paper, a scholarly web page, or a project pertaining to the linguistic plight of citizens within this African Diaspora).

Anthropologists are collectively interested in studying humans from a holistic perspective, including cultural, linguistic and biological anthropology and archaeology. This course aims to introduce students to basic concepts within anthropology, integrating the perspectives and methods of each of the subfields into our approach. We will examine how culture, environment, and biology are intertwined in the variation seen within humans both past and present. Topics addressed will include aspects of human evolution and variation, non-human primates, Paleolithic cultures, subsistence strategies, kinship, political organization, the rise and fall of complex societies, religion, language, globalization, and anthropology in the present and future.

In addition to hands-on art, students will research the historical and theoretical contexts of design and art making and be introduced to a wide variety of artists. Students will hone their personal artistic styles through applied art techniques and develop their artistic voices through personal reflection and written peer critiques.

However, a career in science demands an ability to evaluate what we know in order to discover what we do not. In this course we will sharpen this skill. Students will be guided on how to read and interpret current research articles from the scientific literature. Weekly topics from previous years have included cancer therapy, infectious diseases, CRISPR, microbiome, stem cells, gene therapy, and immunotherapy. You will learn to prepare and present a scientific presentation, interpret the data, and evaluate next potential research questions. In this course, students will work in teams to work on biological problems that puzzle modern scientists. Students should have broad interests and background in biology, molecular biology, and medicine. Students should be curious, exploratory, interactive, and willing to build this unique skill required in scientific careers of all kinds. Students aspiring to be in the biomedical fields find this course very useful and inspiring.

However, integration to a common economic system must be accomplished in the context of the social, environmental, political, and cultural changes that will occur, and these must be addressed.

Is it a succession of literary movements from romanticism to realism to modernism and beyond? Is it a canon of classic texts to survey? Is it a sustained critique of that canon's exclusions, a recentering of the marginalized authors whose works reveal previously obscured accounts of modernity? It is, in fact, all of the above. In this course, we will introduce students to the central themes, forms, and forces that have shaped the history of English-language literature from the late eighteenth century to the present, and to the tools, vocabularies, and critical practices of contemporary literary studies. Throughout, we will examine the norms and assumptions of literary history, including those based in race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality. Students will encounter fiction, poetry, drama, and creative nonfiction from Britain, Ireland, and the U.S., along with African, Caribbean, or other global literatures in English. Authors studied may include William Wordsworth, Phillis Wheatley, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Frederick Douglass, Oscar Wilde, T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Claude McKay, Samuel Beckett, James Baldwin, Wole Soyinka, Toni Morrison, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, and Zadie Smith. NOTE: Satisfies one of the two 200-level requirements for the English Major.] [Description:] [Little Goody Two Shoes taught morality and the alphabet to the poor children of her village and eventually rode in a coach and six; Nancy Drew drove a blue roadster (later a convertible and still later a hybrid) while solving crimes and bringing justice to the town of River Heights. Between these two landmark characters lie the two and a half centuries of rich and diverse fiction for girls that will be at the center of this writing-intensive course. After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series\u00b4 departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine. Major genres will include mysteries, frontier fiction, career fiction, domestic fiction, school stories, and fantasy. Authors will include Newbery, Alcott, Montgomery, Wilder, Lindgren, L'Engle, and \"Carolyn Keene.\" Writing Intensive. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.] [ ] |01||-T-----||4:00P-5:20P|[Cupples II / on-ground/online course meets in-person once per week.

When comparisons are made between perceptions of hazard and actual hazard, some hazards are overperceived and others underperceived. Hazards from natural sources are frequently underperceived, since natural sources are imagined to be safe, while things that are technological in origin are seen as more harmful. This course examines both how biomedical science determines the harm caused by these materials, and the sources and impacts of these exposures.

We will use a historical perspective to explore the complex interplay between individual genetic susceptibilities and an evolving environment, where traditional metabolic signals are not always operative, often replaced by synthetic materials that the receptors have not encountered before through evolution. We will explore how sleep, food, and leisure have been changed by industrial, economic, political, and cultural developments (globalization). We will take a close look at the roles of urban planning, industrial farming, industrial food production / processing, animal husbandry, and the attendant evolving role of the family as well as the education of the individual. We will scrutinize global climate change, as it influences infectious disease vectors, pandemics, pollution, and related political and economic forces that do not promote societal health and well-being.

Conflict and war is one form of international interaction. Movement of capital, goods, services, production, information, disease, environmental degradation, and people across national boundaries are other forms of international interactions. This course introduces major approaches, questions, and controversies in the study of international relations.

To achieve these reductions, massive public policy changes must be made, including switching electricity generation from fossil fuels to wind and solar, adopting aggressive building energy efficiency standards, protecting forests and prairies, and electrifying the transportation sector. This class will teach students how to design winning campaigns to change public policy at the local, state, and federal levels to drastically cut carbon pollution. Students will be able to apply this learning in a variety of settings, including climate advocacy, clean energy deployment, public health, civil rights, and reproductive rights.] |01||M------||5:30P-8:00P|[Rudolph / 308 ](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Rudolph,+Washington+University+in+Saint+Louis%4038.649099,-90.304630&hl=en&vpsrc=0&t=m&z=16) ] [Description:] [Introduction to Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies explores the personal, social, structural, political, economic, cultural, and historical processes that shape and are shaped by gender, sex, and sexuality.
