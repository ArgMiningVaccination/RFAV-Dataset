My emphatic response is \"Yes! But before you do....\" So, what does it mean and why do you need to do one? We sometimes abuse our bodies with either too much physical activity or too little, eating the wrong foods and at wrong times, some medicines can also be harmful for the body. The human body has to process all many toxins and waste products, and get rid of them. But sometimes it can get a little overwhelming for the body, and it may need a little help. When you do a cleanse, you go on a very clean diet, and drink shakes or juices that have the nutrition that you need. Your digestive system has little work to do, and gets some rest, without losing out on nutrition. Do remember though, that every individual has unique health issues and requirements; you need to consult a qualified medical practitioner who can help you with the most suitable cleansing for you. The human body has to process all this, and get rid of it. But sometimes it can get a little overwhelming for the body, and it may need a little help. When you do a cleanse, you go on a very strict diet, and ingest shakes or juices that have the nutrition that you need. Your digestive system has little work to do, and gets some rest, without losing out on nutrition. Who can benefit from cleansing? - If you've been partying hard and had a little too much to drink - If you're feeling stressed out - If you have binged on sweets, too much sodium or junk food in general - If you're dehydrated from too much exercise - If your regular diet includes lots of caffeine, white flour and so on - If you eat well, exercise moderately and generally lead a healthy lifestyle Which means - almost anyone. So now let's take a look at the numerous benefits offered by cleansing: - It's great for your liver: The liver has to deal with all the toxins the most; and when it becomes too much to handle, these toxins are just converted to fat, and stored in your body. Yikes! Ever thought of that? When you perform a cleanse, your liver gets to relax and rejuvenate, and your entire digestive system gets to relax. Toxins are flushed out of your system, and damage done to organs like the kidneys, pancreas and so on, can be repaired. - Identify your food triggers and learn to let go: It's when you know you can eat only certain things, that your body starts craving the food that you're really hooked on to. So, when you go off the track and do a cleanse and start getting these cravings, you will be able to know what foods you crave. You can learn to not give in to the temptation, and appreciate the nourishment you get from your juices/shake. In short, you can learn better self-control, and to appreciate the small and good things in life! - Rejuvenate lymphatic system: Just as your liver filters toxins, your lymphatic system works like drainage, and is the backbone of your immune system, working to contain bacteria and viruses that cause diseases, drains toxins, excess fluids and fat. When you have a chronic disease, or if you have been leading a not-very healthy lifestyle, your immune system may be overwhelmed, and stop functioning at its best. A cleanse will definitely help it by preventing accumulation of lymph in our body tissues, and keep our lymph nodes healthy. - Bring down inflammation: When you cleanse, your inflammatory markers may start diminishing. This can help you lose some weight and/or inches. You may see improved cholesterol and blood sugar levels, better digestion, and reduction in the intensity of aches and pains, especially in the joints; you may feel happier and more energetic, sleep better and less stressed, and generally feel much healthier overall.
