This is Jessica Alba. I'm gonna put on bunny ears. Well, I'm gonna show you how I do skin prep, you know, before I'm doing my makeup. And usually after a workout, I like to put this mask on. It's a shea butter antioxidant mask and it smells delicious. I actually like to use this mask on the daily. I'll just wake up, put this mask on, and then I go downstairs and have my coffee and hang out with my kids, and I usually terrify my two-year old. You basically wait for like 10 minutes. I like to take it off with a sponge 'cause it's kind of a pain taking it off with anything else. So I'll usually use the Deep Hydration Face Cream, and do a squirt of that. A Korean friend of mine told me to beat my face, so I don't really like doing this, but she said her mom looked really young and she beats her face. So this is like, a water-based cream. So I go very liberally with this one. I like to use this little device. It basically just like, gets the blood flowing. So that's that. And then if you really wanna double-whammy it, do this bad boy. And this one you can even feel like, warm up on your face and sometimes my face gets like, a little bit red. [Jessica babbling] And then just wiping in the rest. So, I usually put on an eye mask. I like these because they're like a bio-cellulose. Yeah. Yeah, and all of the skincare products that I use are clean. And why I'm so passionate about it is because I have such reactive skin. And I've had such reactive skin literally since I was born. I just really seek out products that are, for the most part, fragrance-free and then looking for products that don't have parabens, don't have petroleum-based ingredients, things like that, because I'm actually allergic to a lot of petroleum-based ingredients. I'm doing this lip scrub. I find that when I'm tired and I have a lower immune system, my skin rashes come out more when I'm not sleeping. And I've been shooting a TV show and I have not been sleeping very well. Champagne problems, right? So I just scrub, scrub-a-dub. So I think you should just put a balm on after, like immediately after. That is my skin prep. I think it's important, whether you have kids or not, as a woman in the world, trying to do the things, get your hustle on, wearing all the hats. I think it's important that we take time to take care of ourselves, and if you can do that on the daily, even if it's for like, 10 minutes, it's important, and don't let anyone take that away from you. Hi, everyone. I just wear these nice fluffy bunny ears because it doesn't crease my hair. I am going to do a diffused smokey eye. I feel like this looks good on everybody. It's a great day-to-night thing, 'cause you can just take your sort of like, makeup-no-makeup look and if you add that eye, you can transform your look to night, and still have a nude lip so you can smooch. I like to use two primers. So this is the Glow primer and I learned this from a makeup artist named Daniel Martin. Basically I put the Matte primer everywhere where I wanna be matte underneath, and I put the Glow primer everywhere I want to glow. So I want to be matte here, here, sides of my nose, eyelid. And you might be wondering why I still have my eye mask on. What's nice about having an eye mask on while you're doing your makeup is it can catch the fallout from your eyeshadow when you're doing a smokey eye. And then I put the Glow primer everywhere where I wanna glow. And some people just skip primers, but, cool. I'm just gonna brush my eyebrows up. I've done microblading with my eyebrows. Brows are a big thing and they frame your face. I always kind of brush them before I start. This is the nice neutral palette, and what I like is it has this really good bone color, or ivory. And I first apply it with my finger, and then get like, a fluffy brush. I used to be really intimidated with doing my own eyeshadow and then I learned that all you had to do was have like, a really good fluffy brush and you can buff out all your mistakes. I'm gonna go in with this like, pretty unassuming, it's just like a brown. So I'm gonna put that all over the lid. So the more, kind of, just buffed out and diffused, the better. So you don't have to worry about being so, so perfect. There are these really pretty eye tints. Like a blush-y. So I'm gonna do that just along the line in here. And then there's this other one called 23. So this one I'm doing right above the other one. I'm just putting it along the lid, but I do the lighter one closer to the lash line and then the darker one above it. So pretty. [clicks tongue] This is when you're trying to be extra, this palette is for you. Basically all the colors are really beautiful, but a little goes a long way. Gold color, I'm gonna mix it with this like, brown-ish color. And I'm gonna do just the corner here and then go underneath, and create kind of like that wing, see? And then I end it sort of halfway through. And I'm gonna do the same on the other side. It's always really stressful to try and get both sides the same. I'll start with the wing and just underneath. I learned how to do my makeup from, seriously, watching my mom, 'cause my mom couldn't wait to put on a full face. I mean, even just to go to the grocery store. I'm gonna use the Dior here. I'm gonna go with this bronzy color. This guy, very shimmery. Shimmery, shimmery, shimmery. And I'm gonna blend out on my lid over here. And so now I'm gonna take off. Now this, don't judge me, just watch and learn. I'm gonna do the contour. So I like to use a darker foundation for contour, and this is a cream foundation but it's also can be used as a concealer, foundation. And I just go in where I would normally do a contour. And so the lighter color in the cream foundation I'm gonna put under my eyes. And it doesn't really need to be blended out at all. For some reason, my face stays longer when I do this. Then I go in with the CCC, it's like a SPF, like a tinted moisturizer. It's like, makeup with skincare benefits. And then I go in and go to town. And you just go right over everywhere. So when I was working as an actress full-time, I had piles and piles of makeup on my face all day long. I was on lots of prescription medicine, actually, for acne. And it's also because there really wasn't a makeup brand that was clean that I could use on my skin. And then when I became a mom and I stopped acting full-time, and they say that your daughters take your beauty away from you, well, they did. So I cried a lot and I became best friends with my esthetician, 'cause I basically saw her every other day. I like these little concealer pens. I'm gonna just put that underneath my eyes. And then get my powder. I like this translucent powder, and I get like, a fluffy brush. Get off all the excess and I just like to powder where I don't want that shine, instead of doing the whole face. So you still have that glow skin, ya know what I mean? Bronzer. That's me taking all the extra bits. And just go around where I contoured before. I always bring it down into the neck, 'cause there's nothing worse than when it just stops right there, you know? Get a fluffy brush, see how that's like a little weird, and that one's good? Buff it for the gods. There we go. Okay, so now I'm gonna press in this concealer. So, eyebrows. Even though I've gotten my eyebrows microbladed, I still have little bits and bobs that need to be filled in. I usually start from the outside, and I like this one 'cause it has the brush on one side and the pencil on the other. There we go. Okay, so, there's this Marc Jacobs pencil. So I'm gonna go into my lash line with that. So I've already done the other shimmer and I'm just gonna dot it, but the key is to just get it as close to the lash line as possible. And on the bottom I only take it halfway. Okay. Curling your lashes is everything. I like to use this Tweezerman one. It just really works well. And I always use a primer. So what's cool about this one is you have the primer on one side, mascara on the other, and it works so well with people with super-sensitive eyes, like me. I always blink through the wand. Why not use some eyedrops? I like to use these LUMIFY ones. I'm gonna go in on the bottom lashes. Blink through the wand. I remember watching my mom. I'd always be like, What is she doing? She'd be like. Look at that pretty, fluffy brush. Creme Blush. And just put a little bit where you would naturally flush. So you go like this. Just right there on the apples of your cheeks. So, long-wear lip. I'm gonna do the lighter one on the outside, and you can even go a little bit outside your lip line if you wanna give the illusion of a fuller lip. I like to smudge it like that. Go in with a little bit darker nude and just put it in the middle. And maybe I'll put a little bit of powder under my eyes. Don't like to do a ton of powder but just a little. The Magic Balm just here. So you still have the matte lip on the outside, but on the inside you just have like, a little hint. And there we go. All done. Bye.
