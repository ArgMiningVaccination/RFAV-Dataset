He was also the prime minister of Greece from July 2019 to May 2023. On 25 June 2023, Mitsotakis won a second term as prime minister after a historic victory for his [New Democracy](/wiki/New_Democracy_(Greece)) party, [[1]](#cite_note-1) for which he has served as president since 2016. Mitsotakis previously was [Leader of the Opposition](/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Greece)) from 2016 to 2019, and [Minister of Administrative Reform](/wiki/Ministry_of_Digital_Governance_(Greece)) from 2013 to 2015.

[[3]](#cite_note-:102-3) [[4]](#cite_note-:112-4) He has been credited with the modernization and digital transformation of the country's public administration, [[5]](#cite_note-5) and has been remarked for his overall management of the Greek economy, with Greece being named the Top Economic Performer for 2022 by [The Economist](/wiki/The_Economist), [[6]](#cite_note-:132-6) which was in particular due to Greece in 2022 being able to repay ahead of schedule 2.7 billion euros ($2.87 billion) of loans owed to [Eurozone](/wiki/Eurozone) countries under the first bailout it received during its [decade-long debt crisis](/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis), along with being on the verge of reaching investment-grade rating.

[[10]](#cite_note-10) Additionally, Mitsotakis has received criticism for heightened corruption during his term, [[11]](#cite_note-:152-11) [[12]](#cite_note-:23-12) as well as a deterioration of [freedom of the press](/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press) in [Greece](/wiki/Greece).

On 24 May 2023, as required by Greece's constitution, [President](/wiki/President_of_Greece) [Katerina Sakellaropoulou](/wiki/Katerina_Sakellaropoulou) appointed [Ioannis Sarmas](/wiki/Ioannis_Sarmas) to [caretaker prime minister](/wiki/Caretaker_government) for the interim period. [[18]](#cite_note-18) One month later he once again led his party to a majority in the [June 2023 Greek legislative election](/wiki/June_2023_Greek_legislative_election) and was sworn in as prime minister receiving the order to form a government by the President.

At the time of his birth, his family had been placed under house arrest by the [Greek military junta](/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967%E2%80%931974) that had declared his father [persona non grata](/wiki/Persona_non_grata) and imprisoned him on the night of the coup. [[22]](#cite_note-22) In 1968, when he was six months old, the family escaped to [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey) with the help of [Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Turkey)) [hsan Sabri \u00c7alayangil](/wiki/%C4%B0hsan_Sabri_%C3%87a%C4%9Flayangil). After a while, they moved from Turkey to Paris and waited until 1974 to return to Greece after [democracy had been restored](/wiki/Metapolitefsi). [[23]](#cite_note-23) Mitsotakis controversially described the first six months of his life as [political imprisonment](/wiki/Political_prisoner). [[24]](#cite_note-24) [[12]](#cite_note-:23-12) In 1986, Mitsotakis graduated from [Athens College](/wiki/Athens_College). From 1986 to 1990, he attended [Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University) and earned a bachelor's degree in [social studies](/wiki/Social_studies), receiving the [Hoopes Prize](/wiki/Thomas_T._Hoopes_Prize). Later, his senior thesis was published as a book titled \u00abThe Pitfalls of Foreign Policy\u00bb receiving mixed reviews. [[25]](#cite_note-25) [[26]](#cite_note-26) From 1992 to 1993, he attended [Stanford University](/wiki/Stanford_University), earning a [Ford Dorsey Master's in International Policy](/wiki/Ford_Dorsey_Master%27s_in_International_Policy).

[[27]](#cite_note-Concordia-27) Professional career[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] From 1990 to 1991 Kyriakos Mitsotakis worked as a [financial analyst](/wiki/Financial_analyst) at the [corporate finance](/wiki/Corporate_finance) division of [Chase Bank](/wiki/Chase_Bank) in London. From 1991 to 1992, Mitsotakis returned to Greece and joined the [Hellenic Army](/wiki/Hellenic_Army) to fulfil his mandatory [national service](/wiki/Conscription_in_Greece) obligations. From 1995 to 1997, and following the completion of his post-graduate studies, he was employed by the consultancy [McKinsey & Company](/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company) in London, focusing primarily on the telecommunications and [financial services](/wiki/Financial_services) industries. From 1997 to 1999 he worked for Alpha Ventures, a [private equity](/wiki/Private_equity) subsidiary of [Alpha Bank](/wiki/Alpha_Bank), as a senior investment officer, executing venture capital and private equity transactions. In 1999 he founded NBG Venture Capital, the private equity and venture capital subsidiary of the [National Bank of Greece](/wiki/National_Bank_of_Greece), and acted as its CEO, managing its portfolio and executing transactions in Greece and the [Balkans](/wiki/Balkans), until April 2003, when he resigned to pursue a career in politics. [[27]](#cite_note-Concordia-27) In January 2003, he was nominated by the [World Economic Forum](/wiki/World_Economic_Forum) as a global leader of tomorrow. [[28]](#cite_note-28) Political career[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] During the [2000 legislative election](/wiki/2000_Greek_legislative_election), Mitsotakis worked for New Democracy's national campaign. In the [2004 legislative election](/wiki/2004_Greek_legislative_election), Mitsotakis ran in the [Athens B](/wiki/Athens_B_(constituency)) constituency, receiving more votes than any other New Democracy candidate in the country and was elected to the [Hellenic Parliament](/wiki/Hellenic_Parliament).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Mitsotakis is honorary president of Konstantinos K. Mitsotakis Foundation, aiming at promoting the life and works of [Konstantinos Mitsotakis](/wiki/Konstantinos_Mitsotakis) and at reporting the modern political history of Greece.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] On 24 June 2013, Mitsotakis was appointed as the [Minister of Administrative Reform and e-Governance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Administrative_Reform_and_e-Governance_(Greece)) in [Antonis Samaras](/wiki/Antonis_Samaras)' cabinet, succeeding [Antonis Manitakis](/wiki/Antonis_Manitakis). He served in this position until January 2015. During this time, he pursued comprehensive national reforms by implementing a functional reorganization of institutions, structures and processes. He steadfastly supported the drastic downsizing of the [Public Sector](/wiki/Public_Sector) and the structural reform of the tax administration. In 2015, Mitsotakis served as a parliamentary representative for New Democracy, representing the President of the party in Parliament, as well as the body of the party's Representatives. He was charged with expressing the positions of his party during Parliamentary procedures and discourse, as well as ensuring the proper function of Parliament through a process of checks and balances. In March 2015, he claimed that then-Minister of Finance [Yanis Varoufakis](/wiki/Yanis_Varoufakis) was undermining the Greek negotiations over the [third bailout programme](/wiki/Third_Economic_Adjustment_Programme_for_Greece), saying: \"Every time he opens his mouth, he creates a problem for the country's negotiating position.\" [[29]](#cite_note-29) Mitsotakis was the first of four New Democracy members to announce their candidacy in the [leadership election](/wiki/New_Democracy_leadership_election,_2015%E2%80%9316), declared following the resignation of [Antonis Samaras](/wiki/Antonis_Samaras) as party leader and the failure of New Democracy in the [September 2015 snap election](/wiki/September_2015_Greek_legislative_election). [[30]](#cite_note-30) Amongst the other contestants was then-interim leader and former [Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Hellenic_Parliament) [Vangelis Meimarakis](/wiki/Vangelis_Meimarakis). According to the [Financial Times](/wiki/Financial_Times), Mitsotakis was \"billed as an outsider in the leadership race\" due to the party establishment's support of Meimarakis' candidacy. [[31]](#cite_note-:0-31) Following the first round of voting with no clear winner, Mitsotakis came second, 11% behind Meimarakis. [[31]](#cite_note-:0-31) On 10 January 2016, Mitsotakis was elected president of the [New Democracy](/wiki/New_Democracy_(Greece)) political party succeeding [Ioannis Plakiotakis](/wiki/Ioannis_Plakiotakis) (transitional president) with almost 4% difference from opponent [Vangelis Meimarakis](/wiki/Vangelis_Meimarakis). A week following Mitsotakis' election as leader, two opinion polls were published that put New Democracy ahead of [Syriza](/wiki/Syriza) for the first time in a year. [[32]](#cite_note-32) His party won 33% of the votes in the European elections in 2019. [[33]](#cite_note-33) He managed to win back votes from the [Golden Dawn](/wiki/Golden_Dawn_(political_party)) Party. [[34]](#cite_note-34) Following the election results, the Hellenic Parliament was dissolved and a snap election was called. [[35]](#cite_note-35) Prime Minister of Greece[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] First term (2019-2023)[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] New Democracy was victorious in the [2019 legislative election](/wiki/2019_Greek_legislative_election), scoring 39.85% of votes and securing 158 seats in the [Hellenic Parliament](/wiki/Hellenic_Parliament). On 8 July 2019, Greek President [Prokopis Pavlopoulos](/wiki/Prokopis_Pavlopoulos) accepted Tsipras' resignation and tasked Mitsotakis with forming a new government. [[36]](#cite_note-36) Mitsotakis was sworn in as prime minister the same day as well. [[37]](#cite_note-guardianjuly8inaug-37) [[38]](#cite_note-dwjuly8inaug-38) On 9 July, the [ministers in his government](/wiki/First_Cabinet_of_Kyriakos_Mitsotakis) were sworn in. Among his cabinet was [Makis Voridis](/wiki/Makis_Voridis), a former member of the far-right [Popular Orthodox Rally](/wiki/Popular_Orthodox_Rally), who was met with a cold reception abroad and by the Jewish community in Greece. Israel announced that it would not cooperate with Voridis. [[39]](#cite_note-39) From 2019 onwards, it is launching a wave of privatizations, including tourism infrastructure, coastal land, and state-owned shares in the gas and electricity companies and Athens airport. On the other hand, a tax reform aimed at making the country \"a haven for billionaires and the wealthiest citizens\", the Financial Times notes, is being implemented. The aim is to attract investment by offering low tax rates. A clause will protect the beneficiaries of this tax policy from possible policy changes by future governments. [[40]](#cite_note-40) The \"big growth bill\", adopted in the summer of 2020, provides for the restriction of the right to strike and the abolition of collective agreements, which had already been suspended in 2012 at the request of the Troika and then reinstated by the Tsipras government. Migration policy has been tightened: the coverage of hospital care for destitute foreigners has been abolished and the period during which refugees who have been granted asylum can reside in public housing has been reduced from six months to one month. [[41]](#cite_note-41) On environmental issues, the government reformed legislation to facilitate oil exploration. [[42]](#cite_note-42) Mitsotakis' government has been praised by some observers for its handling of the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) as well as for its plans for spending a \u20ac31bn share of the EU's [Recovery Plan](/wiki/Next_Generation_EU) and for its orderly vaccination roll-out. Additionally, the common COVID-19 certificate was credited to Mitsotakis, and his idea has been taken up at a European level. [[43]](#cite_note-:10-43) [[44]](#cite_note-:11-44) Mitsotakis had criticized the initially slow pace of the EU's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and he had called for its acceleration. [[45]](#cite_note-45) Measures were implemented from March to May 2020 and from November 2020 until May 2021, when their gradual lifting started. The controls included the introduction of various movement restrictions, suspension of the operation of retail, catering and entertainment businesses, as well as schools and churches. [[46]](#cite_note-46) [[47]](#cite_note-47) In August 2020, a reform of the labour law was adopted. It provides for the possibility of an employer to dismiss employees without having to give reasons for the decision or give prior notice to the persons concerned. The tax authorities' anti-fraud unit was abolished and its employees were integrated into the Ministry of Finance. [[48]](#cite_note-48) There is a long-standing [dispute between Turkey and Greece](/wiki/Aegean_dispute) over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Mitsotakis said that [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey) \"remains stuck in the logic of using force and threats.\" [[49]](#cite_note-49) He told [NATO](/wiki/NATO) Secretary General [Jens Stoltenberg](/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg) that Greece is \"contributing to NATO, we are an ally and have the expectation that when another NATO ally is behaving in a way that jeopardises our interests, NATO should not adopt this stance of equal distances and non-intervention in internal differences. It is deeply unfair to Greece.\" [[50]](#cite_note-50) In July 2020, Mitsotakis awarded honorary Greek citizenship to American actor [Tom Hanks](/wiki/Tom_Hanks) and his wife, American actress [Rita Wilson](/wiki/Rita_Wilson), the latter of whom is half Greek. [[51]](#cite_note-51) On May 16, 2022, Mitsotakis met with U.S. President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden) at the White House. [[52]](#cite_note-52) On the next day, Mitsotakis became the first Prime Minister of Greece to address a [Joint session](/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress) of the [United States Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress) [[54]](#cite_note-54) [[55]](#cite_note-55) [[56]](#cite_note-56) During his term as PM, Mitsotakis has received both praise and criticism for his [pro-European](/wiki/Pro-European), [technocratic](/wiki/Technocratic) governance, [austerity](/wiki/Austerity) measures, [[2]](#cite_note-:92-2) and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. [[3]](#cite_note-:102-3) [[4]](#cite_note-:112-4) Greece was named the Top Economic Performer for 2022 by [The Economist](/wiki/The_Economist), [[6]](#cite_note-:132-6) in particular because Greece in 2022 repaid ahead of schedule 2.7 billion euros ($2.87 billion) of loans owed to [Eurozone](/wiki/Eurozone) countries under the first bailout it received during its [decade-long debt crisis](/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis), and also because of being on the verge of reaching investment-grade rating. [[7]](#cite_note-:142-7) [[8]](#cite_note-:12-8) Mitsotakis has also received criticism on the subject of corruption, as during his term, Greece has experienced heightened corruption, [[11]](#cite_note-:152-11) [[12]](#cite_note-:23-12) and a deterioration of [freedom of the press](/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press). [[13]](#cite_note-:162-13) [[14]](#cite_note-:172-14) [[15]](#cite_note-:182-15) His term crash](/wiki/Tempi_train_crash). [[17]](#cite_note-:9-17) In addition, he has received both praise and criticism for his handling of migration, receiving praise and aid from the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union), [[9]](#cite_note-:122-9) but criticism from journalists and activists for [pushbacks](/wiki/Pushbacks_in_Greece), which his government has denied. [[59]](#cite_note-59) Migration[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Mitsotakis adopted a hardline stance on the [European Migrant Crisis](/wiki/European_Migrant_Crisis) by resorting to [pushbacks of thousands of migrants](/wiki/Pushbacks_in_Greece) in an attempt to prevent their entry into Greece, which his government has denied. [[60]](#cite_note-HRV1-60) [[61]](#cite_note-HRV2-61) [[62]](#cite_note-62) He received praise from the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union) for his handling of the crisis and received economic support of \u20ac700m. [[9]](#cite_note-:122-9) Mandatory COVID-19 measures and vaccinations[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] In December 2020, Mitsotakis was criticized after a photo of him surfaced on social media, in which he posed with five other people while not wearing a mask, during a time when Greece had a nationwide lockdown and mask-wearing was mandatory both indoors and outdoors. [[63]](#cite_note-:1-63) [[64]](#cite_note-:2-64) On 6 February 2021 Mitsotakis visited the island of [Icaria](/wiki/Icaria) to inspect the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations in the area. During this visit, he attended a lunch organized by MP [Christodoulos I. Stefanadis](/wiki/Christodoulos_I._Stefanadis) along with his entourage numbering up to 40 people. The incident was covered by both Greek and international media and Mitsotakis was heavily criticized for violating the existing COVID-19 containment measures. [[65]](#cite_note-:3-65) [[66]](#cite_note-:4-66) [[67]](#cite_note-:5-67) [[68]](#cite_note-:6-68) Mitsotakis publicly apologized for the Icaria incident, saying this will never happen again and that \"the image hurt the citizens\". [[69]](#cite_note-:7-69) [[70]](#cite_note-:8-70) In May 2021, when the Mitsotakis government announced the country's opening for tourism on 14 May, because movement control measures, such as the obligation to send an SMS at particular sites, were retained temporarily. Other measures still in place after the re-opening of tourism were the daily curfew, from 00:30, the obligatory use of face masks indoors and outdoors, the ban on music in cafes and restaurants, and the ban on the operation of indoor restaurants throughout May. Casinos were allowed to operate, with a specific sanitary protocol. In an interview on 27 May 2021, Mitsotakis did not give a clear answer as to when and if the above measures would be lifted in the summer. He referred to a roadmap for lifting the controls but did not elaborate. He also estimated that tourism in 2021 in Greece would be around 50% of the levels experienced in 2019. [[71]](#cite_note-71) [[72]](#cite_note-72) [[73]](#cite_note-73) [[74]](#cite_note-74) Greece was awarded the \"Global Champion Award for COVID-19 Crisis Management\" by the [World Travel and Tourism Council](/wiki/World_Travel_and_Tourism_Council), which \"commends\" the Greek Government as \"a global example for the safe opening of the tourism sector during the pandemic.\" [[75]](#cite_note-75) [[76]](#cite_note-76) He was also credited for the vaccine pass which was later used in the majority of countries in the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union). [[2]](#cite_note-:92-2) Press freedom[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] Under Mitsotakis, Greece has declined in press freedom. Violence against journalists has increased, [[77]](#cite_note-77) resulting to a deterioration of the Greek [freedom of the press](/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press). [[13]](#cite_note-:162-13) [[14]](#cite_note-:172-14) [[15]](#cite_note-:182-15) Mitsotakis' government has directed funds towards media platforms that produce favorable coverage, whilst also allocating more than \u20ac20 million to state-friendly media at the beginning of the pandemic. [[13]](#cite_note-:162-13) Furthermore, in November 2021, the government enacted a law to criminalize the dissemination of \"fake news\". This legislation empowers authorities to imprison individuals for up to five years if they spread purportedly false information that is deemed capable of causing concern or fear to the public or undermining public confidence in the national economy, the country's defense capacity, or public health. [[78]](#cite_note-78) [[79]](#cite_note-79) Mitsotakis has acknowledged that the law may have been a mistake, but the law has not been reversed. [[13]](#cite_note-:162-13) Wiretapping Scandal[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] In July 2022, the leader of the political party PASOK, [Nikos Androulakis](/wiki/Nikos_Androulakis), revealed that there was an attempt of bugging his phone with the spyware program \"Predator\". In a closed-door parliamentary hearing that was called by Androulakis, the chief of [Greek Intelligence Service](/wiki/National_Intelligence_Service_(Greece)), P. Kontoleon, admitted that his service had spied Greek journalist Thanassis Koukakis, who has also complained about being targeted by \"Predator\". [[80]](#cite_note-ReutersScandal-80) After the publication of an investigation by Efsyn and Reporters United that [Grigoris Dimitriadis](/w/index.php?title=Grigoris_Dimitriadis&action=edit&redlink=1), Mitsotakis's nephew and general secretary, had connections with Felix Bitsios, the owner of the company that markets the \"Predator\", Dimitriadis submitted his resignation. [[81]](#cite_note-81) Shortly after, the chief of Greek Intelligence Service, Panagiotis Kontoleon, also stepped down over an allegation that his service had tapped Androulakis's phone. [[80]](#cite_note-ReutersScandal-80) Mitsotakis himself has actively worked to block any investigation on the wiretapping scandal from concluding. [[82]](#cite_note-82) [[83]](#cite_note-83) The scandal has garnered extensive attention in the international media due to the fact that a number of the actions taken subsequent to the revelations were contentious and seemed to suggest an attempt to conceal the truth. [[84]](#cite_note-84) [[85]](#cite_note-85) [[86]](#cite_note-86) In January 2023, despite calls from the opposition to hold the government accountable for its actions and investigate the scandal further, Mitsotakis' administration successfully withstood a no-confidence vote. [[87]](#cite_note-87) Train collision[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] On 28 Feb. 2023, a freight train and a passenger train traveling in opposite directions between Athens and Thessaloniki were inadvertently routed on the same track; 57 people were killed in the head-on collision near Tempi. Amid rising anger and nationwide protests, Mitsotakis offered \"a public apology on behalf of those who ruled the country over the years\", took responsibility for the disaster and vowed to fix the long-neglected rail system. [[88]](#cite_note-88) [[89]](#cite_note-89) He said the government would invest more than 270 million Euros to hire more staff and to install digital control systems by August. [[90]](#cite_note-90) 2023 elections[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Kyriakos_Mitsotakis&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] Mitsotakis visited [President](/wiki/President_of_Greece) [Katerina Sakellaropoulou](/wiki/Katerina_Sakellaropoulou) on 22 April in order to request the dissolution of the Parliament due to a national issue of extraordinary importance (pursuant to Article 41 of the [Constitution of Greece](/wiki/Constitution_of_Greece)); the issue cited was the need of political stability for the achievement of [investment-grade](/wiki/Investment-grade). [[91]](#cite_note-91) [[92]](#cite_note-:13-92) The election day was set for Sunday 21 May, [[92]](#cite_note-:13-92) a day before the end of the 30-day period within which elections must be held following the dissolution of the Parliament. New Democracy won the majority of votes but did not win an outright majority. As no coalition government was formed by any of the parties eligible to do so, Mitsotakis called for another snap election in June. [[93]](#cite_note-93) [[94]](#cite_note-94) [[95]](#cite_note-95) On 24 May, as required by Greece's constitution, President Sakellaropoulou appointed [Ioannis Sarmas](/wiki/Ioannis_Sarmas) to be the [caretaker prime minister](/wiki/Caretaker_government) for the interim.
