Data have demonstrated that symptomatic pregnant individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of more severe illness and death compared with nonpregnant peers. Many pregnant individuals have medical conditions known to put them at further increased risk of severe illness and complications.

Until findings are available from clinical trials and additional studies, only limited data are available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, administered during pregnancy: - Limited data is currently available from animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. No safety concerns were demonstrated in rats that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy; studies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are ongoing. - Studies in people who are pregnant are planned. - Both vaccine manufacturers are monitoring people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have safety monitoring systems in place to capture information about vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor reports. [mRNA vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mRNA.html) do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and, therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person's DNA because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell. Cells break down the mRNA quickly. Based on how mRNA vaccines work, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant. However, the actual risks of mRNA vaccines to the pregnant person and her fetus are unknown because these vaccines have not been studied in pregnant women. Getting vaccinated is a personal choice for people who are pregnant. People who are pregnant and part of a [group recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations.html) to receive COVID-19 vaccine, such as healthcare personnel, may choose to be vaccinated. A conversation between pregnant patients and their clinicians may help them decide whether to get vaccinated with a vaccine that has been authorized for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). While a conversation with a healthcare provider may be helpful, it is not required prior to vaccination. Key considerations pregnant patients can discuss with their healthcare provider include: - The likelihood of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 - Risks of COVID-19 to them and potential risks to their fetuses - What is known about the vaccine: how well it works to develop protection in the body, known side effects of the vaccine, and lack of data during pregnancy Pregnant patients who decide to get vaccinated should continue to follow the current guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 after they are vaccinated. That means: - Wearing a mask - Staying at least six feet away from others - Avoiding crowds - Washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol "}
