In fact he has bought himself several bumper stickers, T-shirts and coffee mugs that say \"World's Best Chiropractor\" just to make sure no one else less deserving had any paraphernalia with the title on it. Like most chiropractors, Dunning-Kr\u00fcger has lots of training in manipulating spines and alleviating wallet obesity. Also, like most chiropractors, Dunning-Kr\u00fcger has never even taken a single course on immunology and hasn't even read an actual scientific article about the immune system, how vaccines work, or about the millions of lives vaccines have saved [worldwide](https://gomerblog.com/2017/06/paris-accord-earth-hospice/). Despite the complete lack of any knowledge about vaccines, Dunning-Kr\u00fcger knows that vaccines are dangerous. \"If they were good, I would have learned about them in chiropractic school and I would sell them in my health clinic. I sell branched chain amino acids, [essential oils](https://gomerblog.com/2015/04/femur-fracture/), mud salves, and the finest snake oils. Legit stuff that works so well you don't even need studies since anyone with a lick of sense knows they work!\" When asked about the thousands of studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of vaccines, Dunning-Kr\u00fcger said, \"Yeah, studies are for people who don't have good intuition. Also, all those studies were funded by big vaccine companies and doctors get paid by the vaccine companies for pimping vaccines.\" \"You know that's all entirely false and complete bullsh*t, right?\" GomerBlog asked.
