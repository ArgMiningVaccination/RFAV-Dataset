The environment is very tranquil, totally relaxing. Staff are well trained and polite and the massage was amazing. Spent some time relaxing around the pool before heading out.

Nov 2019 Solo The atmosphere of the place and greeting of staff were very nice. I've done jacuzzi soak, body scrub and massage - everything was done very well. Therapist was very professional and did a great work. I was completely happy and relaxed, and proceeded for a lunch before my last treatment- hair wash and blow-dry. This service is described in the menu as \"Our stylists are there to provide quality shampoo and blow dry to give you the style you request\". I had a meeting after the SPA, so was thinking it's gonna be nice to have my blow-dry done. Here the worst part starts. The \"stylist\" who suppose to \"give me the style I request\" simply doesn't know how to dry the hair at all! She started just to dry it in a messy way without using the brush, showing that she does it may be for the first time in her life. When I asked about a proper blow-dry, her colleague said that salon can't provide a blow dry because they haven't got any brushes! However, in the end, \"stylist\" found a plenty of brushes, but better she wouldn't! That was definitely her first time to hold the brash! She messed all my hair up! I took the dryer from her and simply dried it myself, just couldn't wait to leave and to go to a proper hair salon to fix this mess! Forget about using this service, if you feel pity for your hair!!! No need to say that my mood was completely ruined. When I went down and complained, the lady on reception (her name is Tracey) was like \"Our salon is focused on SPA, not on beauty services\". Definitely! But here I asked \"Why do you even provide these services then and charging people for something you can not even make?\" Here she again said the same which pissed me off completely! I've spent over 2 000 000 for treatments that day, but why do I need to pay a single dollar for someone to waste my time, mess up my hair and being unprofessional?! Dear management, if you are reading this, kindly give your therapists a proper training to be able to provide a beauty services (as there is no any \"hair stylist\" that was mentioned in your menu, it doesn't exist, service was done by therapist who doesn't know how to carry a hair dryer!), or simply exclude this service from your menu, as you are unable to provide it and have no right to offer it! However, one of the staff member, Jane, came upon my leaving and apologized and offered to return half of the price of this \"blow dry\", and she was extremely polite. It was my mistake to order this service, which ruined my impression of an amazing SPA day, great treatments and massages. Again, I feel sorry that you add this service to your menu with such a nice description - gives a very bad aftertaste...

Sep 2019 Usually when we're in HCM City, a massage is a must but it's usually a whirlwind affair. in L'Apothiquaire Spa, you should spend at least half a day pampering yourself. I felt that it was an unrushed affair with staff ushering you to the different rooms. The only discomfort is that the changing room is next to the service alley and as you're changing you hear the door opening and closing although your privacy is protected by heavy curtain. I managed to have a body massage, mani and pedi as well as facial within this 4-hour retreat. The other plus point is that the spa is housed within a colonial bungalow so you feel that you're experiencing the heritage as well.

Sep 2019 Couples The spa is set in a nice colonial house. While the building seems to need some maintenance, the body treatments were very good and the service impeccable.

Jul 2019 Couples My partner and I came and enjoyed a relaxation body treatment each in the couple's room. We both loved our treatment, with the massage being so relaxing and effective. The staff were also so lovely and accommodating, and the building was beautiful and a peaceful break from the bustle of the city. Definitely recommend.

Jun 2019 Friends This is definitely one of the bad body massages I had done so far in my life. The therapist is unskillful and massage is uncomfortable which made me feel want to stop the service halfway. The therapist was wearing two bracelets which is kind of metal material which is disturbing in a way during the massage. Their reception service is good and staff is friendly. I just hope to have a massage which matching the price that I am paying. My only complain is the skill and standard of the therapist.

Dear Extraordinary761986 We are sure you did not patronage l'Apothiquaire spa. We always ask our guests after the treatments how the services were and what we can do to improve. We receive only compliments of late. None of our therapists wear any bracelets, watches or any form of jewelry, metal or otherwise that interfere with providing spa treatments. This is for certain. What you have written and rated here is not the services we provide at l'Apothiquaire spa.

Nov 2018 Couples My wife and I went here for a couples massage and it was excellent. Very professional and great service. I bought my wife a bottle of perfume and they offered to engrave the bottle free of charge. What a nice surprise. Needless to say the next time we are in Ho Chi Min City we'll make time in our schedule to visit them again.

Showing results 1-10 of 118 Do you charge a fee for credit cards? What is the tipping policy? Thanks! No fee levied on payment of credit card I tend to always pay in cash - tips are expected in these service industries which can make it quite pricey especially in high end establishments where ++ already levied but that goes to the house ....
