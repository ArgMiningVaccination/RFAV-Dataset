INTRODUCTION Non-Vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are now widely used in patients with non -valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the treatment and prevention venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 'DOAC ', (Direct Oral Anticoagulant ) is also used to describe these medicines. This clinical guideline is intended to assist clinicians wi th the inpatient and discharge management of patients receiving a NOAC . It addresses NOAC use in adult patients only . This NOAC guideline does not address anticoagulation in : Pregnant or breast feeding female s. All NOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding(1-3) Paediatric patients less than 18 years of age. NOACs have not been tested in this population (1-3). Information in this guideline should be used in conjunction with Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved Product Information , local protocols and specialist advice . This clinical guideline was developed in conjunction with a multi -disciplinary Anticoa gulant Medicines Working Party. Consensus recommendations where indicated in the guideline are based on expert opinion from within the Working Party. The Anticoagulant Medicines Working Party members included; a consumer, a Director of Clinical Governance , nurses, pharmacists, medical specialists (a cardio logist, anaesthestist, surgeon, general practitioner and hematologists), and representatives from the NSW Therapeutic Advisor y Group and the National Prescribing Service. Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 6 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 2. NOAC INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS NOACs have been registered by the TGA for use in specific conditions including: the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF with one or more risk factors (see Box 1 for PBS Authority listed risk facto rs), in the prevention of VTE following hip and knee replacement and the treatment of new and secondary prevention of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). There are which NOAC treatment is contr aindicated, notably , in pat ients with a mechanical heart valve(1, 2). NOAC u se has not been studied in the following conditions: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, portal and splenic vein thrombosis non -lower limb DVT. NOACs are not su itable for use in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease. Table 1 outlines registered TGA indications and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ( PBS) listings of NOACs as of July 2017 . NOAC availability may vary between facilities. Contact the Pharmacy Department at your facility for further information. Prophylaxis dose in this document refers to the dose used for prevention of VTE following elective total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement ( TKR). Thera peutic dose in this document refers to the dose used for stroke pre vention in non -valvular AF, or treatment of new and secondary prevention of DVT and PE. Box 1 : PBS Authority listed risk factors(4) Prior stroke (isch aemic or unknown type) Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non -central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism Age 75 years or older Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Heart failure and/ or left ventricular ejection fraction 35% or less .

Estimated c reatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated using the using the Cockcroft -Gault equation (do not use the eGFR reported in pathology results). In the case of a patient with renal impairment , treatment with warfarin may be more appropriate(5). Box 2 and Tables 2, 3 and 4 provide general and specific contraindications for NOAC treatment. Whilst NOACs are NOT ABSOLUTELY contraindicated in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding , prescribers should use caution and seek advice when prescribing to these patients . Box patients with CrCl 15 -30mL in prevention of VTE after elective THR or TKR see Table 1 5) Clinically significant active bleeding Significant inherited or acquired bleeding disorder Hepatic disease with coagulopathy Organ lesions at risk of bleeding including intrac ranial haemorrhage in previous 6 months Indwelling spinal or epidural c atheter and during the first 6 hours after re moval Mechanical heart valve Pregnancy or breastfeeding mother Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 9 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 3. COMMENCING TREATMENT The decisi on to commence NOAC therapy should be made by a Senior Medical Officer in conjunction with the patient and / or carer. In addition, contraindications , drug interactions and other patient factors (such as persistent hypertension, falls risk, anaemia and patient compliance ), need to be taken into account prior to commencing a patient on a NOAC. NOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding . In female patient s of child bearing age, p regnancy or breastfeeding is to be excluded prior to commencing NOAC therapy. The follow ing baseline laboratory tests should be performed prior to commencing treatment. The patient should be further investigated if results are found to be abnormal. Full blood count ( FBC) Prothrombin time ( PT) Activated Partial aPTT ) Liver Function Test ( LFT) Renal function : o Estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated using the Cockcroft -Gault equation (do not use the eGFR reported in pathology results) (see Box 2 for contraindications to a NOAC , based on creatinine clearance ) o A calculator, such as the AMH Ideal body weight calculator should be used for calculating estimated creatinine clearance in patients who are overweight or obese . For all other patients use actual body weight. Table 2 (dabigatran) , Table 3 (apixaban ) and Table 4 (rivaroxaban) list other factors to be taken into consideration prior to commencing a patient on a NOAC.

Rivaroxaban 15 mg tablets taken twice a day The missed dose should be taken immedia tely to ensure the intake of 30 mg total dose per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The following day the 15 mg twice daily dose administr ation should resume . Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 21 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 4. PATIENT FOLLOW -UP AND MONITORING There is variable and limited ability to monitor NOACs using laboratory testing in NSW Health facilities. Patients commenced on a NOAC should have medical follow up during the first seven days t o review clinical progress and monitor for signs of bleeding. In addition patients on: RIVAROXABAN FOR VTE TREATMENT should be followed up after THREE weeks for dose modification(2) APIXABAN FOR VTE TREATMENT should be followed up after ONE week for dose modification(3). 4.1 Ongoing renal function monitoring The p atient 's renal function should be checked at least annually and when ever their clinical circumstances or medications change to avoid inadvertent overdose. There may be a ris k of bleeding if there is deterioration in renal function(5). More frequent monitoring of renal function will be required in patients considered to have impaired renal function. Table 21 provides some advice on the effect of NOACs on anticoag ulation tests. Routine monitoring of drug levels or anticoagulant effect is not required. Local advice should be sought on availability of relevant coagulation tests.

It is currently recommended that patients who are s table on warfarin therapy continue on warfarin therapy(5). 5.1 Trans itioning from anticoagulant therapy to a NOAC Befor e transitioning to a NOAC, the prescriber should check contraindications and other factors as outlined in NOAC Indications and contraindications . When transitioning between a NOAC and warfarin laboratory International Normalised R atio (INR) testing should be used. Point -of-care INR testing is NOT suitable for patients transitioning between a NOAC and warfarin. Table 2 2 provides guidance on transitioning from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), intravenous (IV) unfractionated hepari n (UFH) or warfarin to a NOAC. Caution should be used when transitioning patients with renal impairment to LMWH(1-3, 5). Table 2 2: Transitioning from an anticoagulant (IV UFH, LMWH or warfarin) to a NOAC(1-3, 5) Anticoagulant Instructions UFH infusion to NOAC Stop IV UFH Commence NOAC immediately (when aPTT in or below From LMWH to NOAC Stop LMWH Commence NOAC when next From warfarin to NOAC Stop warfarin Measure INR daily Wait until is less than 2.5 Commence NOAC Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 23 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 5.2 Transitioning from a NOAC to IV UFH or LMWH Figures 1 - 5 provide guidance on tran sitioning from a NOAC to IV UFH or LMWH . This guidance should be used in conjunction with l ocal IV UFH protocols and specialist advice.

Important points to consider in converting from a NOAC to warfarin are the NOAC half -life which is affected by renal function, and the d elay in onset of warfarin. A starting dose of warfarin 5 mg or less is recommended(5). When transitioning from a NOAC to warfarin it is necessary to take into account that INR results can be affected by both the NOAC and warfarin(5). Upon commencing warfarin, the INR should be measured daily to identify high levels thereby maintaining caution with ongoing warfarin dosing. Laboratory INR testing should be used. Point - of-care INR testing is NOT suitable when transitioning between a NOAC and warfarin. 5.3.1 Patients with impaired renal fu nction (estimated CrCl <50mL/min) Specialist advice must be sought for patients with impaired renal function (< 50mL/min) as reduced clearance of a NOAC may increase exposure and therefore may increase bleeding risk. 5.3.2 Patients with estimated CrCl 5 0mL/min For patients with estimated CrCl 50mL/min, t he NOAC should be ceased when the INR has been greater than 'baseline' INR plus 1.0 on two consecutive days. The baseline INR should be a ' trough' level, that is, the blood sample is taken from the pati ent immediately prior to the next dose of the NOAC . For example, if the patient's baseline INR is 1.7, the NOAC should be ceased when INR has been greater than 2.7 (that is, 1.7 plus 1.0) on two consecutive days. If the baseline INR is NOT elevated, th en cease the NOAC when the INR has been greater than 2 for two days. Ongoing warfarin dosing is according to the usual target range for the patient's specific indication. Recommendation based on expert opinion of the Anticoagulant Medicines Working Party Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 29 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 6. PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS The bl eeding risk of surgery , timing of the last dose and half -life of the drug adjusted for renal function will determine duration of treatment cessation before surgery(11). A recent CrCl result should be available. Table 23 lists the 2 -day risk of major bleed for common procedures. For urgent(5) or high bleeding risk elective surgery the following labor atory tests should be conducted.

The treating surgeon should advise whether NOAC therapy needs to be withheld. If the decision is made to withho ld NOAC therapy, the NOAC should be withheld according to the guidelines (see Tables 24 - 26). Bridging therapy is not required for patients receiving NOACs.

The trea ting surgeon should advise when to recommence NOAC therapy. Table 27 provides guidance on when therapeutic dose NOACs should be recommenced post -operatively ( consult Table 23 to de termine bleeding risk). THR and TKR prophylaxis with NOAC may be recommenced after 24 hours. Bridging anticoagulation involves the administration of a short -acting anticoagulant, typically a LMWH during the interruption of a longer -acting anticoagulant. Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 32 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 Table 27: Recommencing NOAC post -operatively(5) Recommencing NOAC post -operatively Low bleeding risk surgery Start or resume 24 hours after sur gery High bleeding risk surgery Do not resume therapeutic dosing until 48 - 72 hours after surgery Consider alternative VTE prophylaxis in the interim 6.1 Epidural , and spinal an aesthesia and lumbar puncture There is limited safety data on epidurals and NOAC use. Specialist medical advice should be sought for patients receivin g a NOAC who require an epidural or spinal anesthesia . Spinal or epidural anesthesia is contraindicated in patients currently receiving a thera peutic dose of NOAC. If a decision has been made to cease therapeutic dose NOAC prior to surgery to enable planned epidural or spinal anaesthesia, the NOAC should be ceased according to perioperative guidelines (Tables 24, 25 or 26). If the NOAC has not b een ceased for sufficient time to predict absence of anticoagulant effect then epidural or spinal anesthesia should be avoided unless laboratory testing establishes the absence of anticoagulant effect (see Table 2 1). There is limited data on the safety of prophylactic dose NOAC use whilst a patient has an e pidural catheter in situ. P rophylactic dose NOAC administration is not recommended for patients who have an epidural catheter in situ. Specialist medical advice should be s ought for patients receiving a NOAC requiring therapeutic or diagnostic lumbar puncture. Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 33 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 Table 28 provides general guidance regarding timing of VTE prophylactic NOAC doses in relation to epidural or spinal anesthesia . Long er periods apply for patients with renal impairment. The recommendations in this table should be used in consultation with specialist medical advice. Table 28: Timing of VTE prophylactic dose in relation to epidural or spinal anaesthesia in patients with out reduced renal function(5, 16) Timing of VTE prophylactic dose Dabigatran (Pradaxa\u00ae) 220 mg or 150 mg daily Apixaban (Eliquis\u00ae) 2.5 mg twice daily Rivaroxaban (Xarelto\u00ae) 10 mg daily Last prophylactic dose prior to spinal or epidural catheter insertion 48 hours 24 hours 24 - 48 hours Last prophylactic dose prior to spinal or epidural catheter removal 48 hours 24 hours 24 - 48 hours Next prophylactic dose post catheter insertion (if indwelling epidura l catheter in -situ) Not recommended Next prophylactic dose after epidural catheter removal* At least 6 hours * *A longer delay is required if there are multiple punctures or traumatic insertion of spinal or epidural catheter. 6.2. Acute coronary syndr ome and stroke admissions The management of patients who present with acute coronary syndrome who are receiving a NOAC will depend on a variety of patient factors as well as the treatment options available at the facility. Specialist cardiology advice sh ould be sought for patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome who are receiving a NOAC. Urgent specialist advice should be sought for patients presenting with haemor rhagic strokes on NOACs as haemorr hagic stroke represents critical bleeding (See Section 7 Managing Bleeding ). Urgent specialist advice should also be sought for patients on NOACs who present with an acute ischaemic stroke who would otherwise meet criteria for intravenous thrombolysis therapy or interventional neuroradiology clot retrieval. Where a patient presents with acute ischaemic stroke on a NOAC , specialist advice is needed to consider continuation or cessation of anticoagulation in the acute period . Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 34 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 7. MANAGING BLEEDING Figure 6 provides som e guidance on managing bleeding. Clinicians should refer to their local bleeding management guidelines. In rural / regional sites where results from laboratory tests may not be readily available , bleed ing should be managed on a case -by-case basis according to patient condition in consultation with a haematology specialist or senior medical officer.

At the time of publication, reversal agents for the factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban) were not available. Indications Idarucizumab is indicated for when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran is required for emergency surgery/ urgent procedures and in life -threatening or uncontrolled bleeding(17). An analysis of dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab in patients with serious bleeding or who required an urgent procedure, demonstrated that idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within minutes(18, 19). Though the anticoagulant effect is reversed, achieving haemostasis will be dependent on identifying and treating the source of bleeding. In mild or moderate bleeding e.g. patients presenting with a non -life threatening bleed or in need of non -urgent surgery or invasive procedure, discontinuation of dabigatran and administration of appropriate supportive care is usually sufficient. Drug interactions No formal interaction studies with idarucizumab and other medicines have been conducted. Clinically relev ant interactions with other medicines are considered unlikely. Monitoring The following laboratory tests should be conducted before idarucizumab administration and 30 minutes after IDARUCIZUMAB administration: aPTT PT Fibrinogen TT. IDARUCIZUMAB is onl y indicated if the TT is prolonged. A normal TT rules out the presence of dabigatran. The TT is extremely sensitive, even to clinically insignificant levels of dabigatran. Repeat doses of idarucizumab should not be based on repeat TT results in isolation. Dosage and administration The recommended dose of IDARUCIZUMAB is 5 g (2 x 2.5 g/ 50 mL). Administer intravenously as two consecutive infusions over 5 to 10 minutes each or as a bolus injection. No dose adjustment is required for renal impairment. Restar ting DABIGATRAN Reversing dabigatran exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. Resumption of anticoagulant therapy should be considered as soon as medically appropriate. Specialist advice should be sought. Dependent on patient ci rcumstances, treatment can be initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab . Idarucizumab may not be available in all facilities. Clinicians should verify availability with their relevant Drug and Therapeutics Committee and Pharmacy Department. Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 36 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 An idarucizumab information sheet is available on the Clinical Excellence Commission High -Risk Medicines webpage . 7.2 Pro-haemost atic a gents There is limited evidence on the use of pro -haemostatic agents in NOAC related bleeding(5). Where available, it is only reasonable to consider the use of pro -haemostatic agents , in the circumstan ce of life -threatening bleeding unable to be managed with support ive measures and in consultation with a haematologist . The risk of thrombotic com plications may be significant. The use of rFVIIa in NOAC related bleeding is not recommended(5). 7.3 Use of dialysis in life -threatening bleeding for patients treated with dabigatran(5, 20) Where available, dialysis may be considered in patients treated with dabigatran who have life -threatening bleeding when: The patient has renal f unction impairment, or Dabigatran is present in excess indicated by aPTT >80 seconds or a dabigatran level >500 mg/mL. There is no role for dialysis in rivaroxaban and apixaban related bleeding due to high protein binding(5). 7.4 Blood management guidelines For patients requiring transfusion support , evidence based patient blood management guidelines are available on the Australian National Blood Authority website. Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) Guidelines | Page 37 Clinical Excellence Commission Updated July 2017 8. INFORMATION AND EDUCATION FOR PATIENT S, FAMILIES AND CARER S All patients and/ or their carer should receive education on their medications . Patients should also be adv ised to carry an al ert card or provide Medic/Alert information. Education reg arding NOACs should address: Information about bleeding risk, what to do in case of bleeding, and the importance of alerting health care professionals that the y are being treated with a NOAC Importance of not missing doses Actions to be taken if they miss a dose (see 3.4 Management of a missed dose ) or take a duplicate dose Advice to c heck with the prescriber before starti ng any medication, including complementary and alternative medicines . For example , St John 's Wort which may reduce the anticoagulant effect Dietary requirements , such as avoiding grapefruit juice as it can increase the anticoagulant effect The n eed to reassess kidney function in case dose adjustment is required (patient may believe that no monitoring is required ) Actions to be taken if they sustain a fall Instructions for taking their NOAC (see Table 1 7) For rivaroxaban and apixaban, in the treatment of VTE, the requirement for a dosage adju stment of the anticoagulant at one week (apixaban) or three weeks ( rivaroxaban) after commence ment The need for regular clinical review by their GP.
