The 10 Best Sports Bras For Yoga of 2023 Final Verdict The YogaWorks program is our pick for the best overall yoga teacher training program because its flexible and well-regarded offerings include weekend, online, and all-inclusive trainings. The curriculum is thorough, with an emphasis on the poses themselves, safety, and how to teach engaging classes. Need-based scholarships are available. If you're looking to be immersed in a month-long, all-inclusive experience, consider Vinyasa Yoga School. How to Choose a Yoga Teacher Training Hatha, Ashtanga, Vinyasa, Yin, Yoga Nidra: There are lots of different styles of yoga. If you've been going to a particular style of yoga class and enjoy it, then you may want a teacher training program that offers that style. Or, maybe you can't find the type of class you want in your area, so you'd like training so you can offer it yourself. The next step is to determine where exactly you want to get trained. Schools that are Yoga Alliance-certified follow a strict framework that allows them to lead not just 200-hour yoga teacher trainings but 300- and 500-hour programs as well. Studios that are Yoga Alliance-certified will feature the Yoga Alliance logo on all of their courses. When in doubt, it's best to inquire with the school directly. Usually, teacher trainings offered abroad in India, Mexico, and Southeast Asia are immersive programs that require you to stay for three or four weeks onsite, and pricing is often reflective of room and board, as well as meals. While these comprehensive trainings are invaluable, they may be cost-prohibitive for some. That said, if you're looking to combine a vacation with yoga training, some yoga schools offer add-on amenities depending on the location, like adventure tours or cultural immersion programs. You also may want to consider hybrid programs (like those offered at the Kripalu Institute) that combine online or self-paced instruction with shorter in-person sessions and retreats to better fit your schedule. Frequently Asked Questions Do I Have to Teach Yoga After a Teacher Training? Yoga teacher training programs are designed to help meet the goal of becoming a teacher, but it is not necessary that you do. Participants join yoga teacher training sessions not just to become a teacher, but also to learn more about yoga and its philosophies, and to deepen their own personal practice. What Does RYT 200 and RYT 500 Mean? RYT 200 indicates a registered yoga teacher who has completed a 200-hour teacher training, the minimum required to teach. RYT 500 indicates a registered yoga teacher who has completed both a 200-hour training and an additional 300 hours of yoga training, which is often more specialized. What Is the Difference Between YTT and RYT? YTT is the abbreviation for Yoga Teacher Training, used by some providers. RYT stands for Registered Yoga Teacher. The standardized Yoga Alliance credentials also include E-RYT, a designation for Experienced training, RCYT for teaching children, and RPYT for teaching prenatal yoga classes. Is Yoga Teacher Training Worth It? The value of yoga teacher training depends on the individual. If you plan a teaching career, then it's an investment you can expect to pay off over time. If you're choosing a retreat-like immersion experience for personal growth, the costs lead to other benefits. Check into local options if you're working on a budget. Methodology We ensured that the teacher training programs we recommend are all-encompassing, were well-received by past students, have a comprehensive curriculum and structure, and offer multiple sessions throughout the year, extending beyond the United States. To do so, we checked the Yoga Alliance's directory of recommended schools and yoga teacher training programs offered around the world and read comprehensive reviews\u2014both positive and negative. For some, we even sought the recommendations of former yogis who participated in past teacher training sessions. We also paid special attention to diversity, not just in the curriculum, but with regard to the teachers and students themselves.
