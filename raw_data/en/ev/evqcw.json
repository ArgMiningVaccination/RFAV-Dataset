It can involve your ligaments, tendons, soft tissues and it can also cause joint pain. Myalgia can be a common symptom if you have a viral infection such as COVID and it can affect a specific area or spread more widely. You may have experienced myalgia during your illness or it may have started in the weeks after you were ill. According to the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention), myalgia is amongst the common lasting symptoms after having COVID. Sometimes your joints and muscles might: - Ache - Feel painful - Feel stiff [Return to Top](#PageMenu) Why am I having problems in my joints and muscles after COVID?You might have already had joint and muscle problems before you got COVID. These problems can come back or get worse after COVID as you are not using your joints and muscles as much as before. Using your joints and muscles less than you would normally can lead to them becoming weak and deconditioned, and you might find it hard to: - Stand up - Climb stairs - Grip objects with your hands - Lift your arms above your head - Get into and out of the bath - Shoulder and back problems - Joint and muscle problems anywhere in your body - Aches all over your body that get better but sometimes come back - A numb or tingling feeling in your arms or legs - Your GP - A physiotherapist - healthcare specialist that treats muscle and joint problems [Return to Top](#PageMenu) Chest painsChest pain is a common symptom of COVID-19. It can be brought on by breathing deeply, coughing and/or sneezing as COVID directly affects your lungs and their muscles. Chest pains after having COVID can be worrying, but they are usually not life threatening.

[Return to Top](#PageMenu) Returning to usual activities and staying active after COVIDAfter you have had COVID and if you start to feel better, you should slowly aim to get back to doing your daily activities and to move around more. It is common to want to avoid any activity if you are feeling pain, but not moving around or resting too much can make your joint and muscle problems worse. Instead, being more active can help prevent further weakening of your muscles and worsening pain. Being active does not have to mean going to the gym and/or doing tiring exercise. Instead, trying to get back into your daily routine is a good place to start. You should slowly start to: - Wash yourself - Get dressed by yourself - Do the housework - Do some gardening - Try some of your hobbies Learn more about: [Return to Top](#PageMenu) Keep movingSitting, standing or lying in the same position for a long time is bad for your muscles and joints, so you should move around as much as possible. You can try to: - Write the alphabet out with one foot, and then swap and do it with the other - Do sit-to-stands at your own pace - standing up from a chair and then sitting down slowly - Go for short walks if you can - either around your home, in your garden or outside [Return to Top](#PageMenu) ExerciseIf you feel well enough to do so, you can exercise after COVID unless you have been told not to by your healthcare professional, such as a doctor or physiotherapist. Exercise will help your joint and muscle problems and make you feel more in control of them. As you start to feel better, you can slowly start to do more exercise. There are multiple forms of exercise that you can do based on what you enjoy and how you feel. You can start with activities that help you become more flexible such as: - Stretching - moving your joints as far as you can several times a day to increase your range of motion - Yoga - a mind and body practice that involves stretching and holding poses, breathing techniques and meditation - Tai chi - a series of gentle physical stretches and exercise motions - Climbing stairs - Lifting weights - Working with resistance bands - Gardening activities such as digging - Walking uphill - Cycling [Return to Top](#PageMenu) What if I feel pain during activity and/or exercise?It is common to experience pain and discomfort during activity and/or exercise or even for a couple of days afterwards, especially if it is something you haven't done in a while or if you are trying something new. It is normally not the activity or exercise that causes the pain and discomfort, but the intensity at which you do it at. It is important that you learn to be active and/or exercise at a level that is right for you. This will come with experience as you start to learn how to 'pace yourself'.

This can leave you feeling less motivated which could affect your activity levels and your recovery. You should try to remain active and to find things that can distract you from thinking about your joint and muscle problems all the time. For people with long COVID and who might be experiencing pain over a long period of time. How you feel and what you believe can be better for your pain levels and how you cope and function with pain daily than physical changes in your joints and muscles. Try to manage your thoughts and feelings by: - Having positive thoughts - these can help to reduce pain and help you to cope with it better - Remaining positive about your joint and muscle problems can help you cope more effectively with your symptoms - Retaining purpose - remember that your recovery can be a long journey, but it will ultimately lead to you feeling better over time [Return to Top](#PageMenu) PainkillersPainkillers and creams you can buy at your local pharmacy can help, but you should always ask the pharmacist for advice on what you should use.
