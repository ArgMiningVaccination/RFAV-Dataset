(Prepared by the Oregon Evidence -based Practice Center under Contract No. 290- 2007- MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ; May 2013. www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm . iii Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of systematic reviews to assist public - and private -sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health c are in the United States. These reviews provide comprehensive, science- based information on common, costly medical conditions, and new health care technologies and strategies. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence -based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertio ns about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm . AHRQ expects that these systematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. Transparency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

Pressure ulcers affect up to 3 million Americans and are a major source of morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. This review summarizes evidence comparing the effectiveness and safety of pressure ulcer treatment strategies. Data s ources . Articles p ublished between January 1, 1985, and October 17, 2012, were identified from searches of MEDLINE\u00ae (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), EBM Reviews (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology Assessment. Additional studies w ere identified by searching reference lists from included studies and systematic reviews of pressure ulcer treatments. Gray literature, including unpublished data, abstracts, dissertations, and individual product packets from manufacturers , was also review ed. Review m ethods . The literature, quality of included studies, and extracted data were dual - reviewed using predefined criteria. Results were summarized in evidence tables. Summary results were derived primarily from qualitative analysis and synthesis. Results . We reviewed 7,274 titles and abstracts and 1,836 full -length articles . We included 174 studies (trials and observational studies) addressing the effectiveness and/or harms of different treatments for pressure ulcers. These studies examined a wide range of interventions, but sample sizes often were small. We found moderate -strength evidence that some interventions were associated with wound improvement, including the use of air -fluidized beds (compared with other support surfaces), protein- containin g nutritional supplements (compared with placebos or other routine measures of nutritional support), radiant heat dressings (compared with other dressings), and electrical stimulation (compared with a sham treatment). Several other interventions had limite d evidence of effectiveness (strength of evidence rated as low). Only a minority of studies examined complete wound healing as an outcome. In general, the evidence about the harms of any of these treatments was limited. Limitations . Most studies were of poor quality and had followup periods inadequate to assess complete wound healing. Studies often measured healing outcomes using heterogeneous methods, making it difficult to compare results across studies. Conclusions . There was limited evidence to draw firm conclusions about the best approaches for treating pressure ulcers, a finding consistent with other recent reviews on this topic. Future research with larger sample sizes, more rigorous adherence to methodological standards for clinical trials, longer followup periods, and more standardized and clinically meaningful outcome measures is needed to inform clinical practice and policy. viii Contents Executive Summary

Evidence Tables and Overall Quali ty Ratings ES-1 Executive Summary Background Uninterrupted pressure exerted on the skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone can lead to the development of localized ischemia, tissue inflammation, shearing , anoxia, and necrosis. Pressure ulcers affect up to three million adults in the United States. Areas of the body prone to the development of pressure ulcers are depicted in Figure A. Estimates of the incidence of pressure ulcers vary according to the sett ing, with ranges of 0.4 to 38.0 percent in acute care hospitals, 2.2 to 23.9 percent in long -term nursing facilities, and 0 to 17 percent in home care settings.1,2 The prevalence of pressure ulcers in acute and long -term care settings was 9.2 to 11.1 perce nt between 1989 and 1995 and 14.7 to 15.5 percent between 1999 and 2005.3 Figure A. Common pressure ulcer sites Pressure ulcer healing rates \u2014which depend on comorbidities, clinical interventions, and ulcer severity \u2014vary considerably. Ulcer severity is assessed using a variety of different staging or grading systems, but the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) staging system is the most commonly used (Figure B). Comorbidities predisposing toward pressure ulcer development and affecting ulcer healing include those affecting patient mobility (e.g., spinal cord injury), wound environments (e.g., incontinence), and wound healing (e.g., diabetes and vascul ar disease). Delayed healing can add to the length of hospitalization and impede return to full functioning. 2 Data on the costs of treatment vary, but some estimates range between $37,800 and $70,000 per ulcer, with total annual costs for pressure ulcers i n the United States as high as $11 billion.1,4 Prevalence of pressure ulcers is used as an indicator of quality for long- term care facilities , and progression of pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients is often considered an avoidable complication represe nting failure of inpatient management. Given the negative impact pressure ulcers have on health status and patient quality of life, as well as health care costs, treatments are needed that promote healing, shorten healing time, and minimize the risk of com plications. Pressure ulcer treatment involves a variety of different approaches, including interventions to treat the conditions that give rise to pressure ulcers (support surfaces and nutritional support) ; interventions to protect and promote healing of t he ulcer (wound dressings, topical applications, and various adjunctive therapies , including vacuum -assisted closure, ultrasound therapy, electrical stimulation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy) ; and surgical repair of the ulcer. 1,4 Most ulcers are treated u sing a combination of these approaches. Standards of care for pressure ulcer treatment are typically guided by clinical ES-2 practice guidelines, such as those developed by NPUAP, but also are informed by patient -related factors such as comorbidities and nutrit ional status,5 local practice patterns, and the stage and features of the wound. Current guidelines primarily reflect expert opinions. An examination of the comparative effectiveness and harms of different therapies and approaches to treating pressure ulce rs is important to guide clinical practice. Figure B. National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel p ressure ulcer stages/categories Scope and Key Questions The following Key Q uestions are the focus of our report . Key Question 1. In adults with pressure ulcers, what is the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for improved health outcomes , including but not limited to: complete wound healing, healing time, reduced wound surfa ce area, pain, and prevention of serious complications of infection? Key Question 1a. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to features of the pressure ulcers, such as anatomic site or severity at baseline? a N ot pictured. NPUAP copyright, photos used with permission . Stage: I Intact skin with non - blanchable redness of a localized area usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching; its color may differ from the surrounding area. Stage: III Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscles are not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining and tunneling. Stage: IV Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often includes undermining and tunneling. Stage: II Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum - filled blister . Suspected D eep T issue I njury a Purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood - filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear. The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, m ushy, boggy, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Unstageable a Full thickness tissue loss in which the base of the ulcer is covered by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown or black) in the wound bed. ES-3 Key Question 1b. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including but not limited to: age, race/ethnicity, body weight, specific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? Key Question 1c. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient care settings , such as home, nursing facility, or hospital, or according to fea tures of patient care settings, including but not limited to nurse/patient staffing ratio, staff education and training in wound care, the use of wound care teams, and home caregiver support and training? Key Question 2. What are the harms of treatments fo r pressure ulcers? Key Question 2a. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to features of the pressure ulcers, such as anatomic site or severity at baseline? Key Question 2b. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, body weight, specific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? Key Question 2c. Do the harms of treatment strategies d iffer according to patient care settings , such as home, nursing facility, or hospital, or according to features of patient care settings, including but not limited to nurse/patient staffing ratio, staff education and training in wound care, the use of wound care teams, and home caregiver support and training? Analytic Framework The analytic framework (Figure C) depicts the K ey Questions and the population, interventions, outcomes, and harms considered in the review. ES-4 Figure C. Analytic fram ework: pressure ulcer treatment strategies ES-5 Population and Conditions of Interest The population studied was adults ages 18 and older with a pressure ulcer. Patients with pressure ulcers usually also have limited or impaired mobility and suffer from other chronic illnesses. Pressure ulcers are most common in the elderly or people with spinal cord injuries or other conditions that restrict mobility. Patients with nonpressure -related ulcers, including but not limited to venous ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, were excluded because treatment considerations for these patients may differ significantly from those for pressure ulcers. A systematic review of treatment for chronic venous ulcers, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) , is in progress. We excluded children because this topic was originally nominated and scoped for adults. a Interventions and Comparators Key Informants agreed with the broadly defined proposed population of interest, but they also noted that \"adults with pressure ulcers\" is a heterogeneous group and that variability in the comparative effectiveness of pressure ulcer treatments may be related to a large number of patient characteristics. In addition to age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and diverse specific med ical comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, end- stage renal disease, dementia), many Key I nformants suggested that we include specific known risk factors for pressure ulcers (e.g., nutritional status, incontinence, peripheral vascular disease, mobility limitations , and functional ability). Various treatment strategies for pressure ulcers were reviewed , including but not limited to therapies that address the underlying contributing factors (e.g., support surfaces and nutritional supplem ents), therapies that address local wound care (e.g., wound dressings, topical therapies, and biological agents), surgical repair, and adjunctive therapies (e.g., electrical stimulation). The comparative effectiveness and harms of other interventions (e.g., repositioning, wound debridement, and wound cleansing) were considered but not reviewed, based on input from the Technical Expert Panel (TEP) that these modalities either were considered standard care or lacked comparative studies. Combined treatment modalities (cointerventions), such as comparison of two treatments in combination compared with a single treatment, were also evaluated. Comparators included placebo or active control, usual care, and other interventions. In some cases, particularly in old er studies, newer interventions were compared with older ones that might no longer be considered standard care in the field. However, in many care settings these applications (e.g., gauze dressings, standard hospital beds) are still used, and we therefore included studies using those types of comparators because of their continued relevance in some treatment settings. Outcomes The most commonly examined outcomes were measures of wound improvement. Some studies examined complete wound healing as the primary outcome, al though many studies evaluated wound size reduction. Based on input from the TEP, we considered complete wound healing to be the principal health outcome of interest. However, we also considered other aAlthough treatment approaches for children with pressure ulcers may be similar to those for adults, other factors may influence the effectiveness differently in this population, including setting, caregiver attention, healing potential, and comorbidities. ES-6 indicators of \"wound improvement\" in synthesi zing evidence. Notably, many studies reported findings in terms of wound size reduction rather than complete wound healing. We considered wound size reduction to be an important outcome for two reasons. First, it represents a necessary intermediate step to ward the principal outcome of complete wound healing : that is , complete wound healing can be considered 100- percent wound size reduction. Second, the likelihood of complete wound healing is lower for larger or higher stage ulcers, and therapies deployed fo r more advanced ulcers may not be expected to achieve complete wound healing over the course of several weeks, which was the duration of most of the studies in our review. Thus, in summarizing the evidence about a given treatment, we considered wound size reduction to be part of the continuum of wound healing. Some studies used composite outcome measures commonly employed to monitor pressure ulcer status. The Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) tool combines wound surface area, amount of wound exudate, and tissue appearance. 6 The Pressure Sore Status Tool (PSST) considers multiple ulcer characteristics, including dimensions, exudate, and tissue appearance. 7 Other studies reported outcomes in terms of wound healing rate. We included these outcomes, when r eported in studies, as indicators of \"wound improvement\" but prioritized findings for complete wound healing, as noted above, based on input from the TEP. Other outcomes included pain and avoidance of serious complications of infection. For harms of treatm ent, we evaluated pain, dermatologic complications, bleeding, infection, and other adverse outcomes as reported in included studies. Timing We did not apply minimum followup duration for studies. Setting Settings were patient care settings, including hom e, nursing facility, or hospital. Methods The methods for this C omparative E ffectiveness Review (CER) follow the methods suggested in the AHRQ \" Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews \"8 and the standards suggested by the Institute of Medicine for conducting systematic reviews.9 Topic Refinement and Review Protocol The K ey Q uestions for this CER were developed with input from Key Informants, representing clinicians, wound care researchers , and patient advocates. The Key Informants helped refine K ey Questions, identify important methodological and clinical issues, and define parameters for the review of evidence. The revised K ey Q uestions were then posted to the AHRQ public Web site for a 4- week comment period. AHRQ and the Evidence -based Practice Center (EPC) agreed on the final K ey Questions after reviewing public comments and receiving additional input from a TEP convened for this report. TEP members were selected to provide high-level content and methodological expertise throughout the development of the review , and the TEP consisted of a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in pressure ulcer treatment and research. TEP members disclos ed all financial or other conflicts of interest prior to participation. The AHRQ Task Order Officer and the authors reviewed the disclosures and determined that the panel members had no conflicts of interest that ES-7 precluded participation. The protocol for t he CER was reviewed by the TEP and is available from the AHRQ Web site: ( www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search -for-guides - reviews -and-reports/?productid=838&pa geaction=displayproduct ). Search Strategy The primary literature search was conducted through June 2012 in MEDLINE\u00ae (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), EBM Reviews (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology As sessment . (See Appendix A of the full report for details .) The most relevant evidence about modalities and procedures currently used for treating pressure ulcers is found in studies conducted within the last 25 years. For this reason we set the search start date at 1985. This decision was affirmed by the Key Informants and TEP. Gray literature was identified by soliciting stakeholders, TEP recommendations, and searching relevant Web sites, including clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Con trolled Trials, ClinicalStudyResults.org, and the W orld H ealth Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), regulatory documents (Drugs@FDA and Devices@FDA), conference proceedings and dissertations (Conference Papers CSA] ), Scopus (Elsevier), Dissertations & Theses (ProQuest UMI), and individual product Web sites. An additional focused search strategy on hyperbaric oxygen for the treatment of pressure ulcers was conducted at the recommendation of the TEP due to the paucity of evidence for this treatment obtained from the original search. Scientific information packets (SIPs) were requested from identified drug and device manufacturers , and a notice inviting submission of relevant scientific information was published in the \" Federal Register \" in an effort to identify any relevant unpublished literature that may contribute to the body of evidence. All interested parties had the opportunity to submit data for this review using the AHRQ Effective Health Care publicly accessible online SIP portal ( effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/submit -scientific - information -packets/ ). Reviewers evaluated the SIP s received for data relevant to our review. Additional studies were identified by reviewing the reference lists of published clini cal trials, systematic reviews, and review articles. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies were based on the K ey Q uestions and the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting (PICOT S) approach. We used the following inclusion criteria . (See Appendix B of the full report for details .) Populations: Studies were limited to subject populations of adults ages 18 years and older being treated for existing pressure ulcers. Subgroups were de fined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and diverse specific medical comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, end- stage renal disease, and dementia), a s well as patients with specific known risk factors for pressure ulcers (e.g., nutritional status, incontinence, peripheral vascular disease, mobility limitations, and functional ability). Studies conducted in populations including children, adolescents, and patients with nonpressure -related ulcers (including but not limited to venous ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers ) were excluded because treatment considerations for these patients may differ significantly from those for adults with pressure ulcers. Interventions: For efficacy and effectiveness assessments, all studies of interventions for treatme nt of pressure ulcers meeting the requirements of the PICOTS and Key Q uestions were included. Treatments for pressure ulcers included but were not limited to support surfaces, ES-8 nutritional supplementation, wound dressings, topical therapies, biological agents, and surgical repair. Adjunctive therapies included electrical stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, ultrasound, negative pressure wound therapy, light therapy, laser therapy, hydrotherapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Comparators: Comparators include d usual care, placebo or sham treatment, no treatment, and different treatment interventions. Studies that did not have a comparator were not considered in our evaluation of comparative effectiveness. They were included for the assessment of harms if they reported on harms of treatments for which data on comparative effectiveness were available in other studies. Outcomes: Studies reporting clinical outcomes of complete wound healing, wound size (surface area, volume, depth) reduction, pain, prevention of se psis, prevention of osteomyelitis, recurrence rate, and harms of treatment (including but not limited to pain, dermatologic complications, bleeding, and infection) were included. Studies of nonpressure -related ulcers were not included. We excluded studies that evaluated only nonclinical outcomes , including ease of use, comfort, or nursing time required to administer the intervention. Timing: No minimum followup time was required. We limited our search to publications and investigations conducted from 1985 t o June 2012. Setting: We included studies conducted in patient -care settings such as home, nursing facility, or hospital. We excluded studies in hospice settings if complete wound healing was not an outcome measured. Study Design: We included randomized tr ials, cohort studies, and case -control studies pertinent to all K ey Q uestions. If such studies were not available, we included cross -sectional studies and intervention series studies. Systematic reviews were used as background information or to ensure completeness of the literature search. Case studies of only one patient were not included. For studies of surgical interventions, we initially planned to include controlled trials, observational studies with at least two compar ison groups, and noncomparative intervention series only if they were multicenter series with a population of 100 patients or more. An initial scan of the literature, however, revealed that studies of surgical interventions revealed primarily small series of specific surgical techniques performed at single centers. Because surgical outcomes are heavily influenced by individual surgeons, local practice patterns, and other contextual factors, the TEP raised concern that data from these small (n < 50) single -site studies would have limited generalizability and that they would not provide a sound basis for making indirect comparisons across studies. We therefore excluded small (n < 50) single -site studies reporting the results of specific surgical techniques for pressure ulcer management but e xpanded our inclusion criteria to include single -center intervention series reporting a large series (n 50) of patients undergoing surgery for pressure ulcer. We included studies of any size that provided direct head -to-head comparisons of different surg ical techniques. Non-English -language studies were included in the abstract triage, but translation for full- text review was not feasible. In an effort to identify any relevant unpublished literature that may contribute to the body of evidence , gray liter ature, including unpublished data, abstracts, dissertations, and SIPs , were reviewed to determine if they added additional and meaningful data beyond the literature included in this review and should also be included. ES-9 Study Selection To calibrate reviewer agreement and consistency in study selection, kappa values were calculated to estimate inter -reviewer reliability. After reconciling disagreements between reviewers, this process was repeated with additional sets of studies until a kappa value of greater than 0.50 for each pair of reviewers was reached. The remaining references were evaluated at the title and abstract level for inclusion, using the pre -established inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine eligibility for inclusion in the evidence synthesis . Excluded titles were reviewed again by a senior investigator/clinician for accuracy. All citations included by one or both of the reviewers were retrieved for full -text review. Full-text articles were independently reviewed by two team members and includ ed when consensus occurred between the reviewers. If consensus was not reached by the two initial reviewers, a senior investigator reviewed the article and adjudicated the decision on inclusion or exclusion. Data Extraction Data from included studies were extracted into evidence tables and entered into electronic databases using Microsoft Excel\u00ae and DistillerSR systematic review software. The data extracted into evidence tables included study design; year, setting, duration, and study inclusion and exclusio n criteria; population and clinical characteristics, including sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, functional ability, and ulcer stage; intervention characteristics; results for each outcome of interest; and withdrawals due to adverse events. Outcomes of i nterest for effectiveness were wound improvement , as determined by complete wound healing, healing rate or time, or reduction in wound size (surface area, volume, depth) ; reduction in pain; prevention of serious complications of infection such as sepsis or osteomyelitis ; and ulcer recurrence rates. Outcomes of interest for harms were pain ; dermatologic reactions ; bleeding ; and complications , including but not limited to infection and need for surgical intervention. Data on settings included patient -care set tings such as long -term care or nursing facility, hospital, and community. If available, we also extracted the number of patients randomized relative to the number of patients enrolled, how similar those patients were to the target population, and the funding source. Noncomparative observational studies were included if they evaluated harms of treatments for which comparative effectiveness evidence was available in other studies. These noncomparative observational studies were used for Key Question 2 (evalu ation of harms) and were rated for study quality but were not formally extracted into evidence tables due to the paucity of data they contained. We recorded intention- to-treat results when available. All summary measure data were collected as available and presented in the individual studies, including but not limited to percentage of complete wound healing, relative risk and risk ratios, confidence intervals, and significance values. A second team member verified all study data extraction for accuracy and completeness. One challenge in extracting data from pressure ulcer studies is that various systems have been used to assess the severity of pressure ulcers. Most use a four -stage categorization, with higher numbers indicating higher severity.10 In 2007 NP UAP redefined their four -stage classification system that defines the pressure ulcer based on depth and tissue involvement (Figure B). Stage I is defined as superficial erythema, stage II as partial thickness ulceration, stage III as full thickness ulcerat ion, and stage IV as full thickness with involvement of muscle and bone. A corresponding four -stage classification system was adopted by the European ES-10 Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP). Given that the stages are based on depth and tissue involvement, when an ulcer has overlying purulent material or eschar prohibiting the ability to determine the depth or extent of tissue involvement, it is classified as unstageable, or stage X. Discolored localized areas of intact skin that may indicate pressure- related injury to subcutaneous tissue are categorized as suspected deep tissue injuries. T he most commonly used systems to classify pressure ulcers prior to adapting the NPUAP system are reviewed in Appendix C of the full report and aligned with the current corres ponding NPUAP stage. In order to allow comparability across studies, we extracted the stage or grade reported but used the corresponding NPUAP stage in summary tables and text when possible. Quality Assessment of Individual Studies In this report, risk of bias is denoted as quality, with the following summary categories: Good quality is defined as a low risk of bias. Fair quality is defined as a moderate risk of bias. Poor quality is defined as a high risk of bias. Using predefined criteri a to assess the quality of controlled trials and observational studies at the individual study level, we adapted criteria from methods proposed by Downs and Black11,12 (observational studies) and methods developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.12,13 We rated the quality of each controlled trial based on the methods described in the published reports about randomization and allocation concealment; the similarity of compared groups at baseline; maintenance of comparable groups; adequate reporting of dropouts, attrition, crossover, adherence, and contamination; loss to followup; the use of intention- to-treat analysis; and ascertainment of outcomes. 12 Individual studies were rated as \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor.\" Studies rated \"good\" have the least ris k of bias , and results are considered valid. Good- quality studies include clear descriptions of the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups; a valid method for allocation of patients to treatment; low dropout rates and clear reporting of dropouts; appropriate means for preventing bias; and appropriate measurement of outcomes. Studies rated \"fair\" do not meet all the criteria for a rating of good quality, but no flaw is likely to cause major bias. The study may be missing information, making it difficult to assess limitations and potential problems. The fair -quality category is broad, and studies with this rating vary in their strengths and weaknesses: the results of some fair -quality studies are likely to be valid , while others are onl y probably valid. Studies rated \"poor\" have significant flaws that imply biases of various types that may invalidate the results. They have a serious or \"fatal\" flaw in design, analysis, or reporting; large amounts of missing information; discrepancies in reporting; or serious problems in the delivery of the intervention. The results of these studies are at least as likely to reflect flaws in the study design as they are to reflect the true differences between the interventions that were compared. We did not exclude studies rated poor quality a priori , but poor -quality studies were considered to be less valid than higher quality studies when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies between studies were present. ES-11 Data Synthesis Due to the het erogeneity of outcomes reported and the limited number and quality of studies for specific treatment comparisons, quantitative analysis was not appropriate for most bodies of literature included in this review. For most comparisons, we synthesized data qua litatively. We evaluated the appropriateness of meta- analysis based on clinical and methodological diversity of studies and statistical heterogeneity. We conducted meta- analysis in selected instances (when the number, quality , and homogeneity of studies permitted) for comparisons examining the outcome of complete wound healing. We chose to limit meta -analysis to the outcome of complete wound healing because of ( a) wide variability in the measurement of other outcomes , including wound size reduction, and ( b) indication from the TEP that complete wound healing was the principal health outcome of interest. When meta -analysis was conducted, we used relative risk as the effect measure. We assessed the presence of statistical heterogeneity among the studies using standard 2 tests and the magnitude of heterogeneity using the I2 statistic.14 We used random -effects models to account for variation among studies15 and fixed - effects Mantel -Haenszel models when variation among studies was estimated to be zero. Sensitivi ty analysis was conducted to assess the impact of quality on combined estimates , and metaregression was conducted to assess the association of effect measure with study duration. However, exploration of heterogeneity was typically limited by the small numb er of studies for each treatment category. All quantitative analyses were performed using S tata 11.0\u00ae (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, 2009). Strength of the Body of Evidence Within each Key Q uestion, we graded the strength of evidence for effectivenes s and for harms by intervention/comparator pair, and for harms by intervention, using an approach adapted from the AHRQ \" Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .\" 8 Our approach considers four major categories to rate the strength of evidence: Quality of studies (good, fair, or poor) Consistency (low, moderate, or high) Directness (direct or indirect) Precision (low, moderate, or high). As with our ratings of indiv idual study quality, we used the term \"quality\" in lieu of \"risk of bias\" in rating the overall strength of evidence of a given finding. Good quality is defined as low risk of bias, fair quality is defined as moderate risk of bias, and poor quality is defi ned as high risk of bias. Our ratings for consistency and precision were trichotomous (low, moderate, high) rather than dichotomous (consistent vs. inconsistent, precise vs. imprecise) to allow for a more graded assessment of those domains. We did not inc orporate the domain of \"dose -response association\" into our strength- of- evidence ratings because few, if any, studies in our review included varying levels of exposure. We also did not include the domain \"plausible confounding that would decrease observed effect\" because this domain is relevant primarily for observational studies and nearly all of our findings were based on the results of clinical trials. We consider ed \"strength of association\" in rating strength of evidence but did not assign explicit scor es for strength of association in the strength- of-evidence ratings due to variability in strength of association for the different measures of wound improvement used across studies. ES-12 We were not able to assess publication bias using a quantitative approach for most treatments because, in many instances, we were not able to perform a formal pooled analysis due to the heterogeneity of interventions, comparators, or outcomes, or due to the poor quality of studies. We evaluated the possibility of publication bi as by qualitatively examining the directionality of study findings by sample size for a given intervention and by looking for unpublished studies through the gray literature search. The strength of evidence was assigned an overall grade of high, moderate, low, or insufficient according to a four -level scale: High \u2014High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate\u2014Moderate confidence that the evidence ref lects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low\u2014Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient \u2014Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. Applicability Applicability is \"the extent to which the effects observed in published studies are likely to reflect the expected resu lts when a specific intervention is applied to the population of interest under 'real -world' conditions.\"16 We developed our review to provide evidence that might be useful to clinicians, policymakers, patients, and other decisionmakers interested in press ure ulcer treatment. Applicability depends on context , and there is no generally accepted universal rating system for it. We described features of the included studies that are relevant to applicability in terms of the PICOTS elements. These elements are t he features embedded in the K ey Q uestions that inform clinical decisionmaking and the degree to which the evidence is likely to pertain to the subpopulations. For example, it is important to determine whether techniques described in studies are representat ive of current practice. We extracted from studies included in our review key information that might affect applicability of findings, including characteristics of ulcers (e.g., stage), populations (e.g., spinal -cord-injured patients), study duration, cointerventions, comparators, and care setting. We based our approach to applicability on the guidance described by Atkins and colleagues . 12,16 Peer Review Experts in prevention and management of pressure ulcers, geriatric medicine, wound care research, and epidemiology, as well as individuals representing important stakeholder groups, were invited to provide external peer review of this CER. The AHRQ T ask Order O fficer and a designated EPC associate editor also provided comments and editorial review. To obtain public comment, the draft report was posted on the AHRQ Web site for 4 weeks. A disposition- of- comments report detailing the changes made to address the public and peer review comments will be made available 3 months after the Agency posts the final CER on the AHRQ Web site . Results Searches of databases, review s of reference lists of published studies, and review s of gray literature resulted in 7,274 potentially relevant articles. After dual review of abstracts and titles, ES-13 1,836 articles were selected for full -text review. Gray literature was assessed but did not meet the inclusion criteria for this report or provide data that w ere not already available in the peer - reviewed literature. One hundred seventy -four studies (with results published in 182 full -text articles) were included in this review. These studies examined a wide range of interventions, but sample sizes often were small. We found moderate -strength evidence that some interventions improved healing of pressure ulcers, but no interventions were found to be effective with a high strength of evidence. Several other interventions had limited evidence of effectiveness (strength of evidenc e rated as l ow). A minority of studies examined complete wound healing as an outcome. In general, the evidence about the harms of any of these treatments was limited. Overall Effectiveness of Pressure Ulcer Treatment Pressure ulcer treatment encompasses numerous intervention strategies: alleviating the conditions contributing to ulcer development (support surfaces, repositioning, nutritional support); protecting the wound from contamination, creating a clean wound environment, and promoting tissue healing (local wound applications, debridement, wound cleansing, various adjunctive therapies); and surgically repairing the wound. We evaluated evidence addressing the comparative effectiveness and harms in treatment categories for which significant uncertainty exists about the best therapeutic options. Results for each Key Q uestion are presented within the following specific treatment categories: support surfaces, nutrition, local wound applications (including wound dressings, topical therapies , and biological a gents), surgical interventions, and adjunctive therapies. Although we evaluated multiple outcomes, only measures of wound improvement (complete wound healing, wound size reduction, healing rate) were consistently reported. Other outcomes , including pain, w ere reported sporadically. Ulcer recurrence was used as an outcome in some studies of surgery and is reported in the section s of this report covering those studies . Prevention of serious infectious complications was not reported as an outcome in any includ ed study. There was no body of literature from which it was possible to synthesize evidence for the impact of a given intervention on outcomes other than wound improvement. In reporting results of wound improvement, when a body of literature allowed conclusions about a particular measure of wound improvement (e.g., complete wound healing), we report those findings. In many cases, however, the use of different measures of wound improvement allowed us to report only on the overall effect of an intervention on wound improvement, which included complete wound healing, wound size reduction, and healing rates. The overall findings of this review and a summary of the strength of the evidence for the key findings are presented in Table A. ES-14 Table A. Summary of evidence: impact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 1. In adults with pressure ulcers, what is the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for improved health outcomes, including but not limited to: complete wound healing, healing time, reduced wound surface area, pain, and prevention of serious complications of infection? Support Air-fluidized beds Moderate Air-fluidized beds produced better healing in terms of reduction in ulcer size compared with other surfaces ( 5 studies conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s). Alternating pressure beds Moderate Complete wound healing and reduction in ulcer size were similar across different brands and types of alternating pressure beds ( 4 studies). Alternating pressure beds compared with other surfaces Low Wound improvement was similar for alternating pressure beds when compared with air, fluid , or standard beds ( 4 studies). Alternating pressure chair cushions Insufficient Evidence about alternating pressure chair cushions did not permit conclusions due to differences in the patient populations studied ( 2 studies). Low-air-loss beds Low Wound improvement was similar for low -air-loss beds compared with foam surfaces ( 4 studies) and for low -air-loss beds compared with low -air-loss bed overlays ( 1 study). Nutrition Protein -containing nutritional supplements Moderate When used in addition to other measures for treating pressure ulcers, protein-containing nutritional supplementation resulted in wound improvement ( 12 studies). Vitamin C Low Vitamin C used as a single nutritional supplement d id not result in wound improvement ( 1 study). Zinc Insufficient The evidence did not allow conclusions as to whether zinc supplementation improves pressure ulcer healing ( 1 study). Local Wound Applications Hydrocolloid dressings compared with conventional care Low Wound improvement was superior with hydrocolloid compared with gauze dressings ( 10 studies). Hydrocolloid compared with foam Moderate Wound improvement was equivalent with hydrocolloid and foam dressings (8 studies). Comparisons of different wound dressings Insufficient Evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of hydrogel (compared with standard care or other dressing types; 7 studies), transparent film ( 4 studies), silicone (2 studies), and alginate dressings ( 1 study) was inconclusive due to limitations in the n umber, size, and quality of studies. Radiant heat compared with other dressings (healing rate) Moderate Radiant heat dressings produced more rapid wound healing rates than other dressings for stage III and IV ulcers ( 4 studies). Radiant heat compared with other dressings (complete wound healing) Moderate Radiant heat dressings were similar to other dressings in terms of complete wound healing of stage III and IV ulcers ( 4 studies) . Debriding enzymes compared with dressings or other topical therapies Insufficient Evidence about the effectiveness of collagenase and other debriding enzymes was inconclusive due to differences in the enzymes studied and outcomes measured ( 5 studies). ES-15 Table A. Summary of evidence: impact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 1. In adults with pressure ulcers, what is the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for improved health outcomes, including but not limited to: complete wound healing, healing time, reduced wound surface area, pain, and prevention of serious complications of infection? (continued) Local Wound Applications (continued) Dextranomer paste compared with wound dressings Low Dextranomer paste was inferior to wound dressings (alginate, hydrogel) in promoting wound area reduction ( 2 studies). Topical collagen compared with hydrocolloid dressings or standard care Low Wound improvement was similar with topical collagen applications compared with hydrocolloid dressings or standard care ( 3 studies). Topical phenytoin Insufficient Three studies of the effectiveness of topical phenytoin used different comparators and produced inconsistent results. Maggot therapy Insufficient Evidence about the effectiveness of maggot therapy was inconclusive due to poor study quality ( 3 studies). Platelet -derived growth factor Low Platelet -derived growth factor was superior to placebo in producing wound improvement in stage III and IV pressure ulcers ( 4 studies). Biological agents other than platelet -derived growth factor (fibroblast, nerve, and macrophage suspension) Insufficient Evidence about the effectiveness of other biological agents used for the treatment of pressure ul cers was inconclusive due to limitations in the number, size, and quality of studies ( 7 studies of various biological agents). Surgery Surgical techniques Insufficient Evidence was inconclusive as to whether one approach to closure of stage III to IV pressure ulcers wa s superior to others due to poor -quality studies and heterogeneity in patient populations and surgical procedures ( 4 studies). Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Moderate Electrical stimulation was beneficial in accelerating the rate of healing of stage II, III, and IV pressure ulcers ( 9 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Low Wound improvement of stage II, III, or IV pressure ulcers was similar with electromagnetic therapy compared with sham treatment ( 4 studies). Therapeutic ultrasound Low Wound improvement was similar with ultrasound compared with standard care or sham treat ment ( 3 studies). Negative pressure wound therapy Low Wound improvement was similar with negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care ( 3 studies). Hydrotherapy Insufficient Evidence on the effectiveness of hydrotherapy was insufficient based on 2 randomized trials evaluating different treatment modalities ( 1 of whirlpool therapy and 1 of pulsatile lavage). Light therapy (complete wound healing) Low Light therapy was similar to sham light therapy in producing complete wound healing based on 2 randomized trials. Light therapy (wound surface area reduction) Low Light therapy reduced wound surface area over time compared with standard care or sham light therapy ( 5 studies). Laser therapy Low Wound improvement was similar with laser therapy compared with sham treatment or standard care ( 4 studies). ES-16 Table A. Summary of evidence: impact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 1a. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to features of the pressure ulcers, such as anatomic site or severity at baseline? Support Support, all strategies Insufficient Only 4 studies reported results by ulcer stage or location, and the interventions, characteristics, and results varied and did not permit conclusions. Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient Only 3 of the 16 studies analyzed results by ulcer characteristics , and the impact on the conclusion was inconsistent. Local Wound Applications Local wound applications, all strategies Insufficient Few studies conducted subgroup analyses by ulcer characteristics ( 7 studies). Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Surgery Sacral compared with ischial pressure ulcers Low Sacral pressure ulcers ha d lower recurrence rates after surgery than ischial pressure ulcers ( 4 studies). Adjunctive Adjunctive, all strategies Insufficient Evidence did not permit determination as to whether the effectiveness of adjunctive therapies varied based on pressure ulcer characteristics due to heterogeneity of studies (6 studies). Key Question 1b. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including but not limited to: age, race/ethnicity, body weight, spe cific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? Support Support, all strategies Insufficient No studies were identified that allowed conclusions about the impact of patient characteristics on the effectiveness of different support surfaces in pressure ulcer wound improvement. Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heter ogeneity of studies. Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient Evidence did not permit determination as to whether patient characteristics, including baseline nutritional status, modified the effect of nutritional support on pressure ulcer healing due to a limited number of studies reporting outcomes by baseline nutritional status ( 2 studies). Local Wound Applications Local wound applications, all strategies Insufficient Studies generally did not report outcomes by patient characteristics, including incontinence and mobility ( 1 study). Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. ES-17 Table A. Summary of evidence: impact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 1b. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including but not limited to: age, race/ethnicity, body weight, specific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? (continued) Surgery Surg ical flap closure Low Spinal cord-injured patients had higher rates of recurrent pressure ulcer after surgical flap closure than other patients with pressure ulcers ( 1 study). Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low The effectiveness of electrical stimulation was similar in spinal -cord-injured patients compared with others ( 4 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Therapeutic ultrasound Negative pressure wound therapy Light therapy Laser therapy Insufficient Evidence did not permit determination as to whether the effectiveness of electromagnetic therapy compared with sham electromagnetic therapy ( 2 studies) , ultrasound therapy compared with sham ultrasound therapy , negative pressure wound therapy , light therapy , or laser therapy varied based on patient characteristics due to heterogeneity of studies and lack of reporting of specific patient characteristics. Key Question 1c. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient care settings, such as home, nursing facilit y, or hospital, or according to features of patient care settings, including but not limited to nurse/patient staffing ratio, staff education and training in wound care, the use of wound care teams, and home caregiver support and training? Support Support, all strategies Insufficient Only 1 study provided data on results by setting and none provided information on setting characteristics. Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported results by patient care settings. Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Local Wound Applications Local wound applications, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported results by patient care settings. Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Surgery Surgery, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported results by patient care settings. Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low Electrical stimulation produced similar results in a hospital compared with a rehabilitation center ( 9 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Therapeutic ultrasound Negative pressure wound therapy Light therapy Laser therapy Insufficient Due to a lack of studies comparing different settings, evidence did not permit determination as to whether the effectiveness of electromagnetic therapy compared with sham electromagnetic therapy ( 2 studies) , ultrasound therapy compared with sham ultrasound therapy , negative pressure wound therapy , light therapy , or laser therapy varied based on features of the patient care settings . ES-18 Table A. Summary of evidence: impact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 2. What are the harms of treatments for pressure ulcers? Harms: Support Support, all strategies Insufficient Few of the identified studies (7 out of 24) explicitly addressed harms attributable to support surfaces. In those where harms were mentioned, most reported no significant differences in harms across the different support surfaces. However , as the harms studied were different and were associated with different support surfaces , we were unable to summarize across studies. Harms: Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient Harms or adverse events were reported in about half of the studies (8 of 16), but the studies reported different harms, did not describe the harm, or did not specify if it was related to treatment. Harms: Local Wound Applications Dressings and topical therapies Moderate Harms reported with dressings and topical therapies for pressure ulcers most commonly included skin irritation and inflammation and tissue damage and maceration. Variability in study populations, interventions, adverse event measurement, and reporting precluded an estimate of adverse event rates for dressings and topical therapies ( 30 studies). Dressings and topical therapies Insufficient Evidence was inconclusive as to whether specific dressing types or topical therapies we re associated with fewer harms than others due to poor study quality and differential reporting of harms across studies ( 7 studies). Biological agents Insufficient Few harms were reported with biological agents, but evidence did not permit determination of the incidence of harms due to lack of precision across studies ( 5 studies). Harms: Surgery Recurrence or flap failure Low Reoperation due to recurrence or flap failure ranged from 12 to 24 percent ( 2 studies). Harms: Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low The most common adverse effect of electrical stimulation was local skin irritation (3 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Therapeutic ultrasound Negative pressure wound therapy Insufficient Due to a lack of reporting, evidence did not permit conclusions about the harms of electromagnetic therapy ( 1 study), ultrasound ( 3 studies), or negative pressure wound therapy ( 2 studies). Light therapy Low Light therapy caused no significant adverse events based on 4 randomized studies ( 4 studies). Laser therapy Low Short -term use of laser therapy caused no significant adverse events based on 3 randomized studies ( 4 studies in all). ES-19 Table A. Summary of evidence: impact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 2a. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to features of the pressure ulcers, such as anatomic site or severity at baseline? Harms: Support Support, all strategies Insufficient None of the identified studies reported if differences in harms of support surfaces var ied based on features of the pressure ulcers. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Harms: Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported harms by ulcer characteristics. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Harms: Local Wound Applications Local wound applications, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported harms by ulcer characteristics. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies . Harms: Surgery Surgery, all strategies Low Wound dehiscence wa s more common if bone was removed at time of surgical procedure ( 1 study). Ischial ulcer surgery Low Complication rates after surgery we re higher for ischial ulcers than for sacral or trochanteric ulcers ( 2 studies). Harms: Adjunctive Adjunctive, all strategies Insufficient Due to a lack of reporting, t here was inconclusive evidence to determine if differences in harms of any adjunctive therapies varied based on features of the pressure ulcers ( 3 studies of electrical stimulation). Key Question 2b. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, body weight, specific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? Harms: Support Support, all strategies Insufficient None of the identified studies reported if differences in harms of support surfaces var ied based on patient characteristics. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies . Harms: Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported harms by patient characteristics. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies . Harms: Local Wound Applications Local wound applications, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported harms by patient characteristics. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies . Harms: Surgery Surgery, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported harms by patient characteristics. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to a lack of studies and reporting. Harms: Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low Frail elderly patients experienced more adverse events with electrical stimulation compared with a younger population ( 3 studies). ES-20 Table A.

Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies and surgical procedures. Harms: Adjunctive Adjunctive, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported harms by patient care setting. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies and a lack of studies comparing different settings . Key Findings and Strength of Evidence We identified evidence addressing a variety of different support surfaces, including air - fluidized (AF) beds, alternating pressure (AP) beds and chair cushions, and low -air-loss (LAL) beds. Other types of support surfaces were evaluated only in small single studies. We found evidence of moderate strength that reductions in wound size were better with AF beds from studies that compared AF beds with other support surfaces, including standard hospital beds. Studies found no difference in wound improvement when different types of AP mattresses were compared (moderate strength of evidence). Evidence about the effectiveness of AP seat cushions was insufficient , as only two studies with very different populations were identified. There was low-strength evidence that AP beds or LAL beds led to similar wound improvement when compared with other surfaces, usually standard mattresses. The reported harms of different support surface options were minimal, al though harms wer e infrequently and inconsistently reported in support surface studies. Studies of nutritional support evaluated protein- containing nutritional supplementation and specific nutrient supplementation with vitamins or minerals, such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C ) or zinc. Studies provided moderate strength of evidence that protein supplementation result ed in wound improvement. There was low strength of evidence indicating similar results with vitamin C compared with placebo. Evidence about zinc supplementation wa s insufficient to draw ES-21 conclusions. There was insufficient evidence to adequately describe the harms of nutritional supplementation in this patient population. A wide variety of modern wound dressings have been compared with each other or with standard ca re, usually with gauze dressings. We found low -strength evidence that hydrocolloid dressings we re superior to gauze and moderate -strength evidence that hydrocolloid and foam (hydrocellular or polyurethane) dressings produced similar wound improvement. Evidence about the comparative effectiveness of other dressings \u2014hydrogels, transparent films, silicone, and alginates \u2014was insufficient to draw conclusions. We found moderate -strength evidence from four studies that radiant heat dressings accelerated the rate o f healing of stage III and IV ulcers compared with other dressings, but we did not find evidence of a benefit of radiant heat dressings in terms of complete wound healing. The most commonly evaluated topical therapies were debriding enzymes (primarily collagenase), phenytoin solution, dextranomer paste, and collagen applications. There was low - strength evidence that dextranomer wa s less effective than wound dressings. Evidence about enzymes and phenytoin was inconsistent and insufficient to draw conclusions. Collagen applications did not produce wound improvement compared with standard care based on low - strength evidence. The most commonly evaluated biological agent was platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF), for which there was low -strength evidence of ben efit compared with placebo in promoting wound improvement in severe (stage III or IV) ulcers. There was insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of other biological agents. There was moderate- strength evidence that the most common harms of wound dres sings and topical agents were dermatologic complications, including irritation, inflammation, and maceration. However, variability across studies precluded an estimate of adverse events for specific dressings or topical therapies, and evidence was insufficient to determine whether certain types of dressings or topical therapies were more likely to cause these complications than others. Few harms were reported with biological agents, but the evidence about the harms of these agents was insufficient to reach conclusions about adverse event rates. Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions about the effectiveness or harms of local wound applications across different ulcer characteristics, patient characteristics, or settings. Surgical interventions for pres sure ulcers identified in studies meeting our inclusion criteria were primarily surgical flaps, most commonly myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Studies of surgical interventions were nearly all observational , and most were conducted in single centers . There was insufficient evidence that one approach to closure of stage III to IV pressure ulcers wa s superior to others due to heterogeneity in patient populations and surgical procedures. There was low strength of evidence that sacral ulcers had a lower rate of ulcer recurrence when compared with ischial ulcers , that a higher rate of recurrent ulcers occurred among patients with spinal cord injury compared with others , that a greater wound dehiscence rate occur red with surgeries in which bone was removed as part of the operation , and that more adverse events occur red with surgery for ischial compared with sacral or trochanteric ulcers. Surgical flap failures requiring reoperation ranged from 12 percent to 24 percent. Adjunctive therapies identified in our review included electrical stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, ultrasound, negative pressure wound therapy, hydrotherapy, light therapy, and laser therapy. Evidence about other adjunctive therapies \u2014including vibration, shock wave, and hyperbaric oxygen\u2014was limited to small single studies. There was moderate -strength evidence that electrical stimulation improved healing rates, but there was insufficient evidence about the ES-22 effect of electrical stimulation on complete wound healing due to heterogeneous findings across studies. Low -strength evidence indicated that the most common adverse effect of electrical stimulation was local skin irritation and that harms were more common in frail elderly compared with younger populations. There was also low -strength evi dence indicating that electromagnetic therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and negative pressure wound therapy were similar to sham treatment or standard care in wound improvement outcomes; there was insufficient evidence to evaluate the harms of those adjunct ive therapies due to a lack of reporting of harms. Light therapy provided benefit in terms of wound area reduction, but not in terms of complete wound healing, and it was not associated with significant adverse events based on low -strength evidence. There was low -strength evidence that laser therapy was not associated with significant adverse events, but also that it did not provide wound improvement over sham or standard treatment. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about hydrotherapy due to the paucity of studies. Discussion Findings in Relationship to What I s Already Known Treatments for pressure ulcers have been described and evaluated with varying degrees of rigor in the past (e.g., Lyder, 20034). A recent systematic review by Reddy and colleagues , published in December 2008, evaluated 103 randomized trials published during or prior to August 2008. 10 The review included studies evaluating support surfaces, nutritional supplements, wound dressings, biological agents, and adjunctive therapies. Our review included evaluations of those treatment categories and additionally evaluated surgical interventions. We included observational studies of pressure ulcer treatments, included assessments of treatment harms, and expanded the search to in clude studies published through June 2012. We assessed treatment harms in studies published through June 2012. Our review also included observational studies in addition to clinical trials in an effort to more comprehensively review the relevant literature . The findings of the prior systematic review were qualitatively similar to ours, with a few exceptions. In the support surface category, Reddy and colleagues reported that AP surfaces and LAL beds were not superior to standard nonpowered surfaces, which is similar to our findings. 10 They did not, however, report specifically on AF beds, as only one of the five studies of AF beds we included in our review w as retrieved in their literature search. Our finding that there was moderate- strength evidence that A F beds were more effective than other surfaces in achieving wound area reduction is based on the finding s from these additional studies. Additional systematic reviews on the use of support surfaces have been published by the Cochrane Collaboration. A recent report 17 update d earlier versions18-20 and separated treatment from prevention. This review summarized 18 trials . (Observational studies were not included.) This review, like ours, found some evidence that AF beds led to reductions in pressure ulcer size and no significant effect of LAL beds on healing. Unlike our review, the Cochrane review reported some benefit from the use of sheepskins, but this wa s based on a study that was excluded from our review because it was published in 1964. Finally, the authors of this review found, as we did, that the evidence base was weak, with studies that were small, had serious methodological limitations , and often did not report key elements such as variance data, p- values, and the characteristics of the surfaces used as the comparator s. Reddy and colleagues reported that, overall, nutritional supplements did not provide benefit in terms of ulcer healing, but that protein supplementation may have produce d wound ES-23 improvement.10 Our findings were similar. We found moderate -strength evidence that protein supplementation result ed in wound size reduction, but studies did not provide evidence of an effect on complete wound healing. The Cochrane Collaboration published a 2008 systematic review on nutritional interventions to trea t and prevent pressure ulcers. The authors were unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of nutritional interventions in the treatment of pressure ulcers due to the small number and poor quality of the available studies. 21 We found limited evide nce to support the use of certain dressings and topical therapies over others in terms of wound improvement. Our findings were similar to the conclusions drawn by Reddy and colleagues . 10 Our finding that hydrocolloid dressings are likely to be superior to gauze in promoting wound improvement was similar to the conclusion in two other systematic reviews. 22,23 A review by Chaby and colleagues22 found equivalence between hydrocolloid and foam dressings in promoting wound improvement, a finding supported by our meta -analysis of eight studies comparing those dressing types. Both Reddy and colleagues and Chaby and colleagues highlighted a study demonstrating the superiority of alginate dressings to dextranomer paste.10,22 We also found dextranomer paste to be inferior to dressing but considered the evidence for this to be low strength. We found moderate- strength evidence that radiant heat dressings accelerated the rate of wound area reduction, bu t we did not find evidence of a benefit of radiant heat dressings in terms of complete wound healing. Like Reddy and colleagues , we found a potential benefit, based on low -strength evidence, for platelet -derived growth factor in promoting wound improvement in stage III and IV ulcers.10 We found evidence to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of eight adjunctive therapies used in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Of these, none demonstrated consistent effectiveness in complete wound healing. Electrical s timulation, electromagnetic therapy, and light therapy show ed a tendency for wound improvement, while other adjunctive therapies showed no evidence of effectiveness. Our findings are consistent with the findings of two prior systematic reviews of electrical stimulation for pressure ulcers, 10,24 two systematic reviews of therapeutic ultrasound,10,25 one prior systematic review o f negative pressure wound therapy,10 and two systematic reviews o f laser therapy.10,26 Our findings of no significant difference in wound improvement with electromagnetic therapy (EMT ) are consistent with those of a prior Cochrane review.27 Although a trend toward improvement in rate of healing with EMT has been observed, consistent with prior systematic reviews,10,28 we found that the clinical significance of this trend remains unknown. Applicability The applicability of our findings to real -world clinical settings is supported by several features of the body of literature we reviewed. First, the populations studied included a broad representation of patients with pressure ulcers \u2014elderly patients, general populations of patients with limited mobility, and patients with spinal cord injury \u2014cared for in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, wound care clinics, and at home. Second, the interventions represented most of the therapeutic modalities commonly used in clinical settings. Comparators were also commonly used therapies and often included standard care as defined by local practice patterns. In some studies thi s included use of comparators that may not be considered best practices, such as standard hospital beds and plain gauze dressings. However, as these treatment strategies remain in use in many settings, both in the United States and other countries, we retained these studies in our review. ES-24 Other features of the studies we identified, however, limited the applicability of our findings. First, the outcome in many studies was wound size (area, volume, or depth) reduction as opposed to complete wound healing. A lthough wound size reduction is a reasonable measure of therapeutic effect, in clinical practice the goal of therapy is almost always complete w ound healing, making wound size reduction a surrogate outcome with less clinical significance than complete wound healing. A principal reason for findings of wound size reduction without complete wound healing was the short duration of most trials. Complet e healing takes time. Interventions lasting only a few weeks (as was the case for most of the trials included in our review) are less likely to achieve complete wound healing than interventions carried out for periods long enough for complete healing to oc cur (as would be the case in clinical practice). A second reason that applicability is limited is that the treatment of pressure ulcers in clinical practice often involves multiple concurrent therapies, such as support surfaces, nutritional supplementation, biological or topical therapies, and adjunctive interventions. No studies compared one combination of concurrent or sequential therapies with another, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of one compared with another.A second issue affecting applicability is that treatment of pressure ulcers is typically multimodal and often involves the sequential use of different therapies. In practice, the relevant question is often not \"Which therapy works best ?\" but rather \"W hich combination of therapies works best ?\" and \"When is a specific treatment indicated ?\" Most comparative studies of pressure ulcer treatments examined head -to-head comparisons of single treatment modalities. Although contextual data and cointerventions were sometimes report ed, integrating those data to answer questions about treatment combinations and timing was difficult. Studies of surgery are additionally limited by the fact that most were observational and conducted in one or, at most, a few centers. Since surgical technique and quality are often operator and/or site dependent, and because outcomes are influenced by local practices, staffing, and other features of the environment, it is difficult to generalize the findings of studies of surgery included in this review. Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking The limitations in applicability discussed above, as well as the limitations of the evidence base discussed below, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions with implications for clinical and policy dec isionmaking. Notably, we generated no findings that were supported by high - strength evidence and only a few findings supported by moderate -strength evidence. Most findings were based on low -strength evidence, and for many issues there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions. The finding that AF beds promote wound improvement compared with other surfaces might warrant consideration of this technology. However, it is important to point out that while the five studies of these beds had consistent fi ndings, they are somewhat dated and most compared AF beds with standard beds rather than with other specialized options. Decisions about investments in support surfaces would benefit from head- to-head trials of current technologies that measure effectivene ss in terms of complete wound healing, not only reduction in wound size. Nutritional supplementation may provide benefit in terms of wound improvement, al though the effects of nutritional supplementation were not dramatic and it was not clear from the stu dies in our review whether nutritional supplementation was beneficial to all patients or only those with evidence of nutritional deficiencies. Because nutritional support is commonly prescribed for ill or debilitated patients with evidence of malnutrition , it is not clear whether nutritional support ES-25 affects ulcer healing and whether patients without evidence of malnutrition might benefit from nutritional supplementation. Decisions about dressings and topical applications are often guided by matching the pri mary functions of different dressings (e.g., absorbent and hydrating) with the primary considerations for treatment of individual ulcers (e.g., dryness, contamination risk, and exudate). Given the wide array of options, comparative effectiveness and harms data have great potential to guide individualized decisionmaking. We found limited evidence, however, to provide such guidance. Overall, we did not find substantial evidence to support certain local wound applications over others. There was evidence to sug gest that radiant heat improved the pace of wound healing, but not complete wound healing. Some biological agents showed promise for the treatment of severe ulcers, but the evidence was not substantial. In light of the cost of these agents, more and better evidence is likely needed before they are widely adopted. Surgery is typically reserved for refractory ulcers unlikely to heal with conservative management. Evidence about surgery is limited to mainly single -center observational studies. However , we found some evidence to inform decisions and expectations about which ulcers will fare best with surgical intervention and which surgeries are likely to produce the lowest complication rates. The influence of those findings on clinical decisionmaking s hould be tempered by the low quality of the studies that produced the findings and the potentially limited generalizability of the findings across sites and surgeons. Adjunctive therapies include therapies that are variably used in the treatment of pressur e ulcers. Our review revealed moderate -strength evidence that electrical stimulation accelerated healing but did not otherwise produce findings that would support greater use of adjunctive therapies for the goal of wound healing. Limitations of the Comparative Effectiveness Review Process The most important potential limitation of our review is that important studies whose findings might influence clinical and policy decisionmaking may not have been identified. We conducted a comprehensive, broadly inclusive search that produced 7,274 study titles and abstracts. Although we excluded studies published before 1985, we do not believe that important studies of therapies used in current practice were missed . The general consistency of our findings with those of other systematic reviews, which included studies published prior to 1985, provides some assurance that our review was not biased by our timeframe selection. Although we did not include foreign- language studies, we identified these studies and, ba sed on review of their abstracts, found that none would have altered our conclusions. Our review focused on clinical outcomes of pressure ulcer treatments, particularly wound improvement. Other outcomes, such as ease of use and nursing/staff time, might al so influence treatment decisions but were beyond the scope of our review. Finally, we excluded studies of the treatment of nonpressure ulcers. To the extent that evidence for interventions studied in other types of wounds, including venous ulcers, is appli cable to the treatment of pressure ulcers, our review may have underestimated the quantity and quality of the body of evidence for these interventions. There may have been biased reporting of results in the literature such that only selected studies were published and retrievable, and that published studies may have been affected by conflicts of interest. Reporting bias and conflicts of interest are concerns with any systematic review. We were not able to conduct quantitative analyses to evaluate the possi bility of reporting bias for most of our findings because the heterogeneity across studies in our review, and in many cases the lack of key information needed to perform quantitative syntheses, generally precluded ES-26 meaningful comparison of effect sizes. Mit igating against the likelihood of reporting bias in our review, however, is the fact that the majority of studies in our review were small (most fewer than 100 patients, many fewer than 50) , and most reported no significant effect of the intervention. Reporting bias typically results in selective publication of larger studies and/or those with positive findings, and studies biased by conflict s of interest would also be more likely to report positive findings. We also conducted gray literature searches to look for unpublished data and did not find evidence of unreported studies. We took several measures to guard against the influence of bias in our identification and evaluation of studies. Abstracts were reviewed by at least two team members, including a clinician/senior investigator. Studies were extracted based on prespecified data elements, extraction done by one team member was checked by another, and quality ratin g of studies was performed by two team members , with disagreements adjudicated by consensus. Rating of elements of strength of evidence was discussed and calibrated among team members. Limitations of the Evidence Base The main limitation of the evidence base in our review was poor study quality. Most trials did not specify randomization method, did not conceal allocation, and did not mask outcomes assessment. Most studies were small , and many were underpowered to detect significant differences. Studies we re also highly variable in terms of patient populations ; ulcer characteristics (e.g., anatomic site, duration, and stage) ; interventions (even within a given intervention category such as different types of foam dressings) ; and comparators (especially in implementation of standard, or usual, care), limiting our ability to combine or compare results across studies. Another major limitation of the evidence base relates to the most common outcome measure: wound size reduction. Comparing changes in the size of pressure ulcers poses several measurement issues. For example, reduction in the size of larger and smaller pressure ulcers is hard to compare. Healing could involve \"bridges\" that split a large ulcer into two. In addition, measurement in person or from tr acings or photographs can be difficult, especially when measurement and photographic techniques are not standardized across studies. Finally, a major limitation of studies in our review was the duration of interventions and followup periods, typically a f ew weeks. Many pressure ulcers, especially more severe ulcers, may take months, or even years, to heal. Many of the studies in our review were implemented over a period that did not necessarily allow for complete ulcer healing , and therefore detection of significant differences in ulcer healing across groups. However, one strength in this body of literature was that most studies use d intention -to-treat analyses. Research Gaps The major gaps in research identified by our review relate to the limitations of the evidence base, as described above. Future studies with larger sample sizes, more rigorous adherence to methodological standards for clinical trials or observational studies, longer followup periods, standardization of comparators, and more standardized and clinically meaningful outcome measures (including more patient -centered outcomes , such as quality of life and pain) are needed to inform clinical practice and policy. Inclusion of information about cointerventions and the timing of studied intervention s in relation to other interventions would improve the applicability of study findings. Similarly, stratification of findings by patient characteristics (e.g., comorbidities, ulcer stage) would help determine the applicability of different interventions for ES-27 specific patients and situations. It is particularly important for future studies to report findings according to ulcer stage, as the rate of healing, conditions necessary to promote healing, and therefore treatment choices may differ for partial - and full- thickness ulcers. Decisions about defining other aspects of patient populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, study timing and duration, and study settings should be guided by clinical practice, expertise, and factors most relevant to decisionm akers, including patients, clinicians, and policymakers. For several interventions, there was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions due to small sample sizes or mixed results across studies. Th ese interventions included AP beds compared with other surfaces, topical debriding enzymes, phenytoin, and growth factors. Future studies should clarify the comparative effectiveness of these interventions and identify possible reasons for disparate results. For other interventions, findings indicated a possible benefit, but the strength of evidence was low due to study quality, duration, sample size, and measured outcomes (wound size reduction rather than complete wound healing). These interventions included platelet -derived growth factor and light therapy. Future studies are needed to confirm or refute the effectiveness of these interventions. As mentioned, further study is warranted comparing AF beds with more modern support surfaces and evaluating comparative effectiveness in terms of complete wound healing. Similarly, in light of findings suggesting a benefit for radiant heat dressings and electrical stimulation in terms of wound healing rate, further study should compare these technologies with other treatments, with sufficient followup to evaluate complete wound healing. There was limited evidence to support the use of nutritional supplements as a component of pressure ulcer care, but few studies examined whether supplementation might have a differential effect for patients with and without baseline nutritio nal deficiencies. Future studies sh ould address this issue. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is one clinical area that our TEP identified as high priority but for which we found limited evidence. Although studies and systematic reviews have evaluated this treatme nt in chronic wounds generally, its utility among patients with pressure ulcers specifically has undergone limited evaluation. Conclusions Choices of treatments for pressure ulcer s are often guided by product availability, local practice patterns, and indi vidualized decisionmaking based on specific patients and the features of a given pressure ulcer. Our review did not generate many findings to guide those choices based on evidence. We found limited evidence to draw firm conclusions about the best approaches for treating pressure ulcers. This finding is consistent with that of a prior systematic review addressing most of the same treatment categories included in our review. 10 We found evidence from five studies indicating greater wound improvement with AF b eds over other support surfaces, from four studies indicating a benefit of radiant heat dressings over other dressings, and from nine studies indicating a benefit of electrical stimulation. However, the benefit observed in all cases was wound size reduction or better healing rates rather than completely healed wounds, and evidence for the benefit of support surfaces in promoting wound improvement was based primarily on comparisons of AF beds with hospital beds that may not be considered the standard of care in the field. The balance of costs and potential harms of those technologies against the benefits observed is unclear. ES-28 Studies generally did not provide evidence to support the use of one type of commonly used wound dressing over another. There was evide nce that hydrocolloid and foam dressings performed similarly, but evidence for other dressing types \u2014hydrogels, alginates, transparent films, and silicone dressings \u2014compared with each other or with standard gauze dressings was limited. Similarly, there was low -strength or insufficient evidence to judge the balance of effectiveness and harms for nutritional supplementation, topical therapies, biological agents, surgical interventions, and adjunctive therapies other than electrical stimulation. Advancing pressure ulcer care will require more rigorous study to solidify the evidence base for this widely used set of treatments. ES-29 References 1. Bergstrom N, Bennett MA, Carlson CE, et al.

Pressure ulcers affect up to three million adults in the United States. Areas of the body prone to the development of pressure ulcers are depicted in Figure 1. Estimates of the incidence of pressure ulcers vary according to the settin g, with ranges of 0.4 to 38.0 percent in acute -care hospitals, 2.2 to 23.9 percent in long -term nursing facilities, and 0 to 17 percent in home care.1,2 A review of international pressure ulcer prevalence surveys found an overall prevalence in acute and long-term care settings of 9.2 to 11.1 percent between 1989 and 1995 and a prevalence of 14.7 to 15.5 percent between 1999 and 2005. 3 Figure 1. Common pressure ulcer sites Oregon EPC Pressure ulcer healing rates - which are dependent on comorbidities, clinical interventions, and severit y of the ulcer - vary considerably. Ulcer severity is assessed using a variety of different staging or grading systems; the United States National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) staging system is the most commonly used (Figure 2). Comorbidities predisposing toward pressure ulcer development and affecting ulcer healing include those affecting patient mobility (e.g., spinal cord injury), wound environments (e.g., incontinence), and wound healing (e.g., diabetes, vascular disease). Delayed healing can a dd to the length of hospitalization and impede return to full functioning. 2 Data on the costs of trea tment for a pressure ulcer vary, but some estimates range between $37,800 and $70,000 per ulcer , with total annual costs for pressure ulcers in the United States as high as $11 billion.1,4 Pressure ulcers are used as an indicator of quality for long -term care facilities , and progression of pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients is often considered an avoidable complication representing failure of inpatient management. Given the negative impact pressure ulcer s have on health status and patient quality of life , as well as health care costs, treatments are needed that promote healing, shorten healing time, minimize the risk of complications, and increase the l ikelihood of complete healing. Pressure ulcer treatment involves a variety of different approaches, including interventions to treat the conditions that give rise to pr essure ulcers (support surfaces and nutritional support), interventions to protect and promote healing of the ulcer itself (wound dressings, topical applications, and various adjunctive therapies including vacuum -assisted closure, ultrasound 2 therapy, electrical stimulation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), and surgical repair of the ulcer.1,4 Most ulcers are treated using a combination of these approaches. Standards of care for pressure ulcer treatment are typically guided by clinical practice guidelines, such as those developed by the NPUAP, but also vary by patient -related factors such as com orbidities and nutritional status, 5 local practice patterns, and the stage and features of the wound. Current guidelines primarily reflect expert opinions. An examination of the comparative effectiveness and harms of the wide variety of different therapies and approaches to treating pressure ulcers is important to guide clinical practice. Figure 2. National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel pressure ulcer stages Scope and Key Questions This topic was selected for review based on two separate nominations that also included questions related to risk assessment and prevention of pressure ulcers. This report addresses the comparative effectiveness of various pressure ulcer treatment approach es while the topic of prevention, including secondary prevention of recurrent pressure ulcers, is addressed in a companion report. Both reports are intended to serve as the foundation for the development of updated guidelines on pressure ulcer prevention a nd treatment. The key questions were developed with input from Key Informants , including clinicians, wound care researchers, and patient advocates. The analytic framework and key questions used a N ot pictured. NPUAP copyright, photos used with permission . Stage: I Intact skin with non - blanchable redness of a localized area usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching; its color may differ from the surrounding area. Stage: III Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscles are not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining and tunneling. Stage: IV Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often includes undermining and tunneling. Stage: II Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum - filled blister .

The analytic framework shows the target populations, interventions, outcomes , and harms that we evaluated. The general categories of treatm ent included in this report are support surfaces, nutritional supplements, local wound applications (including wound dressings, t opical therapies, and biological agents), surgical procedures, and various adjunctive therapies. Other facets of pressure ulcer care (e.g., repositioning, nonsurgical wound debridement, and wound cleansing) were not considered areas where comparative effectiveness evidence was likely to be found or to significantly influence clinical care. We evaluated the evidence on comparisons within the general categories (for example, comparisons between two types of dressings). We also sought direct evidence on compar isons across the general categories (for example, dressings vs. support surfaces). This review also included an assessment of adverse effects or harms associated with pressure ulcer treatment, such as dermatologic complications, bleeding, pain, or infection. Finally, we included an assessment of future research needs on this important clinical topic. 4 Figure 3. Analytic framework: Pressure ulcer treatment strategies 5 Key Question 1. In adults with pressure ulcers, what is the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for improved health outcomes including but not limited to: complete wound healing, healing time, reduced wound surface area, pain, and prevention of serious complications of inf ection? Key Question 1a. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to features of the pressure ulcers, such as anatomic site or severity at baseline? Key Question 1b. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strateg ies differ according to patient characteristics, including , but not limited to: age, race/ethnicity, body weight. specific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? Key Question 1c. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient care settings such as home, nursing facility, or hospital, or according to features of patient care settings, including , but not limited to , nurse/patien t staffing ratio, staff education and training in wound care, the use of wound care teams, and home caregiver support and training? Key Question 2. What are the harms of treatments for pressure ulcers? Key Question 2a. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to features of the pressure ulcers, such as anatomic site or severity at baseline? Key Question 2b. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including: age, race/ethnicity, body weight, specific med ical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? Key Question 2c. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to patient care settings such as home, nursing facility, or hospital, or according to features of patient care settings, including , but not limited to , nurse/patient staffing ratio, staff education and training in wound care, the use of wound care teams, and home caregiver support and training? Population and C onditions of Interest The population studied was adults ages 18 and older with a pressure ulcer. Patients with pressure ulcers usually also have limited or impaired mobility and suffer from other chronic illnesses. Pressure ulcers are most common in the e lderly or people with spinal cord injuries or other conditions that restrict mobility. Patients with non pressure -related ulcers, including , but not limited to , venous ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, were excluded because treatment considerations for these patients may differ significantly from those for pressure ulcers. A systematic review of treatment for chronic venous ulcers, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) , is in progress. We excluded children because this topic was o riginally nominated and scoped for adults. a aAlthough treatment approaches for children with pressure ulcers may be similar to those for adults, other factors may influence the effectiven ess differently in this population, including setting, caregiver attention, healing potential, and comorbidities. Key Informants agreed with the broadly defined proposed population of interest as \"adults with pressure ulcers.\" They endorsed the proposed list of included patient characteristics that should be considered, but they also noted that \"adults with pressure ulcers\" are a heterogeneous group and that variability in the comparative effectiveness of pressure ulcer treatments may be related to a large number of patient characteristics. In addition to age, sex, 6 race/ethni city, socioeconomic status, and diverse specific medical comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and dementia), many informants suggested that we include specific known risk factors for pressure ulcers (e.g., nutritional status, incontinenc e, peripheral vascular disease, mobility limitations, and functional ability). See Appendix B for detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Interventions and Comparators Various treatment strategies for pressure ulcers were addressed, including , but not l imited to , therapies that address the underlying contributing factors (e.g., support surfaces and nutritional supplements), therapies that address local wound care (e.g., wound dressings, topical therapies, and biological agents), surgical repair, and adjunctive therapies (e.g., electrical stimulation). The comparative effectiveness and harms of other interventions (e.g., repositioning, wound debridement, and wound cleansing) were considered but not reviewed, based on input from the Technical Expert Panel ( TEP) that these modalities were either considered standard care or lacked comparative studies. Combined treatment modalities ( cointerventions) , such as comparison of two treatments in combination compared with a single treatment , were also evaluated . Comparators included placebo or active control, usual care, or other interventions. In some cases, particularly in older studies, newer interventions were compared to older ones that might no longer be considered standard care in the field. However, in man y care settings these applications (e.g., gauze dressings, standard hospital beds) are still used, and we therefore included studies using those types of comparators because of their continued relevance in some treatment settings . Outcomes The most commonly examined outcomes were various measures of wound improvement . Some studies examined complete wound healing as the primary outcome, though many studies evaluated wound size reduction. Based on input from the TEP, we considered complete wound healing to b e the principal health outcome of interest. However, we also considered other indicators of \"wound improvement\" in synthesizing evidence. Notably, many studies reported findings in terms of wound size reduction rather than complete wound healing. We considered wound size reduction to be an important outcome for two reasons. First, it represents a necessary intermediate step towards the principal outcome of complete wound healing (i.e., complete wound healing can be considered 100 percent wound size reduction) . Second, the likelihood of complete wound healing is lower for larger or higher -stage ulcers and therapies deployed for more advanced ulcers may not be expected to achieve complete wound healing over the course of several weeks, which was the duration of most of the studies in our review. Thus, in summarizing the evidence about a given treatment, we considered wound size reduction to be part of the continuum of the outcome of \"wound healing,\" but we gave more weight to evidence of complete wound healing. Some studies used composite outcome measures commonly used to monitor pressure ulcer status. The Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) tool combines wound surface area, amount of wound exudate, and tissue appearance. 6 The Pressure Sore Status Tool (PSST ) considers multiple ulcer characteristics including dimensions, exudate, and tissue appearance.7 Other studies reported outcomes in terms of wound healing rate. We included these outcomes , when reported in studies , as indicators of \"wound improvement\" but prioritized findings for complete wound healing , as noted above, based on feedback from the TEP. Other outcomes included wound healing rate and time, pain, and avoidance of serious complications of infection. For harms of treatment , we 7 evaluated pain, dermatologic complications, bleeding, infection, and other adverse outcomes as reported in identified studies. Timing We did not apply minimum followup duration for studies. Setting Settings included patient care settings, such as hom e, nursing facility, or hospital. 8 Methods The methods for this comparative effectiveness review (CER) follow the methods suggested in the AHRQ \" Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews \"8 and the standards suggested by the Ins titute of Medicine for conducting systematic reviews.9 Topic Refinement and Review Protocol The key questions for this CER were developed with input from Key Informants , representing clinicians, wound care researchers, and patient advocates, who helped ref ine key questions, identify important methodological and clinical issues, and define parameters for the review of evidence. The revised key questions were then posted to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) public Web site for a four -week comment period. AHRQ and the Evidence -based Practice Center ( EPC) agreed upon the final key questions after reviewing the public comments and receiving additional input from a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) convened for this report. The protocol for the CER was reviewed by the TEP and is available from the AHRQ group of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in pressure ulcer treatment and research was selected to serve on the TEP to provide high -level content and methodological expertise throughout the development of the review. Participants included leaders in the areas of pressure ulcer treatment and research, wound care and physical therapy, and plastic and reconstructive s urgery, as well as patient safety advocates and United States National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel ( NPUAP ) members. TEP members disclosed all financial or other conflicts of interest prior to participation. The AHRQ Task Order Officer and the authors rev iewed the disclosures and determined the panel members had no conflicts of interest that precluded participation. Search Strategy For the primary literature we searched (through June 2012) MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), EBM Reviews (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology Assessment (see Appendix A for details) . The most relevant evidence about modalities and pr ocedures currently used for treating pressure ulcers is found in studies conducted within the last 25 years. For this reason we have set the search start date at 1985. This decision was affirmed by the Key Informants and TEP. Gray literature was identified by soliciting stakeholders, TEP recommendations, and searching relevant Web sites, including clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalStudyResults.org, and the W orld H ealth Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), regulatory documents (Drugs@FDA and Devices@FDA), conference proceedings and dissertations (Conference Papers Index [ProQuest CSA]), Scopus (Elsevier), Dissertations & Theses (ProQuest UMI), and individual product Web sites. An additi onal, focused MEDLINE search on hyperbaric oxygen for the treatment of pressure ulcers was conducted at the recommendation of the TEP due to the paucity of evidence on this subject obtained from the original search. Scientific information packets (SIPs) were requested from identified drug and device manufacturers, and a notice inviting submission of relevant scientific information was published in the Federal Register. All interested parties had the opportunity to submit data for this review using 9 the AHR Q Effective Health Care publicly accessible online SIP portal (http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/submit -scientific -information -packets/). Reviewers evaluated the SIPs received for data relevant to our review. Additional studies were identified by reviewing the reference lists of published clinical trials, systematic reviews, and review articles. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies were based on the key questions and the populations, interventions , comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting (PICOTS) approach. We used the following inclusion criteria ( See Appendix B for details): Populations: Stu dies were limited to of adults age 18 years and older being treated for existing pressure ulcers. Subgroups were defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and diverse specific medical comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, end -stage renal disease, and dementia), and patients with specific known risk factors for pressure ulcers (e.g., nutritional status, incontinence, peripheral vascular disease, mobility limitations, and functional ability). Studies conducted in populations including children, adolescents, and patients with nonpressure -related ulcers, including , but not limited to , venous ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, were excluded because treatment considerations for these patients may differ significantly from those for adults with pressure ulcers. Interventions: For efficacy and effectiveness assessments, all studies of interventio ns for treatment of pressure ulcers meeting the requirements of the PICOTS an d key questions were included. Treatments for pressure ulcers included, but were not limited to, support surfaces, nutritional supplementation, wound dressings, topical therapies, biological agents, and surgical repair. Adjunctive therapies included electrical stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, ultrasound, negative pressure wound therapy, light therapy, laser therapy, hydrotherapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Comparators: Com parators i ncluded usual care, placebo or sham treatment , no treatment, or different treatment interventions. Studies with no comparator were not considered in our evaluation of comparative effectiveness. They were included for the assessment of harms if th ey reported on harms of treatments for which data on comparative effectiveness were available in other studies . Outcomes: Studies reporting clinical outcomes of complete wound healing, wound size (surface area, volume, depth) reduction, pain, prevention of sepsis, prevention of osteomyelitis, recurrence rate, and harms of treatment (including but not limited to pain, dermatologic complications, bleeding, and infection) were included. Studies of nonpressure -related ulcers were not included. We excluded studi es that only evaluated nonclinical outcomes including ease of use, comfort, or nursing time required to administer the intervention. Timing: No minimum followup time was required. We limited our search to publications and investigations conducted from 1985 to June 2012. Setting: We included studies conducted in patient -care settings such as home, nursing facility, or hospitals. We excluded studies in hospice settings if complete wound healing was not an outcome measured. Study design: We included randomized trials, cohort studies, and case -control studies pertinent to all key questions. If such studies were not available, we included cross -sectional studies and intervention series studies. Systematic reviews were used as background information 10 or to ensure c ompleteness of the literature search. Case studies of only one patient were not included. For studies of surgical interventions, we initially planned to include controlled trials, observational studies with at least two compar ison groups, and noncomparative intervention series only if they were multicenter series with a population of 100 patients or more. An initial scan of the literature, however, revealed that studies of surgical interventions revealed primarily small series of sp ecific surgical techniques performed at single centers. Because surgical outcomes are heavily influenced by individual surgeons, local practice patterns, and other contextual factors, the TEP raised concern that data from these small single- site studies (n < 50) would have limited generalizability and that they would not provide a sound basis for making indirect comparisons across studies. We therefore excluded small (n<50) single -site studies reporting the results of specific surgical techniques for pressur e ulcer management, but expanded our inclusion criteria to include single -center intervention series reporting a large series (n 50) of patients undergoing surgery for pressure ulcer. We included studies of any size that provided direct, head- to-head compa risons of different surgical techniques. According to guidance from the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), and suggestions of literature from our Key Informants, the most relevant evidence about modalities and procedures for treating pressure ulcers used in clinical practice today comes from investigations conducted within the past 25 years . Therefore we limited the search to 1985 to present. Guidance from the TEP indicated that current literature (1985 to present) not only captures historicall y significant treatments and evidence, but also provides the most current information and treatments currently used in clinical practice. Non-English language studies were included in the abstract triage , but translation for full -text review was not feasib le. Gray literature including unpublished data, abstracts, dissertations, and SIPs were reviewed to determine if they added additional and meaningful data beyond the literature included in this review and should also be included. Study Selection To calibrate reviewer agreement and consistency in study selection, each reviewer evaluated the same set of 200 citations for inclusion and kappa values were calculated to estimate inter - reviewer reliability. After discussing and reconciling disagreements between re viewers, the same four team members reviewed an additional 100 citations. This process was continued until a kappa value of greater than 0.50 for each pair of reviewers was reached. For the remaining references , each reviewer evaluated each title and abstr act for inclusion and exclusion, using the pre - established inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine eligibility for inclusion in the evidence synthesis. To ensure accuracy, a senior investigator/clinician conducted secondary reviews of all excluded abstracts. All citations deemed appropriate for inclusion by one or both of the reviewers were retrieved for full -text review. Full-text article s were independently reviewed by two team members. When the two team members did not agree on inclusion or exclusion of an article, they met to discuss and reach consensus, and then the article was either included or excluded accordingly. If consensus was not reached by the two initial reviewers, a senior investigator reviewed the article and adjudicated the decision on inclusion or exclusion. Appendix E contains a record of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion. 11 Data Extraction Data from included studies were extracted into evidence tables and entered into electronic databases using Microsoft Excel\u00ae and Distiller SR systematic review software. The data extracted into evidence tables included : study design; year, setting, dura tion, and study inclusion and exclusion criteria; population and clinical characteristics , including sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, funct ional ability, and ulcer stage; intervention characteristics; results for each outcome of interest; and withdrawals due to adverse events. Outcomes of interest for effectiveness were wound improvement - as determined by complete wound healing, healing rate or time, or reduction in wound size (surface area, volume, depth) - reduction in pain, prevention of serious complications of infection such as sepsis or osteomyelitis, and ulcer recurrence rates. Outcomes of interest for harms were pain, dermatologic reactions, bleeding, and complications including , but not limited to , infection and need for surgical intervention. Data on settings included patient care settings such as long -term care or nursing facilit y, hospital, and community. If available, we also extracted the number of patients randomized relative to the number of patients enrolled, how similar those patients were to the target population, and the funding source. Non comparative observational studies were included if they evaluated harms of treatments for which comparative effectiveness evidence was available in other studies. These non comparative observational studies were used for Key Question 2 (evaluation of harms) and were rated for study quality but were not formally extracted into evidence tables , due to the paucity of data they contained. We recorded intention -to-treat results when available. All summary measure data were collected as available and presented in the individual studies, including , but not limited to, percentage of complete wound he aling, relative risk and risk ratios, confidence intervals, and significance values . A second team member verified all study data extraction for accuracy and completeness. One of the chall enges in extracting data from pressure ulcer studies is that variou s systems have been used to assess the severity of pressure ulcers. Most use a four -stage categorization with higher numbers indicating higher severity.10 In 2007 NPUAP redefined their four -stage classification system that defines the pressure ulcer based on depth and tissue involvement (Figure 2). Stage I is defined as superficial erythema, stage II as partial thickness ulceration, stage III as full thickness ulceration, and stage IV as full thickness with involvement of muscle and bone. A corresponding four -stage classification sys tem was similarly adopted by EPUAP . Given that the stages are based on depth and tissue involvement, when an ulcer has overlying purulent material or eschar prohibiting the ability to determine the depth or extent of tissue invol vement, the ulcer is classified as unstageable, or stage X. Discolored localized areas of intact skin that may indicate pressure -related injury to subcutaneous tissue are categorized as suspected deep tissue injuries . A description of the most commonly use d systems to classify pressure ulcers prior to adapting the NPUAP system is reviewed in Appendix C and aligned with the current corresponding NPUAP stage. In order to allow comparability across studies, we extracted the stage or grade reported, but used t he corresponding NPUAP stage in summary tables and text when possible. Quality Assessment of Individual Studies In this report, risk of bias is denoted as quality, with the following summary categories: Good quality is defined as a low risk of bias. Fair q uality is defined as a moderate risk of bias. Poor quality is defined as a high risk of bias. 12 We used predefined criteria to assess the quality of controlled trials and observational studies at the individual study level (Appendix F). We also adapted criteria from methods proposed by Downs and Black11,12 (observational studies) and methods developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.12,13 We rated the quality of each controlled trial based on the methods described in published reports about ra ndomization and allocation concealment; the similarity of compared groups at baseline; maintenance of comparable groups; adequate reporting of dropouts, attrition, crossover, adherence, and contamination; loss to followup; the use of intention- to-treat ana lysis; and ascertainment of outcomes. 12 Individual studies were rated as \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor\" (see Appendix F). Studies rated \"good\" have the least risk of bias and results are considered valid. Good- quality studies include clear descriptions of the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups; a valid method for allocation of patients to treatment; low dropout rates and clear reporting of dropouts; appropriate means for preventing bias; and appropriate measurement of outcomes. Studies rat ed \"fair\" do not meet all the criteria for a rating of good quality, but no flaw is likely to cause major bias. The study may be missing information, making it difficult to assess limitations and potential problems. The \"fair\" quality category is broad, an d studies with this rating vary in their strengths and weaknesses: the results of some fair -quality studies are likely to be valid, while others are only probably valid. Studies rated \"poor\" have significant flaws that imply biases of various types that ma y invalidate the results. They have a serious or \"fatal\" flaw in design, analysis, or reporting; large amounts of missing information; discrepancies in reporting; or serious problems in the delivery of the intervention. The results of these studies are at least as likely to reflect flaws in the study design as they are to reflect the true differences between the interventions that were compared. We did not exclude studies rated poor quality a priori , but poor -quality studies were considered to be less valid than higher -quality studies when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies between studies were present. Data Synthesis Due to the heterogeneity of outcomes reported, variation in the comparators to which interventions were compared, and the limited number and quality of studies for specific treatment comparisons, quantitative analysis was not appropriate for most bodies of literature included in this review. For most comparisons, we synthesized data qualitatively. We evaluated the approp riateness of meta- analysis based on clinical and methodological diversity of studies and statistical heterogeneity. We conducted meta- analysis in selected instances (when the number, quality, and homogeneity of studies permitted) for comparisons examining the outcome of complete wound healing. We chose to limit meta -analysis to the outcome of complete wound healing because of ( a) wide variability in the measurement of other outcomes including wound size reduction and ( b) indication from the TEP that complet e wound healing was the principal health outcome of interest. When meta -analysis was conducted, w e used relative risk as the effect measure. We assessed the presence of statistical heterogeneity among the studies using standard 2 tests and the magnitude of heterogeneity using the I2 statistic .14 We used random effects models to acco unt for variation among studies15 and fixed effects Mantel -Haenszel models when variation among studies was estimated to be zero. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess th e impact of quality on combined estimates and meta -regression was conducted to assess 13 the association of effect measure with study duration. However, exploration of heterogeneity was typically limited by the small number of studies for each treatment categ ory. All quantitative analyses were performed using S tata 11.0\u00ae (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, 2009) Strength of the Body of Evidence Within each key question, we graded the strength of evidence for effectiveness and for harms by intervention/comparator pair, and for harms by intervention, using an approach adapted from the AHRQ \" Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .\" 8 Our approach considers four major categories to rate the strength of evidence: Quality of studies (good, fair, or poor) Consistency (low, moderate, or high) Directness (direct or indirect) Precision (low, moderate, or high). As with our ratings of individual study quality, we used the terms \"quality\" in lieu of \"risk of bias\" in rati ng the overall strength of evidence of a given finding . Good qualit y is defined as low risk of bias, f air quality is defined as moderate risk of bias, and poor quality is defined as high risk of bias. Our ratings for consistency and precision were trichotomous (low, moderate, high) rather than dichotomous (consistent vs. inconsistent, precise vs. imprecise), to allow for a more graded assessment of those domains. For the domain of \"directness,\" we rated evidence from head -to- head comparisons as direct. We did not incorporate the distinction between ultimate outcomes (e.g., complete wound healing) and intermediate/surrogate outcomes (e.g., wound size reduction) into our ratings for directness. We did, however, give greater weight to studies demonstrating an effect on complete wound healing, as opposed to wound size reduction, based on input from the TEP that complete wound healing represents the most clinically important outcome of interest in pressure ulcer treatment. We did not incorporate the domain of \"dos e-response association\" into our strength of evidence ratings because few , if any , studies in our review included varying levels of exposure. We also did not include the domain of \"plausible confounding that would decrease observed effect \" because this dom ain is relevant primarily for observational studies and nearly all of our findings were based on the results of clinical trials. We did consider \"strength of association\" in rating strength of evidence, but did not assign explicit scores for strength of as sociation in our strength of evidence ratings , due to variability in strength of association for the different measures of wound improvement used across studies. We were not able to assess publication bias using a quantitati ve approach for most treatments because, in many instances , we were not able to perform a formal pooled analysis due to the heterogeneity of interventions, comparators, or outcomes, or due to the poor quality of studies. We did attempt to evaluate the possibility of publication bias by qualitatively examining the directionality of study findings by sampl e size for a given intervention and by looking for unpublished studies through our gray literature search. The strength of evidence was assigned an overall grade of high, moderate, low, or insufficient according to a four -level scale: High \u2014High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate\u2014Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. 14 Low\u2014Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient \u2014 Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. Applicability Applicability is \"the extent to which the effects observed in published studies are likely to reflect the expected results w hen a specific intervention is applied to the population of interest under 'real -world' conditions .\"16 Applicability depends on the particular question and the needs of the user of the review. We developed our review to provide evidence that might be useful to clinicians, policymaker s, patients, and other decisionmakers interested in pressure ulcer treatment. Because it depends on context, there is no generally accepted universal rating system for applicability. We described features of the included studies that are relevant to applicability in terms of the PICOTS elements . These elements are the features embedded in the key questions that inform clinical decisionmaking and the degree to which the evidence is likely to pertain to subpopulations. For example, it is important to determine whether techniques described in studies are representative of current practice. We extracted from studies included in our review key information that might affect applicability of findings, including characteristics of ulcers (e.g., stage), populations (e.g., spinal cord injure d patients), study duration, co interventions, comparators, and care setting. We based our approach to applicability on the guidance described by Atkins and colleagues . 12,16 Peer Review Experts in prevention and management of pressure ulcers, geriatric medicine, wound care research, and epidemiology, as well as individuals representing important stakeholder groups, were invited to provide external peer review of this CER. The AHRQ T ask Order Officer and a designated EPC associate editor also provided comments and editorial review. To obtain public comment, the draft report was posted on the AHRQ Web site for 4 weeks. A disposition- of-comments report detailing the changes made to address t he public and peer review comments will be made available 3 months after the Agency posts the final CER on the AHRQ Web site . 15 Result s Overview The results of the search and study selection are summarized in the study flow diagram (Figure 4 and Table 1 ). Searches of databases, review of reference lists of published studies, and review of gray literature resulted in 7,274 potentially relevant articles. After dual review of abstracts and titles 1,836 studies were selected for full -text review. Gray literature was assessed, but did not meet the inclusion criteria for this report or provide data that was not already available in the peer reviewed literature. One hundred seventy -four studies ( with results published in 182 full -text articles) were included in this review. These studies examined a wide range of interventions, but sample sizes often were small. We found moderate -strength evidence that some interventions improved healing of pressure ulcers, but no interventions were found to be effective with a high strength of evidence. Several other interventions had limited evidence of effectiveness (strength of evidence rated as low). A minority of studies examined complete wound healing as an outcome. In general, the evidence about the harms of any of these treatments was limited. See Appendix B for complete inclusion and exclusion criteria and Appendix G for strength of evidence assessment s. 16 Figure 4.

The full text code for \"Not relevant\" includes non-En glish language articles, animal studies, wrong study design, and other excluded articles for which existing codes did not apply. 17 Overall Effectiveness of Pressure Ulcer Treatment Pressure ulcer treatment encompasses numerous intervention strategies: alleviating the conditions contributing to ulcer development (support surfaces, repositioning, and nutritional support); protecting the wound from contamination, creating a clean wound environment, and promoting tissue healing (local wound appl ications, debridement, wound cleansing, and various adjunctive therapies); and surgically repairing the wound. We evaluated evidence addressing the comparative effectiveness and harms in treatment categories where significant uncertainty exists about the b est therapeutic options. Results for each key question are presented here, within these specific treatment categories: support surfaces, nutrition, local wound applications (including wound dressings, topical therapies and biological agents), surgical inte rventions, and adjunctive therapies. Although we evaluated multiple outcomes, only measures of wound improvement (complete wound healing, wound size reduction, healing time ) were consistently reported. Other outcomes including pain were reported sporadical ly. Ulcer recurrence was used as an outcome in some studies of surgery and are reported in that section of this report. Prevention of serious infectious complications was not reported as an outcome in any included study. There was no body of literature for which it was possible to synthesize evidence for the impact of a given intervention on outcomes other than wound improvement. In reporting results of wound improvement, when a body of literature allowed conclusions about a particular measure of wound impr ovement (e.g., complete wound healing), we report those findings. In many cases, however, the use of different measures of wound improvement allowed us only to report on the overall effect of an intervention on wound improvement, which included complete wound healing, wound size reduction, and healing time . The overall findings of this review and a summary of the strength of the evidence for the key findings are presented in Table 31. Table 1. Overview of included studies by treatment strategy Treatment Strategy Included Trials Included Observational Studies Support 21 3 Nutrition 11 5 Local wound applications 76 13 Surgery 1 5 Adjunctive 34 5 Results of Pressure Ulcer Treatment by Treatment Strategy Effectiveness of Support Surfaces Many factors contribute to both the development of pressure ulcers and the likelihood that pressure ulcers will heal once they develop. Of these, pressure, friction, or shear that limits blood flow and/or damages skin and underlying tissues are the most di rect contributors to the development of pressure ulcers. Treatments that redistribute pressure, reduce friction, and prevent shear are used to promote healing and prevent further damage to the skin in the area of the ulcer. Healing can be promoted by a variety of types of support surfaces. A support surface is defined as \"a specialized device for pressure redistribution designed for management of tissue loads, micro- climate, and/or other therapeutic functions (i.e., any mattress, integrated bed system, mattress replacement, overlay, or seat cushion, or seat cushion overlay).\" 17 While support surfaces are frequently used to prevent pressure ulcers for people at risk, they are also 18 used (though less frequently studied) as a component of pressure ulcer treatment. This section summarizes the studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, including that they compare different support surfaces used in the treatment of existing pressure ulcers and evaluate the impact of these support surfaces on healing. Description of Studies We identified 24 studies of the use of various support surfaces that met our inclusion criteria (see Appendix D). These studies were reported in 26 articles published between 1987 and 2012. Two studies were reported in more t han one publication. 18-21 Most of the studies were published in the 1990s (10 studies22-31) and early 2000s (six studies; eight articles18-21,32 -35). Only five were published during or after 200536-40 and these were sometimes based on older data (e.g., Val ente was published in 2012 but reports data from patients treated in July 2001 to June 2002). A limitation of the liter ature on support surfaces for pressure ulcer treatment is that there are few recent comparative studies. Details extracted from each stud y are included in the evidence tables (see Appendix H , Table H-1). Of these, four were rated as good quality, 10 as fair, and 10 as poor. The assessments of the quality rating criteria used for each study are provided in Appendix H, Table H -2. Of the 24 studies identified, 20 were randomized trials. The other four included one trial in which the method of assignment was not clearly stated,24 two retrospective cohort studies,40,41 and one small , prospective cohort study.30 Fourteen of these studies were conducted in the United States,26,27,29,32,34,38,41 -46 seven in the United Kingdom,18-21,23,25,33,35,36 and one each in Holland,31 Japan,24 and Belgium.39 The populations in the studies were predominately older hospital patients and long -term care residents. Mean ages were in the late 60s to 80s, with the exception of one study of people with spinal cord injuries living in the community. In this study the mean ages for the treatment and control groups were 42 and 45. 38 All subjects had at least one pressure u lcer, as this was the key inclusion criteria. The stage of the ulcers varied, with most studies including people with a range of severities (see details in Summary Table 31), though some studies were limited to patients with ulcers of a particular stage (e.g., Stage II 19,36 or Stage I33). The interventions and comparators in studies of support surfaces included several different types of surfaces and brands. Support surfaces vary in terms of form factor (e.g., mattress, mattress overlays, seat cushions, and seat overlays), materials, action, and method of pressure redistribution or environment control. While definitions of key terms have been proposed, 17 currently there is no universally accepted classification of support surfaces into categories that are mu tually exclusive. Some studies, reviews, and guidelines have classified support surfaces based on reimbursement policies 37,41 or the primary action such as constant low pressure (CLP), low-air-loss (LAL), alternating pressure (AP), or air -fluidized (AF). O ther studies have created categories such as whether they require power or not for operation10 or as \"low tech\" compared with \"high tech.\"47,48 significant overlap with nonpowered, CLP, and \"low tech,\" while powered is often AP or AF and considere d \"high tech.\" However, this categorization does not allow for the possibility of a high -tech material or design that does not require power. Some studies compared a new design with AP as \"standard care.\" For this reason , we organized our presentation of t he studies into four groups (AF, AP, LAL , and \"other\") based on the surface that is considered to be the experimental intervention. The \"other\" category corresponds to surfaces that are not AF, AP, or LAL and were tested as new interventions. 19 The comparat ors in the studies varied and were not always well specified. Some studies compared two specific types and/or brands of surfaces, while others compared the study surface to \"usual care\" or normal hospital beds. These comparators were not always described i n the articles. The comparator is specified in as much detail as is provided by the article authors in the evidence tables in the appendix as well as discussed in the detailed analyses as appropriate. Although it might not be considered best practice today to treat a patient with a pressure ulcer on a normal hospital bed, it is not unheard of for less severe pressure ulcers to be treated on a normal hospital bad. For this reason we retained studies that met the overall inclusion criteria for this review (e. g. published after 1985 and report the comparative impact on a measure of healing) even if they compared the support surface that was the subject of study to a surface that could be considered outdated or not currently the best recommended practice because these are still used in some circumstances. The outcomes measured and reported in the identified studies reflect the goals of treatment , but were restrained by the timing of possible followup measurement, which ranged from 5 days 33 to 36 weeks.45 The ulti mate goal, and therefore outcome, of pressure ulcer treatment is complete healing of the wound. Eight of the identified studies reported how many patients in the study had pressure ulcers that healed, 23,25,29,31,33,36,40,42 two also reported the time to co mplete healing,34,36 while one reported time to 30 percent healed.38 Most pressure ulcers, particularly larger ulcers and those that involve many layers of tissue, often require months to heal17 and some never heal completely in the patient's lifetime. Giv en these constraints, the majority of studies (16 of 24) included in this review20,21,23 -27,30,32,36,38,39,41 -44,46 reported changes in the surface area or volume of either an index ulcer (usually the worst) or all pressure ulcers over a set period of time or until the patient was discharged or died. An additional outcome reported in seven studies was simply \"improvement.\" Improvement was defined as healing or change in the stage of the ulcer determined through blinded assessment by experts. 18,19,24,35,39,43 -45 Five studies also reported pain or patient comfort as an outcome20,21,23,27,43,46 and two included hospital admissions and emergency department visits41,45 as an outcome compared across patients treated on different surfaces. The setting for these stu dies included hospitals, long -term care facilities (e.g., nursing facilities, post- acute care facilities, and home health care agencies), and the community. Eleven studies were conducted in acute care hospitals18,19,26,27,30,33,35,36,39,43,44,46 and ten in long -term care facilities.23,24,29,31,32,34,40 -42,45 One study was of people living in the community38 and two included both hospital patients and nursing facility residents.20,21,25 Key Points Five studies conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s were ident ified that compared AF beds to other surfaces. All reported greater wound improvement on the AF beds in terms of reduction in ulcer size (strength of evidence: moderate). Complete wound healing and reduction in ulcer size were similar across different brands of AP beds made by different manufacturers or types of AP surfaces (i.e., overlays and full beds). (four studies, strength of evidence: moderate). The evidence about the effec tiveness of AP beds was mixed , though most findings were of similar wound impr ovement for AP beds when compared to air, fluid or standard beds . (four studies, strength of evidence: low). Two studies of AP chair cushions were conducted in two very different populations (younger people with spinal cord injury and older hospital patients or nursing home residents) and 20 produced different results, making it difficult to draw a generalizable conclusion about AP chair cushions (strength of evidence: insufficient). Wound improveme nt was similar with LAL beds compared with foam surfaces (three of five studies) or with LAL beds compared with LAL overlays (strength of evidence: low). While harms were reported in seven studies, each study included different harms for different surfaces (strength of evidence: insufficient). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the impact of patient or setting characteristics on the effectiveness or harms of different support surfaces in ulcer healing because most studies did not provide relevant information. Detailed Analysis The identifie d studies are categorized by the experimental surface in both the summary of evidence in Table 31 and the narrative below. Evidence A bout the Comparative Effectiveness of Support Surfaces (Key Question 1) Air-Fluidized Beds AF beds are made of small beads and air is forced through the beads to create a fluid- like surface that redistributes pressure. The five studies of AF beds (Table 2) were all conducted in the United States and included one large, fair -quality cohort study published in 2005 and four randomized trials published between 1987 and 1991. One trial was rated as good quality , 43 two as fair ,45,46 and one as poor .44 The combined results of these studies provide limited evidence that AF beds have a positive effect in that they are more effective th an alternatives in promoting the reduction in the size of pressure ulcers. The moderate strength of evidence rating is based in part on the fact that the results are consistent across all of these studies. However, as is detailed in the text and Table 2, t he trials were conducted 10 or more years ago in the late 1980s and early 1990s and in three of the trials the AF bed was compared with standard beds or multiple surfaces that were not well defined. 44-46 The one good- quality randomized trial compared 31 hospitalized patients on an AF bed who were repositioned every four hours with 34 patients on an AP bed with a foam overlay, which was conventional treatment for patients with pressure ulcers at the location of the study , who were repositioned every two hour s.43 Those on AF beds experienced a median decrease in the size of their pressure ulcers (- 1.2 cm2) that was significantly better than the median increase (+0.5 cm2) in the size of pressure ulcers in patients on the AP beds. Blinded assessors rated 71 percent of patients on the AF beds as improved compared with 47 percent on the AP beds and 62 percent of patients on the AF mattress reported a decrease in pain compared to 36 percent on the AP beds despite the difference in repositioning that could have favor ed the AP bed .43 A fair - quality study of hospital patients46 compared 20 people on AF beds with 20 on standard hospital beds and reported that the mean ulcer area declined on the AF beds and increased for those on standard beds and that pain declined for a ll patients and did not differ by bed type. A third study (poor quality) of hospital patients compared 15 patients on AF beds with 20 patients that used several alternatives that were standard care and found wound surface area reductions were higher in the patients treated on the AF beds. 44 The other two studies of AF beds were in long -term care settings and similarly report favorable results in terms of reduction in pressure ulcer size. One followed 97 home care patients 21 randomized to either an AF bed (n= 47) or conventional treatment (n=50). The authors reported that more stage III and IV ulcers healed and were assess ed as stage II after treatment on the AF beds (29 of 47, data for control group not provided) compared with patients on conventional surfaces and a higher proportion were rated as improved by blinded nurse raters.45 A large, fair- quality retrospective cohort study (n=664) of residents with at least one pressure ulcer in their medical record examined healing rat es across groups of patients on AF beds, low -tech surfaces , and high- tech surfaces other than AF beds. Comparisons were made for healing rates for the largest ulcer for each person as well as the change in each ulcer (multiples al lowed per resident) during 7 to 10 day episodes. Stage III and IV ulcers healed more quickly for patients on the AF beds (3.1 cm2 per week) compared with other high- (0.7) and low -tech surfaces (0.6). Residents on AF beds and residents on lower -tech surfaces (who overall were less severely ill) had fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits than did resi dents who used the other higher -tech beds.41 Table 2.

Alternating Pressure Beds and Chair Cushions AP mattresses, overlays, and cushions have cells or sections that inflate and deflate to change the dis tribution of pressure. The sizes of the cells, patterns of inflation and deflation, and the length of the cycles can vary across brands. Ten studies \u2014six conducted in the United Kingdom,18-21,23,25,35,36 two in the United States ,39,40 and one each in Belgium39 and Japan24\u2014 evaluated AP mattresses or chair cushions (Table 3). Different Brands or Form Factors of Alternating Pressure Beds Researchers found no significant differences in healing in the three studies that compared different AP beds, all involving a version of the Nimbus brand bed .18-20,23,49 One additional study that compared AP beds with AP overlays36 also found no significant difference in the number of ulcers that healed or the number of days they took to heal ( four studie s, moderate strength of evidence). A fair -quality study of residents admitted to a geriatric hospital in Scotland found that, in 4 weeks, 10 of 16 patients on the Nimbus 1 AP bed healed compared with five of 14 who used the Pegasus brand AP bed, but this difference was not significant , there was no difference in patient - reported comfort and the study was stopped after 2 years due to difficulties recruiting patients and changes in the beds.23 Other researchers comparing a later version of the same AP mattress 24 (Nimbus 3) with other brands of AP mattresses in a good -quality trial found no significant difference in change in size of the pressure ulcers in 12 hospital patients and 20 nursing facility residents. This study found that there were some differences i n comfort, with the Nimbus 3 rated as more comfortable.20,21 The third study (fair quality) found a trend toward improvement in heel ulcers on the Nimbus 3 beds compared with another brand (Pegasus C airwave ), but there was no significant difference in healing for sacral ulcers.18,19 A good- quality study that compared an AP mattress to an AP overlay reported no statistically significant differences in the number of ulcers healed or the median time to healing. 36 Alternating Pressure Beds Compared W ith Other Surfaces Four studies (two fair quality and two poor quality) evaluated AP surfaces by comparing them with other surfaces. Three studies included patients with pressure ulcers at all stages24,35,39 and one excluded patients with pressure ulcers that advanc ed to stage III or IV.40 The findings were conflicting, though most studies found no significant differences in at least one measure of healing ( low strength of evidence). Two studies followed hospital patients who were predominately elderly until discharge. 35,39 One fair -quality trial found no significant difference in ulcer progress for 83 patients treated on the AP mattress compared with 75 patients treated on a fluid mattress overlay.35 The most recently published of the identified studies compa red hospitalized patients on ventilators on AP beds with patients on air overlays and documented significant improvement (reduction in wound surface area) on the AP mattress, however the sample size was small (n=16). 39 A poor -quality trial involving long- term care hospital patients in Japan found no significant difference in change in pressure ulcer surface area in patients on a specific type of AP bed (lateral rolling bed which moves residents from left side to back to right side on a timed cycle) compared with a traditional hospital bed. H owever, the mean stage of the pressure ulcers for patients on the rolling bed declined while the mean stage increased on the standard hospital bed. 24 A poor -quality observational study published in 2012 reports on chart r eview data of patients admitted to long - term care be ds between July 2001 and June 2002. Physicians treated patients with pressure ulcer s with either an AP overlay or a gel overlay. The study reported that a higher percentage of patients on the AP overlay experienced complete wound healing, but the difference was not statistically significant. 40 Alternating Pressure Chair Cushions AP is also used in chair cushions. Two studies compared AP cushions used in wheelchairs or day chairs with other types of cushions.25,38 One fair -quality trial of AP cushions , conducted in the United States, randomized 44 wheelchair users with spinal cord injuries living in the community who had stage II or III pressure ulcers to either an AP wheelchair cushion or a standard foam c ushion for 30 days. People using the AP cushion experienced significantly better rates of healing measured as reduction in wound area, days to 30 percent wound closure, and probability of wound closure within 30 days. 38 The second study of AP cushions incl uded 25 hospital or nursing residents who used an AP cushion or a dry floatation cushion in their wheelchair or day chair. Pressure ulcers healed for three of 14 patients on AP cushions and five of 11 on the dry floatation cushions; however, this differenc e was not significant. 25 25 Table 3.

Low-Air-Loss Beds Five studies evaluated LAL mattresses ,27,29,30,32,42 which use power to provide a flow of air that helps regulate heat and humidity and also may adjust pressure. All of these studies were conducted in the United States. Two trials and one observational cohort study followed hospitalized patients and two studied nursing facility residents. Four of the studies compared the LAL bed with a foam overlay 27,29,42 or foam mattress30 and one compared an LAL bed with an LAL overlay (Table 4).26 29 None of the five studies found the LAL bed had a significant advantage over other surfaces for the study's primary outcome. Two of the studies in long -term care compared LAL beds with foam overlays and reported mixed findings for residents with stage III or IV pressure ulcers: One study found no significant difference in complete wound healing , but did report a significantly larger reduction in surface area on the LAL bed.42 Similarly, the second study reported higher rates of wound healing and decrease in surface area, but no significant difference in complete healing. 29 One poor -quality trial of LAL beds used with hospital patients compared the LAL mattress with foam overlays and found no significant difference in changes in wound surface area and no significant difference in comfort. 27 A second observational study followed patie nts for up to 4 weeks and found no difference between the LAL bed and foam bed in terms of progress to wound closure. 30 The study that compared an LAL bed with an LAL overlay for hospital patients also reported that there was no significant difference in c hanges in pressure ulcer surface area.26 Table 4.

Two studies were conducted in the United States,32,34 one in Holland,31 and one in the United Kingdom.33 The experimental surfaces included a high -quality foam mattress, a profiling bed, an airbed with a foam overlay, and a tot al contact seat (see Table 5). Given these differences and the overall quality of the studies (one fair31 and three poor quality32-34) the evidence could not be summarized across the studies. Each study is described below and in Table 5. Three of the studi es were in long -term care settings.31,32,34 The one fair -quality study followed nursing facility residents randomized to either foam or water mattresses for 4 weeks. 31In that time the number of residents who were completely healed was not significantly different on the two surfaces (45 percent on foam and 48.3 percent on water).31 A randomized trial compared the use of a seat with customized shape and air bladders, a LAL bed, and a foam bed overlay in the treatment of nursing facility residents and found that ulcers healed most quickly in patients treated up to 4 hours a day in the seat as opposed to a LAL bed or bed with overlay. 34 The third study in long -term care treated the LAL bed as the standard of care and compared it with a less expensive air bed wit h foam overlay for 20 patients in a post -acute care center. The researchers reported that the wound surface area closures per week were similar or better on the air and foam bed (9 percent air/foam vs. 5 percent LAL, no statistical test or variance reported). 32 A larger study of the incidence of pressure ulcers in hospital patients randomized patients to either a profiling bed (electronically controlled and designed to keep patients from slipping down in bed) or a conventional bed. The recruited subjects i ncluded a subset of 14 patients with stage I pressure ulcers on admission; four of the four on the profiling bed healed by discharge and two of 10 assigned to conventional beds healed (no statistical tests reported). 33 32 Table 5.

Four studies presented some results by pressure ulcer characteristics,18, 19, 27, 34,42 addressing Key Question 1a, however these subgroup analyses were not always presented as part of the original analysis pla n. While initial stage of the pressure ulcer or size at enrollment were incorporated into results by reporting changes or by including these as variables in regressions or ANOVA analyses, four of the 23 studies address ed whether the effect of the support s urface varied across patients with differences in baseline pressure ulcer severity . In a study of hospitalized patients that compared two brands of AP mattresses, results were compared for pressure ulcers staged (as defined by the study authors) as IIa (persistent erythema with intact epidermis) compared with IIb (persistent erythema with epidermal loss). There was no significant difference in healing on the two beds, whether the results were combined or separated by ulcer stages . 18,19 Nursing home residents using an LAL bed and a foam overlay were divided by whether their pressure ulcers were superficial or deep . However , the results were the same for the two categories with residents on the LAL beds experiencing a larger decrease in wo und surface area regardles s of the initial depth of the pressure ulcer .42 A comparison of LAL beds with foam beds in hospitals presented the initial and end size of ulcers separately for stage II and stages III/IV, but the authors did not discuss differenc es in healing by pressure ulcer stage and no test of differences by stage was provided. The data presented suggests that the change was similar on the two types of beds for stage II pressure ulcers, but that there was greater improvement on the LAL bed for stage III/IV pressure ulcers . 27 In the comparison of a generic total contact seat with a LAL bed and foam overlay, the results were divided by the location of pressure ulcer . Pressure ulcers on the trochanter and coccyx healed more quickly on the total contact seat, while there was no significant difference in the time to complete healing for pressure ulcers located on the ischial tuberosity. 34 None of the identified studies examined the impact of support surfaces by other patient characteristics (Key Ques tion 1b). None of the studies in a single setting reported on any relationships between setting characteristics and pressure ulcer outcomes. Three studies included both hospital patients and nursing home residents, but only one reported the results separat ely by setting20,21 and then only in one of two articles reporting the results of the trial.21 In this study comparing a specific brand of AP bed (Nimbus 3) with any other AP beds, the results were examined together and separately for the 12 hospital patie nts and the 20 nursing home residents , and no significant differences were found in wound size when the results were examined by setting. Support Surfaces: Harms (Key Question 2) Few of the identified studies, 7 of 24, explicitly addressed harms that could be attributable to or related to support surfaces.29,31,36,43 -46 Harms were rarely mentioned in the study descriptions, discussions, or results of the articles about support surfaces. In the se seven studies where harms were mentioned, four reported no significant differences in harms in the treatment and comparator groups . For this reason they are not reported in the tables above; however , they are described in the text that follows. 34 Four of the seven studies that mentioned harms were from the subgroup of five studies of AF beds. One study reported that a single patient on the AF bed had a severe episode of epistaxis requiring a transfusion that might have been caused by the drying action of the bed and four patients had trouble transferring in and out of the AF bed. 43 Another study reported no significant differences in bleeding, granulation, necrosis, or nursing time on the AF beds compared with a variety of surfaces. 44 In a study comparing AF beds with standard hospital beds, the author stated that they tested for dehydration, pulmonary congestion, confusion, and microsphere leakage . They found that none of the patients experienced these problems.46 The study of AF bed use in home care reported safety issues including minor mechanical problems that w ere corrected within 24 hours (six leaks and seven beds overheated), several cases (number not reported) of dry skin, and one case of mild dehydration. 45 One29 of the three studies of LAL beds compared LAL beds with foam overlays and mentioned that no harm s were identified, but did not specify what harms were considered. Pain was reported as a potential complicating factor in another study and was found not to differ across the support surfaces (foam and water beds) during the course of the trial. 31 A large trial (n=1972; but n=113 in the treatment subgroup, the rest in prevention) of AP beds and AP overlays for both prevention and treatment reported nine mattress -related adverse events (four falls, three other slips, one suspected contact dermatitis, and one patient who caught his back on the bed rail) for the entire trial , but did not report whether these occurred in the prevention or treatment arm. 36 Evidence About the Harms Related to Support Surfaces by Subgroups According to Pressure Ulcer Characteristi cs (Key Question 2a), Patient Characteristics (Key Question 2b), or Setting (Key Question 2c) None of the identified studies examined harms by any subgroups. Effectiveness of Nutrition Studies of risk factors for the development of pressure ulcers have found that signs of poor nutrition, such as low levels of pre albumin, vitamin C , or zinc, are associated with an increased incidence of pressure ulcers .50,51 Guidelines for pressure ulcer prevention developed by the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel ( EPUAP) and the United States National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) include recommendations for providing high- protein, mixed nutritional supplementation to patients at risk for pressure ulcer development.52 These approaches provide the rationale f or using various types of dietary supplements as a treatment for patients who have developed a pressure ulcer. The most widely studied nutritional intervention is the use of dietary protein or single amino acids. Vitamin and zinc supplements have also been examined as either sole interventions or in combination with protein- based supplements. Nutritional interventions have always been studied along with other interventions such as specialized beds and dressings. The predominant clinical view is that nutriti onal supplementation is one part of multi -component regimens to treat pressure ulcers. Description of Studies We identified eleven randomized controlled trials of nutritional interventions for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Three were rated good quality ,53-55 two were rated fair quality,56,57 and six were rated poor quality.58-63 These trials were published between 1990 and 2012 and were conducted in the United States,60,61,63,64 Australia,55,59 Italy,53,58 Japan,62,65and The 35 Netherlands.54 Two trials we re conducted in multiple European countries.56,57 The studies generally were small, with sample sizes ranging from 16 -160 (total n=527). Only one study had more than 100 participants.56 We also identified five observational studies. Of these three were rated fair 66,67, 68,69 and two were rated poor.70,71 These studies were conducted in the United States,64-66,68,70 Japan,64,65,69 and Australia .67 The sample sizes of the observational studies ranged from 7 to 70 (total n= 192). The observational studies we re published between 1993 and 2010. Details extracted from each study are included in the evidence tables (see Appendix H, Table H-3). The assessments of the quality rating criteria used for each study are provided in Appendix H, Table H-4. The populations in the studies were predominantly older patients, some with mobility impairment . Although not all studies reported prior nutritional status, only one study was conducted among patients without reported baseline malnutrition.57 Mean age of the patients ranged from 49 to 83 years. The two studies with the lowest mean ages both studied groups of patients with spinal cord injuries.64,67 All subjects had at least one pressure ulcer and the majority of studies included patients with ulcers ranging in stage from II -IV. Two observational studies also included patients with stage I ulcers61,69 (see details in Table 6). All studies included both male and female patients. Six of the randomized trials used a protein -fortified formula that also included amino acids and micronutrients as the nutritional intervention.53,57 -59,62,63 One trial used a single amino acid (arginine),55 one used a specialized amino acid compound ,56 and another used a collagen protein hydrolysate .60 One trial used a variety of nutrition support measures61 and one used only vitamin C.54 Of the observational studies, five64,66,67,69,71 studied the use of protein -containing dietary supplements. One observational study eva luated zinc supplementation68 and two did not specify the type of nutritional supplement.65,70 The comparators used in four of the clinical trials were placebos similar in look and taste to the treatments.54,56,57,60 Four other clinical trials performed he ad-to-head comparisons. Two trials compared different doses of a nutritional supplement,55,63 and two trials compared a protein supplement to the same supplement plus arginine and vitamins.58,59 Three studies used standard nutritional care as the comparato r.53,61,62 One observational study also performed a comparison between two different dosages of a protein supplement.66 Three observational studies did not report comparators.64,70,71 The key outcomes measured were complete wound healing, healing time, and reduced wound surface area. The most commonly reported harms were gastrointestinal events and infection. The timing, or duration of followup for all but two of the studies ranged from 3 to 12 weeks. One study evaluated patients for 12 months67 and another study followed patients for 1 week.61 The setting for the studies included hospitals or long -term care facilities, and one study was conducted among people living in the community.67 The studies were conducted in Australia, Europe, Japan, and the United States. Key Points When used in addition to other measures for treating pressure ulcers, protein- containing nutritional supplement ation resulted in wound improvement (strength of evide nce: moderate). The optimal dosage and form of protein has not been defined in nine clinical trials of protein supplementation (strength of evidence: insufficient). 36 Vitamin C used as a single nutritional supplement does not result in wound improve ment (strength of evidence: low). The evidence is insufficient to determine whether zinc supplementation improves pressure ulcer healing. Harms or adverse events were reported in about half of the studies ( 8 of 1 9), but they reported different harms, did not describe the harm, or did not specify if it was related to treatment (strength of evidence: insufficient). Detailed Analysis We were unable to conduct meta- analyses of nutritional supplementation treatment comparisons due to the small number of studies, t he variety of specific nutritional formulas studied, and the poor quality of some of the clinical trials. Evidence About the Comparative Effectiveness of Nutritional Supplementation (Key Question 1) Protein -Containing Nutritional Supplements The most frequently studied nutritional supplements were formulas that included a mixture of protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and various micronutrients. Although there were some differences in the content of the nutritional supplements used in the clinical trials, these differences were generally small. To assess whether protein supplementation in any form appears to provide benefit for the healing of pressure ulcers, we evaluated clinical trials that compared protein supplementation to a placebo or usual care comparator . One good -quality trial and one fair - quality trial used a liquid formula known as Cubitan that contains protein, arginine, zinc, and vitamin C. 53,57 Both trials compared Cubitan supplementation to a placebo. In the good- quality trial,53 patients in the in tervention group were provided an additional 500 kilocalories of the formula each day. In the fair -quality trial,57 patients in the intervention group were provided 750 more kilocalories of nutritional support than patients in the compa rison group. The out come measure in both studies was reduction in surface area of the pressure ulcer. Both studies found slightly greater reductions in ulcer size in the intervention groups by 8 to 12 weeks. Neither study examined complete healing of the pressure ulcers. A fair -quality clinical trial examined the use of ornithine alpha -ketoglutarate (OKG) as a nutritional supplement. 56 OKG is an amino acid salt containing ornithine and glutarate in a 2:1 ratio; it has been advocated as a stimulant of wound healing. The dose of OKG used in this trial was 10 grams per day and all participants had healed ulcers. The primary outcome was reduction in surface area of the ulcer at 6 weeks. The participants were stratified by size of the ulcer at baseline. In the subgroup wit h ulcers of 8 cm2 or less, the group given OKG had a greater reduction is ulcer size that the placebo group. There was no difference in ulcer size reduction in the subgroup having ulcers greater than 8 cm 2 in size .56 Four poor -quality clinical trials also examined protein- based nutritional support.58,59,61,62 All of these trials were relatively small, with the largest trial enrolling 89 participants.60 All studies used measures of pressure ulcer size as th e outcome variable, with follow up periods ranging from 15 da ys to 12 weeks. All studies found greater reductions in pressure ulcer size in the intervention groups. One study assessed complete healing by 12 weeks .60 Complete healing occurred in 33 percent of the intervention group patients and in 14 percent of the c ontrol group 37 patients. (difference not statistically significant). In this trial the intervention group patients received on average 27 percent higher protein and calorie intake than the control group patients. A fair -quality observational study67 examined the use of arginine as a single amino acid for treating pressure ulcers. Participants receiving the interv ention were treated with 9 g of arginine and 310 mg of vitamin C per day. The outcome measure was mean time to complete healing of the ulcer. The int ervention patient s had a mean time of 10.5 weeks while a historical control group had a mean time of 21.1 weeks. The only other study that examined arginine as a sole means of nutritional supplementation was a good- quality clinical trial that randomized patients to receive either 4.5 g or 9 g of arginine per day. 55 Only 23 patients were enrolled and the pressure ulcers were followed for 3 weeks. The two groups did not differ in the mean reduction of size of the ulcers. One poor -quality clinical trial 61 examined generic nutritional support for patients w ith pressure ulcers. There was no difference in either ulcer size or ulcer stage, but followup in this study was only 7 days. Due to poor specification of the nutritional intervention and the limited duration of followup, this study provides little useful information. A poor -quality clinical trial and a fair -quality observational study compared differing dosages of protein -containing nutritional supplements. The clinical trial randomized patients to receive either 16 or 25 percent of their calories as protein. 63 The ulcer healing rate was f aster in the group receiving 25 percent protein. In the observational study, patients were allocated in a nonrandomized fashion to either of two commercial nutritional formulas.66 One f ormula contained 14 percent protein a nd the other contained 24 percent protein. Reduction in ulcer area was greater in the group receiving the 24 percent protein formula. The analyses found that both protein intake and intake of total calories was associated with ulcer size reduction. While t hese studies do not define the optimal dosage of protein, both support the conclusion that protein supplementation enhances healing of pressure ulcers. The studies of protein supplementation used a wide variety of formulations that included single amino acid s (arginine), OKG, generic protein formulations, and formulas supplemented with vitamins. The studies uniformly showed small, positive benefits. In general, higher protein dosages appeared to provide better results. Although the nutritional formulas use d in the studies are diverse, they have the common characteristic that they all include protein or amino acids. The most commonly studied outcome was size reduction rather than complete healing of ulcers. All of the studies also included other standard approaches (dressings and support surfaces) for pressure ulcer treatment, with protein supplementation being an adjunct to these other treatments. Due to the consistency of findings across the studies, we concluded that the strength of evidence is moderate t hat protein supplementation improves healing of pressure ulcers (when used along with other standard treatments for pressure ulcers). Due to there being only a small number of head- to-head trials, the existing evidence base does not define whether any specific type of protein supplementation is superior to any others. All of the studies had relatively small sample sizes, and several were of poor quality. 38 Table 6.

Micronutrient -Containing Nut ritional Supplements Few other nutritional interventions for pressure ulcers have been studied. A good- quality clinical trial54 has examined ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and a f air-quality observational study68 has evaluated zinc supplementation. The clinical trial of vitamin C used a dose of 1000 mg per day for a population of nursing home patients in The Netherlands.54 About two- thirds of patients in both groups were judged to have poor nutritional status. The outcome measure was complete healing of pressur e ulcers. About half of the ulcers had healed by 12 weeks, with no significant difference in healing rate between the vitamin C and placebo groups. This single good- quality study suggests that vitamin C as a single agent is ineffective, but the confidence in this conclusion is low given the lack of other studies (s ee Table 7) . The study of zinc supplementation performed a retrospective analysis comparing patients who had been p rescribed zinc sulfate 440 mg per day to patients who had not been prescribed this supplement. 68 After controlling for patient characteristics, there was no difference between the two groups in ulcer healing rates over 30 days. This study is limited by its small size and 44 retrospective design. We concluded that the evidence is insuff icient to draw a conclusion about zinc as a single agent to enhance pressure ulcer healing. Table 7.

All of the information about sub- groups comes from studies of protein -containing supplements. The clinical trial of vitamin C54 found no subgroup effects for this intervention. In the one study of OKG ,56 the study participants were stratified by size of the pressure ulcer at baseline (all participants had heal ed ulcers). The beneficial effect o f OKG was found only in the subgroup with ulc er sizes of 8 cm2 or smaller . While other studies included patients with varying sizes of pressure ulcers, none examined this factor in the data analyses . There is some evidence that a patient's baseline nutritional status may affect whether protein - containing nutritional supplementat ion accelerates ulcer healing. A fair -quality observational study compared patients whose pressure ulcers improved to those whose ulcers did not improve.64,65,69 Patients in the group that improved had a higher sustained daily calorie intake than those in the unimproved group. A poor -quality observational study stratified patients by baseline level of prealbumin in an open- label study of generic nutritional s upport.70 Patients with a baseline prealbumin level of less than 8 mg/dL showed little healing of pressure ulcers . Because prealbumin reflects sustained calorie intake, these two studies suggest that adequate calorie intake is necessary for protein -contain ing supplements to be effective. In general, the published clinical trials did not include s everely malnourished patients. The clinical trials evaluating OKG, 56 Cubitan,53,57 another product similar to Cubitan ,59 and a protein hydrolysate60 included subjec ts whose body mass indexes wer e between 20 and 30. A poor - quality clinical trial of a protein supplement enrolled pat ients having a mean body mass index of 18.662 This study found a significantly higher rate of complete healing of pressure ulcers in the group given the nutriti onal supplement. Overall, there are too few studies that included participants with very po or baseline nutritional status. Thus, there is insufficient indirect evidence to determine whether baseline nutritional status affects the resul ts of using protein- containing nutritional supplements. All but one of the studies were conducted in inpa tient or nursing home settings. The one study conducted among community -dwelling individuals67 had findings similar to those of the other studies. There were no trends toward different results in nursing home settings than in acute- care hospital settings. Nutritional Supplementation: Harms (Key Question 2) Eight studies reported information about harms or adverse events. Six of these were studies of protein supplements and two were studies of nutrients. Harms were not always described, nor was it always clear whether they were attributed to treatment. The most commonly reported harms were gastrointestinal events and infection. Studies did not always s pecify whether the harms could be reasonably attributed to the treatment. Five clinical trials provided information about harms related to the use of protein -containing supplements. In the study of OKG, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea occurred in 12 percent of patients randomized to the active product and in 7 percent of pat ients randomized to the placebo. 56 In the study of a protein hydrolysate, adverse event rates were reported to be equal in the two study arms, but the actual rates were not reported.60 A study including 50 patients reported study -related adverse events in five controls (16.7 percent) and eight intervention patients (27.6 percent) , but these events were not described and the authors report that the 46 difference in the rate of the events is not significantly different for the two groups.62 Another study of mixed nutritional supplementation reported that none of the 28 patients studied were hospitalized to treat complications of treatment and that the control group had slightly higher occurrence of infection (9 vs. 3 points, p=0.07) and greater number of days of antibiotic therapy (103 vs. 36, p<0.001). 53 In a study that followed 43 patients, 41 adverse events were reported in 16 patients in the treatment group and 35 events for 13 patients in the control. Most (88 percent) of the events were considered were mild or moderate. Four in the control group were related to treatment (two diarrhea, one nausea, and one vomiting) compared with nine in the intervention group (six diarrhea, one constipati on, and dyspepsia, and one nausea). Overall, 41 percent of those receiving the supplement and 19 percent of those receiving placebo reported diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia , or nausea . These differences between the groups were not significant. 57 In the m ulticenter trial of amino acid supplementation, involving 160 patients, 33 mild to moderate adverse events were reported for 22 patients (15 in the intervention group and seven in placebo) that were considered related to study medication. Gastrointestinal events were more common in intervention patients, but more serious gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, vomiting and nausea) were evenly distributed with 68 percent of events in the intervention group and 67 percent in the placebo group, suggesting the diffe rence is in mild events. There were 30 serious adverse events reported during the course of the study, but none were considered treatment related. 56 In a study comparing high and low protein supplementation among 28 patients, recurring mild diarrhea was reported in one patient receiving high protein (24 percent) in the tube feeding group and mild to s evere diarrhea was reported in one patient each in the high and lower protein group receiving tube feeding, but no problems were reported for any patients receiving oral nutrition .66 Another study of protein supplementation that included 71 patients reported reasons for study discontinuation by 11 patients (two hip fractures, three change in renal lab values; four nausea or distention, and two patients died) and added that there was no significant difference in events for the intervention and comparison group but did not discuss whether these reasons were related to the treatment. 60 Nausea also is a side effect associated with zinc treatment . In the observational study of zinc supplementation, na usea or vomiting occurred in 20 percent of those r eceiving the zinc sulfate and 2 percent of those not receiving the product.68 Evidence About the Harms Related to Nutritional Supplementat ion by Subgroups According to Pres sure Ulcer Characteristics (Key Question 2a), Patient Characteristics (Key Question 2b), or Setting (Key Question 2c) No studies reported subgroup analyses to evaluate harms by ulcer, patient, or setting characteristics. Effectiveness of Local Wound Appli cations Wound dressings are a mainstay of pressure ulcer treatment. Dressings serve multiple functions, including padding and protection of the ulcer from pressure and friction, providing a moist wound environment and protection against drying, serving as a barrier in patients with incontinence or other sources of wound contamination, absorbing wound exudate, and promoting autolytic debridement of necrotic tissue and slough. Topical ointments and other therapies such as fibrinolytic enzymes and antimicrobi al agents are also used in pressure ulcer management to provide moisture, promote tissue debridement, and eliminate or prevent infection. Finally, 47 biological agents, particularly cellular growth factors, are used to enhance pressure ulcer healing by promot ing angiogenesis, epithelialization, and connective tissue deposition. Different types of local wound applications have different primary functions and the choice of a particular therapy or combination of therapies is often guided by the features and severity of the ulcer. For many pressure ulcers, however, there is more than a single therapeutic need (e.g., exudate absorption, tissue debridement, moist environment), and the most appropriate choice of dressing or topical therapies is not always clear. The harms of different treatments also differ. Studies have therefore compared the effectiveness and harms of different local wound applications for pressure ulcers. Description of Studies We identified two systematic reviews that were used for background and 89 original studies, reported in 92 articles published between 1985 and 2012, examining the effectiveness and/or harms of local wound applications for pressure ulcers in a total of 7,115 patients. Seventy -six of the original studies were clinical trials. Of these, 11 were rated as good -quality studies, 20 as fair, and 45 as poor. Sample sizes in the trials ranged from 10 to 168 patients. There were 13 observational studies, including two cohort studies with concurrent intervention and control groups, on e pre -post intervention study, and three studies describing outcomes of a single series of patients who all received the same intervention. One cohort study was rated as fair quality and the other observational studies were poor quality. Details extracted from each study are included in the evidence tables (see Appendix H, Table H-5). The assessments of the quality rating criteria used for each study are provided in Appendix H, Table H -6. The populations in most studies were elderly patients (mean age typ ically between 70 and 85) with 11 studies including patients with spinal cord injury who were typically younger (mean age between 30 and 50). There was a relatively even distribution of men and women across studies, except in the spinal cord injury populat ions, which were predominantly men. Patient race and ethnicity were infrequently reported. Most studies included NPUAP stage II and III ulcers, except for studies of biological agents, in which most patients had stage III and IV ulcers. Ulcer sites varied widely , but most commonly included the sacrum, trochanter, ischium, buttocks, and heel. The interventions studied included a wide range of dressings, topical treatments, and biological agents. Dressings come in a variety of forms and serve various functi ons. Dressings within a given category vary in design and composition, but generally have several common features. o Hydrocolloid dressings were the most commonly studied. These are adhesive wafers that absorb wound fluid to form a gelatinous mass that conf orms to the wound and creates a protective and moist wound environment. o Hydrogel dressings are moisture -producing and are commonly used to hydrate dry wounds. o Transparent films are clear, semipermeable membranes that provide a protective barrier that allo ws wound visualization and promote autolytic debridement. o Foam and polymeric membrane dressings provide wound padding and protection and absorb exudate. 48 o Silicone dressings offer benefits similar to foam dressings , but are less adhesive and have the potent ial to reduce skin damage during dressing changes. o Alginates are seaweed -derived dressings that are typically used to absorb large amounts of exudate. o Radiant heat dressings are noncontact dressings attached to a heating element that provides warmth intended to promote wound healing by increasing capillary blood flow and resistance to infection. o Gauze dressings are fabrics used to protect wounds and provide a wet or dry wound environment and are often used in conjunction with topical solutions and ointments. Gauze dressings are often considered conventional care and used as the comparator in studies of other types of dressings. A wide variety of topical ointments and solutions have been used in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Common topical therapies include antimicrobials, enzymes promoting tissue debridement, polymeric pastes (e.g., dextranomer) that absorb wound exudate, and phenytoin, which is thought to promote wound healing t hrough a variety of mechanisms. Biological agents include primarily cellular growth factors, most notably platelet- derived and fibroblast -derived growth factors. Cointerventions were variably reported. In studies that did report them, co interventions applied to intervention and comparator groups most often included debridement, saline cleansing, pressure- relieving surfaces, and repositioning. The comparators in most studies of dressings and topical treatments were other dressings and/or topical treatments. Some studies used \"usual\" or \"conventional\" care as the comparison group, which typically included moist gauze dressings , but in some cases was not described. For most studies of biological agents, the comparison group received a placebo. The outcomes reported in most studies included complete wound healing, time to complete healing, and/or reduction in wound surface area or volume. Few studies reported pain reduction or wound infection as an outcome, and no studies reported on infectious complications such as osteomyelitis or sepsis. Most studies did not report harms of treatment. Harms that were reported included dermatologic complications such as rash or skin maceration, hypergranulation, wound deterioration, and summative counts of overall adverse events. Some studies reported on costs of care, though the methods used to calculate costs were usually not well described. No studies reported on measures of utilization such as length of hospital or nursing home stay. The timing of studie s, in terms of median ulcer duration prior to intervention, was typically 3 weeks to 3 months, though some studies included ulcers with duration of 1 to 2 years. Most interventions lasted 3 to 12 weeks. The setting for thes e studies included hospitals (n= 37), long -term care facilities (n= 23), wound care clin ics (n= 5), and patients' homes (n=9). Some studies were implemented in a variety of settings. Most studies were conducted in the United States or Europe, although several studies were conducted in other parts of the world. Key Points Dressings Wound improvement was superior with hydrocolloid compared to gauze dressings (10 studi es, strength of evidence: low). 49 Wound improvement were similar with hydrocolloid and foam dressings ( pooled relative risk ( CI), I2=16.4%; p=0.301) (eight studies, strength of evidence: moderate). There was insufficient evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of hydrogel, transparent film, silicone, and alginate dressings. Radiant heat dressings produced more rapid wound improvement than other dressings but were similar to other dressings in terms of complete wound healing ( pooled RR 1.32, 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.98, I2=0.0% p=0.985) (four studies, strength of evidence: moderate). Topical Therapies Evidence about the effectiveness of collagenase and other debriding enzymes was inconclusive due to differences in the enzymes studied and in outcomes measured (five studies, strength of evidence: insufficient). Three studies of the effectiveness of topical phenytoin used different comparators and produced inconsistent results (strength of evidence: insufficient). Dextranomer paste was inferior to wound dressings (alginate, hydrogel) in promoting wound area reduction (two studies, streng th of evidence: low). Wound improvement was similar with topical collagen applications compared with hydrocolloid dressings or standard care (three studies, strength of evidence: low). There was insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of maggot therapy, based on three poor -quality observational studies (strength of evidence: insufficient). Biological Agents Platelet -derived growth factor was superior to placebo in producing wound improvement in stage III and IV pressure ulcers (three studies, strengt h of evidence: low). There was insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of other biological agents used for the treatment of pressure ulcers due to limitations in the number, size, and quality of studies . Harms of Local Wound Applications Harms reported with dressings and topical therapies for pressure ulcers most commonly included skin irritation and inflammation and tissue damage and maceration (31 studies, strength of evidence: moderate). Variability in study populations, interventions, adverse event measurement, and reporting precluded an estimate of adverse event rates for dressings and topical therapies. There was insufficient evidence as to whether specific dressing types or topical therapies are associated with fewer harms than othe rs due to poor study quality and differential reporting of harms across studies (seven studies). Subgroups Few harms were reported with biological agents but evidence did not allow an estimate of the incidence of harms , due to lack of precision across stu dies. (strength of evidence: insufficient). 50 There was insufficient evidence about differences in the effectiveness or harms of wound dressings, topical treatments, or biological agents according to ulcer, patient, or setting characteristics. Detailed Analysis Our analysis is grouped by key question and placed in subgroups based on comparisons within and across the general categories of wound dressings, topical therapies, biological agents, and conventional care (most commonly gauze dressings). Evidenc e About the Comparative Effectiveness of Local Wound Applications (Key Question 1) Wound Dressings Compared W ith Conventional Care Studies comparing wound dressings with conventional care are described below and in Tables 8- 11. Hydrocolloid D ressings Ten trials, one good quality,72 two fair quality,73,74 and seven poor quality,75-81 including a total of 670 patients compared hydrocolloid with gauze dressings, typically saline gauze. Overall, wound improvement was better with hydrocolloid, though several s tudies found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between intervention and control groups. We attempted to meta -analyze results from the seven trials reporting complete wound healing as an outcome, but statistical heterogeneity precluded quantitative pooling of results. The single good-quality st udy reported better rates of complete wound healing with hydrocolloid compared with saline gauze (74 percent vs. 27 percent) over an 8- week timeframe among patients with stage I and II ulcers. 72 The two fair -quality studies included 105 patients and were c onducted in hospitals73 and a long -term care facility.74 The former study, which included shallow ulcers, found significantly more complete wound healing after 6 weeks with hydrocolloid (see Table 8 below). The latter study, which included stage III ulcers , found no significant difference in complete healing or time to healing between hydrocolloid and saline gauze dressings. Results were similarly mixed in the poor -quality studies, with one 77 reporting significantly better wound improvement with hydrocolloi d in patients with stage III and IV ulcers. 51 Table 8.

Foam Dressings Three poor -quality studies provided insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of foam vs. gauze dressin gs. One poor -quality study among patients with stage II ulcers found greater improvement in Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) scores with a polymeric foam dressing compared with dry gauze with antibiotic ointment.86 Two poor -quality trials comparing polyurethane foam dressings to gauze found no significant differences in time to healing87 or complete wound healing.88 Both studies reported lower overall costs with foam dressings, attributable to fewer dressing changes and consequently less personnel time. 56 Table 10.

Transparent F ilm D ressings Three poor -quality trials provided inconsistent results about the effectiveness of transparent film dressings. In one 8 week trial,89 more complete wound healing was found in a transparent moisture vapor permeable (MVP) dressing compared with saline gauze (64 percent vs. 0 percent). The benefits of the MVP dressing were observed only in less advanced ulcers (Shea grade II but not III). Two studies 90,91 found no significant differences between transparent film (Op-Site) dressings and gauze. 57 Table 11.

Hydrocolloid C ompared With H ydrocolloid One fair -quality trial92 found more favorable reductions in wound area (32 percent vs. 17 percent) and pain with a triangular compared with oval hydrocolloid dressing in patients with stage II and III sacral ulcers. Hydrocolloid C ompared With H ydrogel trials co mpared hydrocolloid to hydrogel dressings and provided insufficient evidence to draw conclusions. One poor -quality trial93 reported better complete wound healing (43 percent vs. 24 percent) over 2 months, with hydrogel compared with hydrocolloid dressings in stage I and II ulcers. Two other poor -quality trials79,94 found no significant differences in outcomes comparing hydrocolloid and hydrogel dressings in stage II and III ulcers over 8 weeks. Hydrocolloid C ompared With T ransparent Film Only one trial, of fair quality, 95 compared hydrocolloid and transparent film dressings and found no significant difference in complete wound healing (60 percent in both groups over 8 weeks) among patients with stage II and III ulcers. Hydrocolloid C ompared With F oam Three fair -quality96-98 and five poor -quality99-103 trials compared hydrocolloid dressings with a variety of different polymeric or hydrocellular foam dressings. Overall the evidence suggested similar complete wound healing with these two dressing types. One fair -quality study reported similar healing outcomes at 8 weeks , but slightly faster time to healing (32 vs. 38 days) with an amino acid copolymer dressing compared with hydrocolloid in patients with stage III and IV ulcers. 97 One poor -quality study reported better complete healing rates (59 percent vs. 27 percent) with a hydrocellular foam dressing compared with hydrocolloid.102 All other studies reported similar healing outcomes for both dressing types. We conducted a meta -analysis o f the eight studies comparing hydrocolloid with foam dressings. Complete wound healing was similar with foam compared with hydrocolloid dressings (pooled RR 1.12, 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.41, I2=16.4%, p=0.301) (Figure 5). An analysis excluding the four poor -quality trials produced similar results (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.65, I2=0.0%, p=0.675) . 84,97 Figure dressings: Pooled results Hydrocolloid C ompared With A lginate A single fair -quality trial105 compared a strategy of using a calcium alginate dressing for 4 weeks followed by a hydrocolloid dressing for 4 weeks with using the hydrocolloid dressing for all 8 weeks. Complete wound healing was similar across groups but wound area reduction was greater with the alginate/hydrocolloid strategy (69 percent vs. 43 percent). See Table 12.

Radiant H eat C ompared With O ther D ressings Two good -quality trials109,110 and two fair -quality trials111,112 of patients with stage III or IV ulcers compared a radiant heat dressing to hydrocolloid dressings,109 alginate dressings,110 or \"standard care,\"111,112 which included a of other dre ssings, including gauze, alginates, foam, hydrocolloids, and hydrogels (see Table 1 5). Overall, these studies indicated that radiant heat dressings accelerate the rate of healing compared with other types of dressings. One good - quality and two fair -quality studies measured rates of wound closure and overall found faster healing rates with radiant heat over periods of 4 to 8 weeks. A meta -analysis of the three trials reporting complete wound healing results indicated similar outcomes with radiant heat compar ed with other dressings (pooled RR CI, 0.88 to 1.98, I2 = 0.0% p=0.985) (Figure 6). 67 Table 15.

Radiant heat compared with other dressings: Pooled results Other C omparisons Several studies evaluated dressings that did not fall into the general dressing categories listed above. A good- quality trial113 compared wrap therapy - dressing stage II -III ulcers with food wrap or polyethylene sheets - to usual care, which typically involved the use of hydrocolloid, hydrogel, or foam dressings. Complete wound healing and time to healing were similar in both groups. Another good- quality trial 114 compared an activated charcoal dressing with a hydrocolloid dressing and found no significant difference in healing outcomes among patients with stage III ulcers. A fair -quality trial 115 compared \"advanced\" wound dressi ngs, including hydrogel, foam, or transparent film, with \"standard\" dressings, including gauze, alginates, or hydrocolloids. Specific dressings were chosen based on ulcer characteristics. In 58 community - dwelling patients, complete healing was 54 percent i n the advanced dressing group and 30 percent in the standard group, though this difference was not significant. A fair -quality trial 116 compared a honey dressing with a bactericidal dressing and found significantly more complete healing (20 percent vs. 0 percent) and better PUSH scores with the honey dressing over a 5 -week period (see Table 16) .

A good- quality trial117 compared collagenase ointment with a hydrocolloid dressing in patients with stage III ulcers and found no significant difference in ulcer healing , but improved pain in the collagenase group. In a fair - quality trial, 118 the same investigators found similar healing outcomes for collagenase applied every 24 hours compared with every 48 hours, though pain outcomes were better with the every 24 hour application. Another fair -quality trial compared collagenase with fibrinol ysin plus DNAase and found a non significant difference favoring collagenase in necrotic wound area reduction (47 percent vs. 36 percent) . 119 A fair -quality trial120 found no significant differences in complete wound healing or wound area reduction when com paring topical collagenase with papain/urea, but necrotic tissue debridement was better with papain/urea. A poor -quality trial121 reported shorter healing times and more complete healing (92 percent vs. 64 percent) with collagenase compared with hydrocolloid after 16 weeks. A poor -quality trial 122 found nonsignificant differences in wound area reduction when comparing Varidase (streptokinase and streptodornase) with zinc oxide (19 percent vs. 2 percent) over 8 weeks.

A good- quality trial72 found more complete healing of stage I and II ulcers after 8 weeks with hydrocolloid compared with phenytoin (74 percent vs. 40 percent); this effect was seen primarily in the stage I ulcers. Another good- quality trial123 reported nonsignificant differenc es in PUSH scores and wound volume reduction (48 percent vs. 36 percent) with phenytoin solution compared to saline gauze in stage II ulcers. One poor -quality trial124 found shorter time to complete wound healing for stage II ulcers with phenytoin compared with either a hydrocolloid dressing or topical antibiotic ointment (35 vs. 52 vs. 54 days).

A g ood-quality trial125 comparing dextranomer paste to a calcium alginate dressing measured partial healing and wound area reduction after 8 weeks in patients with stage III and IV ulcers and found significantly faster wound surface area reduction with algina te. A poor -quality study 126 found greater wound area reduction with a hydrogel dressing compared with dextranomer paste (35 percent vs. 7 percent) after 3 weeks. Table 19.

A good- quality trial127 comparing topical collagen to a hydrocolloid dressing found similar complete wound healing for both treatments (51 percent vs. 50 percent) for stage II and III ulcers over 8 weeks. One poor -quality trial128 of 24 patients found no significant difference i n wound area reduction over 3 weeks between topical collagen and placebo (59 percent vs. 46 percent). Another poor -quality trial comparing a collagen and cellulose matrix (Promogran) to petrolatum gauze showed no significant difference in complete wound he aling between treatments (90 percent vs. 70 percent) over 8 weeks. 129 Table 20.

The three studies we identified evaluated different antimicrobial formulations and provided insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about effectiveness. One poor -quality trial124 found similar time to stage II ulcer healing with a triple antibiotic ointment compared with a hydrocolloid dressing (54 vs. 52 days), but inferior to topical phenytoin (35 days) (see Table 18 ). A poor -quality trial 130 with stage I and II ulcers found more complete healing over 4 weeks with oxyquinoline ointment compared with A&D ointment, though this benefit was seen only with stage II ulcers (45 percent vs. 22 percent). A fair -quality trial131 found no significant differences in ulcer healing when comparing silver sulfadiazine cream to a silver mesh dressing (Table 21) . Table 21.

All studies found benefits for maggot therapy, includi ng greater wound area reduction132,133 and faster time to complete wound healing ,134 when comparing healing in pat ients receiving maggot therapy either to healing during a period of usual care before maggot therapy was implemented, or to patients not receiving maggot therapy. None of the studies adequately accounted for selection bias or potential confounders. Table 22.

Other Several topical therapies were evaluated in single trials that provided insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about effectiveness. One poor -quality trial135 found more complete wound healing over 6 months in 22 patients treated with resin salve compare d with a hydrocolloid 79 dressing (92 percent vs. 44 percent). A fair -quality trial found greater wound area reduction with a combination of a zinc -based ointment and vitamin A -based spray (Dermagran) compared with either the ointment or spray alone, or to pl acebo (91 percent vs. 26 percent vs. 7 percent vs. 5 percent), in stage I -IV ulcers over 6 weeks.136 We identified several single -study evaluations of plant -derived and other nonpharmaceutical topical treatments ,137-140 but all were small and poor quality. Similarly, evaluations of hyaluronate141 and ketanserin142 were limited to single, poor - quality trials, and evaluation of hydrogenated castor oil, and balsam peru castor oil trypsin (BCT) ointment143 was limited to a single, retrospective cohort study.

Biological Agents Comparisons of different biological agents are described below and in Tables 24-26. Platelet -Derived G rowth F actor Four studies (one fair, three poor) compared platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) or platelet gel compared with placebo and provided evidence of better wound improvement with PDGF for stage III and IV ulcers. One fair -quality trial144comparing PDGF to placebo in stage II I and IV ulcers found higher rates of complete wound healing over 16 weeks (23 percent vs. 0 percent) . A poor -quality trial found greater wound depth reduction over 4 weeks (86 percent vs. 65 percent) with PDGF .145,146 One poor -quality trial147 found bette r ulcer volume reduction (71 percent vs. 17 percent) , but no significant difference in complete wound healing (38 percent vs. 14 percent) with PDGF. Comparison of different doses indicated that 100 mcg/g per day produced similar or better results than higher or lower doses. A poor -quality trial of platelet gel for stage III and IV ulcers showed no si gnificant difference in ulcer volume reduction over 14 weeks compared with usual care with alginate or topical antimicrobials. 148 82 Table 24.

Other Growth Factors Other growth factors were evaluated in single studies that provided insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about effectiveness. A good- quality trial found better complete wound healing in stage II, III, and IV ulcers with nerve growth factor compared wi th placebo (44 percent vs. 6 percent) over 14 weeks.149 A good- quality trial comparing a fibroblast- derived dermal replacement system (Dermagraft) to no dermal replacement found no significant difference in complete wound healing (11 percent vs. 13 percent ), ulcer area or volume reduction, or wound infection in stage III ulcers over 24 weeks.150 A poor -quality trial of fibroblast growth factor did find better partial (> 70 percent) wound healing compared with placebo (60 percent vs. 29 percent) in stage III and IV ulcers over 1 month.151 Another poor -quality trial found no significant difference in complete wound healing (75 percent vs. 71 percent) or ulcer volume reduction with fibroblast growth factor compared with placebo. Studies of TGF -beta and GM - CSF w ere limited to single, poor -quality studies.152-154 A poor -quality trial comparing varying 84 doses of interleukin 1 to placebo found no differences in wound volume reduction over 29 days.155 Table 25.

One study comparing injected macrophage suspension to standard care (as prescribed by a wound care team) for stage III and IV ulcers found more complete wound healing in the macrophage -treated group (70 percent vs. 13 percent) with a median healing time of 87 days.156 The other poor -quality cohort study also found more complete wound healing (27 percent vs. 6 percent) with macrophage treatment compared with usual care over 12 months. 157 Table 26.

Evidence About the Comparative Effectiveness of Local Wound Applications by Subgroup -Analysis (Key Question 1a, 1b, and 1c) Few studies conducted subgroup analyses by ulcer characteristics. A fair -quality trial of transp arent MVP dressings found that the benefit of those dressings over gauze in patients with stage III ulcers was seen only in the less severe ulcers within that stage.89 A good -quality study demonstrated better outcomes with hydrocolloid compared with gauze for gluteal and ischial , but not sacral ulcers.72 In that same study, hydrocolloid was superior to phenytoin in stage I but not 87 stage II ulcers , and in gluteal but not other ulcers.72 Another fair -quality study found faster healing with phenytoin compared with hydrocolloid in sta ge II ulcers. A fair -quality study found that the benefit of radiant heat dressings compared with standard care, in terms of rate of healing, was more prominent with larger (> 5 cm2) wounds.111 Another fair -quality trial found that the benefit of radiant heat over other dressings was observed for both stage III and IV ulcers.158 A poor-quality study found that the benefit of oxyquinoline ointment over A&D ointment was seen in stage II but not stage I ulcers130 A poor -quality study comparing macrophage treat ment to standard care found similar benefits for macrophage treatment in the entire study sample, those with diabetes, and those with ulcers of the leg compared with other locations. 156 Indirect comparisons across studies to evaluate the possibility that treatment effectiveness is modified by ulcer, patient, or setting characteristics are limited by the fact that there were relatively few studies evaluating any given treatment comparison and by the fact that aside from ulcer stage and location, patient age and gender, and study setting, few variables were reported consistently across studies. In the 10 studies comparing hydrocolloid with gauze dressings, there was no clear pattern to suggest variation in findings by ulcer, patient, or setting characteristic s. The same is true for other treatment comparisons, all of which had fewer studies. Local Wound Applications: Harms (Key Question 2) Harms of local wound applications for pressure ulcers were measured in 36 studies. Since most studies were small, the rates of harms reported in studies that did measure them and statistical comparisons of harms across treatment groups were not reported. Harms commonly measured and reported included skin irritation and inflammation, as well as tissue damage and maceration. C ommonly measured, but infrequently occurring , harms included infection, pain, bleeding, tissue overgranulation, and wound deterioration. Wound Dressings Hydrocolloid Harms were measured in 14 studies evaluating hydrocolloid dressings in samples ranging from 7 to 199 patients. 73,75,79,92,93,98,99,103,105,114,117,127,159,160 Commonly reported harms included skin reactions (inflammation, erythema), maceration, pain, wound deterioration, and overgranulation, with rates of harms ranging from 0 to 16 percent. In a fair -quality study comparing a triangular with oval hydrocolloid dressing in 96 patients, wound deterioration and skin reactions were observed in 4 percent with the triangular dressing and 31 percent with the oval dressing over 10 days. 92 Hydrogel Harms measured in five studies of hydrogel dressings in samples ranging from 10 to 135 patients79,84,85,93,126 occurred in 0 to 12 percent of patients and included skin irritation and wound deterioration. Foam Harms of foam dressings measured in four tria ls (five publications) with sample sizes ranging from 40 to 199 patients76,98,99,103,107 occurred in 1 to 30 percent and included bleeding, overgranulation, wound deterioration, maceration, and tissue damage. A large, poor -quality 88 cohort study of 1,891 pat ients with 3 ,969 ulcers reported a 3 percent infection rate and less than 1 percent rate of skin stripping with foam dressings.108 Transparent F ilm Harms were measured for transparent film dressings in two studies with sample sizes ranging from 72 to 77 pa tients.89,95 One study reported no harms95 while the other reported a 14 percent rate of wound deterioration.89 Alginate Harms of alginate dressings measured in four studies with sample sizes ranging from 7 to 110 patients105,106,110,125,161 occurred in 0 to 11 percent of patients and included infection, overgranulation, skin irritation, maceration, bleeding, and wound deterioration. Silicone In a large poor -quality cohort study of 1,891 patients with 3,969 ulcers, infections were reported in 9 percent of patients and skin stripping occurred in 2 percent of patients managed with silicone dressings .108 Radiant H eat One study including 50 patients reported on skin condition after use of radiant heat dressings.110 Inflammation occurred in 11 percent and macera tion in 4 percent, though similar rates were observed with the use of alginate dressings in that study. Comparative Harms In most studies reporting harms of dressings, rates were qualitatively similar between treatment arms; most studies were small and did not report statistical testing of differences in harms. A poor -quality study comparing hydrocolloid with hydrogel in 90 patients reported wound deterioration in 10 percent and 1.5 percent respectively,93 although another poor -quality study reported sim ilar rates of skin complications comparing hydrocolloid to hydrogel dressings (12 percent vs. 14 percent).79 A poor -quality study with 40 patients found no harms with hydrocolloid but six adverse outcomes among 20 patients (30 percent) with a polyurethane foam dressing.99 However, a fair -quality study with 40 patients found similar rates of harms (0.5 to 1 percent) comparing a hydrocolloid with a hydrocellular foam dressing.98 A fair -quality trial with 38 patients found more tissue damage and maceration wit h a polymeric foam dressing compared with a silicone dressing.107 However, a large cohort study with 1891 patients found no significant differences in infection or skin stripping with foam compared with silicone.108 A study of radiant heat compared with al ginate dressings found no significant differences in skin complications.110 Topical Therapies Enzymes One good- quality, one fair -quality, and one poor -quality study evaluating collagenase with sample sizes ranging from 37 to 135 patients reported harms - primarily pain, skin inflammation and necrosis - in 0 to 6 percent of patients.117,120,162 Harms occurred at the same rate in a study comparing collagenase applied every 24 hours with every 48 hours.118 A single, fair -quality study evaluating fibrinolysin p lus DNAase found no harms attributable to the treatment.119 A 89 poor-quality study reported discontinuation of topical streptokinase/ streptodornase in 3 of 14 patients due to skin reactions, necrosis, or infection.122 Phenytoin One good- quality and one poor -quality study including a total of 71 patients reported no adverse effects from topical phenytoin.123,124 Dextranomer In a good- quality trial with 92 patients,125 harms occurred in 22 percent of patients treated with dextranomer paste and included infection, bleeding, overgranulation, and skin irritation, though most adverse reactions were considered minor and did not necessitate stopping treatment. Collagen One good- quality and one poor -quality study with 145 patients reported no adverse events with topica l collagen.127,129 Antimicrobials A fair -quality trial with 45 patients124 found no adverse events associated with triple antibiotic ointment. A poor -quality series163 reported no adverse effects of silver sulfadiazine cream in 21 patients. Biological Age nts Platelet -Derived G rowth F actor One fair -quality and one poor -quality study with 137 patients reported on harms (systemic or local infection, or worsening ulcer) of PDGF and platelet gel and found no significant differences compared with placebo. 144,148 Other G rowth F actors No systemic or local harms were observed in a good- quality study of nerve growth factor with 37 patients.149 No significant differences were found in overall adverse events in a study of 34 patients comparing fibroblast -derived dermal replacement with usual care.150 Harms were not measured in studies of other growth factors. Macrophage S uspension A poor -quality cohort study of macrophage suspension including 100 patients reported no adverse events attributable to treatment.156 Evidence About the Harms Related to Local Wound Applications by Subgroups According to Pressure Ulcer Characteristics (Key Question 2a), Patient Characteristics (Key Question 2b), or Setting (Key Question 2c) No studies reported subgroup analyses to evaluate harms by ulcer, patient, or setting characteristics. Indirect comparisons across studies to evaluate differential rates of harm by ulc er, patient, or setting characteristics were not possible due to the inconsistency of harm reporting and the infrequent occurrence of specific adverse events. 90 Effectiveness of Surgery Pressure ulcers that have progressed to advanced stages often become c hronic and do not completely heal with conservative measures. Surgical debridement and vascularized soft -tissue reconstructions are commonly used when nonhealing is observed or the wound has progressed to an advanced stage despite appropriate conservative management. Frail and debilitated elders and patients with sensory and motor deficits are at greatest risk for developing such advanced grade pressure ulcers. Surgical intervention is generally conducted by plastic and reconstructive surgeons and range from local debridement of necrotic and nonviable tissue in the wound bed to direct closure, skin grafting, and closure with soft tissue flaps. The flap is a section of soft tissue that is placed over the open wound and may be harvested from skin (cutaneous), fascia (fasciocutaneous), or muscle (myocutaneous) from nonaffected parts of the body. Direct closure is rarely indicated due to high risk of failure from increased tension at the closure site. 164 Skin grafting is generally used for shallow nonhealing ulce rs that have a well -vascularized wound bed. This procedure is also rarely used due to high risk of failure from mechanical strain.164 Most commonly, soft tissue flaps are harvested and used to surgically close the wound. Ideally, the tissue chosen should have adequate blood supply for healing and adequate thickness to meet the need of the surgical site. 164 Description of Studies To determine the effectiveness of surgery in the treatment of pressure ulcers we included controlled trials, observational studies with at least two comparative groups, and intervention series if the population was large and the study was conducted at multiple sites. We found one poor-quality trial 165 and one fair -quality retrospective intervention series that met our inclusion criteria.166 Given the paucity of evidence, we expanded our inclusion to retrospective series from a single site if the population was large and provided comparative data. We found an additional three fair -quality studies, one with two publications. 167-170 The total number of included studies was five , including one trial and four observational studies. Details extracted from intervention series studies are included in Table 27 and the trial details are included in the evidence tables (see Appendix H, Table H -7). The assessments of the quality rating criteria used for each study are provided in Appendix H, Table H -8. The single trial was small (n=60), whereas on average the retrospective studies were of moderate size, ranging from 59 to 201 patients and accoun ting for 69 to 380 pressure ulcers. The retrospective studies ranged from 5 to 20 years of followup. The populations in studies of surgical interventions for pressure ulcers included elderly nursing home patients and spinal cord injured or neurologically impaired younger adults ( mean ages 34 -50). All studies enrolled patients with advanced pressure ulcers, stage III or IV NPUAP equivalent. The intervention for all patients was some form of surgical repair of the pressure ulcer, either through primary clos ure, or soft tissue flap (cutaneous, fasciocutaneous, or myocutaneous ). The one trial compared the use of CO 2 laser with knife or electric knife for wound closure by local transposition of tissue or skin graft.165 One study only considered patients with i schial pressure ulcer s.170 For other intervention series, different approaches were compared. The outcomes for the trial were operative time, blood loss, infection rate, hospitalization days, and failure rate.165 The outcomes for intervention series were wound healing, recurrence rates . 91 The harms for intervention series studies included wound dehiscence, infection, reoperative rates, and other complications of the surgery. The settings were hospitals or rehabilitation centers. The single trial was conducted in Argentina. The intervention series were from the U nited S tates, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Key Points Evidence was inconclusive to determine if one approach to closure of stage III to IV pressure ulcers is superior to another due to quality of the studies and heterogeneity in patient popula tions and surgical procedures (strength of evidence: insufficient). Sacral pressure ulcers have lower recurrence rates after surgery than ischial pressure ulcers (strength of evidence: low). Spinal cord injured patients had higher rates of recurrent pressure ulcer after surgical flap closure than other patients with pressure ulcers (strength of evidence: low). Reoperation due to recurrence or flap failure ranged from 12 to 24 percent (strength of evidence: low). Wound dehiscence is more common if bone is removed at time of surgical procedure (strength of evidence: low). Complication rates after surgery are higher for ischial ulcers than for sacral or trochanteric ulcers (strength of evidence: low). Detailed Analysis Evidence About the Comparative Effectiveness of Surgery (Key Question 1) Determining the effectiveness of surgical techniques for treatment of pressure ulcers was limited to poor -quality intervention series. One poor -quality trial and four fair-quality intervention series including a total of 620 patients accounting for 1,057 pressure ulcers provided evidence on the effectiveness of surgical techniques to treat stage III or IV pressure ulcers. Overall sacral pressure ulcers have lower recurrence rates than ischial pressure ulcers and spinal cord injured patients are at the greatest risk of recurrence. Evidence is inconclusive to determine optimal types of soft tissue flap or how this might vary depending on the anatomical site of the pressure ulce r. We found only one, poor -quality randomized trial (n=60) comparing one surgical technique with another. 165 CO 2 laser was compared with knife or electric knife for wound closure by local transposition of tissue or skin graft.165 The study reported significant reduction in operative blood loss (2.1 +/ - 0.1 cm3/cm2 vs. 2.6 +/ - 0.1 cm3/cm2), operative time (39+/ -5 minutes vs. 45 +/ - 7 minutes), hospital days (68 percent fewer days), and infection rate (11/30, 37 percent vs. 14/30, 47 percent) with laser surgery. Although the study was poor quality , it suggest ed a laser knife may be superior to standard wound closure. Further studies would be needed to determine if this is accurate. We found five retrospective series, all rated fair q uality, evaluating long -term results of surgeries performed for patients with advanced (primarily stage III -IV) pressure ulcers (n=560, nPU=997). 166-170 Two were conducted at multiple sites166,167 and two were conducted at single sites.168-170 The combined results provide low strength of evidence that sacral pressure ulcers have lower recurrence rates than ischial pressure ulcers and insufficient evidence to determine optimal surgical procedure. 92 The smallest retrospective series (n=53, nPU=69) conducted in Japan analyzed outcomes of paraplegic patients, mean age 50 years, treated with fasciocutaneous or myocutaneous flaps over an average followup period of 44 months.167 It was unclear if the study included all surgically treated patients with ischial or sacr al pressure ulcers during the five years of chart review.167 There was a trend toward greater recurrence rate in ischial compared with sacral pressure ulcers (50 percent vs. 70 percent) and toward better 36- month pressure ulcer free survival rates with fasciocutaneous compared with myocutaneous flaps (68 percent vs. 43 percent), although the difference was not significant. Two of the three larger retrospective studies reported on recurrence rate and found overall pressure ulcer recurrence rates of 19 percent 166 and 33 percent.168 The publication by Kierney , et al. was a retrospective study of patients from two centers treated with surgical repair of stage III or IV pressure ulcers between October 1977 and December 1989. They reported on 158 patients with 268 pressure ulcers, mean age 35 years, with mean followup of 3.7 years. They found that cutaneous flaps had the highest recurrence (12/44, 27 percent) , compared with fasciocutaneous (8/54, 15 percent) and myocutaneous flaps (13/99, 13 percent). 166 Sacral si tes had the least recurrence (8/69, 12 percent) with similar recurrence rates in ischial and trochanteric sites (32/15, 21 percent and 11/49, 22 percent respectively). 166 Schryvers , et al . conducted a single center retrospective study of patients treated with surgical repair of stage III to IV pressure ulcers between 1976 and 1996, with mean followup of 5.3 years for patients with more than three ulcers and 9.3 years for patients with one ulcer. 168 They reported 380 pressure ulcers in 148 patients, mean ag e 41 years (range: 16- 91). The overall ulcer recurrence rate was 33 percent, greatest with ischial ulcers (84/249, 34 percent). Trochanteric ulcers were the slowest to heal (97 -105.6 days). Time to complete healing was similar between the different surgica l procedures (primary closure 52 -97 days, fasciocutaneous flap 52- 100 days, myocutaneous 44- 105 days). Foster , et al . evaluated fasciocutaneous and different types of myocutaneous flaps in 201 patients with 280 pressure ulcers, age 50 (range: 16- 90), cons idered healing at 1 month to be flap success and reported overall flap success of 89 percent (248/280). In patients treated for ischial ulcers, they found that gluteal thigh (fasciocutaneous) and inferior gluteus maximus island (myocutaneous) flaps demonst rated the best healing at 93 and 94 percent while V -Y hamstring and tensor fascia latae flaps (both myocutaneous) had the least success at 58 and 50 percent respectively (Table 27). 169,170 93 Table 27.

However, the authors were uncertain if this was related to sample size differences per group (2 1 vs. 91) or other risk factors for pressure ulcer s. They noted that 71 percent of patients with small ulcers had more than one risk factor for pressure ulcers , but did not report this result for patients in the group with large ulcers.169,170 Evidence About the Comparative Effectiveness of Surgery by Subgroups According to Patient Characteristics (Key Question 1b) Most studies enrolled neurologically compromised patients \u2014primarily spinal cord injured through trauma, tumor, or congenitally \u2014 with the average age of 34 to 50 years. One study compared recurrence rates between patients with spinal cord impairment and other patients , and found no significant difference between paraplegia (38/160, 24 percent), quadriplegia (7/35, 20 percent), and spina bifida (3/ 13, 23 percent ). However, spinal cord injured patients had a higher risk of recurrence compared with patients with multiple sclerosis (0/9, 0 percent) or other conditions causing immobility (3/51, 6 percent). 166 Evidence About the Comparative Effectiveness of Surgery by Subgroups According to Settings (Key Question 1c) One study (n=158, nPU=268) reported long- term data on pressure ulcer recurrence when surgical debridement and closure are supplemented with patient rehabilitation and education.166 The inves tigators provided a complete perioperative rehabilitation program that included nutrition, social work, physical therapy, wheelchair and mechanical device maintenance, and detailed skin care education. Pressure ulcer recurrence rates were lower than similar long -term studies (19 percent vs. 33 percent to 39 percent), however no study directly compared patients who received this treatment with those who did not. Surgery: Harms (Key Question 2) Three retrospective observational studies, one with two publicat ions, reported on harms associated with surgical techniques for the treatment of pressure ulcers.168-171 One of the studies examined a subset of patients with ischial pressure ulcers also included in the larger study .169,170 Two of the studies reported ove rall complication rate ranging from 28 to 37 percent.168,169 The most common harm was wound dehiscence. One study (n=148, nPU=380) was a 20- year chart review of all patients treated at a single center with wound closure or flap procedure for advanced press ure ulcers. 168 The mean followup ranged from 5.3 years for those with more than three admissions to 9.3 years of followup for those with one admission. The overall dehiscence 96 rate was 31 percent. The type of procedure influenced the occurrence of wound dehiscence, with myocutaneous flaps causing the greatest incidence of dehiscence at each Rates of dehiscence were higher when bone was excised due to osteomyelitis detected at surgery , most notably at the trochanteric (16/22, 73 percent) and sacral sites (8/14, 57 percent) . 168 One 16- year chart review at a single center (n=201, nPU=280) also reported on wound dehiscence but separated those with slight dehiscence in w hich the wound had complete healing within 1 month of surgery and those with significant dehiscence that affected the ability for the wound to heal. 169 The review reported 10 percent slight dehiscence (27/280) and 3 percent significant dehiscence (9/280) but did not report analysis based on site or surgical procedure. A subset from this study of repairs to ischial pressure ulcers, the type most commonly associated with recurrence, were analyzed in a different report (n=87, nPU=112). 169 In this smaller cohor t there was 14 percent slight dehiscence (16/112) and 4 percent significant dehiscence (5/112).169 Partial flap necrosis was found in 10 patients (9 percent) who had myocutaneous flaps using tensor fascia latae, gracilis, or V -Y hamstring grafts.169 Need f or reoperation from the other studies ranged from 12 to 16 percent but these other studies did not analyze based on surgical intervention.168,169 Other harms associated with primary closure or flap repair included osteomyelitis or infection (5 percent to 1 6 percent),168,169 donor site graft loss (2 percent),169 and one case each of intraoperative myocardial infarction, aspiration pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis.169 In summary, there was moderate evidence that complications associated with primary closu re or flap repair of advanced pelvic pressure ulcers are common, ranging from 28 to 37 percent, with wound dehiscence being the most common. Wound dehiscence may be more common if bone is removed at the time of surgery. Evidence was inconclusive to determine if one type of repair performs better or worse than another or how this is related to site of ulcer given the quality of the studies and the heterogeneity of the populations and surgical procedures . Reoperation due to recurrence or flap failure ranged f rom 12 to 24 percent. Evidence About the Harms Related to Surgery by Subgroups According to Pressure Ulcer Characteristics (Key Question 2a), Patient Characteristics (Key Question 2b), or Setting (Key Question 2c) All of the studies reporting on harms associated with surgical techniques for the treatment of pressure ulcers enrolled patients with advanced, stage III -IV, pressure ulcers with a scarcity of evidence on comparative features of the pressure ulcers. One study considered site of pressure ulcer and type of surgical procedure and found greater dehiscence at trochanteric sites (31/90, 35 percent) compared with sacral or ischial sites (25/82, 30 percent and 74/249, 30 percent respectively). 168 The study also considered dehiscence if bone was excised at the time of surgery (indicative of osteomyelitis ), and found that rates of dehiscence were higher, most notably at the trochanteric (16/22, 73 percent) and sacral sites (8/14, 57 percent).168 One study examining a subset of patients with ischial pressure ulcers found that the overall complication rate, as well as wound dehiscence and partial flap necrosis, were all greater than the overall population. 169,170 No studies reported on differences in harms according to patient characteristics, patient care settings, or features of patient care settings. Effectiveness of Adjunctive Therapies Adjunctive therapies refer to pressure ulcer interventions used in addition to standard wound care, where standard care includes pressure relief and local wound applications . The term 97 adjunctive suggests that these are secondary treatments used to complement or enhance the effect of a primary therapeutic modality. Although many of the therapies described as adjunctive are used as standalone treatments, all are used in conjunc tion with standard wound care including dressings and standard pressure ulcer relief practices. We use the term adjunctive because it has become the standard label for this group of treatments among researchers and clinicians. Adjunctive therapies include electrical stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, light therapy, laser therapy, hydrotherapy, vibration, shock wave, and hyperbaric oxygen. Description of Studies We found six systematic reviews (SR) which were used only as background, 34 trials (three good- quality trials, 29 fair -quality trials, and two poor-quality trials), and five observational studie s (two fair- quality and three poor -quality studies) evaluating adjunctive therapies that met our inclusion criteria. Poor -quality studies were considered only if there was a paucity of evidence from higher -quality studies and none met this requirement.172-175 Sample sizes in the trials ranged from 6 to 198 patients and study duration from 7 days to 16 weeks. Details extracted from each study are included in the evidence tables (see Appendix H, Table H-9). The assessments of the quality rating criteria used for each study are provided in Appendix H, Table H -10. The populations varied with many enrolling an elderly general population and others a younger neurologically compromised group. Sizes and stages of pressure ulcers varied across studies. (See Appendix C for NPUAP scale equivalents .) Interventions included electrical stim ulation (12 studies including one study with two publications, one SR), electromagnetic therapy (four studies, two SR s), the rapeutic ultrasound (four studies, one SR), ne gative pressure wound therapy (five studies, two SR s), light therapy (six studies), la ser therapy (three studies plus one direct study included in ultrasound), hydrotherapy (two studies), vibration (one study with two publications), shock wave therapy (one study), and hyperbaric oxygen (one study). Interventions varied in treatment dose, frequency, duration, and set up. All used standard wound care in conjunction with the adjunctive therapy. The comparator was either sham treatment (placebo) or standard care. The outcomes varied across studies, but most evaluated the percent change in wound surface area, complete wound healing, or time to healing as primary or secondary outcomes. Some studies used scales such as the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) and Pressure Sore Status Tool. 176 Study settings included hospitals and rehabilitatio n centers, with fewer outpatient clinics and home health. The studies were conducted in the United States , Nigeria, India, Israel, Canada, Scandinavia, Serbia, Greece, Netherlands, and Switzerland. Direct evidence comparing one intervention with another wa s limited. Our ability to derive indirect evidence from comparisons across studies was also limited due to variability in study population, design, outcomes measured, and sample size. Study data and the quality assessment of each study are presented in evi dence tables (see Appendix H, Evidence Table H-10) 98 Key Points Key Question 1 Electrical Stimulation Electrical stimulation was beneficial in accelerating the rate of healing of stage II, III, and IV pressure ulcers based on one good -quality and eight fair-quality randomized trials (strength of evidence: moderate). Evidence about the effect of electrical stimulation on complete wound healing was inconclusive due to heterogeneous findings across studies (strength of evidence: insufficient). Electromagnet ic Therapy Wound improvement of stage II, III, or IV pressure ulcers was similar with electromagnetic therapy compared to sham treatment based on four randomized trials . (strength of evidence: low ). Therapeutic Ultrasound Wound improvement was similar with ultrasound compared to standard care or sham treatment based on three randomized trials (strength of evidence: low). Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Wound improvement was similar with negative pressure wound therapy compared to standard care over 4 to 6 w eeks of therapy based on two randomized trials and one observational study (strength of evidence: low). Light Therapy Light therapy was similar to sham light therapy in producing complete wound healing, based on two randomized trials (strength of evidence: low). Light therapy reduces wound surface area more than standard care or sham light therapy based on four randomized trials and one observational study (strength of evidence: low). Laser Therapy Wound improvement was similar with l aser therapy compared to sham treatment or standard care based on four randomized trials (strength of evidence: low). Hydrotherapy Evidence on the effectiveness of hydrotherapy was insufficient based on two randomized trials evaluating different treatment modalities (one of whirlpool therapy and one of pulsatile lavage) (strength of evidence: insufficient) 99 Key Question 2 Harms of Adjunctive Therapies The most common adverse effect of electrical stimulation was local skin irritation (strength of evidence: lo w). There is a lack of studies evaluating harms of electromagnetic therapy, ultrasound, negative pressure wound therapy, and hydrotherapy. Light therapy caused no significant adverse events based on four randomized studies (strength of evidence: low). Shor t-term use of laser therapy caused no significant adverse events based on three randomized studies (strength of evidence: low). Subgroups Frail elderly patients experience more adverse events with electrical stimulation compared with a younger population ( strength of evidence: low). Detailed Analysis Evidence A bout the Comparative Effectiveness of Adjunctive Therapies (Key Question 1) Electrical Stimulation Electrical stimulation therapy is the delivery of direct electric current through the wound bed using surface electrodes. All equipment is designed to provide high- voltage pulsed currents with variable intensity (voltage) and frequency (pulses per second or Hz) . The electrodes either surround the wound or one electrode is placed directly on the wound and a second placed at a distant site. Electrical stimulation is believed to promote cell growth and differentiation. We found no direct evidence comparing electrical stimulation to other interventions for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Nine randomized trials, one good quality177 and eight fair quality,178-185 provided evidence regarding the effect of direct electrical stimulation compared with sham treatments. Overall, electrical stimulation increased the rate of healing in stage II, III, and IV pressure ulcers . However , the evidence was insufficient to determine its effect on complete wound healing, due to heterogeneity of findings across studies. Sample sizes ranged from 7 to 80 patients , accounting for 16 to 192 pressure ulcers. Most were of a durati on ranging from 20 days to 16 weeks. One 8- week study followed patients to day 147179 whereas the rest did not follow patients beyond the study duration. Each study enrolled patients with different sizes and stages of pressure ulcers. One study did not report ulcer stage181 and one reported ulcers as stage II or III but did not report the scale being used.185 Age and comorbid conditions varied from young paraplegics to frail elders. Interventions varied in treatment dose, frequency, duration, and set up but all used electrical stimulation sham as the comparator. Most studies evaluated the percent change in wound surface area as the primary outcome. A trend of greater reduction in wound surface area in the treatment group was seen across studies except for on e study that found no significant difference. 181 In the one study that followed patients for an additional 90 days after treatment, this trend was lost after day 45 and no significant differences were noted at the end of followup179 (Table 28). 100 Six studie s of electrical stimulation evaluated complete wound healing as either a primary or secondary outcome.177,179,182 -185 We did not pool the findings of these six studies using meta - analysis because of statistical heterogeneity of results and inconsistent dir ection of the estimated effect measures across studies. A small good -quality study of patients with stage II, III, IV, or unstageable ulcers found no significant difference in complete wound healing at 3 months.177 All stage II ulcers (treatment n=4, sham n=1) completely healed at 3 months. For all other ulcers, there was an increase in the percentage of ulcers completely healed in the treatment group (5/15, 33.3 percent) compared with the sham group (1/14, 7.1 percent ), but no statistical difference between groups. 177 Two fair -quality studies also found no significant difference in complete healing.179,183 Three fair -quality studies enrolling elderly patients found an increase in complete wound healing in the electrical stimulation group compared with the sham treatment at 4 -8 weeks 177,182,184,185 Two of these studies found a high percentage of completely healed ulcers in the treatment group compared with a very low percentage in the sham group, inconsistent with the results of other trials. Notably , the duration of active treatment for most studies (20 days to 90 days) may not have been long enough to allow for complete healing. One methodologically fair -quality study 186 reported on healing rate without providing appropriate primary data or statistical analysis and did not add to the body evidence. In summary, studies did not demonstrate an effect of electrica l stimulation on complete wound healing compared with sham treatment , but indicated that electrical stimulation may be superior to sham treatment in accelerating the rate of wound healing. These findings are consistent with the findings of two prior system atic reviews of electrical stimulation for pressure ulcers. 10,187 Table 28.

Electromagnetic Therapy Electromagnetic therapy (EMT) is the delivery of energy composed of an electric field and a magnetic field without direct contact on the skin surface. It is theorized that the electromagnetic field alters the cell membrane, potentially promoting transport across the cell membrane, which is thought to promote healing.189 103 We found no direct evidence comparing electromagnetic therapy with other interventions for the treatment of pressure ulcers. We identified four fair -quality r andomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of EMT compared with no EMT or sham EMT in the treatment of stage II - IV pressure ulcers.189-192,193 A trend in the direction of improvement with EMT was found but the significance is called into que stion. Two studies found a trend toward benefit for EMT in complete wound healing of stage II -III pressure ulcers (85 percent vs. 0 percent190 and 87 percent vs. 67 percent192) but, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 10.00 [95% CI, 0.70 to 143.06] and 7.00 [95% CI, 0.41 to 12016] respectively. Two small, fair - quality studies reported a lower time to complete healing with EMT. One study enrolled stage II and III ulcers and found healing in all stage II ulcers and only those treated with EMT in stage III ulcers (stage II ulcers: 13 days vs. 31.5 days; stage III ulcers: 43 days vs. no complete healing).192 The other study reported a significant difference in the average healing time for stage III -IV ulcers (10.80+/ - 4.06 days vs. 18.85 +/ - 9.75 days) . However their success in completely healing all of these advanced ulcers calls into question t heir results.193 The rate of healing is dependent on the initial size of the ulcer , which was not balanced between the active and control groups. Differences in baseline wound area may have introduced bias for this outcome. One fair -quality randomized trial 191 enrolled 12 patients (nPU=24) with neurologic disorders and stage III or IV pressure ulcers and compared EMT with sham EMT over an average of 30 sessions. No significant difference in improvement of ulcer stage was found between the two groups at the completion of the study (p=0.649). Our findings of no significant difference in wound improvement despite a trend toward impro vement with EMT are consistent with a prior Cochrane review on the topic of electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of pressure ulcers 194 However, two additional systematic reviews report on the trend toward improvement with EMT without statistical analy sis of the data .10,189 The clinical significance of this trend remains unknown. Therapeutic Ultrasound Therapeutic ultrasound is the generation of low -frequency sound waves transmitted through soft tissue and created when electrical energy causes deformati on of a piezoelectric crystal located in a transducer. The ability of the sound waves to travel through tissue depends on characteristics of the ultrasound and the tissues through which it travels. Both thermal and nonthermal effects of ultrasound are theorized to improve wound healing based primarily on in- vitro studies. 195 We found two randomized trials comparing the effectiveness of ultrasound with sham ultrasound (US)196-198 and one randomized trial comparing the combination of ultrasound and ultraviol et light with laser therapy or standard wound care.199 Limited evidence found no significant difference in complete wound healing ,although a trend toward improvement with US was seen. All trials were small, had different treatment regimens, and different followup periods. The fair -quality randomized study comparing the combination of ultrasound and ultraviolet -C (UVC) light with laser therapy or standardized wound care enrolled 20 patients comprising 22 wounds and analyzed 16 patients comprising 18 wounds. 199 All patients received standard wound care. Six wounds per group were analyzed after receiving either alternatin g days of ultrasound or UVC 5 days per week, laser therapy 3 days per week, or no additional intervention. For the outcome of complete wound healing, the US/UVC group showed the fastest healing, averaging 4 weeks (range 2 -6 weeks) compared with the control group that averaged 7 weeks (range 4- 13) and the laser group that averaged 11 weeks (range 3 -20). The mean percentage change per week in wound surface area was 53.5 percent for 104 the US/UVC group, 32.4 percent for the control group, and 23.7 percent for the laser group. Although there was a trend toward benefit with ultrasound, no significant difference in complete wound healing was found between US/UV therapy and laser therapy. Given that there is only one small, underpowered study assessing this comparison, there is insufficient evidence to determine if a difference exists in the comparative effectiveness of the combination of US/UVC compared with laser therapy. Of the two randomized studies (n=128) comparing ultrasound with sham ultrasound, neither study found a significant difference in the complete healing of wounds (76 percent vs. 47 percent 196 and 40 percent vs. 44 percent197) and rate of healing. One small pilot study randomized six stage III or IV pressure ulcers in five patients to receive either ul trasound or sham ultrasound.200 They reported a decrease in wound size in the ultrasound group with no change in the sham group, but did not provide specific data to allow comparative analysis for an effect size and therefore do not add to the body of evid ence. Our finding of no benefit in wound improvement with therapeutic ultrasound for pressure ulcers is consistent with two prior systematic reviews . 10,201 Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) involves the use of devices t hat provide a vacuum seal to a wound producing a negative pressure.202 This causes the wound to contract in size while maintaining a moist environment designed to optimize wound healing.202 The negative pressure applied to the wound removes excess intersti tial fluid which reduces concentrations of inhibitory factors while increasing blood flow. This effect , as well as the actual disruption of the extracellular matrix of the wound , is believed to promote wound healing.202 The devices include a vacuum pump, drainage tubing, and foam or gauze dressings that are sealed with an adhesive film. We found evidence on the effectiveness of NPWT from two fair -quality trials and one observational study. There was no evidence of benefit in wound improvement with NPWT. We found direct evidence from one 6- week , fair -quality trial comparing negative pressure wound therapy to a system of wound gel products in 28 patients. 203 Six patients did not complete the study and were not included in analysis. No significant difference was found in complete healing at 6 weeks (NPWT, 2/20 [10 percent] and topical gel, 2/15 [13 percent]). No significant difference was found in reduction of ulcer volume at 6 weeks (NPWT 52 percent and topical gel 42 percent). 203 We found no other direct evi dence comparing vacuum assisted devices to other interventions for the treatment of pressure ulcers. One fair -quality randomized trial204 and one fair -quality retrospective cohort study205 compared NPWT with standard wound care in patients with spinal cor d injuries and stage III or IV pressure ulcers. The trial randomized 24 patients and analyzed 22 patients and found no significant difference in mean time to 50 percent reduction in wound volume (NPWT 27 days [standard deviation ( SD)=10 days]; control 28 days, [SD=10 days], p=0.9). 204 The retrospective cohort study used data collected on U.S. veterans. Patients treated with NPWT were matched with patients treated with standard wound care within each participating site based on demographic variables and ulc er surface area on day 1. Ulcers were classified as healing if the wound surface area decreased and as nonhealing if the wound surface area increased. No significant differences were found in percentage of patients demonstrating healing (NPWT 70 percent vs . standard care 67 percent) or nonhealing (NPWT 30 percent vs. standard care 33 percent). No significant difference was found for percentage of reduction in wound surface area in those classified as healing (NPWT 43 +/ - 22 percent vs. standard care 50 +/ - 26 percent). 105 Based on these three studies, there was low evidence that negative pressure wound therapy provides no benefit in wound improvement over 4- 6 weeks. There was insufficient evidence to determine if NPWT provides any benefit in healing over a lon ger duration due to short duration of studies . These findings are consistent with a prior systematic review.10 Light Therapy Light therapy involves the delivery of electromagnetic energy to the wound surface to promote healing. In the treatment of pressure ulcers, light therapy involves the delivery of energy from the infrared, visible (wavelength 380 -760 nm), and ultraviolet spectrums. There are three types of ultraviolet radiation based on the wavelength of the light transmitted. Ultraviolet -A is the long est wavelength and has the ability to penetrate the deepest. It is the most common type of ultraviolet radiation transmitted to the earth's surface and is responsible for immediate tanning effect. Ultraviolet- B is the medium wavelength radiation, able to p enetrate to more superficial layers of the skin and is most associated with burning and the development of skin cancers. The shortest wavelength radiation is derived from ultraviolet -C light and is considered the most damaging. 206 Polarized light involves the use of a crystal that causes the visible electromagnetic wave to vibrate in one direction only. A laser is a device that amplifies light and is notable for its high degree of spatial and temporal coherence.207 We have grouped polarized, infrared, and ultraviolet light, and classified these as light therapy. We have considered laser therapy as an independent class. We found no direct evidence comparing light therapy with other adjunctive interventions in the treatment of pressure ulcers. We found four f air-quality randomized trials 208-212 and one fair - quality observation study198 comparing light therapy with either sham light therapy or standard care in patients with pressure ulcers of the pelvis or lower extremity. Patients were of a general population and had stage I -IV pressure ulcers . Studies were 2 -12 weeks in duration. All five studies evaluated change in wound surface area or ulcer size while two studies also measured complete healing and time to complete healing. 208,209 We found low -strength evid ence of a reduction in wound surface area in pressure ulcers receiving light therapy but no evidence of benefit in complete wound healing. Three trials (n=262) and one observational study (n=55) found a significant difference in reduction in ulcer size 208-210,212 while one trial ( n=164) found no significant difference. Both studies that measured complete healing of patients with stage II -IV ulcers (n=327) found no significant difference between those receiving light therapy compared with sham light therapy (44 percent vs. 40 percent 208 and 54 percent vs. 60 percent209). Similarly, no significant difference was found in time to complete healing in either study (see T able 29) . 106 Table 29.

Non -NPUAP staging was converted to the equivalent NPUAP stage where possible. ++Complete wound healing. +Some improvement in wound healing. ~No difference. Laser Therapy We found one randomized trial comparing laser therapy with another adjunctive therapy for the treatment of pressure ulcers199 and three randomized trials comparing laser therapy with standard wound care, to standard wound care alone, or sham laser therapy (Table 30).213-215 Trials included 16- 86 patients, lasted 5- 16 weeks, and used different treatment regimens. Two studies enrolled an elderly population with stage III ulcers213,214 and two enrolled a younger population with spinal cord injuries and stage II -IV pressure ulcers.199,215 We found low -strength evidence that laser therapy did not produce wound improvement . The fair-quality r andomized study comparing the combination of ultrasound and UVC light with laser therapy or standardized wound care enrolled 20 patients and found faster healing in the US/UVC group (4 weeks) compared with standard therapy (7 weeks) or laser treatment (11 weeks). The mean percentage change per week in wound surface area was 54 percent with US/UVC, 32 percent with standard care, and 24 percent with laser treatment. 199 Although a trend toward benefit with ultrasound, at 12 weeks, no significant difference in complete wound healing was found between US/UV therapy and laser therapy (RR=1.44, 95% CI , 0.85 to 2.64). 216 Two studies (n=102) found no significant difference in reduction in wound size between treatment groups.213,214 Two studies (n=124/nPU=143) found no significant difference in complete wound healing.214,215 One study found no significant difference in time to complete healing.215 Our findings are consistent with those of a prior systematic review that found no improvement in wound healing with the us e of laser th erapy to treat pressure ulcers.217 108 Table 30.

Non-NPUAP staging was converted to the equivalent NPUAP stage where possible. ++Complete wound healing. +Some improvement in wound healing. ~No difference. Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy uses water with or without additives to cleanse the wo und and to promote healing. It is frequently provided in the form of whirlpool therapy whereby the body or body part is immersed in the pool avoiding direct contact of the jet stream on the wound so as not to disturb granulation tissue. Pu lsatile lavage is a form of hydrotherapy in which a gentle stream of normal saline is applied to the wound directly. The treatment uses a device with a disposable tip for each treatment to minimize risk of contamination. We found evidence on hydrotherapy f rom two fair- quality t rials, one on whirlpool therapy 218 and one on pulsatile lavage .219 Both studies enrolled patients with stage III -IV pressure ulcers . The whirlpool study was set at an acute care facility and enrolling a general population and the pulsatile lavage study set at a rehabilitation center and enrolling men with spinal cord injuries. Only the pulsatile lavage study was able to compare to a sham treatment and both studies considered change in wound size over time as the outcome of interest. Th e hydrotherapy group from both studies showed a trend toward greater wound improvement over time (whir lpool 58.33 109 vs. 27.78 volume with pulsatile lavage vs . sham) however none reported on complete wound healing. Giv en the paucity of evidence and the heterogeneity of the available studies, the evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions of the effectiveness of hydrotherapy on the treatment of pressure ulcers. Other Adjunctive Therapies Evidence was limited to a s ingle study on vibration therapy therapy ,220,221 extracorporeal shock wave therapy,222 and hyperbaric oxygen.223 Due to study quality, size, and duration, evidence was insufficient to report on comparative effectiveness of these treatments. We elected to perform an additional search specifically on hyperbaric oxygen at the recommendation of our technical expert panel given that this has been an adjunctive therapy commonly used in the treatment of wounds. Our search revealed no additional studies that met our inclusion criteria. The single study on hyperbaric oxygen from our original search was designed to determine i f a synergistic effect occurred with electrical stimulation by comparing hyperbaric oxygen alone with the combination of hyperbaric oxygen and electrical stimulation on the healing rates of stage III or IV pressure ulcers. 223 Subjects were assigned to receive either hyperbaric oxygen alone twice daily or hyperbaric oxygen twice daily and electrical stimulation five days per week. All wounds diminished in size over time, with no significant difference between the two groups. Evidence About the Comparative E ffectiveness of Adjunctive Therapies by Subgroups According to Pressure Ulcer Characteristics (Key Question 1a), Patient Characteristics (Key Question 1b), or Setting (Key Question 1c) Electrical Stimulation Most studies of electrical stimulation enrolled patients with pelvic and lower extremity pressure ulcers and did not perform subgroup analysis to determine if a difference existed in treatment effectiveness based on anatomic site. Comparison of the results of electrical stimulation studies by ulcer stag e (II, III, and IV) and by patients enrolled did not provide evidence of differential effectiveness by ulcer stage. 177-180,183,184 Most studies enrolled a general population and did not perform subgroup analysis to allow comparison of treatment effectiven ess based on unique patient characteristics. Four trials enrolled only patients with spinal cord injuries and the results were consistent with the overall body of evidence. 177,178,181,183 We found similar results in studies that enrolled a younger populati on (mean age 51 years)177,180,181,183 compared with an older population (mean age >51 years).178,179,182,184,185 Most studies were conducted in a hospital or rehabilitation center,178,179,183,185 with one study conducted in a home care setting177 and the others in a combination of settings181,182 or not reported.180,184 Findings did not differ based on setting. See Table 30. Electromagnetic Therapy One trial of EMT (n=30) randomized patients based on baseline stage of ulcer (II or III) to receive either EMT or sham. There was no significant difference in outcomes between the groups, based on baseline ulcer stage. 192 The two trials of EMT enrolled different patient populations in different settings, but both had similar findings of no significant effect of EMT.190,192 110 Therapeutic Ultrasound The two randomized trials comparing ultrasound with sham therapy included a mixed population of hospitalized and nursing facility patients of varying stages of pressure ulcers without subgroup analysis to determine if a difference exists based on features of the pressure ulcer, patient, or care setting.196,197 Negative Pressure Wound Therapy There was a lack of studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness of NPWT according to features of the pressure ulcers or characteristics of the patient resulting in insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions . One retrospective cohort study reported on the effectiveness of patients being treated with NPWT compared with standard wound care in the home care setting.224 The Outcom e Concepts System was used to identify patients being treated at home for pressure ulcers and the study considered the outcomes of acute care hospitalization and emergent care rates between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004. Patient characteristics we re similar in both groups. Sixty patients were treated with NPWT while 2,288 patients were treated with standard wound care. 224 Of this small group treated with NPWT, a significantly lower percentage of NPWT patients were hospitalized (35 percent vs. 48 pe rcent, p<0.05), fewer required emergent care services (0 percent vs. 8 percent, p<0.01), and fewer required hospitalization for a wound-related problem (5 percent vs. 14 percent, p<0.01). 224 No other study evaluated the outcomes of hospitalization or emerg ent care needs. Given the small sample size in the NPWT group and given that outcomes of wound healing were not assessed, there was insufficient evidence that NPWT in the home setting provided significant benefit. Light Therapy Few studies performed subgroup analysis to determine if treatment strategies differed according to features of the pressure ulcers, patient characteristics, or patient care settings. Two studies performed subgroup analysis to determine if differences in outcomes existed based on body mass index. 208,209 One study of patients with stage III -IV NPUAP ulcers found a larger reduction in ulcer size for patients with a body mass index <20 (3.3 cm2 vs. 2.5 cm2, p<0.01)208 but a subsequent study of stage III NPUAP ulcers found no signifi cant difference in this subgroup.209 Laser Therapy No studies performed subgroup analysis to determine if treatment strategies differed according to features of the pressure ulcers, patient characteristics, or patient care settings. Two studies (n=51/nPU=80) enrolled younger patients with spinal cord injuries and found no evidence of benefit in complete wound healing . This was consistent with the overall body of evidence that included a mixed population. 199,215 Adjunctive Therapies: Harms (Key Question 2) We found 14 trials and two observational studies evaluating the harms of adjunctive therapies (electrical stimulation [three studies], electromagnetic studies], and laser therapy [three studies]). We found no direct evidence comparing one intervention to another and reporting on comparative harms. Indirect evidence of comparative harms was difficult to derive due to variability in study population, study des ign, outcomes measured, and sample size. 111 Electrical Stimulation Three studies reported on harms associated with the use of direct electrical current in the treatment of pressure ulcers compared with sham electrical stimulation.177,179,182 Overall withdraw al was high in the Adunsky study , which enrolled hospitalized frail elders with stage III pressure ulcers in Israel (overall withdrawal 25/63, 40 percent). Fifteen patients withdrew due to adverse events, (11 of 15 [ 73 percent ] in the treatment group ), mos tly due to clinical (8/15) or ulcer deterioration (4/15). In two other studies, however, withdrawal occurred in only one spinal cord injured patient . 177,182 The most commonly reported adverse event was skin irritation. Adunsky reported two cases of excessi ve granulation (5.2 percent) and two cases of a local irritation when the current was combined with topical sulphadiazine ointment on the wound, believed to be due to the effect of electrical stimulation on the silver ions in the ointment. 179 Electromagnet ic Therapy One small randomized study (n=30) reported no adverse effects.192 Therapeutic Ultrasound Three studies reported on overall withdrawal, which ranged from 12.5 percent to 32.5 percent, mostly due to death or discharge from the care setting and not related to the intervention. 196,198,199 One study reported that 2 of 45 patients in the ultrasound group (4.4 percent) complained of pain associated with ultrasound but no other adverse events were reported. 198 Negative Pressure Wound Therapy No controlled studies comparing NPWT to standard care reported on harms. One intervention series of 17 patients with sacral ulcers, stage unknown, reported an overall withdrawal of eight (47 percent), three (18 percent) due to death not attributed to the inte rvention and five (29 percent) due to need for surgery due to incomplete healing. One retrospective cohort study compared patients being treated with NPWT with patients being treated with standard wound care in the home care setting 224 and reported on emer gent care or hospitalization for wound infection, deteriorating wound status, or new lesion/ulcer.224 Compared with patients receiving standard care, a significantly lower percentage of NPWT patients were hospitalized for wound related ent] vs. 310/2288 [14 percent], [0 percent] vs. 189/2288 [8 percent], p<0.01). 224 Of note, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reclassified nonpowered devices intended for NPWT as a class II (special controls) device to ensure safety and effectiveness in administration due to reported risk of infection and bleeding. No harms were reported in the one study evaluated on NPWT in the pressure ulcer population. 225 Light Therapy Four studies reported on overall withdrawal from studies of light therapy, ranging from 17 to 19 percent, with none believed to be directly related to the treatment.208-210,212 Two studies specifically evaluated adverse events,208,209 with similar number of events occurri ng in both the light therapy and the sham light therapy groups, and considered unrelated to the treatment. The most common reported adverse event was tingling or pain in or around the wound (n=12 of 327 patients, 3.7 percent). One patient had bleeding in t he wound and one patient reported redness. 208 112 Laser Therapy Four studies compared laser therapy with either standard care or sham laser therapy in the treatment of stage II -IV pressure ulcers.199,213 -215 No treatment -related adverse events were reported i n three studies199,213,214 and one study reported excessive granulation tissue in one of 64 ulcers, the only treatment -related adverse event that was observed.215 One study evaluated the progression to stage IV ulcers in patients with stage III ulcers and found that during the 6- week study, no significant differences existed between groups in the development of stage IV ulcers (5/44 [11 percent] vs. 337 [8 percent], p=0.72).214 Evidence A bout the Harms Rela ted to Adjunctive Therapies by Subgroups According to Pressure Ulcer Characteristics (Key Question 2a), Patient Characteristics (Key Question 2b), or Setting (Key Question 2c) There was insufficient evidence due to a lack of reporting to determine if differences in harms of any adjunctive therapies exist based on features of the pressure ulcers. One study of electrical stimulation enrolled hospitalized frail elders with stage III pressure ulcers in Israel and had a high rate of overall withdrawal (25/63, 40 percent) and a high rate of withdrawal due to adverse events (15/63, 24 percent). 179 The two other studies reporting on harms associated with electrical stimulation enrolled younger patients, many of whom had spinal cord injuries, and found a very low overall withdrawal or withdrawal due to adverse events. 177,182 This difference may be due to the patient age and comorbid features. However, there may have been other differences in treatment delivery, patient populations, or harms assessment that accounted for the observed differences across studies. Ther e was insufficient evidence to determine if differences existed in harms of any adjunctive therapies based on patient care settings. 113 Discussion Treatment for pressure ulcers involves a variety of different modalities intended to: alleviate the conditions contributing to ulcer development (support surfaces, repositioning, nutritional support); protect the wound from contamination, create a clean wound environment, promote tissue healing (local wound applications, debridement, wound cleansing, and a variet y of adjunctive therapies); and surgically repair the wound. We evaluated evidence addressing the comparative effectiveness and harms in treatment categories where significant uncertainty exists about the best therapeutic options: support surfaces, nutriti onal supplements, local wound applications (dressings, topical therapies, and biological agents), surgical interventions, and adjunctive therapies. We also attempted to discern whether the balance of benefits and harms for different treatment options varie d according to characteristics of the pressure ulcer, the patient, or the setting in which care was being delivered. Key Findings and Strength of Evidence We identified evidence addressing a variety of different support surfaces, including air - fluidized (AF) beds, alternating pressure (AP) beds and chair cushions, and low -air-loss (LAL) beds. Other types of support surfaces were evaluated only in small, single studies. We found evidence of moderate strength that wound improvement was better on AF beds from studies that compared AF beds to other support surfaces, including standard hospital beds. Studies found no difference in wound improvement when different types of AP mattresses were compared . (moderate strength of evidence. Evidence about the effectiven ess of AP seat cushions was insufficient as only two studies with very different population were identified.) There was low - strength evidence that AP beds or LAL beds led to similar wound improvement when compared to other surfaces, usually standard mattre sses. The reported harms of different support surface options were minimal, though harms were infrequently and inconsistently reported in support surface studies. Studies of nutritional support evaluated protein- containing nutritional supplementation and specific nutrient supplementation with vitamins or minerals, such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or zinc. Studies provided moderate strength of evidence that protein supplementation results in wound improvement. There was low strength of evidence indicating similar results with vitamin C compared to placebo. Evidence about zinc supplementation was insufficient to draw conclusions. There was insufficient evidence to adequately describe the harms of nutritional supplementation in this patient population. A wid e variety of modern wound dressings have been compared with each other or to standard care, usually with gauze dressings. We found low -strength evidence that hydrocolloid dressings are superior to gauze and moderate -strength evidence that hydrocolloid and foam (hydrocellular or polyurethane) dressings produced similar wound improvement. Evidence about the comparative effectiveness of other dressings - hydrogels, transparent films, silicone, and alginates - was insufficient to draw conclusions. We found mode rate-strength evidence from four studies that radiant heat dressings accelerated the rate of healing compared with other dressings, of stage III and IV ulcers but we did not find evidence of a benefit of radiant heat dressings in terms of complete wound he aling. The most commonly evaluated topical therapies were debriding enzymes (primarily collagenase), phenytoin solution, dextranomer paste, and collagen applications . There was low - strength evidence that dextranomer is less effective than wound dressings. Evidence about 114 enzymes and phenytoin was inconsistent, and insufficient to draw conclusions. Collagen applications did not appear to produce wound improvement compared with standard care, based on low -strength evidence. The most commonly evaluated biolog ical agent was platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF), for which there was low -strength evidence of benefit compared with placebo in promoting wound improvement in severe (stage III or IV) ulcers. There was insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of o ther biological agents. There was moderate- strength evidence that the most common harms of wound dressings and topical agents were dermatologic complications, including irritation, inflammation, and maceration. However, variability across studies preclude d an estimate of adverse events for specific dressings or topical therapies, and evidence was insufficient to determine whether certain types of dressings or topical therapies were more likely to cause these complications than others. Few harms were report ed with biological agents, but the evidence about the harms of these agents was insufficient to reach conclusions about adverse event rates. Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions about the effectiveness or harms of local wound applications across d ifferent ulcer or patient characteristics, or settings. Surgical interventions for pressure ulcers identified in studies meeting our inclusion criteria were primarily surgical flaps, most commonly myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Studies of surgica l interventions were nearly all observational, and most were conducted in single centers. There was insufficient evidence that one approach to closure of stage III to IV pressure ulcers is superior to others due to heterogeneity in patient populations and surgical procedures. There was low strength of evidence that sacral ulcers had a lower rate of ulcer recurrence when compared with ischial ulcers; that a higher rate of recurrent ulcers was found among patients with spinal cord injury compared with others; that a greater wound dehiscence rates occurs with surgeries in which bone is removed as part of the operation; and that more adverse events occur with surgery for ischial compared with sacral or trochanteric ulcers. Surgical flap failures requiring reoper ation ranged from 12 to 24 percent. Adjunctive therapies identified in our review included electrical stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, ultrasound, negative pressure wound therapy, hydrotherapy, light therapy, and laser therapy. Evidence about other a djunctive therapies \u2014including vibration, shock wave, and hyperbaric oxygen\u2014was limited to small, single studies. There was moderate -strength evidence that electrical stimulation improved healing rates, but insufficient evidence about the effect of electric al stimulation on complete wound healing due to heterogeneous findings across studies. Low-strength evidence indicated that the most common adverse effect of electrical stimulation was local skin irritation; and that harms were more common in frail elderly compared with younger populations. There was also low -strength evidence indicating that electromagnetic therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and negative pressure wound therapy were similar to sham treatment or standard care in wound improvement ; there was in sufficient evidence to evaluate the harms of those adjunctive therapies due to a lack of reporting of harms . Light therapy provided benefit in terms of wound area reduction but not in terms of complete wound healing, and was not associated with significant adverse events, based on low -strength evidence. There was low -strength evidence that laser therapy was not associated with significant adverse events, but also that it did not provide wound improvement over sham or standard treatment. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about hydrotherapy due to the paucity of studies. 115 Findings in Relationship to What Is Already Known Treatments for Pressure Ulcers have been described and evaluated with varying degrees of rigor in the past (e.g., Lyder, 20034) A recent systematic review by Reddy, and colleagues , published in December 2008, evaluated 103 randomized trials published during or prior to August 2008.10 The review included studies evaluating support surfaces, nutritional supplements, wound dressings, biological agents, and adjunctive therapies. Our review included evaluations of those treatment categories and additionally evaluated surgical interventions. We included observational studies of pressure ulcer treatments, included assessment s of treatment harms, and expanded the search to include studies published through June 2012. and assessed treatment harms, in studies published through June 2012. Our review also included observational studies in addition to clinical trials, in an effort to more comprehensively review the relevant literature. The findings of this prior systematic review were qualitatively similar to ours, with a few exceptions. In the support surface category, Reddy and colleagues reported that AP surfaces and low-air-loss beds were not superior to standard, nonpowered surfaces, which is similar to our findings. 10 They did not, however, report specifically on AF beds, as only one of the five studies of AF beds we included in our review were retrieved in their literatur e search. Our finding that there was moderate -strength evidence that AF beds were more effective than other surfaces in achieving wound area reduction is based on the finding from these additional studies. Additional systematic reviews on the use of suppor t surfaces have been published by the Cochrane Collaboration. A recent report 48 update d earlier versions226-228 and separated out treatment from prevention. This review summarized 18 trials (observational studies were not included). This review, like ours, found some limited evidence that AF beds lead to reductions in pressure ulcer size, and no significant effect of LAL beds on healing. Unlike our review, this review reported some benefit from the use of sheepskins, but this is based on a study that was ex cluded from our review because it was published in 1964. Finally, the authors of this review found, as we did, that the evidence base was weak, with studies that were small, had serious methodological limitations , and often did not report key elements suc h as variance data, p -values, and the characteristics of the surfaces used as the comparator s. Reddy and colleagues reported that overall, nutritional supplements did not provide benefit in terms of ulcer healing, but that protein supplementation may provi de wound healing benefit. 10 Our findings were similar; we found moderate -strength evidence that protein supplementation accelerates wound healing, but studies did not provide evidence of an effect on complete wound healing. The Cochrane Collaboration publi shed a 2008 systematic review on nutritional interventions to treat and prevent pressure ulcers but the authors were unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of nutritional interventions in the treatment of pressure ulcers due to the small number and poor qua lity of the available studies. 229 We found to wound dressings and topical therapies, indicating that there was limited evidence to support the use of certain dressings and topical therapies over others, in terms of wound improvement , were similar to the conclusions drawn by Reddy, et al. 10 Our finding that hydrocolloid dressings are likely to be superior to gauze in promoting wound improvement was similar to the conclusion in two othe r systematic reviews. A review by Chaby , et al. also found equivalence between hydrocolloid and foam dressings in promoting wound improvement , a finding supported by our meta -analysis of 8 studies comparing those dressing types. Both Reddy , et al. and Chab y, et al. highlighted a study demonstrating the superiority of alginate dressings to dextranomer paste; we also found dextranomer paste to be inferior to dressing but considered the 116 evidence for this to be low -strength.10 We did find moderate -strength evid ence that radiant heat dressings accelerated the rate of wound area reduction, but we did not find evidence of a benefit of radiant heat dressings in terms of complete wound healing. Similar to Reddy, et al., we found a potential benefit, based on low -strength evidence, for platelet -derived growth factor in promoting wound improvement with stage III and IV ulcers. 10 We found evidence to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of eight adjunctive therapies used in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Of these, n one demonstrated consistent effectiveness in complete wound healing. Electrical stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, and light therapy did show a tendency for wound improvement while the other adjunctive therapies showed no evidence of effectiveness. Our findings are consistent with the findings of two prior systematic reviews of electrical stimulation for pressure ulcers,10,187 two systematic re views of therapeutic ultrasound,10,201 one prior systematic review of negative pressure wound therapy ,10 and two systematic reviews of laser therapy .10,217 Our findings of no significant difference in wound improvement with electromagnetic therapy (EMT ) are consistent with those of a prior Cochrane review .161 Although a trend toward improvement in rate of he aling with EMT has been observed, consistent with prior systematic reviews,10,189 we found that the clinical significance of this trend remains unknown. Applicability The applicability of our findings to real -world clinical settings is supported by several features of the body of literature we reviewed. First, the populations studied included a broad representation of patients with pressure ulcers \u2014elderly patients, general populations of patients with limited mobility, patients with spinal cord injury \u2014cared for in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, wound care clinics, and at home. Second, the interventions represented most of the therapeutic modalities commonly used in clinical settings. Comparators were also commonly used therapies and often included standard care as defined by local practice patterns. In some studies this included use of comparators that may not be considered best practices, such as standard hospital beds and plain gauze dressings. However , as these treatment strategies remain in use in m any settings, both in the United States and other countries, we retained these studies in our review. Other features of the studies we identified, however, limit the applicability of our findings. First, the outcome in many stud ies was wound size (area, volume, or depth) reduction, as opposed to complete wound healing. Although wound size reduction is a reasonable measure of therapeutic effect, in clinical practice the goal of therapy is almost always complete wound healing, maki ng wound size reduction a surrogate outcome with less clinical significance than complete wound healing. A principal reason for findings of wound size reduction without complete wound healing was the short duration of most trials. Complete healing takes ti me. Interventions lasting only a few weeks (as was the case for most of the trials included in our review) are less likely to achieve complete wound healing than interventions carried out for periods long enough for complete healing to occur, as they would be in clinical practice. A second reason that applicability is limited is that the treatment of pressure ulcers in clinical practice often involves multiple concurrent therapies, such as support surfaces, nutritional supplementation, biological or topical therapies, and adjunctive interventions. No studies compared one combination of concurrent or sequential therapies with another, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of one compared with another. 117 A second issue affecting applicability is that treatment of pressure ulcers is typically multimodal and often involves the sequential use of different therapies. In practice, the relevant question is often not \"which therapy works best\" but rather \"which combination of therapies works best\" and \"when is a specific treatment indicated.\" Most comparative studies of pressure ulcer treatments examined head -to-head comparisons of single treatment modalities. Although contextual data and cointerventions were sometimes rep orted, integrating those data to answer questions about treatment combinations and timing was difficult. Studies of surgery are additionally limited by the fact that most were observational and conducted in one or, at most, a few centers. Because surgical technique and quality is often operator - and/or site -dependent, and because outcomes are influenced by local practices, staffing, and other features of the environment, it is difficult to generalize the findings of studies of surgery included in this revi ew. Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking The limitations in applicability discussed above, as well as the limitations of the evidence base discussed below, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions with implications for clinical and polic y decisionmaking. Notably, we generated no findings that were supported by high strength of evidence, and only a few findings supported by moderate -strength evidence. Most findings were based on low -strength evidence, and for many issues there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions. Findings supported by moderate strength of evidence deserve consideration but must be examined critically. For example, the finding that AF beds promote wound improvement compared with other surfaces might warrant co nsideration of this technology. However, it is important to point out that although the five studies of these beds had consistent findings, they are somewhat dated and most compared AF beds to standard beds, rather than to other specialized options. Decisi ons about investments in support surfaces would benefit from head- to- head trials of current technologies that measured effectiveness in terms of complete wound healing, not only reduction in wound size. Nutritional supplementation may provide benefit in terms of wound improvement , though the effects of nutritional supplementation were not dramatic, and it was not clear from the studies in our review whether nutritional supplementation was beneficial to all patients or to those with evidence of nutritional d eficiencies. Nutritional support is commonly prescribed for ill or debilitated patients with evidence of malnutrition; whether this affects ulcer healing, and whether patients without evidence of malnutrition might benefit from nutritional supplementation, is not clear. Decisions about dressings and topical applications are often guided by matching the primary functions of different dressings (e.g., absorbent, hydrating) with the primary considerations for treatment of individual ulcers (e.g., dryness, contamination risk, exudate). Given the wide array of options, comparative effectiveness and harms data have great potential to guide individualized decisionmaking. We found limited evidence, however, to provide such guidance. Overall, we did not find substantial evidence to support certain local wound applications over others. There was evidence to suggest that radiant heat improved the pace of wound healing, but not complete wound healing per se. Some biological agents showed promise for the treatment of severe ulcers, but the evidence was not substantial, and in light of the cost of these agents, more and better evidence is likely needed before they are widely adopted. Surgery is typically reserved for refractory ulcers unlikely to heal with conservative management. Evidence about surgery is limited to mainly single -center observational studies. 118 While we found some evidence to inform decisions and expectations about which ulcers will fare best with surgical intervention, and which surgeries are likely to produce the lowest complication rates, the influence of those findings on clinical decisionmaking should be tempered by the low quality of the studies that produced the findings, and the potentially limited generalizability of the findings across sites and sur geons. Adjunctive therapies include therapies that are variably used in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Our review revealed moderate -strength evidence that electrical stimulation may accelerate healing but did not otherwise produce findings that would s upport greater use of adjunctive therapies for the goal of wound healing. Limitations of the Comparative Effectiveness Review Process The most important potential limitation of our review is that important studies whose findings might influence clinical a nd policy decisionmaking may not have been identified. W e conducted a comprehensive, broadly inclusive search that produced 7,274 study titles and abstracts. Although we excluded studies published before 1985, we do not believe that important studies of therapies used in current practice were missed; the general consistency of our findings with those of other systematic review s, which included studies published prior to 1985, provides some assurance that our review was not biased by our time frame selection . Although we did not include foreign- language studies, we identified these studies and, based on review of their abstracts, found that none would have altered our conclusions. Our review focused on clinical outcomes of pressure ulcer treatments, particula rly wound improvement . Other outcomes, such as ease of use and nursing/staff time, might also influence treatment decisions but were beyond the scope of our review. Finally, we excluded studies of the treatment of non pressure ulcers. To the extent that evi dence for interventions studied in other types of wounds, including venous ulcers, is applicable to the treatment of pressure ulcers, our review may have underestimated the quantity and quality of the body of evidence for these interventions . There may have been biased reporting of results in the literature such that only selected studies were published and retrievable, and that published studies may have been affected by conflicts of interest. Reporting bias and conflicts of interest are concerns with a ny systematic review. We were not able to conduct quantitative analyses to evaluate the possibility of reporting bias for most of our findings, because the heterogeneity across studies in our review, and in many cases the lack of key information needed to perform quantitative syntheses, generally precluded meaningful comparison of effect sizes. Mitigating against the likelihood of reporting bias in our review, however, is the fact that the majority of studies in our review were small (most fewer than 100 pa tients, many fewer than 50), and most reported no significant effect of the intervention. Reporting bias typically results in selective publication of larger studies and/or those with positive findings, and studies biased by conflict of interests would als o be more likely to report positive findings. We also conducted gray literature searches to look for unpublished data and did not find evidence of unreported studies. We took several measures to guard against the influence of bias in our identification and evaluation of studies. Abstracts were reviewed by at least two team members, including a clinician/senior investigator. Studies were extracted based on prespecified data elements, extraction done by one team member was checked by another, and quality rati ng of studies performed by two team members and disagreements adjudicated by consensus. Rating of elements of strength of evidence was discussed and calibrated among team members. 119 Limitations of the Evidence Base The main limitation of the evidence base in our review was poor study quality. Most trials did not specify randomization method, did not conceal allocation, even when this might be possible, and did not mask outcomes assessment. Most studies did use intention- to-treat analyses. Most studies were small, and many were underpowered to detect significant differences. Studies were also highly variable in terms of patient populations, ulcer characteristics (e.g., anatomic site, duration, stage), interventions (even within a given intervention category, e.g., different types of foam dressings), and comparators (especially variability in implementation of standard, or usual, care), limiting our ability to combine or compare results across studies. Another major limitation of the evidence base relates to t he most common outcome measure, wound size reduction. Comparing changes in the size of pressure ulcers poses several measurement issues. For example, reduction in the size of larger and smaller pressure ulcers is hard to compare. Healing could involve \"bri dges\" that split a large ulcer into two. Measurement in person or from tracings or photographs can be difficult, especially when measurement and photographic techniques are not standardized across studies. Studies rarely described whether interventions we re carried out as planned and in a manner conducive to maximizing potential effectiveness. Lack of documentation of treatment fidelity limited our ability to determine whether findings indicated lack of treatment effectiveness or problems with treatment implementation. Finally, a major limitation of studies in our review was the duration of interventions and followup periods , typically a few weeks . Many pressure ulcers, especially more severe ulcers, may take months, or even years to heal. Many of the studies in our review were implemented over a period that did not necessarily allow for complete ulcer healing and therefore detection of significant differences in ulcer healing across groups. One strength in this body of literature was that most studies did use intention- to-treat analyses. Research Gaps The major gaps in research identified by our review relate to the limitations of the evidence base as described above. Future studies with larger sample sizes, more rigorous adherence to methodological standar ds for clinical trials or observational studies, longer followup periods, standardization of comparators, and more standardized and clinically meaningful outcome measures (including more patient -centered outcomes such as quality of life and pain) are needed to inform clinical practice and policy. Inclusion of information about co interventions, and the timing of studied interventions in relation to other interventions, would improve the applicability of study findings. Similarly, stratification of findings b y patient characteristics (e.g., comorbidities, ulcer stage) would help determine the applicability of different interventions for specific patients and situations. It is particularly important for future studies to report findings according to ulcer stage, as the rate of healing, conditions necessary to promote healing, and therefore treatment choices may differ for partial and full thickness ulcers. Decisions about defining other aspects of patient populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, study timing and duration, and study settings should be guided by clinical practice, expertise, and factors most relevant to decision makers, including patients, clinicians, and policymakers. For several interventions, there was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions due to small sample sizes or mixed results across studies. These interventions included AP beds compared 120 with other surfaces, topical debriding enzymes, phenytoin, and growth factors. Future studies could clarify the comparative effectiveness of these interventions and identify possible reasons for disparate results. For other interventions, findings indicated a possible benefit, but the strength of evidence was low due to study quality, duration, sample size, and measured outcomes (wound size re duction rather than complete wound healing). These interventions include platelet - derived growth factor and light therapy. Future studies are needed to confirm or refute the effectiveness of these interventions. As mentioned, further study is warranted comparing AF beds with more modern support surfaces and evaluating comparative effectiveness in terms of complete wound healing. Similarly, in light of findings suggesting a benefit for radiant heat dressings and electrical stimulation in terms of wound healing rate, further study should compare these technologies with other treatments, with sufficient followup to evaluate complete wound healing. There was limited evidence to support the use of nutritional supplements as a component of pressure ulcer care, but few studies examine d whether supplementation might have a differential effect for patients with and without baseline nutritional deficiencies. Future studies could address this issue. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is one clinical area that our TEP identified as high priority but for which we found limited evidence. Although studies and systematic reviews have evaluated this treatment in chronic wounds generally, its utility among patients with pressure ulcers specifically has undergone limited evaluation. Conclusions Choices of t reatments for pressure ulcer are often guided by product availability, local practice patterns, and individualized decisionmaking based on specific patients and the features of a given pressure ulcer. Our review did not generate many findings to guide thos e choices based on evidence. We found limited evidence to draw firm conclusions about the best approaches for treating pressure ulcers. This finding is consistent with that of a prior systematic review addressing most of the same treatment categories incl uded in our review. 10 We found evidence from five studies indicating greater wound improvement with AF beds over other support surfaces, from four studies indicating a benefit of radiant heat dressings over other dressings, and from nine studies indicating a benefit of electrical stimulation. However, the benefit observed in all cases was wound size reduction or better healing rates, rather than completely healed wounds, and evidence for the benefit of support surfaces in promoting wound improvement was bas ed primarily on comparisons of AF beds with hospital beds that may not be considered the standard of care in the field. The balance of costs and potential harms of those technologies against the benefits observed is unclear. Studies generally did not provide evidence to support the use of one type of commonly used wound dressing over another. There was evidence that hydrocolloid and foam dressings performed similarly, but evidence for other dressing types - hydrogels, alginates, transparent films, and silicone dressings - compared with each other or with standard gauze dressings was limited. Similarly, there was low -strength or insufficient evidence to judge the balance of effectiveness and harms for nutritional supplementation, topical therapies, biologica l agents, surgical interventions, and adjunctive therapies other than electrical stimulation . Advancing pressure ulcer care will require more rigorous study to solidify the evidence base for this widely used set of treatments. 121 Results are summarized belo w in Table 31. Table 31. Summary of evidence: Pressure ulcer treatment strategies - Iimpact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 1.

Alternating pressure beds Moderate Complete wound healing and reduction in ulcer size were similar across different brands and types of alternating pressure beds ( 4 studies). Alternating pressure beds compared with other surfaces Low Wound improvement was similar for alternating pressure beds when compared with air, fluid , or standard beds ( 4 studies). Alternating pressure chair cushions Insufficient Evidence about alternating pressure chair cushions did not permit conclusions due to differences in the patient populations studied ( 2 studies). Low-air-loss beds Low Wound improvement was similar for low -air-loss beds compared with foam surfaces ( 4 studies) and for low -air-loss beds compared with low -air-loss bed overlays ( 1 study). Nutrition Protein -containing nutritional supplements Moderate When used in addition to other measures for treating pressure ulcers, protein-containing nutritional supplementation resulted in wound improvement ( 12 studies). Vitamin C Low Vitamin C used as a single nutritional supplement d id not result in wound improvement ( 1 study). Zinc Insufficient The evidence did not allow conclusions as to whether zinc supplementation improves pressure ulcer healing ( 1 study). Local Wound Applications Hydrocolloid dressings compared with conventional care Low Wound improvement was superior with hydrocolloid compared with gauze dressings ( 10 studies). Hydrocolloid compared with foam Moderate Wound improvement was equivalent with hydrocolloid and foam dressings (8 studies). Comparisons of different wound dressings Insufficient Evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of hydrogel (compared with standard care or other dressing types; 7 studies), transparent film ( 4 studies), silicone (2 studies), and alginate dressings (1 study) was inconclusive due to limitations in the number, size, and quality of studies. Radiant heat compared with other dressings (healing rate) Moderate Radiant heat dressings produced more rapid wound healing rates than other dressings for stage III and IV ulcers ( 4 studies). Radiant heat compared with other dressings (complete wound healing) Moderate Radiant heat dressings were similar to other dressings in terms of complete wound healing of stage III and IV ulcers ( 4 studies) . Debriding enzymes compared with dressings or other topical therapies Insufficient Evidence about the effectiveness of collagenase and other debriding enzymes was inconclusive due to differences in the enzymes studied and outcomes measured ( 5 studies). 122 Table 31. Summary of evidence: Pressure ulcer treatment strategies - Iimpact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 1. In adults with pressure ulcers, what is the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for improved health outcomes, including but not limited to: complete wound healing, healing time, reduced wound surface area, pain, and prevention of serious complications of in fection? (continued) Local Wound Applications Dextranomer paste compared with wound dressings Low Dextranomer paste was inferior to wound dressings (alginate, hydrogel) in promoting wound area reduction ( 2 studies). Topical collagen compared with hydrocolloid dressings or standard care Low Wound improvement was similar with topical collagen applications compared with hydrocolloid dressings or standard care ( 3 studies). Topical phenytoin Insufficient Three studies of the effectiveness of topical ph enytoin used different comparators and produced inconsistent results. Maggot therapy Insufficient Evidence about the effectiveness of maggot therapy was inconclusive due to poor study quality ( 3 studies). Platelet -derived growth factor Low Platelet -derived growth factor was superior to placebo in producing wound improvement in stage III and IV pressure ulcers ( 4 studies). Biological agents other than platelet -derived growth factor (fibroblast, nerve, and macrophage suspension) Insufficient Evidence about the effectiveness of other biological agents used for the treatment of pressure ulcers was inconclusive due to limitations in the number, size, and quality of studies ( 7 studies of various biological agents). Surgery Surgical techniques Insufficient Evidence was inconclusive as to whether one approach to closure of stage III to IV pressure ulcers wa s superior to others due to poor -quality studies and heterogeneity in patient populations and surgical procedures ( 4 studies). Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Moderate Electrical stimulation was beneficial in accelerating the rate of healing of stage II, III, and IV pressure ulcers ( 9 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Low Wound improvement of stage II, III, or IV pressure ulcers was similar with electromagnetic therapy compared with sham treatment ( 4 studies). Therapeutic ultrasound Low Wound improvement was similar with ultrasound compared with standard care or sham treat ment ( 3 studies). Negative pressure wound therapy Low Wound improvement was similar with negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care ( 3 studies). Hydrotherapy Insufficient Evidence on the effectiveness of hydrotherapy was insufficient based on 2 randomized trials evaluating different treatment modalities ( 1 of whirlpool therapy and 1 of pulsatile lavage). Light therapy (complete wound healing) Low Light therapy was similar to sham light therapy in producing complete wound healing based on 2 randomized trials. Light therapy (wound surface area reduction) Low Light therapy reduced wound surface area over time compared with standard care or sham light therapy ( 5 studies). Laser therapy Low Wound improvement was similar with laser therapy compared with sham treatment or standard care ( 4 studies). 123 Table 31.

Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to features of the pressure ulcers, such as anatomic site or severity at baseline? Support Support, all strategies Insufficient Only 4 studies reported results by ulcer stage or location, and the interventions, characteristics, and results varied and did not permit conclusions. Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient Only 3 of the 16 studies analyzed results by ulcer characteristics , and the impact on the conclusion was inconsistent. Local Wound Applications Local wound Applications, all strategies Insufficient Few studies conducted subgroup analyses by ulcer characteristics ( 7 studies). Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Surgery Sacral compared with ischial pressure ulcers Low Sacral pressure ulcers ha d lower recurrence rates after surgery than ischial pressure ulcers ( 4 studies). Adjunctive Adjunctive, all strategies Insufficient Evidence did not permit determination as to whether the effectiveness of adjunctive therapies varied based on pressure ulcer characteristics due to heterogeneity of studies (6 studies). Key Question 1b. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including but not limited to: age, race/ethnicity, body weight, specific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence? Support Support, all strategies Insufficient No studies were identified that allowed conclusions about the impact of patient characteristics on the effectiveness of different support surfaces in pressure ulcer wound improvement. Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heter ogeneity of studies. Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient Evidence did not permit determination as to whether patient characteristics, including baseline nutritional status, modified the effect of nutritional support on pressure ulcer healing due to a limited number of studies reporting outcomes by baseline nutritional status ( 2 studies). Local Wound Applications Local wound applications, all strategies Insufficient Studies generally did not report outcomes by patient characteristics, including incontinence and mobility ( 1 study). Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Surgery Surgical flap closure Low Spinal cord-injured patients had higher rates of recurrent pressure ulcer after surgical flap closure than other patients with pressure ulcers ( 1 study). 124 Table 31. Summary of evidence: Pressure ulcer treatment strategies - Iimpact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low The effectiveness of electrical stimulation was similar in spinal -cord-injured patients compared with others ( 4 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Therapeutic ultrasound Negative pressure wound therapy Light therapy Laser therapy Insufficient Evidence did not permit determination as to whether the effectiveness of electromagnetic therapy compared with sham electrom agnetic therapy ( 2 studies) , ultrasound therapy compared with sham ultrasound therapy , negative pressure wound therapy , light therapy , or laser therapy varied based on patient characteristics due to heterogeneity of studies and lack of reporting of specifi c patient characteristics. Key Question 1c. Does the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies differ according to patient care settings, such as home, nursing facility, or hospital, or according to features of patient care settings, including but not limited to nurse/patient staffing ratio, staff education and training in wound care, the use of wound care teams, and home caregiver support and training? Support Support, all strategies Insufficient Only 1 study provided data on results by setting and none provided information on setting characteristics.

Indirect comparisons of results across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies. Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low Electrical stimulation produced similar results in a hospital compared with a rehabilitation center ( 9 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Therapeutic ultrasound Negative pressure wound therapy Light therapy Laser therapy Insufficient Due to a lack of studies comparing different settings, evidence did not permit determination as to whether the effectiveness of electromagnetic therapy compared with sham electromagnetic therapy ( 2 studies) , ultrasound therapy compared with sham ultrasound therapy , negative pressure wound therapy , light therapy , or laser therapy varied based on features of the patient care settings. 125 Table 31. Summary of evidence: Pressure ulcer treatment strategies - Iimpact of pressure ulcer treatment strategies on wound improvement and harms (continued) Key Question and Treatment Strategy Strength of Evidence Conclusion Key Question 2. What are the harms of treatments for pressu re ulcers? Harms: Support Support, all strategies Insufficient Few of the identified studies (7 out of 24) explicitly addressed harms attributable to support surfaces. In those where harms were mentioned, most reported no significant differences in harms across the different support surfaces. However , as the harms studied were different and were associated with different support surfaces , we were unable to summarize across studies. Harms: Nutrition Nutrition, all strategies Insufficient Harms or adve rse events were reported in about half of the studies (8 of 16), but the studies reported different harms, did not describe the harm, or did not specify if it was related to treatment. Harms: Local Wound Applications Dressings and topical therapies Moderate Harms reported with dressings and topical therapies for pressure ulcers most commonly included skin irritation and inflammation and tissue damage and maceration. Variability in study populations, interventions, adverse event measurement, and repor ting precluded an estimate of adverse event rates for dressings and topical therapies ( 30 studies). Dressings and topical therapies Insufficient Evidence was inconclusive as to whether specific dressing types or topical therapies we re associated with fewer harms than others due to poor study quality and differential reporting of harms across studies ( 7 studies). Biological agents Insufficient Few harms were reported with biological agents, but evidence did not permit determination of the incidence of harms due to lack of precision across studies ( 5 studies). Harms: Surgery Recurrence or flap failure Low Reoperation due to recurrence or flap failure ranged from 12 to 24 percent ( 2 studies). Harms: Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low The most common adverse effect of electrical stimulation was local skin irritation (3 studies). Electromagnetic therapy Therapeutic ultrasound Negative pressure wound therapy Insufficient Due to a lack of reporting, evidence did not permit conclusions about the harms of electromagnetic therapy ( 1 study), ultrasound ( 3 studies), or negative pressure wound therapy ( 2 studies). Light therapy Low Light therapy caused no significant adverse events based on 4 randomized studies ( 4 studies). Laser therapy Low Short -term use of laser therapy caused no significant adverse events based on 3 randomized studies ( 4 studies in all). 126 Table 31.

Harms: Surgery Surgery, all strategies Low Wound dehiscence wa s more common if bone was removed at time of surgical procedure ( 1 study). Ischial ulcer surgery Low Complication rates after surgery we re higher for ischial ulcers than for sacral or trochanteric ulcers ( 2 studies). Harms: Adjunctive Adjunctive, all strategies Insufficient Due to a lack of reporting, t here was inconclusive evidence to determine if differences in harms of any adjunctive therapies varied based on features of the pressure ulcers ( 3 studies of electrical stimulation). Key Question 2b. Do the harms of treatment strategies differ according to patient characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, body weight, specific medical comorbidities, and known risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as functional ability, nutritional status, or incontinence?

Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to heterogeneity of studies . Harms: Surgery Surgery, all strategies Insufficient No studies reported harms by patient characteristics. Indirect comparisons of harms across studies were limited due to a lack of studies and reporting. Harms: Adjunctive Electrical stimulation Low Frail elderly patients experienced more adverse events with electrical stimulation compared with a younger population ( 3 studies). 127 Table 31.

Stages of pressure ulcer equivalency NPUAP Stage Description Yarkony - Kirk Description Shea Description DeLisa, Mikulic Description Torrance Description I Intact skin with non-blanchable redness of a localized area usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching; its color may differ from the surrounding area. I Red area: a. Present longer that 30 minutes, but less than 24 hours b. Present longer than 24 hours NA No Equivalent I Pressure sore is an acute inflammatory response involving the epidermis An irregular, ill- defined area if soft-tissue erythema accompanies by in duration and heat persists for more than 24 hours. The epidermis remains intact, and the ulcer is reversible. I Persistent erythema of the skin II Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum -filled blister II Epidermis and/or dermis ulcerated with subcutaneous fat observed I Limited to epidermis exposing dermis II Pressure sore is a break in or blistering of the epidermis surrounded by erythema and in duration. Potentially, it also is reversible. II Blister formation or superficial subcutaneous ulcer C-2 NPUAP Stage Description Yarkony - Kirk Description Shea Description DeLisa, Mikulic Description Torrance Description III Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscles are not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining and tunneling. III Subcutaneous fat observed, no muscle observed II, III Full-thickness of dermis to junction of subcutaneous fat Fat obliterated, limited by deep fascia undermining of skin III Pressure ulcer is an inflammatory fibroblastic response extending through the dermis to the junction with subcutaneous fat. Clinically presents as an irregular, shallow ulcer that has subcutaneous fat at its base and is surrounded by erythema, induration, and heat. III Deep subcutaneous ulcer the dermis C-3 NPUAP - Kirk Description Shea Description DeLisa, Mikulic Description Torrance Description IV Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often include undermining and tunneling. IV-V Muscle/ fascia observed, but no bone observed Bone observed, but no involvement of joint space IV Bone at the base of ulceration IV - muscle V - exposed bone Pressure ulcer extents through the full thickness of skin into the deep fascia and / or muscle. Its draining, necrotic base is often foul - smelling, and under -mining of the surface tissues may be excessive. Pressure ulcer penetrates the underlying bone, causing osteomyel itis. It has no anatomic limit and is surrounded by erythema and induration. Clinically, it presents as an extensive ulcer with exposed bone, joint, muscle, and/or fascia at its base. IV VI Involvement of joint space V Closed large cavity through a small sinus V C-4 NPUAP Stage Description Yarkony - Kirk Description Shea Description DeLisa, Mikulic Description Torrance Description Suspected Deep Tissue Injury Purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood - filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear. The area may be preceded by tissue found to be painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Unstageable Full thickness tissue loss in which the base of the ulcer is covered by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green, or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown, or black) in the wound bed. D-1 Appendix D.

Our ability to derive indirect evidence from compariso ns across studies was also limited due to variability in study population, design; outcomes measured, and sample size. As a result, some treatment intervention types (vibration therapy 185, hydrotherapy154, extracorporeal shock wave therapy 188, noncontact normothermic wound therapy 67, and hyperbaric oxygen 186), as well as some poor quality studies (electrical stimulation 189) have not been included in direct comparative effectiveness analyses or included in evidence tables, but have been evaluated for quality in Appendix H. Non - comparative studies used for eva luation of harms only were quality rated but not presented in the evidence tables due to the paucity of reportable data in th ese studies.
