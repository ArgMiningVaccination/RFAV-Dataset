This field of medicine is associated with alternative medicinal procedures based on natural remedies. However, there is still a lot of mystery around it. Therefore, our board-certified physician of Chinese Medicine in Melbourne, FL, has taken it upon herself to educate people about Traditional Chinese Medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in a nutshell TCM dates back to as far as 23 centuries ago! [Records](https://www.britannica.com/science/traditional-Chinese-medicine) show that acupuncture and Chinese herbal remedies were being used as long as 2,200 years ago. Although, the oldest written record of TCM is the Huangdi neijing from 3rd century BCE. Since then, the concepts and principles of TCM remain unchanged - it's about the restoration of balance within your mind and body. Whilst in the West people associate medicine with the treatment of disease and illness, TCM is about achieving health and well-being by obtaining harmony within our lives. Everyone has a vital energy \"Qi\", which needs to flow throughout the body's pathways called \"meridians\" in order to provide harmony \"yin and yang\". Chinese Medicine in Melbourne, FL provides treatments that re-balance the energy flow, resulting in pain relief, reduced inflammation, and overall well-being. Furthermore, TCM is based on the philosophy that everything, including our mind and body, is composed of the five elements: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. Therefore, herbs are classified into five groups (tastes) also - sweet, salty, bitter, pungent and sour, which correspond to the elements. The idea behind harmony - yin and yang, is to provide a balance, hence the specific tastes are prescribed depending on the affected area and its needs. Additionally, food is believed to either \"heat\" or \"cool\" your mind and body, thus it can disrupt your Qi. As a result, Chinese Herbal Medicine in Melbourne may be prescribed to you alongside a suggested change dietary change to allow greater success of your treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine revolves around 4 key principles: - The body is an integral whole. - We are completely connected to nature. - We were born with a self-healing ability. - Prevention is the best cure. What services constitute TCM? Acupuncture Acupuncture is a technique used to stimulate very specific points on the body \"acupoints\" by inserting extremely thin needles through the skin. Studies suggest that acupuncture effectively eases different types of pain, especially chronic pain, such as lower-back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritic pain. Acupuncture may even be a reasonable treatment option for reducing the frequency of tension and migraine headaches. The [NCCIH ](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction)states that acupuncture rarely results in any complications when conducted by an experienced specialist. So, by choosing our board-certified acupuncturist, Chisie Klinglesmith, you can rest assured that your treatment will be safe and effective. To learn more about how acupuncture can positively benefit you, take a look at our \" [Acupuncture for Pain Management](../acupuncture-melbourne/)\" page. Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) Since herbs are believed to correspond to the different elements of your mind and body, and an inappropriate diet can disrupt your Qi, CHM is an important ingredient of TCM. Chinese Herbal Medicine in Melbourne is mostly plant-based, however, some preparations include minerals and animal products. Different herbs have different properties and can balance particular areas, or ailments of your body. Therefore, the practitioner prescribing the medication must provide a diagnosis that took into account the affected area, the elements governing it and the state of the patient's Yin and Yang. This way, the specialist can create a treatment plan that will give you rapid results and improved overall well-being. For example, the skin is a metal element, thus it would be treated with a pungent herb. Tui Na One of the main treatments of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Melbourne. Tui Na is a therapeutic massage, which involves acupressure. This means the physician applies pressure with her fingers, instead of needles, to specific areas on the body to stimulate acupoints. Gua Sha A widely popular beauty treatment that even [Vogue.com](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/gua-sha-skincare-benefits) can't get enough of, Gua Sha, is a sensational self-care practice. Gua Sha is a natural therapy, which involves gently scraping your skin with a massage tool to improve circulation into that area, and thus promoting healing. Check out our page about [Tui Na and Gua Sha at AcuHeath](../tuina-guasha/) Cupping During cupping therapy, the physician will put a flammable substance such as alcohol, in a cup and set it on fire, and as the fire goes out she will place the cup on your skin. As the air inside the cup cools, it creates a vacuum, which causes your blood vessels to expand, skin to rise and redden. Each cup is usually left on your skin for 3-5 minutes at a time. Cupping therapy holds the promise of improving the state of the patient's blood disorder, rheumatic disease, fertility, skin problems, high blood pressure, migraines, anxiety and depression, bronchial congestion and varicose veins. This procedure is usually painless, but discomfort can be expected in the treated area during the procedure. Also, as a result of the blood vessel expansion, a circular bruise may form in the area and remain for a few days. Tai Chi and Qi Gong Both Tai Chi and Qi Gong are mind and body practices involving steady execution of gentle certain movements and postures, whilst focusing your mind and engaging your breathing. Thai Chi and Qi Gong movements differ in a way that if Tai Chi movements are performed quickly, they can be a form of self-defense, whereas fast Qi Gong movements cannot. These two practices are treatments classified as TCM by Chinese Medicine in Melbourne FL because [research](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/taichi/introduction.htm) has found that they can provide older people with many health benefits. Tai Chi is linked to improved balance and stability in Parkinson's sufferers, reduced joint pain, increased in life quality and mood in people with heart disease and cancer and it helps people cope with fibromyalgia and back pain. Qi Gong, on the other hand, can reduce chronic neck pain, pain from fibromyalgia and improve overall well-being. More about AcuHealth's Chinese Medicine, Melbourne FL!
