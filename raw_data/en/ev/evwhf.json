The VFC helps families of children who may not otherwise have access to vaccines by providing free vaccines to doctors who serve them. Children's Immunizations Parents are constantly concerned about the health and safety of their children and they take many steps to protect them. These preventive measures range from child-proof door latches to child safety seats. In the same respect, vaccines work to safeguard children from illnesses and death caused by infectious diseases. Vaccines protect children by helping prepare their bodies to fight often serious, and potentially, deadly diseases. Immunization has saved millions of lives over the years and has prevented hundreds of millions of cases of disease. Eligibility Children through 18 years of age who meet at least one of the following criteria are eligible to receive VFC vaccine: - Medicaid eligible: A child who is eligible for the Medicaid program. (For the purposes of the VFC program, the terms \"Medicaid-eligible\" and \"Medicaid-enrolled\" are equivalent and refer to children who have health insurance covered by a state Medicaid program) - Uninsured: A child who has no health insurance coverage - American Indian or Alaska Native: As defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603) - Underinsured: A child who has commercial (private) health insurance but the coverage does not include vaccines, a child whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (VFC-eligible for non-covered vaccines only), or a child whose insurance caps vaccine coverage at a certain amount. Once that coverage amount is reached, the child is categorized as underinsured. Underinsured children are eligible to receive VFC vaccine only through a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) or Rural Health Clinic (RHC). Contact and Questions?
