What you need to know about mercury, aluminum and other 'toxins' Opinion: Those worried about 'toxins' in vaccines and their bodies miss an important truism: The dose makes the poison. There is a concept in toxicology that originated from Paracelsus and is paraphrased as \"The dose makes the poison.\" It reminds us that all chemicals can be toxic to humans, depending on the dose. Water can kill you if you drink more than your body can handle. Even table salt is deadly if the dose ingested is high enough. It is also important to understand that the ability to produce toxicity has nothing to do with whether a chemical is natural or synthetic (man-made). Ricin, for instance, is a natural chemical found in the castor bean plant that is deadly in very small amounts. Alternatively, many commonly used synthetic chemicals, including some medications and dietary supplements, do not produce toxic effects unless taken in large overdoses. This relationship between dose and toxicity also applies to vaccine components. It is one reason why claims by anti-vaccination advocates that vaccines are toxic are wrong. The mercury-autism myth has been debunked Anti-vaccination groups have existed for as long as vaccines, and the specific arguments against vaccination have varied with the times. Modern fears related to toxicity initially focused on thimerosal, a preservative that contains mercury. The belief that mercury in vaccines caused toxicity gained momentum after a [study published in the journal Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/fulltext) in 1998 drew an association between the [measles vaccine and autism](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html). Later, the study findings could not be reproduced and discovery of ethical violations and misinformation in the report led to its retraction. The lead author [lost his license to practice medicine](http://healthland.time.com/2010/05/24/doctor-behind-vaccine-autism-link-loses-license/). Years of research have now conclusively demonstrated that there is no association between vaccines and autism, but it has been difficult to erase the damage caused by that widely publicized erroneous report. Dose matters with aluminum, formaldehyde [Thimerosal has since been removed](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html) from almost all vaccines, so anti-vaccination advocates have moved on to claiming that other chemicals in vaccines cause toxicity; namely formaldehyde and aluminum. If you go back to the concept of \"dose makes the poison\" you realize these are ridiculous claims. Formaldehyde is used to inactivate toxins during the manufacture of vaccines, but any amount left in the final product is minimal and much less than what is already found in our bodies naturally. The mere mention of formaldehyde can sound frightening because it has been [associated with cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet). But this association often involves long-term inhalation of high concentrations of formaldehyde in air, as might occur in an occupational setting. Formaldehyde in small amounts is naturally present in foods and in our bodies as part of normal metabolism. Any tiny amount remaining in vaccines after the manufacturing process is much less than the amount already present in the body of a newborn baby and is not dangerous. The situation for aluminum is similar. It is used to increase the body's immune response to the vaccine. But the small amount of aluminum present in vaccines is less than that found normally in our bodies. Due to the abundance of aluminum in our environment, we absorb more daily from our diet than we are exposed to in a vaccine. What's wrong with detox treatments Alleging that vaccines are \"toxic\" is an effective way to create confusion and uncertainty in parents who want to protect their children. We hear about toxins and poisoning in the news all the time, and it can be difficult to know what to be concerned about and what to ignore. For that reason we often default to avoiding the toxin if possible as a precaution, even if the evidence for harm to humans is weak or nonexistent. When there is uncertainty, avoidance may be a reasonable approach, unless the health risks of doing so outweigh the benefits. [As with sunscreen](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/05/06/sunscreen-chemicals-absorb-your-bloodstream-fda-study/1123513001/), for example. Or vaccines. Unfortunately, there are plenty of health practitioners who promote fears related to vaccine toxicity as well as to the general concept of being \"toxic\" from normal environmental exposures. \"Detoxification\" is a big moneymaking business. EDITORIAL: [These doctors vaccinated their kids. What about you?](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2019/05/16/measles-outbreak-has-arizona-doctors-speaking-up-you-should-too/3682694002/) Unscrupulous practitioners will diagnose everyone with some type of poisoning (their argument: we live in an environment filled with chemicals, so we are all exposed and therefore poisoned). They may have you fill out a \"toxicity\" survey, which is sure to raise concern for toxicity and prompt the ordering of diagnostic tests. The tests are not validated for diagnosing toxicity and/or are manipulated in ways that produce misleading results, which these practitioners then use to support treatment. Surprise! They often sell their own supplements or specialty products tailored just for your detox needs, or they administer a lengthy and expensive course of chelation treatments. You end up coming back for repeat visits and treatments and spending a lot of money when you were never \"toxic\" to begin with. Exposure doesn't mean you're poisoned A key thing to remember is that simply being \"exposed\" to something in the environment does not mean that you are \"poisoned.\" Sadly, many recipients of unnecessary testing and chelation treatments have been children with autism who were said to be suffering the effects of mercury from vaccination. All of this information can be less compelling than a heart-wrenching story from a friend, celebrity or politician. It feels less optimistic than a practitioner who tells you that they have the reason and solution for your fatigue or other complaint. This is why it is important to remember another concept often quoted in medicine: \"The plural of anecdote is not data.\" Children do become sick and develop chronic conditions. Adults develop new health concerns throughout their lives. Sometimes the cause is apparent and sometimes it is not. Some conditions, including autism, are complex and not fully understood. At the same time, multitudes of children receive their vaccinations every day. It is inevitable that coincidentally some children become sick soon after receiving a vaccine. This does not mean the vaccine caused the illness, as much as a distraught parent may believe it to be so. You have toxins? Get a second opinion [Studies have demonstrated](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/research/publications/index.html) that vaccines are safe. Vaccines prevent life-threatening diseases. Don't put your child's life at risk and risk the safety of our entire community because fear has overtaken reason. If a health-care provider suggests you suffer from environmental poisoning and recommends expensive tests and treatments to cure it, seek a second opinion from a medical toxicologist or other American Board of Medical Specialties Board-certified physician. While there are real, but rare, dangers of poisoning that your doctor can screen for with a history and physical examination, the vast majority of \"poisonings\" diagnosed in our country today are inappropriate and take advantage of our fear of toxins.
