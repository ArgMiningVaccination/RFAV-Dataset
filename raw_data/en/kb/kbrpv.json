GAVIN NEWSOM, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of California, Defendant -Appellee. No. 20-56357 D.C. No. 2:20-cv-06414 -JGB-KK Central District of California, Los Angeles ORDER Before: O 'SCANNLAIN, RAWLINSON, and CHRISTEN, Circuit Judges. In light of our court's recent opinion in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom , No. 20 -56358 (9th Cir. Jan. 22, 2021) , Appellants' emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, without prejudice to renewi ng the request before the merits panel in this case. The State of California is enjoined from enforcing the following policies against Harvest Rock Church or its member churches pending resolution of the appeal in this case : (1) the fixed 100-person atte ndance limit on indoor places of worship under Tier 2 of the State's Blueprint for a Safer Economy; and (2) the FILED JAN 25 2021 MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK U.S. COURT OF APPEALS Case: 20-56357, 01/25/2021, ID: 11979399, DktEntry: 44, Page 1 of 11 2 fixed 200-person attendance limit on indoor places of worship under Tier 3 of the Blueprint. This injunction does not prevent the State from e nforc ing the following policies against Harvest Rock or its member churches pending resolution of the appeal in this case: (1) the total prohibition s against indoor worship under Tier 1 of the Blueprint and the December 3 Regional Stay at Home Order; (2) t he limitations on attendance at indoor worship services under Tiers 2, 3, and 4 of the Blueprint that are tied to a percentage of a facility's fire -code capacity; and (3) the State's restrictions on singing and chanting at indoor worship services. IT IS SO ORDERED. Case: 20-56357, 01/25/2021, ID: 11979399, DktEntry: 44, Page 2 of 111 Harvest Rock Church , Inc. v. Newsom , No. 20- 56357 O'SCANNLAIN, J., specially concurring: I agree tha t, in light of our court's recent opinion in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, \u2014 F.3d \u2014, 2021 WL 222814 (9th Cir. Jan. 22, 2021) , we must largely deny Harvest Rock Church's emergency motion for an injunction against the State of California's draconian restrictions on indoor worship services . I write separately, however, because I believe that the decision in South Bay is woefully out of step with both the Supreme Court's decision in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63 (2020) (per curiam), and our own court's decision in Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak , 982 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir. 2020) . A simple, straightforward application of these controlling cases compels what should be the obvious result here: California's uniquely severe restrictions agains t religious worship services\u2014 including its total ban against indoor worship in nearly the entire state \u2014are patently unconstitutional and should be enjoined. The court's refusal to do so in South Bay cries out for correction. I In an effort to combat the spread of COVID -19, California's \"Blueprint for a Safer Economy\" and its December 3 Stay at Home Order completely prohibit indoor worship services in nearly the whole state. Even in the midst of the present FILED JAN 25 2021 MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK U.S. COURT OF APPEALS Case: 20-56357, 01/25/2021, ID: 11979399, DktEntry: 44, Page 3 of 112 pandemic, the se measure s are drastic: California is the only state in the country that imposes such a ban, according to the brief filed in this case by an organization participating as amicus curiae . See Brief of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae , Dkt. No. 29, at 2-4. Yet, in exactly the same locales where indoor worship is prohibited, California still allows a vast array of secular facilities to open indoors, including (to name only a few) : retail stores, shopping malls, factories, food- processing plants, warehouses, tra nsportation facilities, childcare centers, colleges, libraries, professional sports facilities, and movie studios. II We should have little trouble concluding that these severe measures violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. My view on that question is unchanged from my dissent from our denial of Harvest Rock Church's first emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal in October. See Harvest Rock Church, Inc. v. Newsom , 977 F.3d 728, 731 (9th Cir. 2020) (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting), cert. granted before judgment, \u2014 S. Ct. \u2014 , 2020 WL 7061630 (2020), and vacated on remand, 981 F.3d 764 (9th Cir. 2020 ). Since then, two intervening cases have entered injunctions against attendance caps on worship services that were far less extreme than California's total ban. See Roman Cath. Diocese , 141 S. at 982 F.3d at 1228. T hese controlling decision s conclusion here. Case: 20-56357, 01/25/2021, ID: 11979399, DktEntry: 44, Page 4 of 113 A First, there can be no doubt that California's discriminatory treatment of houses of worship must be subject to strict scrutiny. See Roman Cath. Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67; Calvary Chapel, 982 F.3d at 1233. Indeed, even the South Bay opinion could not avoid that reality. See South Bay , 2021 WL 222814, at *8 -9. B Second, t he controlling decisions also eliminate any notion that California's measures withstand such scrutiny. It should go without saying that strict scrutiny is a n exceedingly difficult standard to satisfy\u2014 indeed it is \"our most rigorous and exacting standard of constitutional review.\" Miller v. Johnson , 515 U.S. 900, 920 (1995). To sustain its ban on indoor worship , the State must demonstrate that such a measure is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Roman Cath. Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67. That is, the State must show that its \"inroad on religious liberty . . . is the least restrictive means of achieving\" its compelling in terest. Thomas v. Rev. Bd. of Ind. Emp. Sec. Div. , 450 U.S. 707, 71 8 (1981) (emphasis added). The State's interest in controlling the spread of a deadly pandemic is unquestionably compelling; no one disputes this. But California has not come close to showing t hat its measures are narrowly tailored to that interest. As exhaustively recounted in the South Bay decision, the State submitted many pages Case: 20-56357, 01/25/2021, ID: 11979399, DktEntry: 44, Page 5 of 114 of expert testimony setting forth its understanding of how COVID -19 is spread and why indoor activities present a risk of such spread. But even if we were to accept that testimony as true,1 it does not support a total ban on indoor services as the least restrictive means available to mitigate the risk at places of worship. And how could it be? T he South Bay decision itself proves the point that there are many ways t hat the State might safeguard indoor activities that stop well short of a total prohibition. The opinion discuss es at great length the variety of less severe measures that California has taken to allow all manner of secular activity to take place safely indoors, including occupancy limitations; facemask, physical- distancing, and disinfection protocols; installation of plexiglass barriers; regular COVID -19 testing practices ; and penalties the State might enforce for failures to comply with such requirements. See generally So uth Bay , 2021 WL 222814, at *11- 15. The obvious conclusion should be that , because the State has found measures like these sufficient to safeguard indoor activities as varied as running a 1 With respect, I question the salience of much of the evidence recounted in South Bay , which, among other things, often presents assertions about issues far beyond the scientific expertise of an infectious disease specialist. For example, t he views of an epidemiologist can hardly compel deference on matters of religion . Thus, I see no reason for our court to have credit ed an epidemiologist's assertion that individuals come to places of worship for the specific \"purpose of being together,\" South Bay , 2021 WL 222814, at *3 (quoting declaration of Dr. George Rutherford), as opposed to any number of relevant private religious purposes\u2014 such as to pray to God within the sacred and spiritually uplifting confines of a church, synagogue, or mosque. Case: 20-56357, 01/25/2021, ID: 11979399, DktEntry: 44, Page 6 of 115 daycare center, shopping in a mall, working in a warehouse or factory, riding public transportation, practicing a professional sport, attending a college class, or filming a movie, then surely some combination of similar measures might work for indoor religious worship as well. Even if it weren't otherwise clear that the State's total ban is not the narrowest way by which it might make indoor worship safer, the Supreme Court's decision in Roman Catholic Diocese dictates such a conclusion. There, the Court held that New York's 25- person cap on attendance at worship services was a restriction \"far more severe than has been shown to be required to prevent the spread of the virus. \" Roman Cath. Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67. The Court observed that \"there are many other less restrictive rules that c ould be adopted to minimize the risk to those attending religious services,\" including, \"[a]mong other things, \" tying \" the maximum attendance at a religious service . . . to the size of the church or synagogue.\" Id. Our court subsequently held that even a 50 -person cap on attendance at worship services was too inflexible to be narrowly tailored. Calvary Chapel, 982 F.3d at 1234. If fixed attendance caps of 25 or 50 people are too rigid and too extreme to withstand strict scrutiny, how can a complete ban not be? To paraphrase the Supreme Court , nothing in the record recounted in South Bay supports the conclusion that \"admitting [even a single person] to ID: 11979399, 44, Page 7 of 116 seat synagogue w ould create a more serious health risk than the many other activities that t he State allows.\" Roman Cath. Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67. Although we judges \"are not public health experts, \" id. at 68, we cannot simply forfeit all common sense to the State's a ssertions. We must instead insist upon a \"serious examination of the need for [the State's] drastic measure[s].\" Id. Under any meaningful examination , California's complete ban on indoor worship fails strict scrutiny\u2014 just as New York's and Nevada's more permissive regime s did before. III The remaining Winter factors also favor an injunction. See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Because the State's restrictions violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Ame ndment, there \"can be no question\" that their continued enforcement would cause irreparable harm to the religious believers and places of worship currently prohibited from worshipping indoors . Roman Cath . Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67. An injunction to protect these constitutionally guaranteed rights undoubtedly serves the public interest. Although the State's concern for mitigating a public health crisis is undeniably weighty, \"[n]o public interest is served by maintaining an unconstitu tional policy when constitutional alternatives are available to achieve the same goal.\" Agudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo , 983 F.3d 620, 637 (2d Cir. 2020); see also Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 11979399, DktEntry: of 117 injunction serves the inter ests of the general public by ensuring that the government's . . . procedures comply with the Constitution. \"). \"[E]ven in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.\" Roman Cath . Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 68. Thus, as both the Supreme Court and our court have agreed: Even in a case with such vital interests on each side, the balance of harms and the public interest require us to enjoin the State's unconstitutional practices. Indeed , neither court appears to have had much difficulty rea ching such a conclusion. See id. at 67- 68; Calvary Chapel, 44, Page 9 of est Roc k Church v. Newsom, No. 20-56357 Christe n, Circuit Judge , concurring I write separately, and brie fly, to c larify a few points. First, whe n Ha rvest Rock filed its emergency motion for injunc tion pe nding appeal, two othe r emergency motions we re pending in whic h house s of worship challenged California 's response to the COVID-19 pa ndemic. One of those cases, Gish v . Newsom, No. 20-56324, wa s consolida ted with South Bay Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, No. 20-56358, but the issue s in Ha rvest Rock's motion we re not a ligne d with those presented in South Bay . In pa rticular, the briefing in South Bay addressed California 's December 3, 2020 Sta y at Hom e and an orde r issue d December 19, 2020 by Los Ange les County . The posture of the se challenges changed at the January 4, 2021 a rgum ent held on Ha rvest Rock's motion be cause the parties agreed to supple ment the ir briefs to a ddress the December 3, 2020 Sta y at Hom e Orde r. Additiona lly, the order issue d by Los Ange les County was withdra wn. At tha t point, the issue s raised by Harvest Rock's motion be came aligne d with those in South Bay , and unde r our c ourt rule s, the South Bay panel had priority to issue merits ruling. See General Orde r 4.1(a ). Ora l argum ent wa s held in South Bay on January 15, 2021. To avoid issuing a ruling on Ha rvest Rock's emergency motion tha t might ha ve conflic ted with South Bay 's merits ruling\u2014 especially at a time whe n California 'sFILED JAN 25 2021 MOLLY C.

BACKGROUND On July 17, 2020, Plaintiffs Harvest Rock Ch urch, Inc., and Harvest Rock International Ministry, Inc. filed a complaint against De fendant California Governor Gavin Newsom. (\"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1.) The Complaint allege s six causes of action arising out of Governor Newsom's Covid-19 policy: (1) Violation of Free Ex ercise Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (2) Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Assembly Clau se; (3) Violation of Free Speech Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (4) Violation of Establishment Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (5) Violation of Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution; and (6) Violation of the Guarantee Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

(Dkt. No. 4.) On August 12, 2020, the Court held a telephonic hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. No. 42.) The Court ora lly denied the Motion at the haring and issued a separate written order to the same effect on September 2, 2020. (Dkt. No. 53.) On August 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed for an injunction pending appeal. (Dkt. No. 44.) The Court denied the injunction pending appeal on September 16, 2020. (Dkt. No. 54.) On October 1, 2020, the Ninth Circuit held t hat Plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on its argument that the Court abused its discretion by declining to grant its requested injunction. Harvest Rock Church, Inc. v. Newsom, 977 F.3d 728, 730 (9th Cir. 2020) (vacated). On November 25, 2020, the Supreme Court granted emergency injunctive relief to petitioners in Roman Catholic Diocese of Bro oklyn v. Cuomo, No. 20A87, 592 U.S. ___ (Nov. 25, 2020), a case concerning the constitutionality of New York State's Stay-at-Home orders. On December 3, 2020, in light of its Ca tholic Diocese opinion, the Supreme Court vacated this Court's September 2, 2020 Order. Harvest Rock Church v. Newsom, No. 20A94, 592 U.S. ___ (Dec. 3, 2020). On instruction fr om the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit vacated its October 1, 2020 order and remanded the case to this Court for further consideration in light of Catholic Diocese. (Dkt. No. 57.) The following day, Friday, December 4, 2020 , Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion, once again requesting emergency injunctive relief. (D kt. No. 58.) The Motion requested \"immediate relief by this Sunday, December 6, 2020.\" (I d.) The Court scheduled hearing for Tuesday, December 8, 2020. (Dkt. No. 60.) On December 5, 2020, Defendant filed a Notic e of Intention to Oppo se Plaintiffs' Motion and requested additional time to prepare an oppo sition and record. (Dkt. No. 61.) At the Tuesday, December 8, 2020 telephonic hearing, the Court granted Defendant's request for more time and set an expedite d briefing schedule. Also on December 8, 2020, South Bay United Pentecostal Church and Bishop Arthur Hodges III filed a motion to file an amicus brief in support of Plaintiffs. (Dkt. No. 63.) The Court GRANTS this request and considers the proposed amicus curiae brief properly submitted. (Dkt. No. 63-1.) On December 14, 2020, Defendant opposed Pl aintiffs' Motion. (\"Opposition,\" Dkt.

CURRENT RESTRICTIONS The set of policies governing Covid-19 clos ures in California exist under the umbrella designation \"Blueprint for a Safer Economy,\" (t he \"Blueprint,\") enacted August 28, 2020. (Dkt. No. 58-4.) The Blueprint is a framework of risk tiers and sector-specific restrictions, applied and periodically adjusted county-by-county through the State. (Id.) Counties are assigned tiers ranging from \"Tier 1-Widesp read\" testing positivity and \"case rate,\" defined as rate of new Covid-19 infection per capita, excluding prison cases, on a seven-day average. (Id.) The Blueprin t has changed since its inception, but its overall framework remains essentially the same. Also specifically governing religious activity in California is the State's July 29 Worship Guid ance, which prohibits indoor singing and chanting for places of worship and require s the use of face coverings.1 Tier 1-Widespread restrictions are the most severe.2 In counties designated Tier 1, social gatherings (predominately but not exclusively se cular) are only permitted outdoors and may only consist of up to three households.

In Tier 2-Substantial, social gatherings are \"strongly discouraged\" but permitted indoors and may consist of up to three households. (See Blueprint.) Shopping centers are open and may operate at a maximum of 50% capacity but must close common areas and reduce the capacity of food courts. (Id.) Museums, zoos, and aquariums may open at a maximum of 25% capacity. (Id.) Gyms and fitness centers may open at a maxi mum of 10% capacity. (Id.) Restaurants, movie theaters, and places of worship may operate ind oors at a maximum of 25% capacity or 100 people, whichever is fewer. (Id.) Wineries, cardr ooms, and family entertainment centers are still outdoor-only. (Id.) Amusement parks and bars ar e still closed. (Id.) Offices are still designated \"remote.\" (Id.) In Tier 3-Moderate, social gatherings ar e \"strongly discouraged\" but permitted indoors and may consist of up to three households.

(Id.) Gyms, cardrooms, and wineries may open at a maximum of 25% capacity. (Id.) Rest aurants, movie theaters, and places of worship may operate indoors at a maximum of 50% capacity or 200 people, whichever is fewer. (Id.) Bars may open outdoors only. (Id.) Smaller amusement parks may open at 25% capacity or 500 people, whichever is fewer, for ou tdoor attractions and with in-coun ty visitors only. (Id.) Offices may open indoors with modifications but should \"encourage telework.\" (Id.) Regardless of tier, California permits \"Critical Infrastructure\" sectors to remain open with industry-specific modifications.3 Critical Infrastructure sectors include healthcare, emergency services, the food and agriculture supply chain, the energy sector, water and wastewater management, transportation, communi cations and information technology, critical manufacturing, financial services, chemical and hazardous materials, defense, and \"industrial, commercial, residential, and sheltering facilitie s and services,\" which includes construction, plumbing, hardware, property management, laun dromats, and homeless shelters. (Id.) As of December 3, 2020, layered on top of the Blueprint is a \"Regional Stay Home Order,\" which goes into effect automatically th e day after a region has been announced to have less than 15% availability in its Hospital Intensive Care Units (ICUs). (Grabarsky Declaration Exh. 12.) The Regional Stay Home Order prohibits all social gatherings with members of other households, including outdoor gatherings. (I d.)

(Id.) III. LEGAL STANDARD The Court has previously articulated relevant standards for Temporary Restraining Orders. (See Dkt. Nos. 5, 42, 53.) To repeat: \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable har m in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an in junction is in the public interest.\" Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, I nc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy; it is never awarde d as of right.\" Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008) (citations omitted). The elements of a TRO and of a preliminary injunction are the same. See Rodriguez v. Wolf, 2020 WL 16 52541, *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2020.) IV. DISCUSSION Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo5 is a Free Exercise opinion. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion mostly requests injunctive re lief on Free Exercise grounds. (Motion 6.) However, Plaintiffs also argue that the Blueprint violates the Establishment Clause. (Id. at 17.) After this case was remanded, the Nint h Circuit found Nevada's Covid-19 religious restrictions unconstitutional in light of Catholic Diocese.6 In their Reply, Plaintiffs quote Dayton Valley: \"The Supreme Court's recent decision in [Catholic Diocese] arguably represents a seismic shift in Free Exercise law, and compels the result in this case.\" (Reply 1 (quoting 2020 WL 7350247 at *1).) A. Plaintiffs Remain Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits 1. Free Exercise Clause The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendm ent, incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits laws \"proh ibiting the free exercise\" of religion. U.S. Const., amend. I. Claims brought under the Free Exercise Clause first face the threshold inquiry of whether a law that substantially burdens a plaintiff's religious ex ercise is \"neutral or generally applicable.\" 4 Regional Stay Home Order, https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential- needs/#regional-stay-home-order (last accessed December 18, 2020). 5 Hereafter cited as No. 20A87, 2020 WL 6948354, at *1 (U.S. Nov. 25, 2020). 6 Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v.

Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 881 (1990). If a law is neutral and of general applicability, that law \"n eed not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effe ct of burdening a particular religious practice.\" Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 52 0, 531 (1993). Absent neutrality or general applicability, that law faces st rict scrutiny, which requires the government to demonstrate a compelling interest and that its means are narrowly tailored to meet that interest. 508 U.S. at 531-32. Catholic Diocese did not overrule Smith; it app lied it. In Catholic Diocese, the Supreme Court established that New York State's Order wa s: (1) not neutral or ge nerally applicable; (2) unlikely to survive the merits of a strict scrutiny inquiry. 2020 WL 6948354, at *1. Though the Ninth Circuit has labeled this a seismic shift, (see 2020 WL 7350247 at *1,) the standard this Court is bound to apply remains the framework fr om Smith and Lukumi Babalu. Indeed, though the Ninth Circuit found that Nevada's Covid-19 restrictions on houses of worship warranted strict scrutiny and directed the district court to review its analysis of the directive accordingly, it did not recognize or articulate a standard for Free Exercise claims distinct from the Smith framework. a. California's Restrictions Do Not Warrant Strict Scrutiny The law remains that courts must first a ssess whether a law is \"neutral or generally applicable.\" Smith, 494 U.S. at 881. The Court finds that California's Blueprint is. The Blueprint offers something the New York and Nevada Orders did not: the ability to legally congregate in unlimited numbers fo r worship\u2014so long as that worship occurs outside. In so doing, the Blueprint treats religious activity be tter than comparable secular activity and even better than essential services. This is distinct from both the New York and Nevada restrictions and compels the conclusion that the Blueprint is neutral. As the Supreme Court described, the New York Order imposed \"very severe restrictions\" on religious services in areas cla ssified as \"red\" or \"orange\" zones. 2020 WL 6948354, at *1. In red zones, no more than 10 p eople were permitted to a ttend a religious service, and in orange zones, attendance was capped at 25. Id. The New York Orders made no exceptions for outdoor religious worship. In ho lding that the New York Orders were entitled to strict scrutiny, the Supreme Court noted that New York's regulations \"cannot be viewed as neutral because they single out houses of wors hip for especially harsh treatment.\" Id. This harsh treatment occurred in both red and or ange zones. In red zones, businesses like \"acupuncture facilities, camp grounds, garages, . . . all plants manufacturing chemicals and microelectronics and all transportation facilities\" co uld admit as many people as they wished while religious organizations were numerically cappe d at 10. Id. at *2. In orange zones, while religious institutions were strictly capped, even non-essential businesse s were empowered to decide for themselves how many persons to a dmit. Id. The Court noted that \"the maximum Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 77 Filed 12/21/20 Page 6 of 14 Page ID #:2976Page 7 of 14 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG attendance at a religious service could be tied to the size of the church or synagogue,\" and that almost all of the Diocese churches affected by the Orders could seat over 500 people. Id.7 In Nevada, Governor Sisolak's Directive pr ohibited \"gatherings in groups of more than fifty people in any indoor or outdoor areas.\" Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak, 2020 WL 4260438, at *1 (D. Nev. June 11, 2020), rev'd and remanded sub nom. Dayto n Valley v. Sisolak, 2020 WL 7350247 (9th Cir. Dec. 15, 2020). The Nevada Directive limited movie theaters and churches to a maximum of 50 people but allowed casin os to reopen at 50% of their capacity. Id. As the average capacity of a casino far surpa sses 100 people, Nevada's Directive created an environment where individuals could gather in large groups to gamble but not to attend a religious service, regardless of whether that service was inside or outside. In applying Catholic Diocese to Dayton Valley, the Ninth Circuit noted that \"instead of a fifty-person cap, the Directive could have, for e xample, imposed a limitation of 50% of fire-code capacity on houses of worship, like the limitation it imposed on retail stores and restaurants, and like the limitation the Nevada Gaming Control Bo ard imposed on casinos.\" Dayton Valley, 2020 WL 7350247, at *4. Nevada denied churches the a bility to be treated like casinos, which is not neutral, generally applicable regulation. By contrast to both New York and Nevada, California treats houses of worship like or more favorably than similar secular institutions\u2014so th e Blueprint is not subject to strict scrutiny. There are no numerical limits on worship in Califo rnia. Plaintiffs and other religious institutions located in Tier 1 may gather as many worshippers in person as they please for outdoor services. The same rules apply to theaters and restaurants. All are limited to outdoor-only service in Tier 1. (Blueprint.) Likewise, in Tier 2, chur ches, theatres, and restaur ants are allowed unlimited outdoor services and indoor services at a maximum of 25% capacity or 100 people, whichever is fewer. (Id.) In Tier 3, those entities are allo wed unlimited outdoor servic es and indoor services at a maximum of 50% capacity or 200 people, whiche ver is fewer. (Id.) Large amusement parks, for example Disneyland, are not a llowed to open until Tier 4 because of the risk associated with gathering crowds from many households together . (Id.) Smaller amusement parks may not open until Tier 3. (Id.) This is the case even th ough amusement parks are by nature, outdoors. California also restricts activities and bu sinesses mentioned in Catholic Diocese. Overnight stays at campgrounds are prohibited in regions with limited Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity. (Grabarsky Declaration Exh. 12.) In such areas, including Southern California, which has no ICU beds left, all retailers are cappe d at 20% capacity and must follow strict guidance\u2014 unlike the unlimited gathering permissible in New York stores described by the Supreme Court. 7 The challengers in Catholic Diocese were al so entitled to strict scrutiny because of the strong showing that New York's restrictions impermissibly discriminated against religious communities. The Court first noted that statemen ts made in connection with the rules \"can be viewed as targeting the ultra-Orthodox [Jewish] community.\" 2020 WL 6948354, at *1 (internal quotations omitted.) There are no statem ents indicating religious animus here. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 77 Filed 12/21/20 Page 7 of 14 Page ID #:2977Page 8 of 14 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG (Id.) No hotel or lodging entity is permitted to acce pt out-of-state reservations for non-essential travel unless the reservation is for an entire quarantine period. (Id.) The Blueprint and Regional Stay Home Ord er regulate social gatherings\u2014including outdoor gatherings\u2014more stringently than they re gulate both indoor and outdoor religious activity. (Id., Blueprint.) Outdoor social gath erings are barred entirely under the Regional Stay Home Order, and under regular Tier 1, outdoor ga therings of more than three households are prohibited. (Id.) In other words, in Tier 1 counties, four families may not gather together outdoors for a picnic, but they may gather togeth er outdoors to attend a religious service. In Pasadena, two people from sepa rate households cannot gather to gether outside unless they are engaged in worship or political expression. (Graba rsky Declaration Exh. 12 .) This is not the especially harsh treatment of New York State,8 or the casino favoritism of Nevada. b. Even Applying Strict Scrutiny, California's Restrictions Survive The Court finds the Blueprint is likely to pr evail. Strict scrutiny requires governmental action to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. See Catholic Diocese, 2020 WL 6948354 at *2. The State has a compelling interest in curbing the spread of what is now the \"world's deadliest infectious disease.\" (See Grabarsk y Declaration Exh. 2-3.) This has been acknowledged by both the Supreme Court and the Ni nth Circuit. See Dayton Valley v. Sisolak, 2020 WL 7350247, at *3; Catholic Diocese, 2020 WL 6948354, at *2. Indeed, Covid-19 can cause severe disease and death in individuals of any age. (Watt Declaration \u00b6 22.) Even those who are asymptomatic or suffer only mild illness may face serious long-term effects. (Id. \u00b6 23.) There is no cure. (Id. \u00b6 24.) The virus has killed almost 300,000 Americans, including more than 20,000 Californians, and despite the miraculous development of a vaccine, this number will continue to climb in the foreseeable future. (See Grabarsky Declaration Exh. 2-3.) Mass death will likely be accelerated by public need for he althcare beyond what the hospital system can bear\u2014Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity is curren tly at less than 3% in Southern California. (See Watt Declaration \u00b6 93; Rutherford Declaratio n \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.) As a consequence, all patients in need of ICU services, including those who do not have Covid-19, are at risk of not being able to receive intensive treatments necessary to save th eir lives. (See Watt Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.) A compelling interest in averting mass death is clear. Waiting out the pandemic in search of herd immunity results in substantial preventable death. (See Rutherford Declaration \u00b6 89.) California's Blueprint is also painstakin gly tailored to address the risks of Covid-19 transmission specifically. Again, Covid-19 is sp read through airborne transmission from person to person\u2014infectious droplets are expelled into th e air when people with the virus cough, sneeze, 8 Catholic Diocese specifically references South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), a ca se concerning California's Blueprin t, in relevant reasoning. See, e.g., 2020 WL 6948354, at *7 (Kavanaugh. J. , concurring) were \"much more severe\" than California's). Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 77 Filed 12/21/20 Page 8 of 14 Page ID #:2978Page 9 of 14 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG speak, sing, or make other noises. (Watt Declar ation \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.) These droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or be inhaled into those people's lungs. (Id.) Droplets may also fall onto objects which others then touch, but this is presently not believed to be a common source of Covid-19 sp read. (Id.) There is broad co nsensus that people who are not experiencing symptoms can still spread the Covid-19 virus. (Id. \u00b6 30.) This means that even those who are feeling well may infect others. Th is scientific knowledge\u2014that the virus spreads by being carried from an infected person to others through the air, even when the infected person may not feel ill\u2014is the foundation of all public hea lth guidance about Covid-19. This is why it is safer for individuals to be farther apart as oppo sed to closer together. This is why outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor gatherings in well-ventilated spaces, which are in turn safer than indoor gatherings in poorly-ventilated spaces. This is the science behind masks, which block respiratory droplets from being expelled when they are worn properly. This is why singing and shouting, which expel more viral droplets, are riskier activities than sitting silently. Viral load also matters. Viral load is the number of viable viral particles per milliliter of oral or nasal secretions. (Rutherford Declaration \u00b6 36.) People with higher viral loads are more infectious than those with lower viral loads. (Id.) Those with higher viral loads are more likely to die than those with lower viral loads. (Id. \u00b6 35.) To simplify greatly, more of the virus is worse for people than less of the virus. Illness is no t a binary between \"Covid present\" and \"Covid absent.\" Scientific knowledge about the spread of Covid-19 has led to \"broad consensus among public health professionals\" that all of the foll owing measures reduce the spread of coronavirus: \"stay at home orders, physical distancing requ irements, physical barriers where distancing is not possible, prohibiting/limiting high-risk gatherings and other high-risk activities (including singing and other activities involving increased exhalation fo rce), and universal wearing of face coverings by all in public places.\" (Rutherford Declaration \u00b6 51.) California has tailored its Blueprint restrictio ns to the specific mechanism of Covid-19 transmission: viral droplets which travel through th e air from person to person. Imagining other possible methods of viral transmission underscore s the specificity of California's response. For example, if Covid-19 were a sexually transmitte d viral disease like HIV/AIDS, State mandates requiring people to cover their faces would do no good. There would be no sense in attendance limits on churches or grocery stores. As such, th e Blueprint would fail a strict scrutiny analysis if it were enacted to prevent the spread of HIV. Similarly, if Covid-19 were a bacterial disease spread through contaminated water like cholera, there would be no reas on to prevent people from singing and chanting. The Blueprint would fa il a strict scrutiny analysis if it were enacted to prevent the spread of cholera. But the restrictions on houses of worship at the core of this case are narrowly tailored to prevent the spread of Covid-19. They are precis ely focused on the method by which the virus is transmitted: viral droplets expelled into the a ir. Of course, Califor nia cannot merely prohibit expelling viral droplets. It must address scenarios likely to make people ill by their transmission. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 77 Filed 12/21/20 Page 9 of 14 Page ID #:2979Page 10 of 14 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG California permits unlimited attendance at religio us services so long as those services occur outdoors. Neither New York nor Nevada did so. As outdoor activity is safer than indoor activity, (see Watt Declaration \u00b6 44,) this framewor k enables people to practice their faith in large groups in the context in which it may be safe to do so. The increased danger of transmission posed by on singing and chanting are similarly res tricted. There is widespread scientific consensus that louder and more forceful vocal vocalization, such as singing and chanting, produces more airborne droplets than normal speech. (Id. \u00b6 45.) The more people singing and chanting, the greater the likelihood that some of those people are infected with Covid-19 and can infect others. (Id.) Comparing restrictions on houses of worshi p to similar secular activities proves their tailoring. Indoor professional sporting events and concerts can draw crowds many times larger than the capacity of single movie theater. Under the Blueprint, these events cannot open to live audiences in any tier, even though they fit in the same \"substantive categorization\" as theaters. (Rutherford Declaration \u00b6 61.) Restaurants, which also gather people from different households and thus pose risk, are regulated like indoor worshi p. (Blueprint.) Tier 1 closes indoor dining and religious observance alike. Id. Finally, comparing restrictions on houses of worship to so-called \"essential services\" effectively proves tailoring. Plaintiffs place much weight on essential services, noting that even in Tier 1, \"food packaging and processing plants, laundromats, and warehouses are permitted to operate with no numerical or capacity restrictions.\" (Motion 9.) Plaintiffs also cite Judge O'Scannlain's observation that in counties where individuals are restricted from indoor worship, they may still \"spend a day shopping in the ma ll, have their hair styled, get a manicure or pedicure, attend college classes, produce a television show or movie, participate in professional sports, wash their clothes at a laundromat, and even work in a meatpacking plant.\" (Reply 8 (quoting Harvest Rock Church, Inc. v. Newsom, 977 F.3d 728, 731 (9th Cir. 2020) (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting))). First, many of these activities, for both safety and architectural reasons, must occur inside, making the outdoor access ac corded to Plaintiffs and other houses of worship impossible. It would be incredibly odd for the government to demand all meat-packing warehouses bring their operations into the Pasadena sunshine to comply with Covid-19 best practices. More critically, the activities that Plaintiffs id entify as receiving more favorable treatment than indoor worship are safer than indoor worship. Dr. Rutherford, Dr. Wa tt, and Dr. Stoto each explain why. (Stoto Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; Ruth erford Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 91-133; Watt Declaration \u00b6 46.) To summarize, indoor worship services \"are an especially risky type of public gathering.\" (Watt Declaration \u00b6 46.) Indoor services typ ically involve large groups of people coming together for the purpose of bein g together. (Rutherford Declara tion \u00b6 102.) Religious services commonly bring together individuals from diff erent households who may know each other, making them more likely to interact. (Id.) Attendees at indoor worship services typically Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 77 Filed 12/21/20 Page 10 of 14 Page ID #:2980Page 11 of 14 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG assemble close together in one space, seated in a series of many rows (or pews) that are physically close together, making close proximity of many in dividuals highly likely. (Id.) Worship services typically last a minimum of one hour with congregant s gathered in close proximity. (Id. \u00b6 103.) Many services involve \"substantial group sin ging and other group vocalization by those leading the services and those in the congregation\" whi ch \"carry with them a potential for increased risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus.\" (Id. \u00b6 104.) In many cases, buildings housing indoor worship services \"are older and are not equipped with adequate methods of ventilation or air conditioning.\" (Id. \u00b6 105.) Risk in such settings is \"reduced but not eliminated where all of the participants wear face coverings.\" (Id. \u00b6 106.) Because of these characteristics, there have been many documented super-spreading incidents involving indoor religio us activity. (Id. \u00b6 108; Watt Declaration \u00b6 46.) In contrast, shopping at a grocery or big box store \"involves less risk\" of Covid-19 transmission than attending an indoor worship serv ice. (Rutherford Declaration \u00b6 113.) Grocery shoppers generally do not get or stay in close proximity to one another, generally intend to \"get in and get out as soon as possible,\" and it is unlike ly that two shoppers are ever within six feet of each other for more than 15 minutes, making it le ss likely that shoppers \"receive a sufficient viral load of droplets or aerosolized particles sufficien t to overcome their defenses and cause a COVID 19 infection.\" (Id.) Grocery stores are also ge nerally larger in size, of more recent construction, and better ventilated than houses of worship, an d they are \"almost always equipped with high- functioning air-conditioning systems, as is requ ired due to the necessity to preserve perishable products sold in these stores and the applicable building and health and safety codes.\" (Id. \u00b6 114.) Grocery stores do not common ly invite singing. (Id. \u00b6 116.) Likewise, retail shopping centers, hotels, laun dromats, and liquor stores pose a lower risk of transmission than indoor religious gatherings . \"Staying at a hotel, doing laundry at a laundromat and retail shopping may bring people into relative closeness, but none of these activities would require them to remain in prox imity for longer than a brief interlude.\" (Id. \u00b6 117.) Because viral load matters, standing next to someone infected with Covid-19 for fifteen minutes is much less dangerous than standing next to someone infected with Covid-19 for one hour. Personal care services are distinct for differe nt reasons. Hair and nail salons and other personal services ordinarily involve much smaller gro ups of people than worship services. (Id. \u00b6 120.) And under the Blueprint, workers at such businesses are \"subject to numerous specific hygiene requirements, including requiring the us e of face coverings by both workers and customers/clients, frequent handwashing, frequent cleaning and disinfection and the use of disposable gloves. Workers that are consistently within six feet of customers or co-workers are required to wear a secondary barrie r (e.g., a face shield or safety goggles) in addition to a face covering.\" (Id.) Congregate workplace settings such as wa rehouses, factories, and film production companies are also distinct. (Id. \u00b6 121.) These workspaces are closed systems in which employers can determine who is allowed \"in the bubble.\" Warehouses and factories do not Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 77 Filed 12/21/20 Page 11 of 14 Page ID #:2981Page 12 of 14 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG involve people in close proximity to others for ex tended periods of time; and they do not typically involve extended vocalizations. As for f ilm production companies, employment in the entertainment industry is currently contingent on a negative Covid-19 test result, with subsequent testing up to three times a week de pending on an employee's position. See COVID- 19 Return to Work Agreement with DGA, IA TSE, SAG-AFTRA and Teamsters/Basic Crafts (Sept. 21, 2020), at pp. 4-12 (describin g testing requirements), available at https://www.sagaftra.org/files/sa_documents/ ReturnToWorkAgreement_wAMPTP.pdf (last visited December 17, 2020). If \"narrowly tailored\" does not mean ba sed on the specific mechanism of Covid-19 infection with sliding levels of restriction based on scientific likelihood of viral spread in any given scenario, it means nothing. California's Blueprint regulations track levels of risk that infectious airborne droplets will enter the eyes, noses, and mo uths of previously uninfected individuals, just as public health experts have advised. Both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals have counseled that judges \"are not public health experts, and we should respect th e judgment of those with special expertise and responsibility in this area.\" Dayton Valley, 2020 WL 7350247, at *3 (quoting Catholic Diocese, 2020 WL 6948354, at *3.) This Court agrees. And respecting the judgment of experts means understanding which activities pose greater or le sser risks and allowing the State to regulate accordingly. (See, e.g., Stoto Declaration \u00b6 34, \"Rather than comparing the risks associated with attending church services and participating in pr otests, a more appropriate comparison would be between places of worship and movie theaters, wh ich are treated identically in the Blueprint. Indeed, because movie viewers sit in one place during the entire performance, do not remove masks to receive communion, and do not sing or chant, the risk of transmitting the virus to others is probably lower than in church services.\") The California Blueprint survives strict scrutiny. 2. Establishment Clause Plaintiffs remain unlikely to succeed on the merits of their Establishment Clause claim. (Motion 17.) Neither Catholic Diocese nor Dayton Valley addressed the Establishment Clause; there is no basis to believe the Clause has changed to become salient here. The Establishment Clause of the Firs t Amendment prohibits laws \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" U.S. Const., amend. I. At least for now, in assessing Establishment Clause claims, courts must examine the purposes and effects of a challenged government action, as well as any entanglement with religion that it might entail. See Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613 (1971). This analysis has involved challenges ranging from prayer in public schools to Sunday closing laws to religious monument s on public lands. See Am. Legion v. Am. Humanist Ass'n, 139 S. Ct. 2067, 20 80 (2019) (collecting cases). However, the \"real object\" of the Establis hment Clause is \"to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government.\" Lynch v. Donnelly, 46 5 U.S. 668, 678 (1984) (quoting 3 Story, Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 77 Filed 12/21/20 Page 12 of 14 Page ID #:2982Page 13 of 14 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG Commentaries on the Constitution of the United Stat es 728 (1833)). Restrictions on religious activity which are the same as restrictions on secular activity do not constitute government establishment\u2014or disavowal\u2014of religion. Even th e broadest possible understanding of this clause does not render the State of California's Blueprint unconstitutional. B. Irreparable Harm Plaintiffs' harm is distinct from harm faced by challengers in Catholic Diocese. While the \"loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,\" see Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion), Plaintiffs here have the ability to gather and wors hip in person and in unlimited numbers. If there is unique irreparable harm arising from being made to gather for worship outside as opposed to inside, (a possibility the Court will no t foreclose,) Plaintiffs have not briefed it. Plaintiffs engage with the Blueprint as they imagine it to be, claiming \" every single attendee is prohibited from attending a worship service ,\" (Motion 19, (emphasis in original)), as opposed to engaging with the actual contours of the polic y at hand. Even assuming such harm exists, \"the right of free exercise does not relieve an individua l of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\" 494 U.S. at 879 (internal quotations omitted). C. Balance of Equities and the Public Interest Where the government is the opposing party, balancing of the harm and the public interest merge. See Nken v. Ho lder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). Thus, the Court asks whether any significant \"public consequences\" would result from issuing the preliminary injunction. Winter, 555 U.S. at 24. Plaintiffs argue \"the State is in no way harmed by the issuance of an injunction\" preventing enforcement of Bluep rint restrictions. (Motion 21 (i nternal quotations omitted.)) Not so. There is compelling evidence that en tering Plaintiffs' requested injunction would harm the public interest. Scientific consensus is clea r that Covid-19 is transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when a person or group of peop le talk, sing, cough, or breathe near each other. (Watt Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.) Indoor gatherings are riskier than outdoor gatherings; big gatherings are riskier than small gatherings; and gatherings which last for long periods of time are riskier than gatherings which last for short periods of time. (Id.) If Plaintiffs were to immediately resume numerically uncapped indoor worship, it is likely that this indoor worship\u2014like any indoor ac tivity involving members of multiple households\u2014 would contribute to the spread of Covid-1 9, straining already-stressed public health infrastructure and filling already-packed ICUs.

They claim that Tier 1 \"totally prohibit[s] religious worship services of any kind and any number.\" (Motion 3.) This is not true. The First Amendment has not taken a sabbatical. Californians may still worship, attend services, pray, and otherwise exercise their religious freedoms. They just may not do so in ways that significantly increase the likelihood of transmission of a v irus which has claimed more than three hundred thousand American lives in less than one year. The Constitution is not a suicide pact.9 The First Amendment may not be used to make it one. Plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Dkt. No. 58) is DENIED. IT IS SO ORDERED. 9 See Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 37 (1949) (dissenting opinion).

Harvest Rock Church, Inc., and Harvest International Ministry, Inc., (Harvest Rock) challenge the constitutionality of California Governor Gavin Newsom's COVID- 19 Executive Orders and related restrictions (Orders) as they apply to in -person worship services. T he district court denied Harvest Rock's request for a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the Orders as to its in- person worship services. Harvest Rock appealed and has filed an emergency motion asking this court to enjoin enforcement of the Orders pending appeal. FILED OCT 1 2020 MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK U.S. COURT OF APPEALS Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 1 of 19 2 In order to demonstrate that a n injunction pending appeal is warranted, Harvest Rock must show that it is likely to succeed on the merits, that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in its favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); see also Feldman v. Ariz. Sec'y of State's Office , 843 F.3d 366, 367 (9th Cir. 2016) (\"The standard for evaluating an injunction pending appeal is similar to that employed by district courts in deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction.\"). As to a likelihood of success o n the merits, Harvest Rock must demonstrate that it is likely this court will conclude the district court abused its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction. See, e.g. , Lopez v. Heckler , 713 F.2d 1432, 1436 (9th Cir. 1983) (abuse of discretion st andard governs an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction) . Our review of the denial of a preliminary injunction is \"limited and deferential.\" Southwest Voter Registration Educ. Project v. Shelley , 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). We consider \"only the temporal rights of the parties until the district court renders judgment on the merits of the case based on a fully developed record.\" Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Nat'l Marine Fisheries Ser v., 422 F.3d 782, 793 (9th 2005) (citation omitted). Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 2 of 19 3 We find that Harvest Rock has not shown a likelihood of success on its argument that the district court abused its discretion by declining to enjoin the Orders . The evidence that was before the district court does not support Harvest Rock's argument s that the Orders accord comparable secular activity more favorable treatment than religious activity . The Orders apply the same restrictions to worship services as they do to other indoor congregate events, such as lectures and movie theaters. Some congregate activities are completely prohibited in every county , such as attending concerts and spectating sporting events. The dissent states that the restrictions applicable to places of worship 'do no t apply broadly to all activities that might appear to be conducted in a manner similar to religious services,' but does not provide support for this point. By our read the restrictions on theaters and higher education are virtually identical. Harvest Roc k also contends that the Governor failed to provide a rationale for the more lenient treatment of certain secular activities, such as shopping in a large store. However , the Governor offered the declaration of an expert, Dr. James Watt, in support of the claim that the risk of COVID-19 is elevated in indoor congregate activities, including in- person worship services. Harvest Rock did not offer a competing expert or any other evidence to rebut Dr. Watt's opinion that congregate events li ke worship services are particularly risky. Because the district court based its order on the only evidence in the record as to the risk of spreading Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 3 of 19 4 COVID -19 in different settings, Harvest Rock is unlikely to show that the district court abuse d its discr etion . We also conclude that Harvest Rock failed to demonstrate that an injunction pending appeal is in the public interest. The Supreme Court considered and declined a similar request to enjoin application of California's Orders as to worship services in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613 , 1614 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (deference to state officials is \"especially\" warranted where \"a party seeks emergency relief in an interlocutory posture, while local officials are actively shaping their response to changing facts on the ground.\") . Harvest Rock has not shown that the restrictions at issue in this appeal are materially different than those presented in South Bay United Pentecostal, and though we are not bound by it, we are persuaded by the Supreme Court's conclusion that injunctive relief is not warranted. See United States v. Montero - Camargo , 208 F.3d 1122, 1132 n. 17 (2000) (en banc) (non-binding Supreme Court dicta is accorded \"appropriate deference\" (citation omitted)) . For these reasons, t he emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal (Docket Entry No. 6) is denied. We grant the motion to file the amicus brief in support of the Governor for purposes of this emergency motion (Docket Entry No. 9). Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 4 of 191 Harvest Rock Church , Inc. v. Newsom , No. 20- 55907 O'SCANNLAIN, J., dissenting: At present, in 18 counties in California \u2014home to more than 15 million residents and including its most populous county, Los Angeles \u2014indoor religious worship service s are completely prohibited.1 California insists that th is drastic measure is necessary to fight the ongoing global COVID -19 pandemic \u2014a worthy and indeed compelling goal of any State. Yet, in these same counties, the State still allows pe ople to go indoors to: spend a day shopping in the mall, have their hair styled, get a manicure or pedicure, attend college classes, produce a television show or movie, participate in professional sports, wash their clothes at a laundromat, and even work i n a meatpacking plant. The Constitution allows a State to impose certain calculated, neutral restrictions \u2014even against churches and religious believers \u2014necessary to combat emergent threats to public health. But the Constitution, emphatically, does not allow a State to pursue such measures against religious practices more aggressively 1 See Cal. Dep't Pub. Health, Blueprint Data Chart (Sept. 29, 2020), https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20 Library/COVID -19/Blueprint_Data_Chart_092920.xlsx; State of California, Covid- 19 Blueprint Activity and Business Tiers 1 (last updated Sept. 28, 2020), https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/C DPH%20Document%20Library/ COVID -19/Dimmer -Framework -September_2020.pdf . Attendance at in -person religious worship services is allowed but tightly capped in California's remaining counties, as explained below. See infra Part II.A. FILED OCT 1 2020 MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK U.S. COURT OF APPEALS Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 5 of 192 than it does against comparable secular activities . See Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak , 140 Ct. 26 03, 2605 (2020) (mem.) (Alito, J., dissenting); South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1615 (2020) (mem.) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). Because California's present coronavirus- related initiatives do exactly that, I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision not to enjoin them pending Harvest Rock Church's appeal in this case. I I first clarify a point that is somewhat obscured by the majority's decision: we are n either bound nor meaningfully guided by the Supreme Court's de cision to deny a writ of injunction against California's restrictions on religious worship services earlier this year. See South Bay United Pentecostal Church, 140 S. Ct. at 1613 . That decision, which considered a challenge to an earlier and much differe nt iteration of California's restrictions, was unaccompanied by any opinion of the Court and thus is precedential only as to \" the precise issues presented and necessarily decided.\" Mandel v. Bradley , 432 U.S. 173, 176 (U.S. 1977) (per curiam) . In that case, the Supreme Court considered whether to issue a writ of injunction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) , a more demanding standard tha n that which applies t o the motion for an injunction pending appeal here. Compare Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. v. Sebelius, 568 U.S. 1401, 1403 (2012) (Sotomayor, J. , as Circuit Justice ) (discussing the standard for issuing a writ of Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 6 of 193 injunction, which is an \"extraordinary\" measure to be \"used sparingly\" and \" only when it is necessary or appropriate in aid of our jurisdiction and the legal rights at issue are indisputably clear\" ( alterations and internal quotation marks omitted )), with Se. Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs , 472 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 2006) (\" In deciding whether to grant an injunction pending appeal, the court balances the plaintiff 's likelihood of success against the relative hardship to the parties. \" (internal quotation marks omitted)) . Without any opinion of the Court, we have no guidance whatsoever \u2014not even in the form of \"dicta\" as the majority suggests, Maj. at 4\u2014as to why the Court declined to provide such an extraordinary remedy, and we certainly have no basis to infer that a majority of the Court agreed upon some unstated r ationale that somehow ap plies equally here.2 Cf. Makekau v. Hawaii , 943 F.3d 1200, 1205 (9th Cir. 2019) (\"[T]he mere fact that the injunction order issued under the All Writs Act does not prove that the Supreme Court . . . addressed the merits [of the underlying claim].\"). II Turning to the motion before us, I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that Harvest Rock Church is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its 2 This is true even if one agrees \u2014and to be clear, I do not agree\u2014with the majority's assertion that Harvest Rock Church \"has not shown that the restrictions at issue in this appeal are materially different than those presented in South Bay United Pentecostal .\" Maj. at 4. Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 7 of 194 free exercise challenge to California's severe restrictions on religious worship in the State . There is no doubt that California's COVID -19 scheme (described more fully below) imposes direct and severe burdens on religious practice within the State. And where a State imposes such burdens through measures that are not \"neutral and of general applica bility ,\" its actions must survive strict scrutiny. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 -32 (1993) . \"The Free Exercise Clause bars even subtle departures from neutrality on matters of religion .\" Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civ il Rights Comm'n , 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1731 (internal quotation marks omitted) . Because California's COVID -19 regulations patently disfavor religious practice when compared to analogous secular activities, I believe that the church is quite likely indeed to succeed on the merits of its challenge to such regulations. A First, California's complex morass of COVID-related restr ictions fails even the \"minimum requirement of neutrality\" : such restrictions discriminate against religious practice \" on [their] face. \" Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 533. Contrary to how California would portray its scheme , at this point there is no \"neutral\" or \"generally applicable\" State policy that one can apply to determine whether or to what extent any particular activity is permissible . Instead, California Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 8 has announced a variegated and ever -changing \"Blueprint for a Safer Economy,\" which regulates all manner of in-person activities by meticulously delineating those activities which may take place . See State of California, Blueprint for a Safer Economy (last updated Oct. 1, 2020), https://covid19.ca.gov/safer -econom y [hereinafter \"Cal. Blueprint \"]. Despite its deceptively cohesive title, this \"Blueprint\" is in reality an amalgamation of dozens of independent restrictions and \"guidance\" documents, each of which pertains only to a specific category of activity within the State. There are, at this point, independent restrictions targeted to nearly forty categories of activity (many of them further subdivided into more categories), including retail shopping outlets, grocery stores, offices, fitness centers, places of hi gher education, schools, barbershops, warehouses, food packing facilities, film and television studios, family entertainment centers, museums, professional sports facilities, an d \"places of worship.\" See State of California , COVID -19 Industry Guidance (last updated Sept. 29, 2020) , https://covid19.ca.gov/industry- guidance [hereinafter \"Industry Guidance \"]. Under this patchwork scheme, it is the State's substantive categorization of an activity that determines its level of regulation, not any \" neutral\" or \"generally applicable\" feature of that activity itself. Relevant here, the restrictions prescribed for \"places of worship\" limit attendance at in -person worship services as follows: (1) at the most severe, in Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, designated to be \"Tier 1\" risks for COVID -19 spread ,3 no in-person worship services may be held; (2) in Tier 2 counties, worship services may be held with no more than 25% of a building's capacity or 100 persons in attendance, whichever is fewer; (3) in Tier 3 counties, worship services can be held with no more than 50% of a building's capacity or 200 persons in attendance, whichever is fewer; and, finally, (4) in Tier 4 counties, worship services can be held with no more than 50% of a building's capacity, with no additional cap on attendance. State of California, Covid -19 Blueprint Activity and Business Tiers 1 (last updated Sept. , 2020), -Framework - September_2020.pdf [hereinafter \" Blueprint Tiers\"]. Critically, these same parameters do not apply broadly to all activities that might appear to be conducted in a manner similar to religious services \u2014for example, educational events, meetings, or seminars. Instead, each of these (and many other potentially similar) activities is regulated entirely separately from, and often more leniently than, religious services. See Industry Guidance , supra (providing restrictions separately governing institutes of higher education , museums, theaters, and schools); see also, 3 The State assigns each county to one of four tiers based on the recently documented number of COVID- 19 cases in the county. The assignments are regularly reviewed and, as infection numbers change, a county may be moved up or down the State's tiers. DktEntry: 26, of 197 e.g., State of California, COVID -19 Essential Workforce (last updated Sept. 22, 2020), https://covid19.ca.gov/essential exempt from other COVID-19 restrictions\u2014 \"academies and training facilities and courses for the purposes of graduating students and cadets that comprise the essential workforce for all identified critical sectors\"). Indeed, even non- worship activities conducted by or within a place of worship are not subject to the attendance parameters outlined above. See Cal. Dep't of Pub. Health , COVID -19 Industry Guidance: Places of Worship and Providers of Religious Services and Cultural Ceremonies 3 (July 29, 2020) [hereinafter \" Places of Worship Guidance \"]. In sum, the restrictions on religious worship services that Harvest Rock Church challenges here apply because \u2014and only because \u2014the activities they wish the host and partake in have been identified, substantively, as \"religious \" or \"worship \" services. B California contends that the many idiosyncratic lines it has drawn between activities within the State are not actually tied to the substantive content of those activities but instead reflect the State's expert judgment regarding the risk that each activity presents of spreading COVID -19. The majority accepts the State's characterization, insisting that \"the Governor offered the declaration of an Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, expert . . . in support of the claim that the risk of COVID- 19 is elevated in indoor congregate activities, including in- person worship services. \" Maj. at 3 . The problem, however, is that the very features that California's expert identified as especially dangerous in religious worship appear to have been ignored by the State in its decision to all ow numerous other activities to occur, even though they self - evidently exhibit the same features. California's epidemiological expert , Dr. James Watt, declared that the State determined church attendance to be particularly risky because: (1) gatherings of \"people from different households\" increase the risk of spreading the virus; (2) there have been \"multiple reports\" of COVID -19 spread resulting from religious events; (3) the virus is more likely to spread \"when people are in close contact or proximity wi th one another (within about six feet)\"; (4) the risk of transmission increases in groups where people speak, chant, shout, and sing in close proximity indoors; and (5) gat herings with \"longer duration\" increase the opportunity for the virus to spread. In his declaration, Dr. Watt distinguished the threat posed by religious services from the supposedly lesser threat posed by shopping in a store or working in an office where, according to him (but with no evidence or expertise in support),4 interp ersonal e ncounters are much briefer or more easily regulated. 4 At oral argument on this motion, counsel for the State conceded that Dr. Watt is not qualified as an expert to opine on what takes place at religious worship services or how people interact there as opposed to in other settings of public life. Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 12 of 199 1 The first flaw in the majority's uncritical acceptance of this \"evidence\" supporting California's sever e restrictions on church attendance is that the bulk of the identified risk factors have already been addressed by other measures imposed by the State . In those counties where indoor worship is actually allowed to take place , congregants must observe six -foot distancing, must wear masks, and may not sing or chant. See gene rally Places of Worship Guidance , supra . With such measures in place, Dr. Watt's professed concerns about physical proximity and vocal projections fall flat. How would the State distinguish a physically distanced, masked, and silent congregation sitting in a church from any other setting where the same number of people are present under the same roof for any other purpose? We do not know the answer, and I question whether the State could supply one that is neutral as to the pr actice of religion. 2 More c entrally, e ven if we were to accept Dr. Watt's assertion that the State has reason to find religious services more dangerous than activities like shopping or working in an office, the glaring problem for the State is that it has offered no evidence to support the notion that the myriad other activities which are less restricted than religious services are somehow safer by these same parameters. The State more freely allows a n abundance activi ties to take plac e which, on their Case: 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 13 of 1910 face, share the same risk factors that Dr. Watt identified as so concerning about church attendance, including: having one's hair cut and styled at a salon ;5 getting a manicure or pedicure ;6 working in a warehouse, food- production facility, or meatpacking plant ;7 playing , coaching , or broadcasting professional sports (including participating in games, practices, workouts, film sessions, and large team meetings) ;8 attending college classes;9 filming a television show or movie ;10 5 Barbershops and hair salons may open in all counties, without limitations on the number of people who may be present. See Blueprint Tiers , supra , at 1. 6 As of September 22, 2020, nail salons may open in all counties, without limitations on the number of people who may be present. See Blueprint Tiers, supra , at 2. 7 All of these facilities have been designated as \"essential critical infrastructure, \" and they may operate in all counties, without limitations on the number of people who may be present. See Blueprint Tiers, supra , at 1; Essential Workforce , supra . 8 In all counties, professional sports may take place without restrictions on the number of people present (but with no fans in attendance). See Blueprint Tiers, supra , at 5; Industry Guidance , supra . 9 In all counties at least some courses , like laboratory sciences and studio arts, may be conducted indoors, without limitations on the number of people present. See Industry Guidance , supra . 10 California has deemed \"entertainment industries, studios, and other related establishments\" to be \" essential critical infrastructure,\" and suc h businesses may open in all counties, without restriction on the number of people in attendance. See Blueprint Tiers, of 1911 exercising at the gym ;11 or washing clothes at a laundromat.12 All of these activities involve gatherings of people from different households for extended periods of time \u2014in many cases, hours on end. Man y are carried out in close proximity with others including some \u2014like playing sports , receiving a haircut, getting a manicure, or acting out a scene in a movie \u2014that simply cannot be undertaken while also practicing six-foot social distancing and wearing a mask. Some involve speaking loudly or shouting\u2014for example, on an indoor television studio set filled with actors projecting lines and directors barking orders or in an indoor practice facility or locker room filled with dozens of professional athletes and coaches shouting instructions to each other \u2014which (unlike singing in a church) the State h as permitted to continue . And some have been widely reporte d to have resulted in significant outbreaks across the country, a fact the State itself acknowledges. See Cal. Dep't of Health, COVID -19 Industry Guidance: Food Packing and Processing 1 (July 29, 2020) (\"There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, [including at] hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, 11 Although fitness centers must close in Tier 1 counties, at Tiers 2, 3, and 4 they may open at 10%, 25%, and finally 50% capacity respectively, with no additional cap on attendance like that imposed on churches. See Blueprint Tiers, supra , at 3 . Thus, in a Tier 2 or 3 county, a fitness center with a capacity greater than 1,000 people would be allowed to admit more people than would a church of the same size. 12 Laundromats are designated as \"essential critical infrastructure \" and may open in all counties, without limitations on the number of people who may be present See Blueprint Tiers, 26, Page 15 of 1912 food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. \"); see also, e.g., Anna Stewart, et al., Why Meat Processing Plants Have Become COVID -19 Hotbeds , CNN -intl/index.html ; Brady Dennis & Chelsea Janes, Coronavirus Outbreak in Major League Baseball Casts Pall Ove r Other Reopenings, Washington Post (July 28, 2020) , https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/28/coronavirus -outbreaks- baseball -schools . Yet, despite sharing these supposedly critical features of church attendance, these activities are all more open and available to Californians. If the reason is based in some other neutral assessment of disease spread, it has not been provided to us in this case. 3 The majority ma kes much of the fact that, at this point, the State has imposed the same attendance restrictions on some secular \"congregate\" activities such as attending some academic lectures or going to see a movie in a theater. Maj. at 3. But the majority cannot dispute that not all such activities are so tightly restricted\u2014 such as participating in a college class in a laboratory or studio setting or attending a team meeting or film -review session in the auditorium of a professional sports facility. More to the poin t, even if it is true that the State has similarly regulated some congregate activities with analogous risks of disease Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 16 of 1913 spread, that does not end our inquiry. Indeed, \"it does not suffice to point out that some [comparable] secular businesses . . . are su bject to the [same restrictions],\" if the State cannot also explain why so many other comparable secular businesses have been treated more favorably. Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley , 140 S. Ct. at 2613 -14 (Alito, J., dissenting); see also id. at 2614 (\"The l egal question is not whether religious worship services are all alone in a disfavored category, but why they are in the disfavored category to begin with.\" (citing Emp't Div., Dep't of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 884 (1990))). Thus, the State cannot evade the Free Exercise Clause merely by linking its severe restrictions on worship attendance to those imposed on one or two categor ies of comparable secular activity; it must also justify its decision to t reat more favorably a host of other comp arable activities which so evidently raise the State's same expressed concerns about disease spread. C Finally, we cannot overlook the fact that the State's restrictions on houses of worship explicitly exempt on-site non-religious activities from the strict attendance restraints . California's guidelines for place s of worship warn of the supposed danger in individuals coming together specifically \"to practice a personal faith,\" and they make clear that the restrictions on places of worship do not apply to non- worship activities including \"food preparation and service, delivery of items to Case: 20-55907, 10/01/2020, ID: 11843942, DktEntry: 26, Page 17 of 1914 those in need, childcare and daycare services, school and educational activities, in- home caregiving, counseling, office work, and other activities that places and organizations of worship may provide .\" Places of Worship Guidance , supra , at 3. Thus, California's framework w ould plainly permit a church in a Tier 1 county to host a group of people for some non -religious purpose , but the same church would be prohibited f rom hosting an event for the same people in the same setting for the same length of time simply if it were for purposes of religious worship . It is difficult to conceive of a more obvious form of discrimination against religious activity than that. III Because Har vest Rock Church is likely to succeed on the merits of its free - exercise challenge, it follows that the balance of har dships also tips in its favor. Without an injunction, the church and its congregants will be prohibited from exercising their First Amendment freedoms\u2014 the loss of which, \"for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" In re Dan Farr Prods. , 874 F.3d 590, 597 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted) .

BACKGROUND Plaintiff s challeng e the constitutionality of orders issued by Governor Newsom to slow the spread of COVID -19. On August 12, 202 0, the Court orally denied Plaintiffs ' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction , (Dkt. No. 4 ,) during a telephonic hearing. (Dkt. No. 42). On September 2, 2020, the Court issued a written order to the same effect. (Dkt. No. 52.) Plaintiffs appeal ed the denial to the Ninth Circuit. (\"Notice of Appeal,\" Dkt. No. 5 0). Plaintiffs filed this Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal on August 21, 2020. (Dkt. No. 44.) Concurrently, they filed a declaration of Pastor Che Ahn to supplement the record and authenticate a letter received by Harvest Rock Church on August 18, 2020, which was also submitted as new evidence . (Dkt. No. 45.) On August 24, 2020, Governor Newsom filed objections to the new evidence submitted by Plaintiffs . (Dkt. No. 46.)

No. 4) Before the Court is a Motion for Prelimina ry Injunction filed by Plaintiffs Harvest International Ministry, Inc. and Harvest Rock Ch urch, Inc. (\"Motion,\" Dkt. No. 4.) The Court held a telephonic hearing on the Motion on August 12, 2020. After considering the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Mot ion, the Court DENIES the Motion. I. BACKGROUND On July 17, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their compl aint against Defendant California Governor Gavin Newsom. (\"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1.) Th e Complaint alleges six causes of action: (1) Violation of Free Exercise Clause of First Am endment to U.S. Constitution; (2) Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Assembly Clause; (3 ) Violation of Free Speech Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (4) Violation of Establishment Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (5) Violation of Equal Protecti on Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution; and (6) Violation of the Gua rantee Clause of the U.S. Constitution. On July 18, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Mo tion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. (\"Motion,\" Dkt. No. 4. ) Defendant opposed th e Motion on August 3, 2020. (\"Opposition,\" Dkt. No. 31.) In support of the Opposition, Defendant filed the Declaration of Seth Goldstein and the Decl aration of James Watt, M.D. (\"Goldstein Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 53 Filed 09/02/20 Page 1 of 5 Page ID #:725Page 2 of 5 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk iv Declaration,\" Dkt. No. 31-1; \"Wa tt Declaration,\" Dkt. No. 31-2.) Plaintiffs replied in support of the Motion on August 7, 2020.1 (\"Reply,\" Dkt. No. 37.) II. LEGAL STANDARD \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction mus t establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable har m in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an in junction is in the public interest.\" Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, I nc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy; it is never awarde d as of right.\" Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008) (citations omitted). An injunction is binding only on parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees and attorn eys and those \"in active concert or participation\" with them. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d). Under the Ninth Circuit's \"sliding scale\" a pproach to preliminary injunctions, the four \"elements of the preliminary injunction test are balanced, so that a stronger showing of one element may offset a weaker showing of another.\" All for The Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). Th us, \"a preliminary injunction could issue where the likelihood of success is such that serious questio ns going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in [plaintiff's] favor.'\" Id. at 1131- 32 (internal quotation omitted). Put differently, \"'serious questions going to the merits' and a hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, as suming the other two elements [likelihood of irreparable injury and public interest] of the Winter test are also met.\" Id. at 1132. Regardless of the strength of its showings on the other factors, a plaintiff may not obtain a preliminary injunction unless he or she establishes that irrepara ble harm is likely to result in the absence of the requested injunction. Id. at 1135. III. DISCUSSION COVID-19 has killed over 10,000 California residents and infected more than half a million. 2 The disease spreads via respiratory drop lets and\u2014without a known vaccine or cure\u2014 the best way to slow COVID-19's spread is through social distancing measures. (Watt Declaration \u00b6 16.) To slow the spread of COVID-19, the Govern or has issued a series of orders (\"Orders\") restricting certain activities and mandating distanci ng and hygiene protocols for others. As the pandemic has evolved, so too has the scope of the Orders. (Complaint, Exhibits A-M.) The Orders currently ban indoor religious services in co unties that have been on a watchlist for three consecutive days or more. (Complaint, Exhibit M.) Outdoor services can take place without 1 Plaintiffs moved for an extension to th e 12-page limit for reply briefs. (\"Reply Request,\" Dkt. No. 38.) The Reply Request is unopposed.

Plai ntiffs seek to enjoin enforcement of the Orders' ban on indoor religious services, arguing that th e ban violates the Free Exercise, Establishment and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. (See Motion.) A. Free Exercise The Orders restrict indoor religious services. (Complaint, Exhibit M.) They also restrict \"comparable secular gatherings, including lectur es, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports, and theatrical performances.\" South Bay Unite d Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613-14 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., concurring); see also Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church v. Pritzker, 962 F.3d 341, 346 (7th Cir. 2020); (\"[Worship services] seem most like other congregate functions that occur in auditoriums, such as concerts and movies. Any of these indoor activities puts members of multiple families close to one another for extended periods, while invisible droplets containing the virus may linger in the air.\") Because religious activities are only restricted similarly to or less than comparable non-religious activities, the Orders are neutral on their face and in application. See Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794 F.3d 1064, 1079 (9th Cir. 2015) (holding that a law is only fatally underinclusive if it prohibits religious conduct but not \"comparable secular conduct\"). Plaintiffs argue that the Orders are not neutral in application because they restrict indoor religious services but not outdoor protests. (R eply at 1.) But because indoor activities carry a much greater risk of COVID-19 spread, indoor re ligious services are not comparable to outdoor protests. Accordingly, how the Orders treat outdoor protests is irrelevant to whether the Orders' restriction on indoor religious services is constitutional. Likewise, whether the Governor encouraged outdoor protests that violated earlier stay-at- home orders is irrelevant. (See Motion at 3-7.) Plaintiffs make no allegation that the Governor enforced restrictions on indoor re ligious services while encouraging comparable secular indoor activities. See Stormans, 794 F.3d at 1083; Storm 1109, 1125 (9th Cir. 2009).3 Even if the Governor did encourage the pr otests in violation of earlier stay-at-home orders\u2014which Plaintiffs fail to present any evid ence of\u2014as outdoor activities, the protests are not equivalent to indoor religious services.4 3 At the hearing, Plaintiffs' counsel argued t hat he believed that outdoor protests were in fact riskier than indoor religious services. Plai ntiffs' counsel, however, is not an expert on disease spread. And Plaintiffs have failed to submit any expert testimony supporting this proposition. Moreover, the Governor's determi nation that indoor activities carry the greatest risk is entitled to deference. See Marshall v. Un ited States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974) (holding that state officials should be awarded broad la titude when they \"undertake[] to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties.\") 4 The only evidence Plaintiffs submit in favo r of the Motion is their verified Complaint. Thalheimer v. City of San Diego, 645 F.3d 1109, 1116 (9th Cir. 2011) (\"A verified complaint may be treated as an affidavit, and, as such, it is evidence that may support injunctive relief.\") (continued . . . ) Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document Filed 09/02/20 Page 3 of 5 Page ID #:727Page 4 of 5 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk iv Plaintiffs additionally contend that the Orders are discriminatory because they permit Plaintiffs to distribute food and provide ind oor shelter\u2014activities that Plaintiffs argue are comparable to indoor religious se rvices. But Plaintiffs fail to provide any concrete information about the nature of these allegedly permissible activities, only stating vaguely that \"member churches in California have programs that prov ide food support for the hungry, financial and ministry support for those in need, and also biblical and social-service-type counseling for members of their communities throughout Calif ornia.\" (Complaint \u00b6 55.) Without more, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that these activities are anything like indoor worship. And the Court concludes they likely are not: distributing f ood at a church is analogous to a grocery store, not an indoor event such as a concert. Finally, th e Governor has determined that these activities are essential services, and therefore must be exe mpted from other guidelines for the health and safety of California residents\u2014a determination whi ch is entitled to this Court's deference. Finally, the restriction on indoor chanting and singing applies equally to religious events and secular events. Plaintiffs argue that this law applies unequally becau se religious singing is more likely to occur indoors than singing at prot ests. A law is not discriminatory simply because it burdens religious practice greater than secula r activities, so long as religious activities are treated the same as comparable secular activities. Again, because indoor secular singing is restricted to the same extent that indoor religious singing is restricted, the Orders are neutral in application. Because the Orders restrict indoor religious se rvices similarly to or less than comparable secular activities, it is subject to rational basis review, which it easily passes: by limiting certain activities, the Orders reduce person-to-person cont act, which in turn furthers the interest of reducing COVID-19 spread. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their Free Exercise Claim. B. Establishment Claim Plaintiffs argue that Defendant violated the Establishment Clause by subjecting religious institutions to disparate treatment. (Motion at 21-22.) But, as the Court concluded above, the Orders treat religious services the same as compar able secular activities. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their Establishment Clause Claim. // // However, a verified complaint is treated as Plain tiffs' own affidavit. In this case, because the Complaint is verified by Che Ahn, Pastor of Plaintiff Harvest Rock Church and President of Plaintiff Harvest International Ministries, it func tions as Mr. Ahn's affidavit. However, the Complaint fails to establish Mr. Ahn's foundatio n for any assertions other than those directly related to Harvest Rock Church and Harvest Inte rnational Ministries. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to establish a factual basis for their allegations regarding the protests, Defendant's alleged statements, and scientific facts related to the spread of COVID-19, among other things.

Free Speech Claim Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Orders are content-based restrictions on speech. However, they fail to explain how they are content based. And the Court concludes they are not: the Orders restrict activities based on the locatio n and nature of the gathering, rather than the content of the speech at those gatherings. Accord ingly, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their Free Speech Claim. Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the me rits of their claims. Accordingly, the Court need not consider the remaining factors. IV. CONCLUSION For the reasons above, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion. IT IS SO ORDERED.

Harvest Rock's attorney does not certify in writi ng that he made any efforts to give notice of the Complaint or the Motion. ( See Mot.) The only communicati on with opposing counsel the Court finds in Harvest Rock's filings is a July 16 prelitigation \"demand letter,\" demanding rescission of the various orders by July 17 at 10:00 Pacific ti me, attached as an exhibit to the Verified Complaint. ( See Compl. \u00b6 151, Ex.

R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)(B). As Harvest Rock fails to satisfy the requirement s for a TRO without notice, the Court DENIES Harvest Rock's Motion for a TRO.

In their Prayer for Relief, infra , and in the contemporaneously filed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), Plaintiffs seek a TRO and preliminary injunction restraining enforcement against Plaintiffs of the various COVID -19 orders issued by Governor Newsom and other State officials \u2014 \u2014Prohibiting gathering for any indoor worship services in over 30 counties in California (including those where many of Plaintiffs' churches are located) and, in the counties where indoor worship is not totally prohibited, prohibiting gathering for indoor worship with 101 or more individuals , or at over 25% c apacity (whichever is lower) ; \u2014Prohibiting singing or chanting during religious worship in counties where indoor worship remains permissible ; \u2014Prohibiting gatherings inside private homes for small -group Bible studies and worship services ; and Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 2 of 74 Page ID #:2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 \u2014Imposing discriminator y and disparate prohibitions on the types of activit ies that Plaintiffs may engage in at their own c hurch buildings , as the orders allow Plaintiffs to feed the hungry, cloth e the naked, house t he homeless, and provide other material social services to an unl imited number of individuals with unlimited volunteers in a single church building, but the Orders prohibit Plaintiffs from engaging in a religious worship service with th e same individuals in the same church building , on pain of criminal penalties . A TRO and preliminary injunction are necessary to protect these vitally important and constitutionally protected liberties, even in the midst of disease. 2. Additionally, while the Governor has unilat erally and significantly restrict ed the number of individuals permitted to \"gather\" in Plaintiffs' churches, he has imposed no similar restrictions on the untold thousands of protesters who have gathered all throughout California cities with no threat of c riminal sanction, and no social dis tancing or restrictions whatsoever. And, the Governor explicitly encouraged such large gatherings of protesters while condemning churches for signing hymns in their churches. 3. At around the same time that Governor Newsom 's Executive Orders and the State's P ublic Health Orders regarding COVID -19 were being used to threaten criminal sanctions on Plaintiffs' pastor s, officials in other jurisdictions had similarly threatened to impose criminal sanctions on other religious gathe rings. Twice in two weeks t he Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals enjoined enforcement of executive orders like the Governor's orders, determining that restrictions on drive -in and in -person worship services violate the First Amendment. See Roberts v. Neace , 958 F.3d 409 (6th Cir. 2020) ( Maryville Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear , 957 F.3d 610 (6th Cir. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 3 of 74 Page ID #:3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2020) (holding plaintiffs likely to succeed on merits of First Amendment and Kentucky RFRA claims for both drive -in and in-person services). Also, in First Pentecostal Church v. City of Holly Springs, Miss. , 959 F.3d 669 (5th Cir. 2020), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an IPA to a Mississippi church, enjoining enforcement of the Mississippi Governor's order restricting worshi p. 4. In Roberts , the Sixth Circuit granted an IPA enjoining the Kentucky Governor from enforcing executive orders prohibitin g a church's in -person worship services when \"serial exemptions for secular activities pose comparable public health risks.\" 958 F.3d at 414. In determining the plaintiffs' likely success on the merits of their free exercise claims, the court recognized, \" On one side of the line, a generally applicable law that incidentally burdens religious practice usually will be upheld.\" Id. at 413 (citing Emp't Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 879 -79 (1990)). But, the court concluded the Kentucky orders \"likely fall on the prohibited side of the line,\" where \"a law that discriminates against religious practices usually will be invalidated because it is the rare law that can be 'justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest.'\" Id. (quot ing Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520 , 553 (1993) ). 5. Expanding on the problems with Kentucky's or ders, the court explained, Do the four pages of exceptions in the orders, and the kinds of group activities allowed, remov e them from the safe harbor for generally applicable laws? We think so. As a rule of thumb, the more exceptions to a prohibition, the less likely it will count as a generally applicable, non -discriminatory law. At some point, an exception -ridden policy tak es on the appearance and reality of a system of individualized exemptions, the antithesis of a neutral and generally applicable polic y and just the kind of state action that must run the gauntlet of strict scrutiny . Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 4 of 74 Page ID #:4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Id. at 413 -14 (cleaned up) (emphasis add ed). 6. Continuing, the court reasoned, \"Assuming all of the same precautions are taken, why can someone safely walk down a grocery sto re aisle but not a pew? And why can someone safely interact with a brave deliverywoman but not with a stoic minister? The C ommonwealth has no good answers.\" Id. at 414. Thus, the court rejected the Governor's suggestion \"that the explanation for these grou ps of people to be in the same area\u2014intentional worship \u2014creates greater risks of contagion than groups of people, say, in an office setting or an airport,\" id. at 416, further explaining, the reason a group of people go to one place has nothing to do with it. Risks of contagion turn on social interaction in close quarters; the virus does not care why they are there. So long a s that is the case, why do the orders permit people who practice social distancing and good hygiene in one place but not another for similar lengths of time? It's not as if law firm office meetings and gatherings at airport terminals always take less time than worship services. Id. 7. The Roberts court also rejected the notion that the Governor's orders were justified because congregants could simply worship online via Facebook, reasoning, Who is to say that every member of the congregation has access to the necessary technology to make that work? Or to say that every member of the congregation must see it as an adequate substitute for what it means when \"two or three gather in my Name,\" Matthew 18:20, or what it means when \"not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,\" Hebrews 10:25. [T]he Free Exercise Clause does not prot ect sympathetic religious practices alone. And that's ex actly what the federal courts are not to judge \u2014how individuals comply with their own faith as they see it. Id. at 415 (citation omitted). Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 5 of 74 Page ID #:5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 8. In awarding the injunction , the Roberts court brought into sharp relief the Kentucky Governor's disparate treatment o f churchgoers under his orders: Keep in mind that the Church and its congregants just want to be treated equally. . . . They are willing to practice social distancing. They are willing to foll ow any hygiene requirements. . . . The Governor has offered no good reason for refusing to trust the congregants who promise to use care in worship in just the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and laundromat workers to do the same . Come to think o f it, aren't the two groups of people often the same people \u2014going to work on one day and going to worship on another? How can the same person be trusted to comply with social -distancing and other health guidelines in secular settings but not be trusted to do the same in religious settings? The distinction defies expla nation, or at least the Governor has not provided one. Id. at 414 (emphasis added). 9. A week after the Sixth Circuit's Roberts decision, the Eastern District of North Carolina issued a TRO enjoin ing the North Carolina Governor from enforcing a 10-person limi t on religious worship because it violated the Free Exercise Clause. See Berean Baptist Church v. Cooper , No. 4:20 2514313 (E.D.N.C. May 16, 2020) [hereinafter Berean Baptist ]. In granting the TRO, the court noted upfront, \"There is no pan demic exception to the Constitution of the United States or the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment .\" 2020 WL 2514313, at *1 (emphasis added). 10. The North Carolina \"stay -at-home\" orders c hallenged in Berean Baptist provided exemptions from their 10 -person gathering limits for numerous \"Essential Business and Operations.\" Id. at *3. But, the North Carolina orders subjected worship services to a 10 -person limit that was not imposed on any of the myriad \"Essential\" businesses and activities. 2020 WL 2514 313, at *4. The Berean Baptist court observed Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 6 of 74 Page ID #:6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 that the uniquely restrictive 10 -person limit for worship gatherings \"represent[s] precisely the sort of 'subtle departures from neutrality' that the Free Exercise Clause is designed to prevent.\" Id. at *6 (quo ting Gillette v. United States , 401 U.S. 437, 452 (1971)). 11. The court observed further, Eleven men and women can stand side by side working indoors Monday through Friday at a hospital, at a plant, or at a package distribution center and be trusted to foll ow social distancing and hygiene guidance, but those same eleven men and women cannot be trusted to do the same when they worship inside together on Saturday or Sunday. \"The distinction defies explanation . . . .\" Id. at *8 (quoting Roberts , 958 F.3d at 414). 12. Thus, the court concluded, \"These glari ng inconsistencies between the treatment of religious entities and individuals and non -religious entities and individuals take [the orders] outside the 'safe harbor for generally applicable laws.'\" Id. (quoting Roberts , 958 F.3d at 413 ). 13. Ultimately, in co ncluding the North Carolina orders could not pass strict scrutiny, the Berean Baptist court recognized that the plaintiffs \"simply want the Governor to afford them the same treatment as they and their fellow no n-religious citizens receive when they work at a plant, clean an office, ride a bus, shop at a store, or mourn someone they love at a funeral.\" Id. at *9 (citing Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 546 (\"The proffered objectives are not pursued with respect to analogous n on-religious conduct, and those interests coul d be achieved by narrower ordinances that burdened religion to a far lesser degree.\")). Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 7 of 74 Page ID #:7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 14. In Louisville, Kentucky, the government threatened to use police to impose criminal sanctions on those individuals found i n violation of similar COVID -19 orders and thr eatened to impose various sanctions on individuals found in violation of such orders. The United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky found that the mere threat of such criminal sanction w arranted a TRO. See On Fire Christian Center, Inc. v. Fischer , No. 3:20 -cv-264-JRW, 2020 WL 1820249 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 11, 2020) [hereinafter On Fire ]. The On Fire TRO enjoined the Mayor of Louisville from \"enforcing, attempting to enforce, threatening to enfo rce, or otherwise requiring compliance with an y prohibition on drive -in church services at On Fire.\" Id. at *1 (emphasis added). 15. Additionally, the Governor of Kansas had imposed a similar restriction on religious gatherings in Kansas, stating that \"gatheri ngs\" of more than 10 individuals are prohibite d, including religious gatherings. On April 18, 2020, the United States District for the District of Kansas issued a TRO enjoining Kansas officials from enforcing its discriminatory prohibition on religious gat herings and required the government to treat \"religious\" worship services the same as other similar gatherings that are permitted. See First Baptist Church. v. Kelly , No. 20 -1102 -JWB, 2020 WL 1910021, *6 -7 (D. Kan. Apr. 18, 2020) [hereinafter First Baptist ]. The First Baptist TRO specifically stated t hat the government's disparate treatment of religious gatherings was a violation of the Free Exercise Clause because it showed that \" religious activities were specifically targeted for more onerous restrictions than comparable secular activities ,\" and that the churches had shown irreparable harm because they would \"be prevented from gathering Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 8 of 74 Page ID #:8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 for worship at their churches\" during the pendency of the executive order. Id. at *7 -8 (emphasis added). 16. In discussing th e Kansas orders , which imposed a 10-person limit on in - person gatherings, the court said that specifically singling out religious gatherings for disparate treatment while permitting other non -religious activities \"show[s] that these executive orders expres sly target religious gatherings o n a broad scale and are, therefore, not facially neutral,\" First Baptist , 2020 WL 1910021, at *7, and \u2014much like here \u2014 \"churches and religious activities appear to have been singled out among essential functions for stricter treatment . It appears to be the o nly essential function whose core purpose \u2014association for the purpose of worship \u2014had been basically eliminated.\" Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the court found that a TRO was necessary and that Kansas should be enjoined from e nforcing its orders' disparate te rms against churches. Indeed, \"it goes without saying that the government could not lawfully expressly prohibit individuals from meeting together for religious services.\" Id. at *6 (emphasis added). 17. Also, several courts hav e found that the government's ope n encouragement of protesters flouting the various COVID -19 gathering restrictions across the country and the concomitant refusal by government officials to impose similar threats of criminal sanctions upon such massive gat herings while simultaneously thre atening religious worship services that exceed the arbitrary numerical limitations represents a gross violation of the First Amendment. 18. The constitutional incongruity of Governor Newsom 's encouragement of protesters while r estricting worshippers was highli ghted by Judge Ho of the Fifth Circuit in his concurrence in Spell v. Edwards , 962 F.3d 175 (5th Cir. 2020), where the court Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 9 of 74 Page ID #:9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 dismissed as moot an appeal arising from a church's challenge to Louisiana's stay -at- home orders r estricting worship services to 10 people. 962 F.3d at 177 . Judge Ho first recounted, At the outset of the pandemic, public officials declared that the only way to prevent the spread of the virus was for everyone to stay home and away from each other. The y ordered citizens to cease all p ublic activities to the maximum possible extent \u2014even the right to assemble to worship or to protest Id. at 180-81 (Ho., J., concurring). 19. Then, he observed, \"But circumstances have changed. In recent weeks, officials have n ot only tolerated protests \u2014they h ave encouraged them . . . .\" Id. at 181. And he posed a question: For people of faith demoralized by coercive shutdown policies, that raises a question: If officials are now exempting protesters , how can they justify conti nuing to restrict worshippers? The answer is that they can't. Government does not have carte blanche, even in a pandemic, to pick and choose which First Amendment rights are \"open\" and which remain \"closed.\" Id. (emphasis added). 20. Judge Ho noted that, \"To survive First Amendment scrutiny , however, those orders must be applied consistently, not selectively. And it is hard to see how that rule is met here [in light] of the recent protests.\" Id. at 182. 21. He continued, \"It is common knowledge, and easily proved , that protesters do not comply with social distancing requirements. But instead of enforcing the Governor's orders, officials are encouraging the protests \u2014out of an admirable, if belated, respect for First Amendment rights.\" Id. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 10 of 74 Page ID #:10 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 22. As the Constitution deman ds, Justice Ho explained that: \"If protests are exempt from social distancing requirements, then worship must be too.\" Id. (emphasis added). 23. Of particular relevance to Plaintiffs' claims herein , Judge Ho cited a brief filed by the United States in another case against Governor New som in observing that \"California's political leaders have expressed support for such peaceful protests and, from all appearances, have not required them to adhere to the now -operative 100 -person limit . . . . It could raise First Amendment concerns if Cal ifornia were to hold other protests to a different standard .\" Id. (emphasis added). Indeed, the same principle Governor Newsom applies to protesters \"should apply to people of faith .\" Id. (emphasis added). 24. Much like the Governor he re, \"support for the prot ests reflects a commendable commitment to equality. But public officials cannot devalue people of faith while elevating certain protesters . That would offend the First Amendment \u2014not to mention the principle of equality for which th e protests stand.\" Id. at 183 (emphasis added). 25. As Judge Ho stated, \"The point here is that state and local officials gave [protesters ] the choice,\" to ignore the prohibitions on gathering. Id. \"Those officials took no action when protesters chose to ignor e health experts and viol ate social distancing rules. And that forbearance has consequences .\" Id. (emphasis added). 26. The consequences Judge Ho referred to are that , The First Amendment does not allow our leaders to decide which rights to honor and which to ignore. In law, as in li fe, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. In these troubled times, nothing should unify the American people more than the Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 11 of 74 Page ID #:11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 principle that freedom for me, but not for thee, has no place under our Constitution . Id. (emph asis added). 27. Similarly, as recounted in Soos v. , No. 1:20 -cv-651 (GLS/DJS), 2020 WL 3488742 (N.D.N.Y. June 26, 2020) , the Governor of New York and the New York City Mayor openly encouraged protesters gathering in large numbers in New York, 2020 WL 34 88742, *4 -5, while continuing to prohibit in -person religious gatherings. Id. at *5-6. 28. The Northern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of the \"ever changing maximum number of people\" for religious worship b ecause the disparate treatment for protesters as compared to religious congregants in worship service s violated the First Amendment. Id. at *8 (\"[I]t is plain to this court that the broad limits of that executive latitude have been exceeded.\"). 29. The court f ound t hat a restriction of 25% capacity for indoor worship services that is not applied equally to non -religious businesses and certainly not applied to protesters removes the law from general applicability and thus mandates strict scrutiny. Id. at *11. 30. With res pect to openly supporting protesters , rioters, and looters while imposing draconian restrictions on indoor religious worship services, the court noted that \"Mayor de Blasio's simultaneous pro -protest/anti -religious gatherings message . . . clearly un dermin es the legitimacy of the proffered reason for what seems to be a clear exemption, no matter the reason.\" Id., at *12. 31. Indeed, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio could have just as easily discouraged protests, short of condemning their message, in the Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 12 of 74 Page ID #:12 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 name of public health and exercised discretion to suspend enforcement for public safety reasons instead of encouraging what they knew was a flagrant disregard of the outdoor limits and social distancing rules. They could have also been silent. But, by acting as they did, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of special treatment. Id. at *12 (emphasis added). 32. Because the government in New York treated protesters differently and more favorably than relig ious g atherings, the court held that such disparate treatment violated the Free Exercise Clause and issued a preliminary injunction. Id. at *13. 33. The same result should obtain here. The Governor's orders impose disparately onerous prohibitions and numerical restrictions on religious gatherings in churches, and even on in-home Bible studies, worship meetings, and life groups . Moreover, the orders purport to dictate the manner in which Plaintiffs may engage in acceptable religious worship by prohibiting singing and chanting where indoor worship is allowed , and by allowing provision and receipt of approved social services by unlimited numbers in the same church buildings where religious worship services are limited numerically or prohi bited altogether. And t he Governo r has imposed these draconian restrictions on Plaintiffs while openly celebrating and encouraging mass gatherings for protests . The Constitution demands more and so should this Court. INTRODUCTION 34. Due to the unprecedented nature of COVID -19 and the health tragedy the disease has wrought on our great Republic and those victims suffering under its yoke, there are those who may find it \"tempting to hold that First Amendment rights should acquiesce to n ational security in this instance.\" Tobey v. Jones , 706 F. 3d 379, 393 (4th Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 13 of 74 Page ID #:13 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Cir. 2013). One could be forgiven for hastily reaching such a conclusion in such uncertain times, but \"our Forefather Benjamin Franklin warned against such a temptation by opining t hat those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a li ttle temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" Id. 35. When the great American experiment was first implemented, our revered Founders took pains to note that the Constitution \u2014and all of th e rights it recognized and enshrined \u2014was instituted \"in or der to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and ou r Posterity.\" U.S. Const. Pmbl. (emphasis added). To this very day, \"we continue to strive toward '[that] more perfect union.'\" Smith v. City of New Smyrna Beach , No. 6:110cv01110 -Orl-37KRS, 2013 WL 5230659, *1 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 16, 2013). That work is not easy, and governments can and sometimes do miss the mark. This is such a case. 36. Recognizing that times of crisis would arise, that such times might lead governments to seek to repress precious freedoms, and that the Republic's survival depended upon defeat ing such repressive instincts, the genius of our founding document is that it placed explicit protections into the text of the Bill of Rights. And, importantly, \"[o]ur Bill of Rights placed our survival on firmer ground \u2014that of freedom, not repression.\" Konigsberg v. State Bar of California , 366 U.S. 36, 79 (1961 ) (Black, J., dissenting). 37. During times of national crisis, such as the current uncertainty arising from COVID -19, \"the fog of public excitement obscures the ancient landmarks set up in our Bill of Rights.\" American Communist Ass'n, C.I.O. v. Douds , 339 U .S. 382, 453 (1950) Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 14 of 74 Page ID #:14 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 (Black, J., dissenting). But, where the fog of public excitement is at its apex, \"the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly.\" De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S . 353, 365 (1937). Without doubt, \"[t]herein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.\" Id. 38. It is beyond cavil that our commitment to our founding principles is most tested and best calculated during times of cris is and uncertainty. Indeed, \"[t]imes of crisis take the truest measure of our commitment to constitutional values. Constitutional values are only as strong as our willingness to reaffirm them when they seem most costly to bear .\" Hartness v. Bush , 919 F.2d 170, 181 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (Edwards, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Our willingness to reaffirm our staunch commitment to our fundamental freedoms is imperative to the very survival of the American experiment. For, \"[h]istory reveals that the init ial ste ps in the erosion of individual rights are usually excused on the basis of an 'emergency' or threat to the public. But the ultimate strength of our constitutional guarantees lies in the unhesitating application in times of crisis and tranquility ali ke.\" United States v. Bell , 464 F.2d 667, 676 (2d Cir. 1972) (Mansfield, J., concurring) (emphasis added). 39. Plaintiffs bring this case to restrain the troubling transgression of their fundamental and cherished liberties wrought by the imposition of Governor Newsom 's orders contrived from COVID -19. Plaintiffs seek not to discredit or discard the government's unquestionable interest in doing that task for which it was instituted \u2014 protecting the citizenry. But, as is often true in times of crisis, Plaintiffs respectful ly submit that the Governor has transgressed a line the Constitution does not permit. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 15 of 74 Page ID #:15 16 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Because of that, Plaintiffs bring this action to ensure that this Court safeguards the cherished liberties for which so many have fought and died. For, \"[i]f the p rovisio ns of the Constitution be not upheld when they pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be discarded.\" Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell , 290 U.S. 398, 483 (1934) (Sutherland, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs pray unto the Court that it not permit the cherished and fundamental liberties enshrined in the Constitution to be another tragic casualty of COVID -19. PARTIES 40.

Harvest Rock has and exercises sincere religious beliefs that it is to minister the Gospel of Jesus Christ to its members and attendees at its facilities, that it cannot fulfill its vital ministry and sincere religious beliefs without gathering together in person, and cannot effectively engage in its constitutionally protected free exercise of religion on the Internet. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 17 of 74 Page ID #:17 18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 49. Harvest Rock has and exercises sincere religious belie fs that a Church i s fundamentally a communal and associational body of Believers in Jesus Christ that must gather together in order to fulfill the vital requirements of scriptural commands. Put simply, Harvest Rock has and exercises sincere religious belie fs that failure to gather together in person for religious worship services in which its members and congregants may worship the Lord, receive biblical teaching, and minister to one another's needs is disobedience to the Lord for which they will be held divinely accountable. 50. In fact, Harvest Rock has and exercises a sincere religious belief that failure to abide by Scripture's command that it gather its congregants together to worship the Lord is disobedience to the Lord for which its pastors will be held divinely accountable . Harvest Rock has and exercises sincere religious beliefs that it must adhere to all scriptural commands, and that failure to do so will result in the strictest of divine judgment for its pastors and leaders. See Hebrews 3:17; James 3:1. 51. As part of its religious mission, Harvest Rock has a ministry at its church called the Hope Center, which is staffed by church leaders and volunteers. The Hope Center provides support for those with financial, familial, emotional, and spiritual needs in its communities . Harvest Rock has and exercises sincer e religious beliefs that Scripture commands it to feed the hungry, give water to the thirst y, clothe the naked, house the homeless, and counsel the afflicted. All of these ministries have been impacted by the Governor's COVID -19 Orders . 52. As part of the exer cise of its sincerely held religious beliefs, Harvest Rock's Church campuses also have numerous Life Groups, which meet in the homes of members Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 18 of 74 Page ID #:18 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 of the Church to worship together, engage in Bibl e study, fellowship with one another, and minister to the needs of each other . 53. Harvest Rock has and exercises sincere religious beliefs that it is to raise up disciples and launch reformers through families, for the purpose of advancing the Kingdom of God . Harvest Rock has and exercises a sincere religious belief that Life Groups are an essential way for the church to fulfill its mission and to foster a health y, vibrant, and growing Church community such that its members can gather together to grow in the Lord, mature in their faith, and under stand the Scriptures bett er. 54. Harvest International has 162 member churches in California, and each of these churches ha s and exercises the sincere religious beliefs that the church is to minister the Gospel of Jesus Ch rist to its members and attendees at its facilities, that it cannot fulfill its vital ministry and sincere religious beliefs without gathering together in person, and that it cannot effectively engage in its constitutionally protected free exercise of religion on the Internet. 55. Many of Harvest International's member churches in California have programs that provide food support for the hungry, financial and ministry support for those in need, and also biblical and social -service -type counseling for members o f their communities throughout California. These churches also have and exercise sincer e religious beliefs that Scripture commands them to feed the hungry, give water to the thirst y, clothe the naked, house the homeless, and counsel the afflicted.

Harvest International's member churches in California have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that a Church is fundamentally a communal and associational body of Believers in Jesus Christ that must gather together in order to fulfill the vital requirements of scriptural commands. Put simply, Harvest International's member churches in California have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that failure to gather together in person for religious worshi p services in which their members and congregants may worship t he Lord, receive biblical teaching, and minister to one another's needs is disobedience to the Lord for which they will be held divinely accountable. 58. In fact, Harvest International's member churches in Californi a have and exercise a sincere religious belief that failure to abide by Scripture's command that they gather together to worship the Lord, is a sin for which their Pastors will be held divinely accountable . Harvest International's member churches in California have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that they must adhere to all scriptural commands, and that failure to do so will result in the strictest of divine judgment for their pastors and leaders .

Hebrews 2:12 (KJV) (emphasis added) . 63. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercis e sincere religious beliefs that, in the current times of trouble and distress, they are to sing to the Lord even more and to sing aloud to Him. See Psalm 59:16 ( ESV ) (\"I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fort ress and a refuge in the day of my distress .\"). 64. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that they are to chant and shout to the Lord as well. See Psalm 33:3 (ESV) (\"Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the string s, with loud shouts .\" (emphasis added) ). 65. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religious beliefs , rooted in Scripture's commands ( e.g., Hebrews 10:25), that fo llowers of Jesus Christ are not to forsake the assembling of themselves tog ether, and that they are to do so even more in times of peril and crisis. Indeed, the entire purpose of the Church (in Greek \"ekklesia,\" meaning \"assembly\") is to assemble together Christians to worship Almighty God.

On July 1, 2020 the Governor issued a revised Guidance for Places of Worship. A true and correct copy of the \"July 1 Worship Guidance \" is attached hereto as EXHIBIT K and incorporated herein. 88. The July 1 Worship Guid ance largely mirrored the May 25 Worship Guidance, but imposed mandatory requirements on places of worship that were merely suggested in the prior version. 89. For example, t he July 1 Worship Guidance state s unequivocally: \"Places of worship must therefore dis continue singing and chanting activities and limit indoor attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees , whichever is lower .\" (Bold emphasis added). The July 1 Worship Guidance also restrict s outdoor worship services by requiring , \"[a]t a minimum, . . . strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of six feet between attendees from different households .\" 90. Thus, the July 1 Worship Guidance imposes numerical and size re strictions on both indoor and outdoor worship which are not impos ed on other \"Essential\" businesses and non-religious activities. 91. On July 6, 2020 the Governor issued yet another revised Guidance for Places of Worship.

The July 6 Worshi p Guidance retained the mandatory numerical restrictions for indoor and outdoor worship, but changed the singing and chanting prohibition to apply only indoors . 93. Each of the evolving Worship Guidance documents equated the COVID -19 risks at places of worship with the COVID -19 risks at \"Essential\" businesses and non- religious operations such as \"food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores ,\" all of which \"Essential\" entities are exempt from the unique nume rical restrictions and other prohibitions imposed on the core activities of places of religious worship. 94. On July 13, 2020, a fter permitting Plaintiffs and other houses of worship to reopen subject to the restrictions of the evolving Worship Guidance docume nts, and subject to obtainin g the approval of local officials who could tell them whether worship services were permissible at all , the Governor announced that 30 counties in the State were being returned to Stage 1 and that in-person worship services woul d no longer be permitted in any of those counties. 95. Also , on July 13, 2020, pursuant to the Governor's public announcement, the Public Health Officer issued a Public Health Order closing indoor operations throughout the state for businesses such as bars, pu bs, breweries, and restaurants, and ordering the additio nal closure, in counties on the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) County Monitoring List, of \"Gyms and Fitness Center s[,] Places of Worship [,] Protests [,] Offices for Non-Critical Infrastr ucture Sectors [,] Care [,] Hair and barbershops [, and] M alls\" (emphasis added) .

The July 13 Public Health Order \"sha ll remain in effect until [the Public Health Officer] de termine[s] it is appropriate to modify the order ,\" and it remains in effect. 97. The now 32 California counties on the County Monitoring List currently subject to the enhanced closures of t he July 13 Publ ic Health Order , which closures include places of worship , are: Alameda, Colusa, Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Imperial, Kings, Los Angeles, Madera, Marin, Merced, Monterey, Napa, Orange, Placer, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Berna rdino, San Diego, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo , Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tulare, Ventura, Yolo, and Yuba. C. THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER s DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PERMISSIBLE RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES AND IMPERMISSIBLE RELIGIOUS WORSHIP IN THE SAME BUILDING. 98. As alleged supra , the March 19 Stay-at-Home Order created expansive categories of business es and activities wholly exempt from the Order's stay-at-home mandate , subject only to social distancing. 99. These exempt activities include the provision of \" food, shelter, and social servi ces, and other necessities of life for economically disadvantaged or otherwise needy individuals \" from the CISA Guidance (EXHIBIT D , at 20), and the identically described provision of \" food, shelter, and social services, and other necessities of life for economically disadvantaged or otherwise needy individuals \" from the Governor's additional Essential Workforce Guidance (EXHIBIT G, at 23) .

Thus, under the Governor's orders, Plaintiffs and their churches may provide food for t he hungry, shelter for the homeless, counseling on unemployment benefits or other government assistance programs, family counseling, drug -addiction counseling, and any other social services for \"necessit ies of life ,\" and may do so in their Church buildings , without numerical restrictions on volunteers or recipients , subject only to social distancing . 101. But, in counties where Plaintiffs' campus and member churches are still permitted to gather at all, if they are feeding, clothing, housin g, or counseling 101 individuals (or over 25% of their building capacity), and at any point transition from providing material \"necessities of life\" through government -approved social services , to providing spiritual necessities of life \u2014according to sincer ely held religious bel iefs\u2014 through government -prohibited religious worship service s, for the same people, in the same building, the Governor's orders automatically apply, and Plaintiffs are subject to criminal penalties . 102. For each of Plaintiffs' campus and member churches in Cal ifornia counties subject to total closure for worship under the July 13 Public Health Order, they are still exempt for feeding, counseling, and even housing overnight an unlimited number of materially needy people in the same room, bu t if a pastor preaches a sermon for the spiritually needy among them and invites them to participate by singing a hymn, the exempt service becomes a prohibited religious worship service subject to criminal penalties \u2014no matter how many or how few participate in worship. 103.

D. THE GOVERNOR PUBLICLY AND UNEQUIVO CALLY SUPPORTED MASS PROTEST GAT HERINGS THAT VIOLATED HIS ORDERS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONDEMNING AND PROHIBITING RELIGIOUS WORSHIP SERVICES. 104.

G. LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNOR. 126. Despite Governor Newsom's insistence that in -person religious gatherings of any number of people indoors cannot continue in most of C alifornia, or at the requisite capacity limitations in the c ounties where worship is still allowed provided no singing or chanting takes place , the Governor has failed to consider other, substantially less restrictive alternatives to the absol ute prohibiti on and severe restrictions on religious gatherings. 127. Like California, t he State of Indiana has issued stay -at-home executive orders and required the closure of all so -called \"non -essential\" businesses without unnecessarily discriminating agains t religious g atherings.

A true and correct copy of the Alabama Ord er is attache d hereto as EXHIBIT O and incorporated herein. 129. The State of Arkansas has likewise exempted \"places of worship\" from its Executive Order 20 -13 imposing restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID -19, provided that they engage in adequate social distancing a nd personal hygiene practices. A true and correct copy of the Arkansas Executive Order is attached hereto as EXHIBIT P and incorporated herein. 130. The State of Connecticut has similarly shown that other, less restrictive alternatives are availabl e. In Executi ve Order No. 7N, Governor Ned Lamont permitted religious services to continue to meet, but limited their in -person gatherings to 50 people, as opposed to the six -person limit applicable to other gatherings. A true and correct copy of the Conne cticut Execut ive Order No. 7N is attached hereto as EXHIBIT Q and incorporated herein. 131.

The State of Florida has issued stay -at-home executive orders and required the closure of all so -called \"non -essential\" businesses without unnecessarily discriminating against religious gatherings.

In that Guidance, Texas notes that religious assemblies and houses of worship are \"essential services\" and that in -person gatherings are perm issible if social distancing and personal hygiene pr actices are followed. 136. Numerous other states have similarly permitted religious gatherings to be treated equally with non -religious gatherings , and have exempted them altogether from the restrictions being placed on their constitutionally protected exercise of religion. 137. As these other states have demonstrated, Governor Newsom can continue to pursue the State's objective of preventing the spread of COVID -19 without unnecessarily treating religious gatherings in a discriminatory manner, and the State has numer ous other, less restrictive alternatives available to it to do so. 138. Governor Newsom has neither tried without success nor considered and ruled out for good reason these less restrictive alternatives. 139. Gover nor Newsom has constitutionally permissible alternat ives available, but has failed to attempt to achieve the State's purported goals without unnecessarily interfering with constitutionally protected activities .

As a result of the Governor's orders, and blatantly selective enforcement of his orders , Plaintiffs have suffered and are suffering irreparable injury from the weight and threat of criminal enforcement of the Governor's orders against their churches, pastors, and worship attendees for merely engaging in res ponsibly distanced and sanitized religious worship services involving singing or chanting in the counties where indoor religious worship services are permitted but singing and chanting are prohibited . 144. As a result of the Governor's order, Plaintiffs have suffered and are suffering irreparable injury from being prohibited from engaging in their constitutionally protected rights of free exercise, assembly, and speech. 145. As a result of the Governor's orders , Plaintiffs have suffered and are suffering irreparable injury from the infringement of their constitutionally protected right to be free from government hostility toward religion. 146. As a result of the Governor's orders , Plaintiffs have suffered and are suffering irreparable injury from the infringement of their constitutionally protected right s to be free from excessive government entanglement with how Plaintiffs are permitted to engage in their religious exercise, what religious services Plaintiffs may offer to their members and the com munity, and what religious practices Plaintiffs may engage in during the worship services the Governor has permitted in certain counties in California. 147. As a result of the Governor's orders , Plaintiffs have suffered and are suffering irreparable injury by t he continuing threat of cr iminal sanctions against their Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 50 of 74 Page ID #:50 51 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 churches, pastors, and congregants for merely exercising their constitutionally protected freedoms. 148. Due to the explicit threats of the Governor's orders , Plaintiffs have been forced to self -censor, c ease their religious worsh ip services, cease certain vital practices in their religious services, and violate their sincerely held religious beliefs . 149. As a result of the Governor's orders, Plaintiffs have been forced to conduct their religious worship services (in counties where it is even permissible to have a worship service) in a manner prescribed by the government, which has told them how they may worship and prohibited them from singing and chanting which are a critical parts of Plaintiffs' religious exercise . 150. As a result of the Governor's orders, Plaintiffs have been prohibited from engaging in the critical ministries of home group Bible studies and programs because the Governor's orders prohibit them from leaving their homes for such gathe rings. I. PLAINTIFFS' ATTEMPTS TO SECU RE RELIEF WITHOUT JUDICIAL INTERVENTION WERE IGNORED AND FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN SUCH RELIEF WOULD BE FUTILE. 151. On July 16 , 2020, prior to the commencement of the instant action, Plaintiffs' counsel sent by e -mail a demand letter to Governor Newsom in whi ch Plaintiffs' counsel demanded, by 12:00 P.M. on July 17 , written confirmation that the Governor has withdrawn the prohibitions and restrictions on religious gatherings embodied in the Governor's orders , will allow i ndividuals to attend religious worship services at Plaintiffs' churches on equal terms as Californians are allowed to work at and patronize \"Essential\" businesses and non -religious operations provided certain social distancing and personal hygiene practice s are followed, will cease demanding Pl aintiffs' churches Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 51 of 74 Page ID #:51 52 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 conform their worship services to only those activities the Governor has approved, and will cease enforcement of any church gathering ban against members or attendees of Plaintiffs' worship services . A true and correct copy of the demand letter is attached hereto as EXHIBIT X. 152. The Governor responded to Plaintiffs' demand letter, through the Office of the California Attorney General, by letter dated July 17, 2020, in which the Governor refused to withdraw any of his current prohibitions or restrictions on indoor worship. A true a nd correct copy of the Governor's response is attached hereto as EXHIBIT Y. 153. Governor Newsom 's refusal to withdraw his discriminatory religious worship prohibitions and restrictions shows that Plaintiffs' irreparable injury to their constitutionally protect ed freedoms is ongoing. 154. Governor Newsom's flat refusal to withdraw his discriminatory religious worship prohibitions and restrictions also shows that notice and an opportunity to respond to this lawsuit would be fut ile prior to this Sunday's worship servic es at Plaintiffs' churches , which must proceed, if at all, under the weight and threat of criminal enforcement of the Governor's orders against Plaintiffs' churches, pastors, and attendees absent a TRO from this Cou rt. CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS COUNT 1 - THE GOVERNOR'S ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFFS' RIGHT S TO FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT 155. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-154 above . Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 52 of 74 Page ID #:52 53 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 156. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the State from abridging Plaintiffs' rights to free exercise of religion. 157. Plaintiffs have and exercise sincer e religious beliefs that Scripture is the infallible, inerrant word of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that they are to follow its teachings. 158. Plaintiffs have and exercise sincere religious beliefs , rooted in Scripture's commands ( e.g., Hebrews 10:25), that foll owers of Jesus Christ ar e not to forsake the assembling of themselves together, and that they are to do so even more in times of peril and crisis. Indeed, the entire purpose of the Church (in Greek \"ekklesia,\" meaning \"assembly\") is to assemble together Ch ristians to worship Almi ghty God. 159. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that they are to \"sing to the LORD\" and \"[d] eclare his glory among the nations .\" Psalm 96:1-2 (ESV). 160. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religio us beliefs that they are to \"make a joyful noise\" to the Lord, Psalm 95:1 (ESV), through singing and chanting His praises. 161. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that they are to \"sing to the LORD as long as I live.\" Psalm 104:33 (ESV). 162. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that not only are they to sing to the Lord, also to \"declare [His] name unto my brethren,\" and that \" in the midst of the church will [ they] sing praise\" to th e Lord. Hebrews 2:12 (KJV) (emphasis added). Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 53 of 74 Page ID #:53 54 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 163. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that, in the current times of trouble and distress, they are to sing to the Lord even more and to sing aloud to Him. See Psalm 59:16 (ESV) (\"I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress.\"). 164. Plaintiffs and their churches all have and exercise sincere religious beliefs that they are to chant and shout to the Lord as well. See Psalm 33:3 (ESV) (\"Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts .\" (emphasis added)). 165. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, target Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs by prohibiting or numerically restricting religious gatherings , by prohibiting singing and chanting in counties where religious worship services are permitted , and by imposing government -mandated restrictions on the types of religious activity Plaintiffs may exercise in their own buildings . 166. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, impermissibly burden Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs, co mpel Plaintiffs to either change those beliefs or to act in contradiction to them, and force Plaintiffs to choose between the teachings and requirements of their sincerely held religious beliefs in the commands of Scripture and the State's imposed value sy stem. 167. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, place Plaintiffs in an irresolvable conflict between c ompliance with the Governor's orders and their sincerely held religious beliefs.

The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, put subst antial pressure on Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs by ignoring the fundamental teach ings and tenets of Scripture concerning the assembling of believers. 169. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but rather specifically and discriminatorily target the religious beliefs, speech, assem bly, and viewpoint of Plaintiffs . 170. By treating mass gatherings of thousands of protesters differently from religious gatherings of substantially smaller numbers, the Governor has demonstrated his orders are not neutral. 171. By treating mass gatherings of thousa nds of protesters differently from religious gatherings of substantially smaller numbers, the Governor has demonstrated his orders are not generally applicable. 172. By treating mass gatherings of thousands of protesters differently from religious gatherings of substantially smaller numbers , the Governor has demonstrated his orders create a system o f individualized exemptions based upon the value the Governor places on religious and other activit ies being engaged in by residents of California. 173. By treating mass g atherings of thousands of protesters differently from religious gatherings of substantiall y smaller numbers , the Governor has demonstrated his orders create a religious gerrymander of based upon the value judgments of the Governor. 174. By treating mass gatheri ngs of thousands of protesters differently from religious gatherings of substantially smaller numbers , the Governor has demonstrated his orders are not being generally applied within California.

By permitting mass gatherings of thousands of protesters on m ore favorable terms than small religious gatherings comprising Plaintiff s' life groups and in-home Bible studies, the Governor has demonstrated that his orders impose substantially more burdensome restrictions on religious gatherings than on his approved n on-religious gatherings . 176. The Governor's orders , on their face and as app lied, constitute a substantial burden on Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs. 177. By prohibiting Plaintiffs' Churches from gathering at all (in some counties), from gathering with out adherence to certain numerical limitations (in other counties), and from engaging in certain religious activities that are not approved by the G overnor , the Governor has imposed an unconscionable and unconstitutional burden on Plaintiffs' religious exe rcise according to their sincerely held beliefs. 178. The State lacks a compe lling, legitimate, or rational interest in the Governor's orders ' application of different standards for churches and religious gatherings than those applicable to exempted businesses , non-religious entities , and protesters . 179. The State lacks even a rational basis to impose disparate treatment on Plaintiffs' permissible services (such as feeding, clothing, housing, and providing other necessities of life without numerical limitation) and its impermissible religious worship services (such as singing, chanting, and gathering together indoors for worship services) that all occur in the same building. 180. The Governor cannot claim a compelling , legitimate, or even rational interest in his orders when he has permitted and encouraged mass gatherings of thousands of Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 56 of 74 Page ID #:56 57 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 protesters to engage in the very activity he claims poses a massive danger to California if it takes place in Plaintiffs' churches, as that leaves an appreciable amount of purported damage d unrestricted. 181. Even if the Governor's orders were supported by a compel ling, legitimate, or even rational interest, they are not the least restrictive means or otherwise narrowly tailored to accomplish the government's purported interest. 182. The Governor's o rders , on their face and as applied, fail to accommodate Plaintiffs' religious exercise according to their sincerely held beliefs. 183. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, specifically target Plaintiffs' religious exercise according to their sincerely held beliefs and set up a system of individualized exemptions that permits certain other similarly situated businesses or non-religious entities to continue operations under certain guidelines while prohibiting religious gatherings, such as Plain tiffs' church and worship services, from operating with similar guidelines. 184. The Governor's orders also set up a system of individualized exemptions by specifically permitting protesters to gather in massive numbers (sometimes thousands) without threat of c riminal sanction or penalty while imposing draconian prohibitions on religious gatherings in Plaintiffs' churches. 185.

COUNT IV - THE GOVERNOR'S ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFFS' RIGHTS UNDER THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUS E OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT 222. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-154 above . 223. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohib its the government from establish ing a religion. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 62 of 74 Page ID #:62 63 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 224. The Establishment Clause also prohibits excessive government entanglement with religion. 225. The Establishment Clause also prohibits the government from showing hostility towards religion and prohibits showing f avoritism towards one religious s ect over another or between non -religion and religion. 226. The government -mandated prohibition s and restrictions on religious gatherings in the Governor's orders violates the Establishment Clause because the State of California thereby dictates the manner in w hich Christians and churches must worshi p or whether they may worship at all . 227. The Establishment Clause does not permit the State of California to dictate under penalty of criminal sanctions the manner, style, form, practic es, or sacraments of religious wo rship and thereby impose its own version of religious worship on every church and citizen of the State. 228. The State, through Governor Newsom 's Orders, is purporting to prescribe what shall be orthodox in matters of religious worship, and is thus running roug hshod over the Establishment Clause. See W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943) ( \"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politi cs, nationalism, religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\" (emphasis added) ). 229. The Governor's prohibition on singing and chanting during a religious worship servi ce is a n impermissible prescripti on for what shall be orthodox in matters of worship and religious belief.

The Governor's prohibition on in -home Bible studies, in -home life groups, and in -home worship services is an impermissible prescription for what shal l be orthodox in matters of worsh ip and religious belief. The Governor may not dictate how individuals gather together to worship the Lord, express their faith, minister to one another, and exercise their religious faith. 231. The Governor's orders , on their fa ce and as applied, display and pe rmit government officials to display impermissible hostility towards religious gatherings. 232. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, have permitted singing and chanting by mass gatherings of protesters while impo sing a total ban on singing or chanting during religious worship service s. 233. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, impermissibly show favoritism towards certain non -religious gatherings , such as protests , over religious gatherings. 234. The Governo r's express statements of support and encouragement of protesters while imposing draconian prohibitions and restrictions on Plaintiffs' worship services demonstrates the unquestionable government hostility toward Plaintiffs' religious gatherings and worshi p services. 235. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, violate the Establishment Clause because they excessively entangle the government with religion. 236. By setting up a system of permissible religious activities in Plaintiffs' church buildings (pr oviding food, shelter, clothing, or other necessities of life without numerical restriction) and impermissible religious activities in a worship service (gathering in any number or above a certain number for a service, singing, and chanting), th e Governor Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 64 of 74 Page ID #:64 65 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 has excessively entangled California with religious beliefs, teachings , and doctrine on proper expressions of faith in worship . 237. By setting up a system whereby thousands of individuals may gather to sing and chan t in protest without threat of cri minal sanct ion while small er groups of religious adherent s cannot gather to sing and chant as religious worship, whether in church or in in-home worship services , Bible studies, or life groups, the Governor has excessively entangled California with religio us beliefs, teachings, and doctrine on proper expressions of faith. 238. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, purport to inform religious adherents and believers how they may choose to worship, assemble together, or exercise their religious free doms. 239. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, purport to establish an acceptable method of religious practice and worship, place a numerical limitation on the scope of how such religious practice and worship may occur, and provide a government imprimatur for only certain forms of \"permissible\" worship. 240. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, demonstrate overt hostility to religious practice and worship that does not conform to government sanctioned religious exercises. 241. By explicitly and publi cly stating his belief that it was impossible for protesters to stay home instead of marching together by the thousands while continuing to call religious gatherings non -essential and impermissible, the Governor has demonstrated host ility towards those rel igious adherents that believe it is impossible and sinful for them to forsake the assembling of themselves together for worship.

COUNT V - THE GOVERNOR'S ORDERS VIOLATE PLAINTIFFS' RIGHT S TO EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT 244. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-154 above . 245. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees Plaintiffs the right to equal protection under the law. 246. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, are an unconstitutional abridgement of Plaintiffs' right to equal protection under the law, are not neutral, and specifically target Plaintiffs' and other religious gatherings for unequal treatment. 247. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, are an unconstitutional abridgment of Plaintiffs' righ t to equal protection becau se they permit the State to treat Plaintiffs differently from other similarly situated businesses , non-religious entities , and protesters on the basis of the religious content and viewpoint of Plaintiffs' gatherings. 248. The Governor 's orders create a system o f exempt categories that permit \"Essential\" businesses and activities, and protesters , to gather without restriction or threat Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 66 of 74 Page ID #:66 67 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 of criminal penalty while imposing disparate treatment on Plaintiffs' religious worship services. 249. By explicitly and publicly decl aring support for mass gatherings of protester s in flagrant violation of his own orders and asking that hey continue, while at the same time imposing draconian prohibitions on Plaintiffs' religious worship services, the Governor has created a class of proh ibited gatherings without any rational, legitimate, significant, or compelling interest. 250. The Governor's system of categories represents disparate treatment based upon classification s in violation equal protection. 251. The Governor's orders , on their face and a s applied, impermissibly discriminate between certain non -religious gatherings and religious gatherings. 252. The State lacks a compelling, significant, legitimate, or rational interest in the Governor's o rders' application of differ ent standards for churches a nd religious gatherings from those applicable to exempted businesses , non-religious activities , and protesters . 253. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, are not the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissib le government purpose sought to be served. 254. The Governor's orders , on their face and as applied, do not have a rational basis. 255.

Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-154 above . 259. Article IV, \u00a7 4 of the United States Constitution requires the United States to guarantee to every citizen in the nation a republican form of government. 260. The Guarantee Clause's distinguishing feature is that the republican form of government it guarantees is the right of the people to choose their own governmental administration and pass their ow n laws. 261. As interpreted by th e federal judiciary and prominent scholars, the Guarantee Clause mandates that the federal government guarantee a form of government for all citizens in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and exercised by elected officers re sponsible to such citizens. 262. The Governor's orders ' express, unilateral, and unequivocal exercises of purported executive authority over the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs deprive Plaintiffs of the right to select their own government administration, p ass their own laws, and Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1 Filed 07/17/20 Page 68 of 74 Page ID #:68 69 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 maintain a government administration directly responsible to the people, including by laws that are enacted by the legislature in constitutional recognition of the separation of powers. 263.

In addition, and in consultation with the Director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, I may designate additional sectors as critical in order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians. Pursuant to the authority under the Health and Safety Code 120125, 120140, 131080, 120130(c), 120135, 120145, 120175 and 120150, this order is to go into effect immediately and shall stay in effect until further notice. The federal government has identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination thereof. I order that Californians working in these 16 critical infrastructure sectors may continue their work because of the importance of these sectors to Californians' health and well-being. This Order is being issued to protect the public health of Californians. The California Department of Public Health looks to establish consistency across the state in order to ensure that we mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Our goal is simple, we want to bend the curve, and disrupt the spread of the virus. The supply chain must continue, and Californians must have access to such necessities as food, prescriptions, and health care. When people need to leave their homes or places of residence, whether to obtain or perform the functions above, or to otherwise facilitate authorized necessary activities, they should at all times practice social distancing. 91 Jq/zo20 SONIA Y.

Krebs Director Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) As the Nation comes together to slow the spread of COVID -19, on March 16th, the President issued updated Coronavirus Guidance for America. This guidance states that: \"If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule.\" The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) executes the Secretary of Homeland Security's responsibilities as assigned under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide strategic guidance, promote a national unity of effort, and coordinate the overall federal effort to ensure the security and resilien ce of the Nation's critical infrastructure. CISA uses trusted partnerships with both the public and private sectors to deliver infrastructure resilience assistance and guidance to a broad range of partners. In accordance with this mandate, and in collaboration with other federal agencies and the private sector, CISA developed an initial list of \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers \" to help State and local officials as they work to protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. The list can also inform critical infrastructure community decision -making to determine the sectors, sub-sectors, segments, or crit ical functions that should continue normal operations, appropriately modified to account for Centers for Disease Control (CDC) workforce and customer protection guidance. The attached list identifies workers who conduct a range of operations and services that are essential to continued critical infrastructure viability , including staffing operations centers, maintaining and repairing critical infrastructure, operating call centers, working construction, and performing management functions, among others. The industries they support represent, but are not necessarily limited to, medical and healthcare, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, law enforcement, and public works. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-4 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 11 Page ID #:86 We recognize that State, local, tribal, and territorial governments are ultimately in charge of implementing and executing response activities in communities under their jurisdiction, while the Federal Government is in a supporting role. As State and local communities consider COVID -19-related restrictions, CISA is offering this list to assist prioritizing activities related to continuity of operations and incident response, including the appropriate movement of critical infrastructure workers within and between jurisdictions. Accordingly, this list is advisory in natur e. It is not, nor should it be considered to be, a federal directive or standard in and of itself. In addition, the se identified sectors and work ers are not intended to be the authoritative or exhaustive list of critical infrastructure sectors and functions that should continue during the COVID -19 response . Instead, State and local officials should use their own judgment in using their authorities and issuing implementa tion directives and guidanc e. Similarly, critical infrastructure industry partners will use their own judgment, informed by this list, to ensure continued operations of critical infrastructure services and functions. All decisions should appropriately balance public safety while ensuring the continued delivery of critical infrastructure services and functions. CISA will continue to work with you and our partners in the critical infrastructure community to update this list as the Nation's response to COV ID-19 evolves. We also encourage you to submit how you might use this list so that we can develop a repository of use cases for broad sharing across the country. Should you have questions about this list, please contact CISA at CISA.CAT@cisa.dhs.gov.

Cert ain critic al infrastructure industri es have a sp ecial responsibility in these tim es to continue operations. This guidance and accompanying list are intended to support State, Local, and industry partners in identifying the critical infrastructure sectors and the essential workers needed to maintain the services and functions Americans depend on daily and that need to be able to operate resiliently during the COVID-19 pandemic response. This document gives guidance to State, local, tribal, and territorial jurisdictions and the private sector on defining essential critic al infrastructure workers. Promoting the ability of suc h workers to continue to work during periods of community restrict ion, access management, s ocial distancing, or closure orders/directiv es is crucial to community resilience and continuity of essenti al functions. CON SIDERA TIONS FOR GOVERN MENT AND BUSIN ESS This list was developed in consultation with federal agency partners, industry experts, and State and local officials, and is based on several key principles: 1.Response efforts to the COVID-19 pandemic are locally executed, State managed, and federally supported 2.Everyone should follow guidance from the CDC, as well as State and local government officials, regarding strategies to limit disease spread. 3.Workers should be encouraged to work remotely when possible and focus on core business activities. In- person, non-mandatory activities should be delayed until the resumption of normal operations. 4.When continuous remote work is not possible, businesses should enlist strategies to reduce the likelihood of spreading the disease. This includes , but is not necessarily limited to , separating staff by off-setting shift hours or days and/or social distancing. These steps can preserve the workforce and allow operations to continue. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-4 Filed 07/17/20 Page 3 of 11 Page ID #:88Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce CONNECT WITH US www.cisa.gov For more 5.All organizations should implement their busines s continuity and pandemic plans, or put plans in place if they do not exist. Delaying implementation is not advised and puts at risk the viability of the business and the health and safety of the employees. 6.In the modern economy, reliance on technology an d just -in-time supply chains means that certain workers must be able to access certain sites, facilities, and assets to ensure continuity of functions. 7.Government employees, such as emergency managers, and the business community need to establish and maintain lines of communication. 8.When government and businesses engage in discussions about critical infrastructure workers, they need to consider the implications of business operations beyond the jurisdiction where the asset or facility is located. Busin esses can have sizeable economic and societal impacts as well as supply chain dependencies that are geographically distributed. 9.Whenever possible, jurisdictions should align access and movement control policies related to critical infrastructure workers to lower the burden of workers crossing jurisdictional boundaries. IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKERS The following list of sectors and identified essential critical infrastructure workers are an initial recommended set and are intended t o be overly inclusive reflecting the diversity of industries across the United States. CISA will continually solicit and accept feedback on the list (both sectors/sub sectors and identified essential workers) and will evolve the list in response to stakeho lder feedback. We will also use our various stakeholder engagement mechanisms to work with partners on how they are using this list and share those lessons learned and best practices broadly. We ask that you share your feedback, both positive and negative on this list so we can provide the most useful guidance to our critical infrastructure partners.

(See https://covid19.ca.gov/stay -home -except- for-essential-needs/ .) I then set out California's pa th forward from th is \"Stay-at-Home \" Order in California's Pandemic Roadmap https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp - content/uploads/2020/05/5.4.20- Update -on-Californias -Pandemic- Roadmap.pdf .That Roadmap identifies four stages of the pandemic: safety and preparation (Stage 1) , reopening of lower -risk workplaces and other spaces (Stage 2) , reopening of higher -risk workplaces and other spaces (Stage 3), and finally an easing of final restrictions lead ing to the end of the stay at home order (Stage 4) . Today, COVID -19 continues to present a significant risk to the health of individuals throughout California . There are confirmed cases of the virus in 54 of the 58 counties across the S tate, and e ach day over the past two weeks over one thousand new cases have been confirmed in California and dozens of people have lost their lives due to the virus. However, o wing to Californians' mitigation efforts, statewide data currently demonstrates stable rates of new infections and hospitalizations, the maintenance of surge capacity, and an improved ability to test, contact trace, isolate, and provide support to individuals exposed to COVID -19. As Stat e Public Health Officer, I have determined that the statewide data now supports the gradual movement of the entire state from Stage 1 to Stage 2 of California's Pandemic Resilience Roadmap. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-8 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 3 Page ID #:135Gradual movement into Stage 2 is intended to re introduce activitie s and sectors in a phased manner and with necessary modifications, in order to protect public health and result in a lower risk for COVID -19 transmission and outbreak in a community . Such deliberate phasing is critical to allowing the State to protect the public , and to mitigate and manage the impact of the re-openings , such that our health care delivery system has the capacity to respond t o potential increased demands. Differences across the state in the prevalence of COVID - 19, as well as testing rates , containment capability , and hospital capacit y, have resulted in differences among local health jurisdictions' ability to safely progress through the various s tages . The low and stabl e data reported by some local health officers in their local health jurisdictions , combined with sufficient COVID - 19 preparedness, justifies allow ance for some variation in the speed with which some local health jurisdictions will be able to move through the phases of Stage 2. NOW, THEREFORE, I as State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health, order: 1. All local health jurisdictions in the state may begin gradual movement into Stage 2 , as set forth in this Order, effective on May 8, 2020; however, a local health jurisdiction may implement or continue more restrictive public health measures if the jurisdiction's Local Health Officer believes conditions in that jurisdiction warrant it. 2. I will progressively designate sectors , businesses, establishments, or activities that may reopen with certain modifications , based on public health and safety needs, and I will add additional sectors, businesses , establishments, or activities at a pace designed to protect public health and safety . Those s ectors , businesses , establishments, or activities that are permitted to open will be designated, along with necessary modifications, at https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/ , as I announce them . 3. To the extent that such sectors are re-opened, Californians may leave their homes to work at, patronize, or otherwise engage with those businesses , establishments, or activities and must, when they do so, continue at all times to practice physical distancing , minimize their time outside of the home, and wash their hands frequently . To prevent further spread of COVID -19 to and within other jurisdictions within the State, Californians should not travel significant distances and should stay close to home. My March 19, 2020, O rder otherwise remains in full effect. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-8 Filed 07/17/20 Page 2 of 3 Page ID #:1364. The California Department of Public Health has set forth criteria to help local health officers assess the capacity of their local health jurisdictions to move through Stage 2. Local health jurisdictions that meet the criteria and follow the process set forth https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID - 19/ COVID- 19-County -Variance -Attestation -Memo.aspx w ill be permitted to move through Stage 2 more quickly than the State as a whole and reopen additional low -risk businesses before the rest of the state , if they choose to do so. A list of the sectors, businesses, establishments, or activities , and any necessary modificatio ns, that such a qualifying jurisdiction may choose to reopen will be available at https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap -counties/ , and may be expanded if I deem it to be in the interest of public health and safety . Pursuant to the authority under EO N -60-20, and Health and 120135, 120145, 120175 and 120150, this Order is to go into effect immediately and shall stay in effect until further notice. This Order is being issued to protect the public health of Californians as we move as expeditiously to minimiz e risk to the extent possible through out the Stages of the Pandemic Resilience Roadmap . Sonia Y Angell, MD, MPH State Public Health Officer & Director California Department of Public Health Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-8 Filed 07/17/20 Page 3 of Document 1-10 Filed of 13 Page ID #:155 COVID -19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Places of Worship and Providers of Religious Services and Cultural Ceremonies July 1, 2020 covid19.ca.gov Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 14 Page ID #:156 OVERVIEW On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID -19 among the population. The impact of COVID -19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed sympt oms. Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID -19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include places of worship, hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to ensure the safety of workers and the public. Key prevention practices include: physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, use of face coverings by worke rs and volunteers (where respiratory protection is not required) and congregants/visitors, frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, training workers and volunteers on these and other elements of the COVID -19 prevention plan. In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. PURPOS E This document provides guidance for places of worship and providers of religious services and cultural ceremonies (referred to collectively as \"places of worship\") to support a safe, clean environment for workers , interns and trainees, volunteer s, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, visitors, etc. (referred to collectively as \"visitors\" or \"congregants\" ). This guidance does not obligate places of worshi p to resume in -person activity. Further, it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 2 of 14 Page ID #:157 services and other related activities for those who are vulnerable to COVID -19 including older adults and those with co -morbidities. Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a relatively higher risk for widespread transmission of the COVID -19 virus, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities such as singing and chanting negate the risk - reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. *Places of wor ship must therefore discontinue singing and chanting activities and limit indoor attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction's key COVID - 19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of six feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document. This revised limitation will be subject to regular review by the California Department of Public Health in consultation with local Departments of Public Health to assess the impact of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased -in restoration of activities in places of worship. NOTE: This guidance is not intended for food preparation and service, delivery of items to those in need, childcare and daycare services, school and educational activities, in -home caregivi ng, counseling, office work, and other activities that places and organizations of worship may provide. Organizations that perform these activities must follow applicable guidance on the COVID -19 Resilienc e Roadmap website . The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health -related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA G uidance on Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage . The CDC has additional guidance for community - and faith -based organizations. Required Use of Face Cove rings On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings , which broadly requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 3 of 14 Page ID #:158 whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any member of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person's own household or residence) are present when unable to physically distance; Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended . Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance . Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers should provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of the exemptions from wearing a face covering . If a worker who would otherwise be required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non -restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying with the guidance . Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 4 of 14 Page ID #:159 Workplace Specific Plan Establish a written, workplace -specific COVID -19 prevention plan at every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and all work tasks , and designate a person at each workplace to implement the plan. Incorporate the CDPH Face Cove ring Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions . Identify contact information for the local health department where the workplace is located for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among work ers and congregants/visitors. Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives . Regularly evaluate workplaces for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of inf ection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak , in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive workers and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. Topics for Worker and Volunteer Training Information on COVID -19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to contracting the virus. Self-screening at home, including tempe rature and/or symptom checks using CDC guidelines . The importance of not coming to work or participating in activities o If a worker has symptoms of COVID -19 as described by the CDC , Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 5 of 14 Page ID #:160 such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headach e, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea , OR o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID -19 and has not yet been released from isolation, OR o If within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID -19 and is considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation ). To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without t he use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 test . To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webpage . The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Physical Distancing section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded after each shift. Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 6 of 14 Page ID #:161 Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled . Ensure all types of workers including temporary, independent contract ors, and volunteer workers are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention policies and have necessary PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary, contract, and/or volunteer staff. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional information ongovernment programs supporting sick leave and worker's compensation for COVID - 19, including worker 's sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and worker 's rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor's Executive Order N -62-20 while that Order is in effect. Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, w hich is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker and/or volunteer leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. Encourage workers and congregants/visitors who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19, or who have family members who are ill, to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers and volunteers use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves, where necessary. Places of worship should consider where disposable gloves use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use o f hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched items. All workers and volunteers should wear gloves when handling items contaminated by body fluids. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 7 of 14 Page ID #:162 Workers, volunteers, etc. , should not enter the home or visit someone who has tested positive for, exhibited symptoms of, or has been in contact with someone infected with COVID -19 for an appropriate waiting period as described by CDC guidelines. Places of worship must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in strategic and highly -visible locations and in reservation confirmations , to remind congregants and visitors that they must use face coverings and practice physical distancing and should frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds , use hand sanitizer , and not touch their face . Use social media, website, texts, email, newsletters, etc., to communicate the steps being taken to protect congregants/visitors and workers so that they are familiar with the policies (including to stay home if experiencing symptoms or are at increas ed risk of becoming sick, face coverings, physical distancing, handwashing and/or sanitizing, and cough etiquette), before arriving at the facility. Workers and volunteers are strongly encouraged to remind congregants/visitors of these practices with announcements during services or on welcoming guests. Remind congregants and visitors in advance to bring a face covering and make them available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. Congregants/visitors should be screened for temperature and/or symptoms upon arrival to places of worship and asked to use hand sanitizer . Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols Perform thorough cleaning of high traffic areas such as lobbies, halls, chapels, meeting rooms, offices, libraries, and study areas and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including doorknobs, toilets, handwashing facilities, pulpits and podiums, donation boxes or plates, altars, and pews and seating areas. Establish frequent cleaning and disinfection of personal work areas such as desks and cubicles and supply the necessary cleaning products. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of the workers' job duties. Discourage sharing items used in worship and services (such as prayer books, cushions, prayer rugs, etc.) whenever possible and provide single - use or digital copies or ask congregants/visitor s to bring personal items Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 8 of 14 Page ID #:163 instead. Avoid sharing work equipment and supplies, such as phones, office equipment, computers, etc., wherever possible. Never share PPE. Where such items must be shared, disinfect between shifts or uses, whichever is more freque nt, including the following: shared office equipment (copiers, fax machines, printers, telephones, keyboards, staplers, etc.) and shared worship items, etc., with a cleaner appropriate for the surface. Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and s tocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. Consider more frequently cleaning and disinfecting handwashing facilities that are used more often. Use signage to reinforce handwashing. Disinfect microphones a nd stands, music stands, instruments and other items on pulpits and podiums between each use. Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam mufflers. Consider using disposab le seat covers for congregants/visitors, particularly on porous surfaces or where a facility has multiple daily services. Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Provide disposable or washable covers on pillows used as seating on floors and chang e/wash them after each use. Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless whenever possible, at entrances and contact areas such as meeting rooms, lobbies, and elevator landings. When choosing disinfecting chemicals, establishments should use products approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alco hol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers and volunteers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves or other protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma - safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. Wash religious garments and linens after each service or event, at the highest water setting possible. Ask congregants/visitors to bring their own storage bags for personal garments and shoes. Workers , congregants, and visitors should wear gloves when handling others' dirty linens, shoes, etc. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 9 of 14 Page ID #:164 Discontinue passing offering plates and similar items that mov e between people. Use alternative giving options such as secure drop boxes that do not require opening/closing and can be cleaned and disinfected. Consider implementing digital systems that allow congregants/visitors to make touch -free offerings. Mark walking paths between spaces designated for congregants/visitors to sit/kneel so that people do not walk where someone may touch their head to the floor. During meetings and services, introduce fresh outside air, for example by opening doors/windows (weath er permitting) and operating ventilation systems. Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible. Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in worship areas, offices, and other spaces. Physical Distancing Guidelines Places of worship should continue to provide services through alternative methods (such as via internet live and/or recorded streaming, telephone, drive -in, etc.) whenever possible. Consider holding in -person meetings and providing in-person services outside whenever possible. Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between workers and congregants/visitors, etc. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor or pew markin gs or signs to indicate where people should sit and stand). Reconfigure seating and standing areas to maintain physical distancing of six feet or more between congregants/visitors from different households. Consider limiting seating to alternate rows. Memb ers of the same household may be seated together but should maintain at least six feet of distance from other households. Consider dedicating workers to help people maintain distances during activities. Shorten services to limit the length of time con gregants/visitors spend at facilities whenever possible. This could include limiting speeches, asking congregants/visitors to put on garments at home before arrival, etc. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 10 of 14 Page ID #:165 Close places of worship for visitation outside of scheduled services, meetings, etc., whenever possible. Consider implementing a reservation system to limit the number of congregants/visitors attending facilities at a time. This can include the use of digital platforms or other types of tools. Encourage congregants/visitors to meet with the same group, particularly when services meet frequently and/or require a certain number of people to be present. This can reduce the spread of transmission by minimizing the number of different individuals who come into close contact with each other. Consider offering additional meeting times (per day or per week) so that fewer guests attend meetings and services at one time. Clean meeting areas between each use as described in this guidance. Discontinue large gatherings that encourage congregants/visitors to travel and break physical distances during activities, such as concerts, large holiday and life event celebrations and remembrances. Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at any time while visiting facilities. Close play areas and discontinue activities and services for children where physical distancing of at least six feet cannot be maintained. Encourage congregants/visitors to p hysically distance themselves from others outside their household, avoid touching surfaces, and to leave the facility if they do not feel well. Consider limiting touching for religious and/or cultural purposes, such as holding hands, to members of the same household. Dedicate workers to direct guests to meeting rooms upon entry to places of worship rather than congregating in lobbies or common areas. Consider using ushers to help people find places to sit and stand that are at least six feet apart from other guests/household groups. Ask congregants/visitors to arrive and leave in a single group to minimize crossflow of people. Welcome and dismiss congregants/visitors from altars, podiums, meeting rooms, etc. in an orderly way to maintain physi cal distancing and minimize crossflow of traffic, to the extent possible. Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when congregants/visitors are entering and exiting facilities, if possible and in accordance with security and safety protocols. Close or restrict common areas, such as break rooms, kitchenettes, foyers, Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 11 of 14 Page ID #:166 etc. where people are likely to congregate and interact. Consider installing barriers or increase physical distance between tables/seating when there is continued use of these areas. Remove from service or find low -community touch alternatives for communal/religious water containers such as fonts, sinks, and vessels. Empty and c hange water between uses. Where there is a possibility of contaminant splash, workers , congregants, visitors, etc., are strongly encouraged to use equipment to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth using a combination of face coverings, protective glasses , and/or face shields. Reusable protective equipment such as shields and glasses should be properly disinfected between uses. When washing is a required activity, modify practices whenever possible to limit splashing and the need to clean and disinfect was hing facilities. Encourage necessary washing to be performed at home prior to entering a facility, if possible. Reconfigure podiums and speaker areas, office spaces, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc., to allow for at least six feet between people. Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, and designate separate routes for entry and exit into meeting rooms, offices, etc., to help maintain physical distancing and lessen the instances of people closely passing each other. Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator at a time . Post signage regarding these policies. Utilize practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of workers and congregants/visitors in office, meeting spaces, etc., at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g. staggeri ng start/end times), establishing alternating days for onsite reporting, returning to places of worship in phases, or continued use of telework when feasible. Consider offering workers and volunteers who request modified duties options that minimize their contact with congregants/visitors and other workers (e.g., office duties rather than working as an usher or managing administrative needs through telework). Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings via phone and internet. Close self -service item selection such as pamphlet displays and booksh elves and provide these items to congregants/visitors individually as necessary. Consider delivering items and information electronically. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 12 of 14 Page ID #:167 Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow for physical distancing. Discourage workers , congregants, visitors, etc., from engaging in handshakes, hugs, and similar greetings that break physical distance. Take reasonable measures to remind people to wave or use other greetings. Reconfigure parking lots to limit congreg ation points and ensure proper separation (e.g., closing every other space). If performing drive -in services, ensure vehicle windows and doors are closed if six feet of distance is not possible between vehicles. Continue to support non -in person attendance of services and other related activities by those who are vulnerable to COVID -19 including older adults and those with co-morbidities. Considerations for Places of Worship Discontinue offering self -service food and beverages. Do not hold potlu cks or similar family -style eating and drinking events that increase the risk of cross contamination. If food and beverages must be served, provide items in single -serve, disposable containers whenever possible. Workers or volunteers serving food should wash hands frequently and wear disposable gloves . Discontinu e singing (in rehearsals, services, etc.) , chanting , and other practices and performances where there is increased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets. Consider practicing these activities through alternative methods (such as internet streaming) that ensure individual congregatio n members perform these activities separately in their own homes . Consider modifying practices that are specific to particular faith traditions that might encourage the spread of COVID -19. Examples are discontinuing kissing of ritual objects, allowing rites to be performed by fewer people, avoiding the use of a common cup, offeri ng communion in the hand instead of on the tongue, providing pre -packed communion items on chairs prior to service, etc., in accordance with CDC guidelines . Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 13 of 14 Page ID #:168 Considerations for Funerals Consider reduced visitor capacity and stagger visitation times at funerals, wakes, etc., if possible. Follow all cleaning and disinfection measures as described in this guidance. Whenever possible, remind visitors to maintain physical distance from each other, from workers and volunteers, and from the deceased. Consider modifying religious or cultural practices when washing or shrouding bodies of those who have died from COVID -19, in accordance with guidance from CDPH and the CDC . If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, work with funeral home staff and families to reduce exposure as much as possible. All people participating in these activities must wear disposable gloves and if there will be splashing of fluids, people must use additional protective equipment including protection for the eyes, nose, and mouth, such as face shields. Consult and comply with local guidance regarding limits on gathering sizes, travel, holding funerals for those who died from COVID -19, etc. Consider other recommendations and modifications of services related to places of worship outlined above, as applicable for funeral services. 1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Places of worship must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) . Additionally, places of worship must be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-11 Filed 07/17/20 Page 14 of 14 Page ID #:169 COVID-19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Places of Worship and Providers of Religious Services and Cultural Ceremonies July 6, 2020 covid19.ca.gov 1Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 14 Page ID #:170 OVERVIEW On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID -19 among the population. The impact of COVID -19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed sympt oms. Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID -19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include places of worship, hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. As stay -at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to ensure the safety of workers and the public. Key prevention practices include: physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, use of face coverings by workers and volunteers (where respiratory protection is not required) and congregants/visitors, frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, training workers and volunteers on these and other elements of the COVID -19 prevention plan. In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the v irus. PURPOSE This document provides guidance for places of worship and providers of religious services and cultural ceremonies (referred to collectively as \"places of worship\") to support a safe, clean environment for workers , interns and trainees, volunt eers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, visitors, etc. (referred to collectively as \"visitors\" or \"congregants\" ). This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in -person activity. Further, it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote 2Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 2 of 14 Page ID #:171 servic es and other related activities for tho se who are vulnerable to COVID -19 including older adult s and those with co-morbidities. Even with adherenc e to physical distancing , convening in a congregationa l setting of multiple diff erent household s to practice a perso nal faith ca rries a relativ ely higher risk for widespread transmissio n of the COVID-19 virus, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospita lizatio n, and death, especially amo ng mo re vulnerable populatio ns. In partic ular, activities such as singing and chanti ng nega te the risk- reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. *Places of worship must therefore discontinue indoor singing and chanting activities and limit indoor attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction's key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of six feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protoco ls within this document. This revised limitation will be s ubject to regular review by the California Dep artment of Public Health in consultation with loca l Departments of Public Health to assess the impac t of these imposed limits on public hea lth and provid e further direction as part of a phased- in restoratio n of activities in places of worship. NOTE: This guidance is not intended for food preparation and service, delivery of items to those in need, childcare and daycare services, school and educational activities, in -home caregiving, counseling, office work, and other activities that places and organiz ations of worship may provide. Organizations that perform these activities must follow applicable guidance on the COVID -19 Resilience Roadmap website . The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health -related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage . The CDC has additional guidance for community -and faith -based organizations. Required Use of Face Coverings On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings , which broadly requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 3Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 3 of 14 Page ID #:172 whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any m ember of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walki ng through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person's own household or residence) are present when unable to physically distance; Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended . Complete details, including all requi rements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance . Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers should provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with othe rs cannot wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non -restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not e xclude any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying with the guidance . Businesse s will need to develop policies for handling these exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers. 4Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 4 of 14 Page ID #:173 Workplace Specific Plan Establish a written, workplace -specific COVID -19 prevention plan at every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and all work tasks , and designate a person at each workplace to implement the plan. Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions . Identify contact information for the local health department where the workp lace is located for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among workers and congregants/visitors. Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives . Regularly evaluate workplaces for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak , in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive workers and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cau se operations to be temporarily closed or limited. Topics for Worker and Volunteer Training Information on COVID -19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which underlying health con ditions may make individuals more susceptible to contracting the virus. Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks using CDC guidelines . The importance of not coming to work or participating in activities o If a worker has symptoms of COVID -19 as described by the CDC , 5Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 5 of 14 Page ID #:174 such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny no se, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea , OR o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID -19 and has not yet been released from isolation, OR o If within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID -19 and is considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation ). To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without t he use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 test . To seek medical attention if their sy mptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webp age. The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Physical Distancing section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded after each shift. Information contained in t he CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 6Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 6 of 14 Page ID #:175 Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled . Ensure all types of workers including temporary, independent contract ors, and volunteer workers are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention policies and have necessary PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary, contract, and/or volunteer staff. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker's compensation for COVID -19, including worker 's sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Respons e Act and worker 's rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor' s Executive Order N -62-20 while that Order is in effect. Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker and/or volunteer leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. Encourage workers and congregants/visitors who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19, or who have family members who are ill, to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers and volunteers use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves, where necessary. Places of worship should consider where disposable gloves use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched ite ms. All workers and volunteers should wear gloves when handling items contaminated by body fluids. 7Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 7 of 14 Page ID #:176 Workers, volunteers, etc. , should not enter the home or visit someone who has tested positive for, exhibited symptoms of, or has been in contact with someone infected with COVID -19 for an appropriate waiting period as described by CDC guidelines. Places of worship must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in strategic and highly -visible locations and in reservation confirmations , to remind congregants and visitors that they must use face coverings and practice physical distancing and should frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds , use hand sanitizer , and not touch their face . Use social media, website, texts, email, newsletters, etc., to communicate the steps being taken to protect congregants/visitors and workers so that they are familiar with the policies (in cluding to stay home if experiencing symptoms or are at increased risk of becoming sick, face coverings, physical distancing, handwashing and/or sanitizing, and cough etiquette), before arriving at the facility. Workers and volunteers are strongly encourag ed to remind congregants/visitors of these practices with announcements during services or on welcoming guests. Remind congregants and visitors in advance to bring a face covering and make them available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. Congregants/visitors should be screened for temperature and/or symptoms upon arrival to places of worship and asked to use hand sanitizer. Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols Perform thorough cleaning of high traffic areas such as lobbies, halls, chapels, meeting rooms, offices, libraries, and study areas and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including doorknobs, toilets, handwashing facilities, pulpits and podiums, donation boxes or plates, altars, and pews and seating areas. Establish frequent cleaning and disinfection of personal work ar eas such as desks and cubicles and supply the necessary cleaning products. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of the workers' job duties. Discour age sharing items used in worship and services (such as prayer books, cushions, prayer rugs, etc.) whenever possible and provide single - use or digital copies or ask congregants/visitors to bring personal items 8Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 8 of 14 Page ID #:177 instead. Avoid sharing work equipment and sup plies, such as phones, office equipment, computers, etc., wherever possible. Never share PPE. Where such items must be shared, disinfect between shifts or uses, whichever is more frequent, including the following: shared office equipment (copiers, fax mach ines, printers, telephones, keyboards, staplers, etc.) and shared worship items, etc., with a cleaner appropriate for the surface. Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. Consider more frequently cleaning and disinfecting handwashing facilities that are used more often. Use signage to reinforce handwashing. Disinfect microphones and stands, music stands, instruments and other items on pulpits and podiums between each use. Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam mufflers. Consider using disposable seat covers for congregants/visitors, particularly on porous surfaces or where a facility has multiple daily services. Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Provide disposable or washable covers on pillows used as seating on floors and change/wash them after each use. Install hand sanitizer dispen sers, touchless whenever possible, at entrances and contact areas such as meeting rooms, lobbies, and elevator landings. When choosing disinfecting chemicals, establishments should use products approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved list and follow pr oduct instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Pro vide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers and volunteers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves or other protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma - safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. Wash religious garments and linens after each service or event, at the highest water setting possible. As k congregants/visitors to bring their own storage bags for personal garments and shoes. Workers , congregants, and visitors should wear gloves when handling others' dirty linens, shoes, etc. 9Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 9 of 14 Page ID #:178 Discontinue passing offering plates and similar items that move be tween people. Use alternative giving options such as secure drop boxes that do not require opening/closing and can be cleaned and disinfected. Consider implementing digital systems that allow congregants/visitors to make touch -free offerings. Mark walking paths between spaces designated for congregants/visitors to sit/kneel so that people do not walk where someone may touch their head to the floor. During meetings and services, introduce fresh outside air, for example by opening doors/windows (weather permitting) and operating ventilation systems. Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible. Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in worship areas, offices, and other spaces. Physical Distancing Guidelines Places of worship should continue to provide services through alternative methods (such as via internet live and/or recorded streaming, telephone, drive -in, etc.) whenever possible. Consider holding in -person meetings and providing in -person se rvices outside whenever possible. Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between workers and congregants/visitors, etc. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor or pew markings or signs to indicate where people should sit and stand). Reconfigure seating and standing areas to maintain physical distancing of six feet or more between congregants/visitors from different households. Consider limiting seating to alternate rows. Members of the same household may be seated together but should maintain at least six feet of distance from other households. Consider dedicating workers to help people maintain distances during activities. Shorten services to limit the length of time congregants/visitors spend at facilities whenever possible. This could include limiting speeches, asking congregants/visitors to put on garments at hom e before arrival, etc. 10Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 10 of 14 Page ID #:179 Close places of worship for visitation outside of scheduled services, meetings, etc., whenever possible. Consider implementing a reservation system to limit the number of congregants/visitors attending facilities at a time. This can include the use of digital platforms or other types of tools. Encourage congregants/visitors to meet with the same group, particularly when services meet frequently and/or require a certain number of people to be present. This can reduce the spread of transmission by minimizing the number of different individuals who come into close contact with each other. Consider offering additional meeting times (per day or per week) so that fewer guests attend meetings and services at one time. Clean meeting areas between each use as described in this guidance. Discontinue large gatherings that encourage congregants/visitors to travel and break physical distances during activities, such as concerts, large holiday and life event celebrations and remembrances. Childre n should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at any time while visiting facilities. Close play areas and discontinue activities and services for children where physical distancing of at least six feet cannot be maintained. Encourage congregants/visitors to physically distance themselves from others outside their household, avoid touching surfaces, and to leave the facility if they do not feel well. Consider limiting touching for religious and/or cultural purposes, such as holding hands, to members of the same household. Dedicate workers to direct guests to meeting rooms upon entry to places of worship rather than congregating in lobbies or common areas. Consider using ushers to he lp people find places to sit and stand that are at least six feet apart from other guests/household groups. Ask congregants/visitors to arrive and leave in a single group to minimize crossflow of people. Welcome and dismiss congregants/visitors from altars , podiums, meeting rooms, etc. in an orderly way to maintain physical distancing and minimize crossflow of traffic, to the extent possible. Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when congregants/visitors are entering and exiting facilities, if possib le and in accordance with security and safety protocols. Close or restrict common areas, such as break rooms, kitchenettes, foyers, 11Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 11 of 14 Page ID #:180 etc. where people are likely to congregate and interact. Consider installing barriers or increase physical distance between tables/seating when there is continued use of these areas. Remove from service or find low -community touch alternatives for communal/religious water containers such as fonts, sinks, and vessels. Empty and change water between uses. Where there is a possibi lity of contaminant splash, workers , congregants, visitors, etc., are strongly encouraged to use equipment to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth using a combination of face coverings, protective glasses, and/or face shields. Reusable protective equipment su ch as shields and glasses should be properly disinfected between uses. When washing is a required activity, modify practices whenever possible to limit splashing and the need to clean and disinfect washing facilities.

Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator at a time . Post signage regarding these policies. Utilize practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of workers and congregants/visitors in office, meeting spaces, etc., at one time. Th is may include scheduling (e.g. staggering start/end times), establishing alternating days for onsite reporting, returning to places of worship in phases, or continued use of telework when feasible. Consider offering workers and volunteers who request modi fied duties options that minimize their contact with congregants/visitors and other workers (e.g., office duties rather than working as an usher or managing administrative needs through telework). Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour reg ulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings via phone and internet. Close self -service item selection such as pamphlet displays and bookshelves and provide these items to congregants/ visitors individually as necessary. Consider delivering items and information electronically. 12Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-12 Filed 07/17/20 Page 12 of 14 Page ID #:181 Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow for physical distancing. Discourage workers , congregants, visitors, etc., from engaging in handshakes, hugs, and similar greetings that break physical distance. Take reasonable measures to remind people to wave or use other greetings. Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper separation (e.g., closi ng every other space). If performing drive -in services, ensure vehicle windows and doors are closed if six feet of distance is not possible between vehicles. Continue to support non -in person attendance of services and other related activities by those who are vulnerable to COVID -19 including older adults and those with co-morbidities. Considerations for Places of Worship Discontinue offering self -service food and beverages. Do not hold potlucks or similar family -style eating and drinking events that incr ease the risk of cross contamination. If food and beverages must be served, provide items in single -serve, disposable containers whenever possible. Workers or volunteers serving food should wash hands frequently and wear disposable gloves. Discontinu e singing (in rehearsals, services, etc.) , chanting , and other practices and performances where there is increased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets.

Follow all cleaning and disinfection measures as described in this guidance. Whenever possible, remind visitors to maintain physical distance from each other, from workers and volunteers, and from the deceased. Consider modifying religious or cultural practices when washing or shrouding bodies of those who have died from COVID -19, in accordance with guidance from CDPH and the CDC . If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, work with funeral home staff and families to reduce exposure as much as possible. All people participating in these activities must wear disposable gloves and if there will be splashing of fluids, people must use additional protecti ve equipment including protection for the eyes, nose, and mouth, such as face shields. Consult and comply with local guidance regarding limits on gathering sizes, travel, holding funerals for those who died from COVID -19, etc. Consider other recommendations and modifications of services related to places of worship outlined above, as applicable for funeral services. 1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Places of worship must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) .

Box 558-1784 Internet Address: www.cdph.ca.gov State wide Public Health Officer Order, July 13 , 2020 On March 19, 2020, I issued an order directing all individuals living in the State of California to stay at home except as needed to facilitate authorized, necessary activities or to maintain the continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors. I then set out California's path forward from this \"Stay -at-Home\" Order in California's Pandemic Resilience Roadmap . On May 7th, I announced that statewide data supported the gradual movement of the entire state into Stage 2 of the Pandemic Resilien ce Roadmap . On May 8th, the Governor outlined a process where counties that met specific criteria could move more quickly than other parts of the state through Stage 2 of modifying the Stay -at-Home order, including certain businesses deemed higher risk. The statewide data has since demonstrated a significant increase in the spr ead of COIVD -19, resulting in public health conditions that demand measures responsive to those conditions be put into place with haste. On June 28, 2020, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued guidance setting forth the need to close bars and similar establishments in counties that - due to concerning levels of disease transmission, hospitalizations, or insufficient testing - had been on the County Monitoring List , which includes counties that show concerning levels of disease transmission, hospitalizations, insufficient testing , or other critical epidemiological markers, for 14 days. On July 1, 2020, CDPH issued guidance specific to counties on the County Monitoring List for three consecutive days, requiring closure of the indoor operations of various sectors, i ncluding restaurants, wineries, and certain entertainment venues, as well as all bars indoor and outdoor. Based on my judgment as the State Public Health Officer, i t is now necessary to take these steps statewide, to take additional steps for counties on t he County Monitoring List , and to continue to monitor and modify the process of reopening . The current data reflect that community spread of infection is of increasing concern across the state. On July 1, 2020, there were 19 counties on the County Monitoring List. As of July 13, 2020, there are 32 counties on the list , and additional counties may soon be added as data warrants . In addition to the impact on the general population, community spread increases the likelihood of expanded transmission of COVID -19 in congregate settings such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, jails and prisons. Infection of these vulnerable populations in these settings can be catastrophic. Higher Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-13 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 5 Page ID #:184 levels of community s pread also increase the likelihood of infection among individuals at high risk of serious outcomes from COVID -19, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions who might live or otherwise interact with an infected individual . The Pandemic Resilienc e Roadmap classifies bars, brewpubs , dine- in resta urants , wineries and tasting rooms, family entertainment centers, zoos, museums, and cardrooms as Stage 2 or Stage 3 sectors with high risk of transmission due to a number of features of the businesses and the behaviors that occur within them . Public health studies have shown that the risk of transmission is exacerbated in indoor spaces , particularly when lacking appropriate ventilation. These sectors are settings where groups convene and may mix with others for a prolonged period of time, increasing the risk of escalating the transmission rate of COVID -19. While p hysical distancing is critical to mitigating exposure, it is more effective at protect ing an individual with brief exposures or outdoor exposures . In contrast to indoor spaces, w ind and the viral dilution in outdoor spaces can help reduce viral load. Bars, both indoor and outdoor, have additional risk factors . A bar, foundationally, is a social setting where typically not only small groups convene, but also where groups mix with other groups. Bars also have an added risk imposed by the consumption of alcohol as a primary activity offered in such venues . Alcohol consumption slows brain activity, reduces inhibition, and impairs judgment, factors which contribute to reduced compliance with recommended core personal protective measures, such as the mandatory use of face coverings and maintaining six feet of distance from people in different households, both indoors and outdoors . Louder environments and the cacophony of conversation that are typical in bar settings also require raised voices and greater projection of oral ly emitted viral droplets. For counti es on the County Monitoring List, the risks and impacts of disease transmission are even greater. The science suggests that for indoor operations t he odds of an infected person transmitting the virus are dramatically higher compared to an open- air environm ent. Thus, f or those counties on the list , it is necessary to close indoor operations for additional sectors which promote the closed- space mixing of populations beyond households and/or make adherence to physical distancing with face coverings difficult , including: gyms and fitness centers , places of worship, protests, offices for non-Critical Infrastructure sectors as designated on covid19.ca.gov , personal care services (including nail salons , massage parlors, and tattoo parlors) , hair salons and Page 2 of 5 Page ID #:185 NOW, THEREFORE, I , as State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health, order all of the following: Statewide Order Relative to Bars, Pubs, Brewpubs, and Breweries 1.

These closures shall remain in effect until I determine it is appropriate to modify the order based on public health conditions . 6. Outdoor operations may be conducted under a tent, canopy, or other sun shelter but only as long as no more than one side is closed, allowing sufficient outdoor air movement. 7. I will continue to monitor the epidemiological data and will modify the sectors that may be open both statewide and in counties on the M onitoring List as required by the evolving public health conditions. If I determine that it is appropriate to reopen, close, or modify the operations of any additional sectors, those sectors will be posted at : https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap- counties/ . 8.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, NED LAMONT, Governor of the State of Connecticut, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the State of Connecticut, do hereby ORDER AND DIRECT: I. Restriction of Social and Recreational Gatherings to No More Than 5 People. Effective immediately, and through April 30, 2020, unless earlier modified, extended, or terminated by me, the prior order set forth in Executive Order No. 7D, prohibiting social and recreational gatherings of 50 people or more, is hereby amended and modified to require that all such gatherings of six (6) or more people, including but not limited to, community, civic, leisure, or sporting events; parades; conceits; festivals; plays or live performances; conventions; and similar activities, are prohibited throughout the State of Connecticut, except that religious, spiritual or worship gatherings shall not be subject to such increased restrictions, and shall instead remain subject to the prohibition on gatherings of 50 or more people, provided that they employ reasonable and appropriate distancing measures. To further clarify this order, it does not apply to government operations, private workplaces, retail establishments, or other activities that are not social or recreational gatherings. 2. Restrictions on Restaurant Payment and Pickup Operations. Where reasonably practicable, restaurants, eating establishments, and any bars that remain open for sales of food for off-premise consumption, shall limit entrance of customers into their locations to the minimum extent necessary to pick up and/or pay for orders, use touchless payment systems, and require remote ordering and payment, whether by telephone, computer, mobile application, or other technology. Nothing in this order shall require any such business to acquire or use ordering or payment technology that they do not already possess, prohibit drive-through ordering and pickup, or prohibit in-person payment or cash payment where there is no reasonable alternative. Previously issued guidance for hospital and business cafeterias remains in effect. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-17 Filed 07/17/20 Page 4 of 6 Page ID #:2173. Further Restrictions on Retail Operations. Any retail establishment that has been allowed to remain open and permit customers inside such establishment during this public health and civil preparedness emergency shall take appropriate and reasonable measures to ensure customers maintain six feet of distance between each other, and to manage any resulting lines to maintain such distance while people are waiting to enter, and where reasonably practical, employ touchless payment technology if they already have such technology available. a. Firearms Transactions by Appointment Only. Effective immediately and through May 15, 2020, unless earlier modified, extended, or terminated by me, because the nature of certain regulated retail transactions, including purchase, sale, and transfer of firearms, ammunition, and their components or supplies, requires the customer's presence inside the business to accommodate certain parts of those transactions or associated background check processes, and in order to limit person-to-person contact as much as possible and manage the large increase in requests for authorizations for such transactions and the resulting burdens on the communications technology and public safety staff responsible for reviewing and providing such authorizations, any firearms dealer shall conduct all such transactions by appointment only, shall limit such appointments to a number that will maintain a distance of six feet between any customers and/or staff in a store, including customers and staff conducting such transactions, and shall allow entrance into their establishments only to those customers conducting such transactions. 4. Temporary Suspension of Tax on Single-Use Checkout Bags. All provisions of Section 355 of Public Act 19-117, as codified in Section 22a- 246a of the 2020 Supplement to the Connecticut General Statutes, regarding single-use plastic checkout bags, are temporarily suspended through May 15, 2020, unless earlier modified, extended, or terminated by me. The Commisioner of Revenue Services shall issue any implementing order he deems necessmy, and any guidance for businesses on accounting or other necessmy measures during this temporary suspension. 5. Employees Not Required to Bag Items in Reusable Bags. Effective immediately and through May 15, 2020, unless earlier modified, extended, or terminated by me, no employer in a retail establishment shall require any employee to bag any item in a customer-provided reusable bag, provided that nothing in this order shall prohibit customers who wish to use such reusable Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-17 Filed 07/17/20 Page 5 of 6 Page ID #:218bags from doing so; such customers shall bag their own items where the employee of the retail establishment declines to do so. 6. Suspension of 21-month Limit on Temporary Family Assistance. Section 17b-l 12 of the Co1mecticut General Statutes and any implementing regulations are modified to exclude from the statutory 21-month time limit on receipt of Tempora1y Family Assistance all months of such assistance received during the public health and civil preparedness emergency. 7. Suspension of School Testing Assessments for 2019-20 School Year. The provisions of Section 10-14n of the Co1U1ecticut General Statutes related to the administration of all state summative and alternate assessments; Section 10- 14t, related to the administration of universal screening reading assessment for students in Grades K-3; and Section 10-265g, related to the administration of reading assessments in priority districts at the end of the school year, are hereby suspended for the 2019-20 school year. Any associated regulations, rules, and policies regarding statewide assessments are modified to authorize the Commissioner of Education to temporarily waive any requirements contained therein as he deems necessary to respond to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unless otherwise specified herein, this order shall take effect immediately and shall remain in effect for the duration of the public health and civil preparedness emergency, unless earlier modified or terminated by me.

This guidance does not obligate or encourage places of worship to resume in-person activity. Indeed, it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services, particularly for those who are vulnerable to COVID-19, including older adults and those with chronic conditions. Even with adherence to physical distancing, multiple different households convening in a congregational setting to worship carries a higher risk for widespread transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, the high risk associated with activities like singing, and group recitation can negate the risk-reducing behaviors, such as 6 feet of physical distancing. Recognizing the centrality of worship in many people's lives and the spiritual and emotional value of prayer, community, and faith, this guidance provides recommendations for places of worship that choose to resume or expand in-person activities. The Safest Options: Remote Services and Drive-In Services A common thread joining many faiths is a deep respect for human life and health, which prioritizes protecting our neighbors and the vulnerable among us. Places of worship may choose to express those values by practicing the safest forms of worship through remote services and drive-in services. Remote services Remote services can be streamed online, broadcast by radio, and/or conducted by telephone or dial-in. Remote services are the only way to guarantee places of worship will not become sources of new infection. Drive-in services Drive-in services involve congregants driving to a common location and worshiping together from their vehicle, while listening to either a remote service or one broadcast through speakers. If done correctly, these types of services pose a low risk of infection. Some best practices include: Congregants who are living together travel together, without introducing new people to the vehicle. Congregants always remain in their vehicles.Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-19 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 6 Page ID #:234525-5 35 W est Jeff erson S treet Springfield, Illinois 6 2761-0001 www .dph.illinois.g ov Protecting H ealth, Improving Lives Nationally Accredited by PHAB Version Number 1.02 Maintain distance between cars so that there is more than 6 feet between any group of congregants and another group of congregants - particularly if car windows are open. Regularly sanitize restrooms and have sufficient soap and hand sanitizer. For further guidance Places of worship may look to the additional guidance referenced below: CDC Interim Guidance for Communities of Faith: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/faith-based. html Guidelines for re-configuring places of worship for social distancing Reconfigure seating and standing areas to maintain physical distancing of 6 feet or more between congregants/ visitors from different households. Consider both limiting seating to alternate rows and assigning seating in advance. Shorten services to limit the length of time congregants/visitors spend at facilities whenever possible. This could include limiting speeches/sermons and asking congregants/visitors to put on garments at home before arrival. Consider implementing a reservation system to limit the number of congregants/visitors attending facilities at a time. This can include the use of digital platforms or other types of tools. Consider offering additional times for services or meetings (per day or per week) so fewer guests attend at one time. Dedicate staff to direct guests immediately to their seats upon entry to places of worship rather than congregating in lobbies or common areas. Consider using ushers to help people find places to sit and stand that are at least 6 feet apart from other guests/ household groups. Develop and communicate a plan to welcome and dismiss congregants/visitors from seating areas, altars, podiums, and meeting rooms in an orderly way to maintain physical distancing and minimize crossflow of traffic. Avoid assembly line type greetings at the beginning or conclusion of services. Ask congregants/visitors to arrive and leave in a single household group to minimize crossflow of people. Consider assigning spaced household arrival times to minimize congregants arriving all at once. Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when congregants/visitors are entering and exiting facilities, if possible and in accordance with security and safety protocols. Close or restrict common areas, such as break rooms, kitchenettes, and foyers where people are likely to congregate and interact. Consider installing barriers or increase physical distance between tables/seating when continued use of these areas cannot be avoided. If possible, provide bottled water or touchless water fountains. For touch drinking fountains, discourage forming a line and create markings to allow social distancing while waiting, have paper towels available to touch the fountain, and clean and disinfect frequently. Remove from service or find low-community touch alternatives for communal/religious water containers, such as fonts, sinks, and vessels. Empty and change water between services/uses. Where there is a possibility of contaminant splash, strongly encourage staff, congregants, visitors, and others to use equipment to protect their eyes, noses, and mouths using a combination of face coverings, protective glasses, and/or face shields. Reusable protective equipment, such as shields and glasses, should be properly disinfected between uses. When washing is a required activity, modify practices whenever possible to limit splashing and the need to clean and disinfect washing facilities.Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-19 Filed 07/17/20 Page 2 of 6 Page ID #:235525-5 35 W est Jeff erson S treet Springfield, Illinois 6 2761-0001 www .dph.illinois.g ov Protecting H ealth, Improving Lives Nationally Accredited by PHAB Version Number 1.03Physical distancing guidelines Continue to provide services through alternative methods (such as via internet live and/or recorded streaming, telephone, and drive-in) whenever possible. Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least 6 feet between workers, staff, and congregants/visitors. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor or pew markings or signs to indicate where people should sit and stand). Members of the same household may be seated together but should maintain at least 6 feet apart from other households. Encourage congregants/visitors to meet with the same group, particularly when services meet frequently and/or require a certain number of people to be present. This can reduce the spread of transmission by minimizing the number of different individuals who come into close contact with each other. Consider dedicating staff or volunteers to help people maintain distances during services or activities. Take steps to ensure limited attendance at gatherings that encourage congregants/visitors to travel and break physical distances, such as concerts and large holiday and life event celebrations and remembrances. Discontinue these activities whenever possible. Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at any time while visiting facilities. Close play areas and discontinue activities and services for children where physical distancing of at least 6 feet cannot be maintained. Limit touching for religious purposes, such as shaking hands or holding hands, to members of the same household. Cleaning and disinfecting protocols Perform thorough cleaning of high traffic areas, such as lobbies, halls, chapels, meeting rooms, offices, libraries, and study areas, and areas of ingress and egress, including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including doorknobs, toilets, handwashing facilities, pulpits and podiums, donation boxes or plates, altars, and pews and seating areas. Discourage sharing items used in worship and services (such as prayer books, cushions, prayer rugs) whenever possible and provide single-use or digital copies or ask congregants/visitors to bring personal items instead. Where such items must be shared, disinfect between uses. Disinfect microphones and stands, music stands, instruments and other items on pulpits and podiums between each use. Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless whenever possible, at entrances and contact areas such as meeting rooms, lobbies, and elevator landings. Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow for physical distancing. Consider placing a towel dispenser near the restroom exit with signage for using a towel to touch the door or having touchless exit. Discontinue passing offering plates and similar items that move between people. Use alternative giving options such as secure drop boxes that do not require repeated opening/closing and can be cleaned and disinfected. Consider implementing digital systems that allow congregants/visitors to make touch-free offerings. Mark walking paths between spaces designated for congregants/visitors to sit/kneel so that people do not walk where someone may be touching the floor. During meetings and services, introduce fresh outside air by opening doors/windows (weather permitting) and operating ventilation systems.Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-19 Filed 07/17/20 Page 3 of 6 Page ID #:236525-5 35 W est Jeff erson S treet Springfield, Illinois 6 2761-0001 www .dph.illinois.g ov Protecting H ealth, Improving Lives Nationally Accredited by PHAB Version Number 1.04Modify high-risk religious practices Consider modifying practices that are specific to faith traditions that might encourage the spread of COVID-19. Examples are discontinuing kissing of ritual objects, discontinuing bathing rites, allowing rites to be performed by fewer people, providing pre-packed communion items on chairs prior to service, avoiding the use of a common cup, and offering communion in the hand instead of on the tongue. Individual control measures and screening Ensure proper use of face coverings. Congregants/visitors and staff should be screened for temperature and/ or symptoms upon arrival to places of worship and asked to use hand sanitizer and to wear face coverings. Encourage staff and congregants/visitors who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or who have family members who are ill, to stay home. Post signage in strategic and highly visible locations, to remind congregants/visitors that they should use face coverings and practice physical distancing whenever possible. Use social media, websites, texts, emails, and newsletters to communicate the steps being taken to protect congregants/visitors and staff so they are familiar with the policies (including to stay home if experiencing symptoms or at an increased risk of becoming sick, face coverings, physical distancing, handwashing and/or sanitizing, and cough etiquette), before arriving at the facility. Staff and volunteers are strongly encouraged to remind congregants/visitors of these practices with announcements during services or on welcoming guests. Consider reaching out separately to those who are ill but desire to be engaged in worship services. Develop a plan to include those participants by phone, video, or a safe alternative. Monitor for staff illnesses and have staff remain home if they are ill or have been exposed to a person who is ill. Know and communicate where staff and congregants can get tested for COVID-19 if they develop symptoms. Have a clear plan to facilitate contact tracing if an attendee later tests positive for COVID-19. Recruit non-vulnerable volunteers to assist in activities, particularly those that may require close contact. Limit offerings of classes or services for children to groups of 50 or fewer and devise an age-appropriate plan for children to practice social distancing and wear face coverings. Avoid the riskiest activities COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets in person-to-person contact (within 6 feet); risk grows as exposure time increases. Some activities at places of worship pose a heightened risk that should be avoided: Singing and group recitation Strongly consider discontinuing singing (and post signage discouraging singing), group recitation, and other practices and performances where there is increased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets. Modify practices by calling for silent recitation, using prerecorded music, or having a single singer in a separate area with speaker transmission. If these practices cannot be discontinued, strictly limit the number people reciting or singing, ensure physical distancing significantly greater than 6 feet between people, and consider installing plexiglass to provide physical barriers between people, or opt to celebrate these practices outside with significant physical distancing and other precautions. Use microphones to discourage loud speaking and provide a barrier (plexiglass) for the speaker.Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-19 Filed 07/17/20 Page 4 of 6 Page ID #:237525-5 35 W est Jeff erson S treet Springfield, Illinois 6 2761-0001 www .dph.illinois.g ov Protecting H ealth, Improving Lives Nationally Accredited by PHAB Version Number 1.05Food and beverages Discontinue offering food and beverages. Do not hold potlucks or buffet-style meals or events that increase the risk of cross contamination. If food and beverages must be served, provide items in single-serve containers (disposable containers whenever possible), and ensure congregants or others who are living together are seated together and more than 6 feet apart from others. Employees or volunteers serving food should wash hands frequently and wear disposable gloves and face coverings. Greetings and person-to-person contact Discourage staff, congregants, and visitors from engaging in handshakes, hugs, and similar greetings that break physical distance. Take measures to remind people to wave or use other greetings. Additional guidance for in-person activities As places of worship navigate COVID-19, the guidelines below are designed to make in-person indoor worship and activities safer - recognizing that the safest and recommended options are those listed above, and that larger gatherings pose greater risk. Strict social distancing, wearing face coverings, and cleaning and disinfecting are paramount to reducing the risk of infection for in-person gatherings. Places of worship should develop a COVID-19 plan and be prepared to adapt to updated public health guidance and to restrict in-person activities if the incidence of COVID-19 within their communities increases. Places of worship should provide training to both staff and congregants on their COVID-19 plans and share the new safety protocols and processes by email, video, mail, and posted signage - with frequent updates as new safety protocols are implemented. Capacity limits As gatherings grow, they pose a greater risk of becoming a source of COVID-19 transmission. The current statewide guidelines recommend gatherings of no more than 50 people. Where the 50 -person limit cannot be followed in places of worship, these guidelines are recommended: Set a capacity limit for the place of worship that allows for extensive social distancing (6 feet or more) between congregants. Consider limiting attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. Expand capacity limits gradually, rather than all at once, to allow the opportunity to test and improve safety protocols. Conduct multiple small services as opposed to one large service. Consider small, separate services for certain groups - such as those over 65 years of age or those who have serious underlying medical conditions, or those with small children who will have difficulty social distancing. During services for those over 65 years of age or those who have serious underlying medical conditions, enforce strict safety protocols. Consider a reservation system to limit capacity, to assign seating to ensure social distancing, and to allow for contact tracing in the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case and the need to contact exposed individuals. Develop and communicate a social distancing plan that includes where congregants will sit, how they will enter and exit seating areas (including staggered and scheduled arrival times and varied exit times), and how social distancing can be maintained at all times given the physical layout of the place of worship. Use the social distancing plan to determine a safe capacity limit. Relatively Safe Options for In-Person Worship Faith communities also cherish fellowship. The desire for the human connection of worshipping together, particularly during a time of crisis, is understandable. However, gatherings of any size pose a risk of COVID-19 transmission. For places of worship that choose to hold in-person activities, the safest course of action is to congregate outdoors and/or in groups of less than 50 peopleCase 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-19 Filed 07/17/20 Page 5 of 6 Page ID #:238525-5 35 W est Jeff erson S treet Springfield, Illinois 6 2761-0001 www .dph.illinois.g ov Protecting H ealth, Improving Lives Nationally Accredited by PHAB Version Number 1.06Congregate outdoors Where weather and facilities permit, it is safer for worship and other activity to occur outdoors rather than indoors. Some best practices include: Congregants who are living together sit together, at least 6 feet apart from other congregants and groups. Wear face coverings. Refrain from singing and group recitation, which significantly increases the risk of transmission of the virus by projecting respiratory droplets. Consider pre-recorded music or other alternatives. If continuing with singing and group recitation, increase social distance to at least 10 feet between groups and ensure face coverings are worn. Restrooms should be regularly sanitized and have sufficient soap and hand sanitizer. Follow applicable guidance below for in-person activities. Congregate in groups of less than 50 people indoors. For in-person services that are indoors, the safest choice is to limit the number of people during a given service. Consider holding multiple services for multiple small groups, limiting to 50 in-person services to special events (e.g., weddings, funerals, baptisms), or limiting in-person activities to private prayer and worship. Some best practices include: Congregants who are living together sit together, at least 6 feet apart from other groups. Wear face coverings. Especially indoors, refrain from singing and group recitation, which significantly increases the risk of transmission of the virus by projecting respiratory droplets. Consider pre-recorded music or other alternatives. If continuing with singing and group recitation, increase social distance to at least 10 feet between groups and ensure face coverings are worn. Restrooms should be regularly sanitized and have sufficient soap and hand sanitizer. Follow applicable guidance below for in-person activities.

In reference to the right to \"peaceably assemble\" protected under the US Constitu- tion, would attendance a chur ch service constitute an \"essen tial activity\" and be considered a permissible activity under E xecutive Order 2020-18? 2. Would parishioners be required to maintain social distancing by being 6 feet apart? 3. If they are required to maintain 6 feet apart and do not, un der what law would they be in violation of and what punishment would they be subje ct to? Summary Answer Attendance at a church service is an \"essential activity\" under Executive Order 2020-18. The Executive Order does not impose an absolute six-foot social distancing requirement on es- sential activities that are constitutionally protected. Instea d, it provides flexibility to individuals Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-22 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 4 Page ID #:2502 engaged in constitutionally protected activities by encouraging such activities to be \"conducted in a manner that provides appropriate physical distancing to th e extent feasible.\" That being said, nothing in this opinion should be construed to require or recommend places of worship to reopen; that decision is beyond t he scope of a legal opinion. Background On March 11, 2020, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey issued a Declara tion of Emergency declaring a State of Emergency throughout Arizona due to the CO VID-19 outbreak. Pursuant to that State of Emergency, on March 30, 2020, Governor Ducey issu ed Executive Order 2020-18, which lists certain \"Essential Activities\" exempted from the or der's general proscription that \"all individuals ... shall limit their time away from their place of r esidence or property.\" Ariz. Exec. Order No. 2020-18 \u00a7 2 (March 30, 2020) (\"Executive Order\").1 These essential activities in- clude \"Engaging in constitutionally protected activities such a s speech and religion ... provided that such is conducted in a manner that provides appropriate ph ysical distancing to the extent feasible.\" Id. \u00a7 4(f). Analysis I. Attending Places of Worship Is an \"Essential Activity\" Attendance at a place of worship is clearly an \"essential activ ity\" under Executive Order 2020-18. The Executive Order expr essly provides that essential activities include \"[e]ngaging in constitutionally protected activ ities such as speech and religi on.\" Executive Order \u00a7 4(f). II. Social Distancing for Constit utionally Protected Activities The Executive Order exempts essential activities from the requi rement that individuals limit their time away from their place of residence or property . Executive Order \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6. Gener- 1 On April 29, 2020, the Governor iss ued Executive Order 2020-33 , to which this opinion is also applicable. Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-22 Filed 07/17/20 Page 2 of 4 Page ID #:2513 ally, when individuals engage in essential activities outside t heir residence or property, \"they shall to the extent possible maintain physical distancing of at least six feet from any other per- son, consistent with guidance from the CDC.\" Executive Order \u00a7 5 (emphasis added). The Ex- ecutive Order, however, provides even wider latitude when const itutionally protected activities \"such as speech and religion\" are involved. For constitutional ly protected activities, the Execu- tive Order does not mandate a set distancing requirement. Inst ead, it provides that such protect- ed activities be \"conducted in a manner that provides appropriate physical distancing to the ex- tent feasible .\" Executive Order \u00a7 4(f) (emphasis added). This flexible lan guage recognizes that what may be appropriate or feasible in one context may not be a ppropriate or feasible in another context. As such, the Executive Order encourages individuals t o act responsibly based on indi- vidual circumstances. The flexible language also helps ensure that appropriate leeway is provid- ed to individuals engaged in activities afforded heightened pro tections under both federal and state constitutions. No doubt recognizing the importance of th ese protections\u2014even when faced with an emergency declaration\u2014the \"intent of th[e] Or der\" expressly reatest extent possible.\" Ex ecutive Order \u00a7 14. III. Applicable Penalties for Con stitutionally Protected Activi ties As set forth above, the Executive Order does not impose an abso lute six-foot social dis- tancing requirement for essentia l that are constitut ionally protected, but rather requires \"appropriate physical distancing to the extent feasible.\" Id. \u00a7 4(f). Conclusion Executive Order 2020-18 proclaims that a state of emergency exi sts due to COVID-19 and implores all Arizonans to use their best judgment in suspen ding public activities that can be delayed, for the purposes of protect ing the individual and the public as well as p reserving vital Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-22 Filed 07/17/20 Page 3 of 4 Page ID #:2524 healthcare resources.

Mark Brnovich Attorney General Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-22 Filed 07/17/20 Page 4 of 4 Page ID #:253 1 April 21, 2020 Guidance for Houses of Worship During the COVID -19 Crisis During these challenging times, government and faith communities throughout Texas need to work together to love our neighbors and slow the spread of Coronavirus. To facilitate this collaboration , State and local governments must clearly articulate their di rectives aimed at mitigating spread of the virus. This updated joint guidance from the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Governor is the official guidance regarding the effect of Executive Order GA 16 on religious services conducted in c hurches, congregations, and houses of worship . The government must give special consideration to houses of worship when issuing order s related to the COVID -19 crisis . The First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I of the Texas Consti tution protect the right of Texans to worship and freely exercise their religion according to the dictates of their own consciences . In addition, t he Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") provides additional protections to faith communities, and government must ensure that it complies with RFRA when it acts, even during a disaster . Thus, when state or local governments issue orders prohibiting people from providing or obtaining certain services , they must ensure that these orders do not violate t hese constitutional and statutory rights. Houses of worship provide \"essential services .\" By executive order , Governor Abbott has define d essential services to include \"religious services conducted in churches, congregations, and houses of worship.\"1 Institutions providing these e ssential services can provide them under certain conditions described in Executive Order GA 16 and local orders by counties or municipalities that are consistent with GA 16. To the extent there is conflict between the Governor's Executive Order GA 16 and local orders, GA 16 control s. Local governments may not order houses of worship to close. Houses of worship should conduct as many activities as possible remotely , and should follow federal guidelines when providing services in person . Houses of worship should conduct as many of their activities as possible remotely . Services that houses of worship cannot conduct remotely should be conducted in accordance with guidance from the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n (\"CDC\").2 For example: 1 Exec. Order No. GA 16 at 3 (Apr. 17, 2020); see also Exec. Order No. GA 14 at 2 (Mar. 31, 2020) (superseded by GA 16). 2 Ctr. for Disease Control, Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) (Apr. 9, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-23 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 3 Page ID #:254 2 April 21, 2020 Instruct sick employees , volunteers, and guests to stay home; Practice social distancing by maintaining appropriate distance between people; Maintain good hygiene by washing your hands frequently, using hand sanitizer, using your elbow to cover coughs, and not touching your face; Implement environmental cleanliness and sanitization practices; and Clean and disinfect work areas frequently. Houses of worship , like providers of other essential services, are to follow additional guidance from the White House and CDC whenever possible .3 Houses of worship should help slow the spread of the virus . Texas is a big state and the transmission rate of COVID -19 varies in different communities. Texans also have big hearts and should love their neighbors by evaluating the rate of local community spread to determine the appropriate level of mitigation strate gies to implement.4 Houses of worship play an important role in this effort , and can use their creativity to help slow the spread of the virus. For example, a church could hold \"drive -in\" style services. Or because Executive Order GA 16 permits drive -thrus to provide goods and services , a house of worship may , according to their faith practices, provide communion or a blessing through a similar drive -up service. When conducting services, houses of worship may consider implementing the following practices: Encourage all attendees who are 65 and above to stay home and watch the services online , or provide a \"senior service\" exclusively for attendees 65 and above to attend in person . Ask all attendees who have an underlying at -risk health condition to stay hom e and watch the services online. Equip ushers and greeters with gloves and masks . Consider keeping child care closed, unless the house of worship can comply with CDC guidelines for child care facilities.5 community/ guidance -business -response.html ; Tex.

Ensure attendees sit with their family unit , use social distancing between each unit, and, if necessary, add more service times to facilitate distancing . Clergy should d ismiss attendees by family unit , maintaining social distancing. Staff should sanitize seats and frequently touched surfaces between services . Consider refraining from passing collection plates and instead provide a central collection box in the building or encourage online giving. Consider how the sacraments can be administered without attendees having to touch the same surfaces and objects. These guidelines do not violate the religious liberty of houses of worship. Under the extraordinary circumstances in which we temporarily live, t hese guidelines provide that houses of worship may remain open . The guidelines make only recommendations to houses of worship . They do not violate the religious liberty of houses of worship because the government has a compelling interest in recommending this guidance (stopping contagion) and the guidance is the least restrictive means of serving that compelling interest (allow ing hous es of worship to stay open for ministry, but suggest ing ways that help slow the spread of COVID -19).

Liberty Counsel represents Pastor Che A hn, Harvest Rock Church, and other California churches. (\"Clients\"). Harvest Rock Church has satellite and affiliated locations throughout California. Various COVID -19 orders have been issued by Governor Newsom and other State officials purporting to prohibit California residents, on pain of criminal sanctions, from gathering for indoor worship services in 3 3 counties in California (including those where many of C lient satellite churches are located) or from gathering in -person at Client c hurches (in the other 2 5 counties where worship is not totally prohibited) for worship services, if that worship service includes 101 individuals or more than 25% capacity (whichever is lower). In addition, f or our Client churches in counties that can still meet at all, Governor Newsom' s orders prohibit them from engaging in singing or chanting during their religious services, or from having small groups gather inside people's homes for small -group Bible studies and worship services. Governor N ewsom treats our C lients differently and discriminatorily, based on different religious activities in which our Clients engage at their Church buildings. Clients may feed the hungry, clothe the naked, house the homeless, and provide other critical social services to an Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-24 Filed 07/17/20 Page 1 of 4 Page ID #:257Church meeting bans and bans on singing and chanting July 16 , 2020 Page 2 unlimited number of individ uals in the same building and be exempt from the Governor's Orders. Yet, if Clients transition to a \"worship service\" with those same hungry, naked, or homeless individuals, then the Governor's Orders automatically kick in, and Clients are subject to crimi nal penalties. Additionally, while Governor Newsom has purported to significantly restrict the number of individuals permitted to \"gather\" in Client c hurches, he has imposed no similar restrictions on the untold thousands of protestors, rioters, and looters who have gathered all throughout California cities with no threat of criminal sanction, no social distancing, and no restrictions whatsoever. And, the Governor explicitly encouraged such large gatherings of protestors, rioters, and looters while condemning churches from signing hymns in their churches. Governor Newsom may not permit and encourage massive protest and gatherings in bla tant violation of his Orders , some of which are protected by the First Amendment, while prohibiting or impermissibly burdening religious activities, which are all protected by the First Amendment. In Church of the Lukum i Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520 (1993) [hereinafter Lukumi ], the Supreme Court held certain laws prohibiting religious practices violated the First Amendment, concluding \"that the laws in question were enacted by officials who did not understand, failed to perceive, or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violated the Nation's essential commitment to religious freedom.\" 508 U.S. at 524. Officials in other jurisdictions have threatened to impose criminal or other sanctions on other religious gatherings. In Louisville, Kentucky, for example, the government threatened to use police to impose criminal sanctions on those individuals found in violation of similar COVID -19 orders and threatened to impose various sanction s on individuals found in violation of such orders. The United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky found that the mere threat of such criminal sanction warranted a TRO. See On Fire Christian Center, Inc. v. Fischer , No. 3:20-cv-264-JRW, 2020 WL 1820249 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 11, 2020). The On Fire TRO enjoined the Mayor of Louisville from \"enforcing, attempting to enforce, threatening to enforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with any prohibition on drive -in church services at On Fire.\" Id. at *1 (emphasis added). In May 2020, two circuit courts of appeal issued three injunctions pending appeal (IPA) against enforcement of executive orde rs restricting worship services. See Maryville Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear , 957 F.3d 610 (6th Cir. 2020); Roberts v. , 958 F.3d 409 (6th Cir. 2020); First Pentecostal Church v. City of Holly Springs, Miss ., 959 F.3d 669 (5th Cir. 2020) (granting IPA to Mississippi church enjoining enforcement of Mississippi Governor's order restricting worship). A week after the Sixth Circuit's Roberts IPA, the Eastern District of North Carolina issued a TRO enjoining the North Carolina Governor from enforcing a 10 -person limit on religious worship because it violated the Free Exercise Clause. See Berean Baptist Chu rch v. Cooper , No. 4:20 -cv-81-D, 2020 WL 2514313 (E.D.N.C. May 16, 2020). Twice in April, three times in May, and once in June 2020, federal district courts enjoined COVID -19 prohibitions on religious worship. On April 18, 2020, the District of Kansas iss ued a TRO enjoining enforcement of a restriction on religious gatherings of more than 10 people, requiring the state to treat worship services the same as exempted \"essential\" gatherings. See First Baptist Church. v. Kelly , No. 20 -1102 -JWB, 2020 WL 191002 1, *6-7 (D. Kan. Apr. 18, 2020). The First Baptist TRO specifically stated that the government's disparate treatment of religious Case 2:20-cv-06414-JFW-PJW Document 1-24 Filed 07/17/20 Page 2 of 4 Page ID #:258Church meeting bans and bans on singing and chanting July 16 , 2020 Page 3 gatherings violated the Free Exercise Clause because it showed \"religious activities were specifically targeted for more onerou s restrictions than comparable secular activities.\" Id. at *7 (emphasis added). The court concluded that restricting religious gatherings while permitting other non-religious activities \"show[s] that these executive orders expressly target religious gather ings on a broad scale and are, therefore, not facially neutral.\" Id. Finally, the June district court decision enjoining COVID -19 orders restricting religious worship arose in the context of recent mass, race -related protests. In Soos v. Cuomo , No. 1:20 -cv- 651 (GLS/DJS), slip op. (N.D.N.Y. June 26, 2020) (attached hereto for your ready reference ), the district court preliminarily enjoined executive orders issued by the New York Governor and New York City Mayor, restricting worship services, after both officials publicly encouraged protests that violated their orders. Slip op. at 2 -14, 31 -32, 37 -38. Applying Lukumi , the Soos court held the restrictions were not generally applicable, and therefore had to satisfy strict scrutiny, because some restrictions applied uniquely to religious worship as a practical matter, and others were not applied to mass protests that clearly violated the restrictions. Slip op. at 29 -32. In times of national crisis, such as the current uncertainty arising from COVID -19, \"the fog of public excitement obscures the ancient landmarks set up in our Bill of Rights.\" American Communist Ass'n, C.I.O. v. Douds , 339 U.S. 382, 453 (1950) (Black, J., dissenting). But, where the fog of public excitement is at its apex, \"the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly.\" De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353, 365 (1937). Without doubt, \"[t]herein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.\" Id. Here, the State of C alifornia has failed to consider other, substantially less re strictive alternatives to an arbitrary numerical limitation for \"houses of worship .\" Other states have determined that churches are essential and may continue to operate with no numerical restrictions, provided they follow appropriate social distancing and personal hygiene practices . Strict enforcement of \"gathering orders\" limiting churches and religious meeting attendance , while allowing and encouraging mass protests of tens of thousands is discriminatory and unlawful. The state may not dictate the method or modes of worship, as it has tried to do in banning singing or chanting during religious worship services. The California Office of the Attorney General and other law enforcement agencies, acting at the direction of the Office of the Governor, are each acting under color of state law. The threat of enforcement action against our clients and other similarly situated C alifornia citizens deprives them of rights secured by the United States Constitution, including the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Liberty Counsel therefore requests that the C alifornia Office of the Attorney General respond in writing by 10:00 Pacific on July 17, that the above -detailed Orders have been rescinded. If I do not receive this response, Liberty Counsel will take further action to prevent irreparable harm to the rights of our clients. I may be reached at dschmid @lc.org. .

COVID -Related Restrictions Currently in Effect on Places of Worship and Comparison to Restrictions on Other Categories of Activity . The current scheme of COVID -19 restrictions in California is under the umbrella designation \"Blueprint for a Safer Economy\" ( the \" Blueprint \"),1 enacted August 28, which is a framework of risk tiers and sector -specific restrictions within each tier, appli ed and periodically adjusted county -by-county throughout the State. Exhibit A hereto is a chart (the \" Blueprint Sector Chart \") of the Blueprint tiers and corresponding sector restrictions.2 Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a chart (the \"Blueprint Data Char t\") classifying each county by tier and providing population and other metrics. Counties may move in both directions within the tier framework. By way of example, the Blueprint identifies tiers and corresponding specific restrictions for the \"Places of Worship\" sector as follows: Tier 1 -Widespread: No in-person, indoor worship allowed; a llowed to o pen outdoors only with no attendance limit . Tier 2 -Substantial: Allowed to open indoors at maximum of 25% capacity or 100 people , whichever is fewer , and outdoors with no attendance limit . 1 Blueprint for a Safer Economy , https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/ Pages/COVID -19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx . 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 2 of 130 Page ID #:859 2 Tier 3 -Moderate : Allowed to open indoors at maximum of 50% capacity or 200 people , whichever is fewer , and outdoors with no attendance limit . Tier 4-Minimal: Allowed to open indoors at maximum of 50% capacity , and outdoors with no attendance limit .3 In addition, the July 29 Worship Guidance (attached hereto as Exhibit C) prohibits indoor singing and chanting for places of worship .4 Political protests are permitted outdoors but are subject to the same indoor capacity restrictions and singing prohibition as worship services.5 Movie theaters and restaurants are subject to the same capacity and numerical restrictions as houses of worshi p. More stringent capacity and numerical restrictions apply to gyms, wineries, bars, family entertainment centers, cardrooms, and offices. Less stringent restrictions apply to critical infrastructure, limited services, hair salons, hotels, shopping centers , personal care centers, and museums. Concert, performance, or 3 Places of worship may open for drive -in services (with no attendance limit) and to conduct services online or through other remote technology statewide.

Changes to Restrictions Since Filing of Compla int and Preliminary Injunction Hearing . Since the filing of Appellants' Verified Complaint (Dkt. 6 -5) on July 17, 2020, and the district court 's preliminary injunction hearing on August 12, 2020 (Dkt. 11 - 2 at SER000207 -225), the State's adoption of the Bl ueprint scheme constitutes the only material changes to the COVID -19 restrictions applicable to places of worship and other sectors.9 The Blueprint changes comprise, inter alia , the following: 6 COVID -19 Industry Guidance: Dine Restaurants (July 29, 2020), https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance -dine-in-restaurants.pdf (Exhibit E hereto). 7 COVID -19 Industry Guidance: Schools and School -Based Programs (Aug. 3, 2020), https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance -schools.pdf (Exhibit F hereto ). 8 CDPH Guidance for the Prevention of COVID -19 Transmission for Gatherings (Sept. 12, 2020), https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID -of-COVID -19-Transmission -for-Gatherings.aspx (Exhibit G hereto ). 9 The July 29 Worship Guidance replaced t he July 6 Worship Guidance in effect at the time of filing ( Dkt. 6 -5 at 170-183), but did not materially alter the prior . Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 4 of 130 Page ID #:861 4 August 28 Health Order . The August 28 Health Order (Exhibit H hereto) authorizes the Blueprint framework of tiers and sectors.10 The Order leaves in place all other statewide health guidances not expressly altered by the Order. The Blueprint also leaves in place, to the extent not expressly altered, the March 19 Stay - at-Home Order (Dkt. 6 -5 at 85). The Blueprint tiers and sector -specific restrictions for Places of Worship under the August 28 Health Order supersede the July 13 Health Order (Dkt. 6 -5 at 184). The July 13 Health Order prohibited indoor worship in counties on the County Monitoring List (32 at the time the Verified Complaint was filed). (Dkt. 6 -5 at 186.) Counties not on the Monitoring List were subject to the July 29 Worship Guidance , which prohib ited (and still prohibi ts) indoor singing and chanting , and limit ed indoor worship services to 25% capacity or 100 people, whichever was fewer . The 30 counties classified as Tier 1 -Widespread under the Blueprint as of September 15 include most of the counties that were on the n ow superseded County Monitoring List at the time the Verified Complaint was filed , including Los Angeles County where Appellant Harvest Rock Church's Los Angeles and Pasadena campuses are located, and Riverside County where its Corona campus is located . 10 Statewide Public Health Officer Order (Aug. 28, 2020), https://www.cdph .ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 5 of 130 Page ID #:862 5 Orange County, where Harvest Rock Church's Irvine campus is located, was on the County Monitoring List at the time the Verified Complaint was filed , but as of September 15 was classified as Tier 2 -Substantial under the Blueprint . Appellant Harvest Internatio nal Ministry, Inc. has 162 member churches located throughout California in various Blueprint tiers. (V. Compl. , Dkt. 6 -5, \u00b6\u00b6 48, 54, 97, 120-123; Blueprint Data Chart, Ex. B hereto.) Industry Guidance . Some restrictions applicable to sectors other than houses of worship under the Blueprint are different as compared to the restrictions in effect at the time of the Complaint and the preliminary injunction hearing , but some are not. (See Industry guidance to red uce risk , https://covid19.ca.gov/industry - guidance/ (last updated Sept. 17, 2020 , 8:31 AM) (hereinafter, \" Industry Guidance \"). For example: o Grocery stores are designated \"Essential Critical Infrastructure\" operations under the Governor's April 28 Essential Workforce Guidance (V. Compl., Dkt. 6 -5, \u00b6\u00b6 77 -78; Dkt. 6 -5 at 117), in effect at the time of filing, and are now classified in the \" Retail \" sector of th e Blueprint, subject to the Industry Guidance and the July 29 Retail Guidance (Exhibit I hereto ).11 Whereas, at the time of filing grocery stores could operate without capacity or numerical limit under 11 COVID -19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Retail 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 6 of 130 Page ID #:863 6 the April 28 Essential Workforce Guidance (Dkt. 6 -5 at 117) , the Blueprint permits grocery stores to operate at 50% capacity under Tier 1 -Widespread and Tier 2-Substantial, but without numerical limit s under Tier 3 -Moderate and Tier 4 - Minimal . o Other retail stores which are designated \"Essential C ritical Infrastructure\" operations under the April 28 Essential Workforce Guidance , in effect at the time of filing , such as Walmart and Costco (Dkt. 6 -5 at 117), are also now classified in the \" Retail \" sector of the Blueprint, subject to the Industry Guid ance and the July 29 Retail Guidance . Whereas, at the time of filing essential retail stores could operate without capacity or numerical limit, t he Blueprint permits essential retail stores to operate at 25% capacity under Tier 1 -Widespread, 50% capacity u nder Tier 2 -Substantial, but without numerical limit s under Tier 3 - Moderate and Tier 4 -Minimal . o Laundromats are designated \"Essential Critical Infrastructure\" operations under the Governor's April 28 Essential Workforce Guidance (Dkt. 6 -5 at 134), in effect at the time of filing, and are now classified in the \"Limited Services\" sector of the Blueprint, subject to the Industry Guidance and July 29 Limited Services Guidance (Exhibit J hereto ).12 As was true at the time of filing, 12 See COVID -19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Limited Services (July 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 7 of 130 Page ID #:864 7 however, the Blueprint permits laundromats to operate without numerical limit, subject to distancing and other restrictions . o Warehouses are designated \"Essential Critical Infrastructure\" operations under the Governor's April 28 Essential Workforce Guidance ( Dkt. 6-5 at 113, 117, 121, 133), in effect at the time of filing, and are now classified in the \"Logistics and warehousing facilities\" sector of the Blueprint, subject to the Industry Guidance and July 29 Logistics and Warehousing Guidance (Exhibit K hereto ).13 As was true at the time of filing, however, the Blueprint permits warehouses to operate without numerical limits , subject to dis tancing and other restrictions . o Movie theate rs are classified in the \"Movie theaters and family entertainment centers\" sector of the Blu eprint, subject to the Industry Guidance and the July 29 Family Entertainment Guidance (Exhibit L hereto ).14 Whereas, at the time of filing indoor services at movie theaters were prohibited statewide under the July 13 Health Order , the Blueprint prohibits indoor services under Tier 1 - Widespread , but permits indoor services at 25% capacity or 100 people , whichever 13 See COVID -19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Logistics and Warehousing Facilities (July 29, 2020), https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance -logistics -warehousing -- en.pdf . 14 See COVID -19 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 8 of 130 Page ID #:865 8 is fewer, under Tier 2 -Substantial, 50% capacity or 200 people , whichever is fewer, under Tier 3 -Moderate , and 50 % capacity under Tier 4 -Minimal . 3. Effects of Restriction Changes on Parties' Arguments. a. Appellants state severally, and not jointly with Appellee: The restriction changes do not weaken , and actually strengthen, Appellants' arguments . Although the Blueprint tightened some restrictions on some sectors , Appellants' disparat e treatment arguments are essentially unaffected because patrons and workers of many operations involving patently similar risks (e.g., grocery stores, other essential retail stores, laundromats, warehouses) retain more favorable treatment of their liberties as compared to houses o f worship, which remain subject to indoor worship bans in most of the State15 (including in private homes with non - household members), and indoor singing bans and capacity restrictions in the rest of the state. Houses of worship are also still permitted to provide nonreligious, \"critical infrastructure\" services (food, shelter, necessities of life) in their own buildings without capacity or numerical limits , but cannot conduct religious worship services for the same number of people in the same buildings. Moreover, in the State's several July 29 Guidances incorporated into the Blueprint, the State repeats the admission 15 As of September 15, 2020, the State classified 30 counties as Tier 1 -Widespread (76.38% of State population), 17 counties as Tier 2 -Substantial (22.57% of population), 9 counties as Tier 3 -Moderate (1.02% of population), and 2 counties as Tier 4 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 9 of 130 Page ID #:866 9 that it has no risk data to support the disparities in restrictions between sectors, including as between houses of worship and critical infr astructure, warehouse, and grocery operations ,16 which nullifies any narrow tailoring argument by the Governor \u2014and it remains the Governor's burden to justify the restriction disparitie s. (Dkt. 6-1 at 18 -19.) Furthermore, the Blueprint prolongs indefinitely the State's restriction scheme ,17 further defeating narrow tailoring. b. Appellee states severally, and not jointly with Appellants: The changes after the filing of the complaint and the August 12 hearing do not weaken Appellee's arguments . Under the Blueprint, a ctivities that pose risks comparable to or greater than worship services, like movie theatres, concerts, and sporting events , are still subject to similar or greater restrictions than worship services . See Exhibi t A; SER 170, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22. In addition, while activities like retail 16 See, e.g. , July 29 Retai l Guidance , Ex. I hereto , at 2 ( \"Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time . There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID -19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses , meat processing plants, and grocery stores .\" (emphasis added) ); July 29 Limited Services Guidance, Ex. J hereto, at 2 (same); July 29 Logistics and Warehousing Guidance , Ex. K hereto, at 2 (same) ; July 29 Family Entertainment Guidance, Ex. L hereto, at 2 (same) ; July 29 Worship Guidance, Ex. C hereto , at 2 ( the only Guidance to include \"places of worship \" as example ). 17 See August 28 Health Order, Ex. H hereto, at 3 (\"This order shall remain in effect until I determine it is appropriate to modify the order based on public health conditions. \"). Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 10 of 130 Page ID #:867 10 stores , grocery shopping , laundromats, and warehouses are subject to less stringent restrictions, those activities do not pose comparable risks because they are not congregate activities in which large groups of people not normally in contact gather in one place simultaneously for extended period s of time , much l ess with si nging and chanting, and also because, in some instances, other means of reducing the risk of transmission are available . SER 171 -172, \u00b6\u00b6 26 -27.18 Indoor singing and chanting are prohibited in schools, restaurants, and protests, while other a ctivities with similar risks, including spectator sports, concerts, and theatrical performances, are prohibited statewide. Indeed, by relaxing r estrictions on many activities and provid ing deeper reductions based on the circumstances in each county, the Blueprint strengthens Appellees' argument that the State has been considering less restrictive alternatives and narrowly tailor ing its COVID -19 restrictions.19 18 Plaintiffs' charitable activities are treated differently because they are not comparable. As the district court noted, running a food pantry is like a grocery store, Dkt. 6 -2 at 4 (as is a clothes distribution), and homeless shelters are subject to exten sive habitability and sanitary requirements. Moreover, Plaintiffs provide no information in their complaint about their charitable activities, noting only that they \"feed the hungry, give water to the thirsty, clothe the naked, house the homeless, and counsel the afflicted\" Dkt. 6 -5 at 18, \u00b6 51, and have therefore not carried their burden to demonstrate that comparable activities are treated differently. 19 Although Plaintiffs claim in their section and in footnote 16 that the State has admitted \"it has no risk data,\" the cited text actually states that \" Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time .\" Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 11 of 130 Page ID #:868 11 DATED this September 21, 2020. /s/ Roger K.

COVID-19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Places of Worship and Providers of Religious Services and Cultural Ceremonies July 29, 2020 covid19.ca.gov 1 EXHIBIT C Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 20 of 130 Page ID #:877 OVERVIEW On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID -19 among the population. The impact of COVID -19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed sympt oms. Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID -19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include places of worship, hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. As stay -at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to ensure the safety of workers and the public. Key prevention practices include: physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, use of face coverings by workers and volunteers (where respiratory protection is not required) and congregants/visitors, frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, training workers and volunteers on these and other elements of the COVID -19 prevention plan. In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the v irus. PURPOSE This document provides guidance for places of worship and providers of religious services and cultural ceremonies (referred to collectively as \"places of worship\") to support a safe, clean environment for workers , interns and trainees, volunt eers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, visitors, etc. (referred to collectively as \"visitors\" or \"congregants\" ). This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in -person activity. Further, it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote 2 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 21 of 130 Page ID #:878 servic es and other related activities for tho se who are vulnerable to COVID -19 including older adult s and those with co-morbidities. Even with adherenc e to physical distancing , convening in a congregationa l setting of multiple diff erent household s to practice a perso nal faith ca rries a relativ ely higher risk for widespread transmissio n of the COVID-19 virus, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospita lizatio n, and death, especially amo ng mo re vulnerable populatio ns. In partic ular, activities such as singing and chanti ng nega te the risk- reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. *Places of worship must therefore discontinue indoor singing and chanting activities and limit indoor attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction's key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of six feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protoco ls within this document. This revised limitation will be s ubject to regular review by the California Dep artment of Public Health in consultation with loca l Departments of Public Health to assess the impac t of these imposed limits on public hea lth and provid e further direction as part of a phased- in restoratio n of activities in places of worship. NOTE: This guidance is not intended for food preparation and service, delivery of items to those in need, childcare and daycare services, school and educational activities, in -home caregiving, counseling, office work, and other activities that places and organiz ations of worship may provide. Organizations that perform these activities must follow applicable guidance on the COVID -19 Resilience Roadmap website . The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health -related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage . The CDC has additional guidance for community -and faith -based organizations. Required Use of Face Coverings On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings , which broadly requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 3 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 22 of 130 Page ID #:879 whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any m ember of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walki ng through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person's own household or residence) are present when unable to physically distance; Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended . Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance . Fac e covering s are strongly encouraged in other circumstances , and employ ers can implement additiona l fac e covering requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meet s one of the exemption s from wearing a fac e covering . If a wo rker who would otherwis e be required to wear a fac e covering because of frequent contact with othe rs cannot wear o ne due to a medica l conditio n, they should be provided with a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medica l condition permit s it. Business es that are open to the public should be cogniza nt of the exemption s to wearing face covering s in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member of the public for not wearing a fac e covering if that person i s complying with the guidance . Bus inesse s will need to develop polic ies fo r handling these exemptio ns amo ng customers , clients, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 23 of 130 Page ID #:880 Workplace Specific Plan Establish a written, workplace -specific COVID -19 prevention plan at every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and all work tasks , and designate a person at each workplace to implement the plan. Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions . Identify contact information for the local health department where the workp lace is located for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among workers and congregants/visitors. Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives . Regularly evaluate workplaces for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak , in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive workers and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cau se operations to be temporarily closed or limited. Topics for Worker and Volunteer Training Information on COVID -19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which underlying health con ditions may make individuals more susceptible to contracting the virus. Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks using CDC guidelines . The importance of not coming to work or participating in activities o If a worker has symptoms of COVID -19 as described by the 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 24 of 130 Page ID #:881 such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny no se, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea , OR o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID -19 and has not yet been released from isolation, OR o If within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID -19 and is considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation ). To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without t he use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 test . To seek medical attention if their sy mptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webp age. The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Physical Distancing section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded after each shift. Information contained in t he CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 6 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 25 of 130 Page ID #:882 Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled . Ensure all types of workers including temporary, independent contract ors, and volunteer workers are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention policies and have necessary PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary, contract, and/or volunteer staff. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker's compensation for COVID -19, including worker 's sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Respons e Act and worker 's rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor' s Executive Order N -62-20 while that Order is in effect. Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker and/or volunteer leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. Encourage workers and congregants/visitors who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19, or who have family members who are ill, to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers and volunteers use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves, where necessary. Places of worship should consider where disposable gloves use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched ite ms. All workers and volunteers should wear gloves when handling items contaminated by body fluids. 7 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 26 of 130 Page ID #:883 Workers, volunteers, etc. , should not enter the home or visit someone who has tested positive for, exhibited symptoms of, or has been in contact with someone infected with COVID -19 for an appropriate waiting period as described by CDC guidelines. Places of worship must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in strategic and highly -visible locations and in reservation confirmations , to remind congregants and visitors that they must use face coverings and practice physical distancing and should frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds , use hand sanitizer , and not touch their face . Use social media, website, texts, email, newsletters, etc., to communicate the steps being taken to protect congregants/visitors and workers so that they are familiar with the policies (in cluding to stay home if experiencing symptoms or are at increased risk of becoming sick, face coverings, physical distancing, handwashing and/or sanitizing, and cough etiquette), before arriving at the facility. Workers and volunteers are strongly encourag ed to remind congregants/visitors of these practices with announcements during services or on welcoming guests. Remind congregants and visitors in advance to bring a face covering and make them available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. Congregants/visitors should be screened for temperature and/or symptoms upon arrival to places of worship and asked to use hand sanitizer. Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols Perform thorough cleaning of high traffic areas such as lobbies, halls, chapels, meeting rooms, offices, libraries, and study areas and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including doorknobs, toilets, handwashing facilities, pulpits and podiums, donation boxes or plates, altars, and pews and seating areas. Establish frequent cleaning and disinfection of personal work ar eas such as desks and cubicles and supply the necessary cleaning products. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of the workers' job duties. Discour age sharing items used in worship and services (such as prayer books, cushions, prayer rugs, etc.) whenever possible and provide single - use or digital copies or ask congregants/visitors to bring personal items 8 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 27 of 130 Page ID #:884 instead. Avoid sharing work equipment and sup plies, such as phones, office equipment, computers, etc., wherever possible. Never share PPE. Where such items must be shared, disinfect between shifts or uses, whichever is more frequent, including the following: shared office equipment (copiers, fax mach ines, printers, telephones, keyboards, staplers, etc.) and shared worship items, etc., with a cleaner appropriate for the surface. Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. Consider more frequently cleaning and disinfecting handwashing facilities that are used more often. Use signage to reinforce handwashing. Disinfect microphones and stands, music stands, instruments and other items on pulpits and podiums between each use. Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam mufflers. Consider using disposable seat covers for congregants/visitors, particularly on porous surfaces or where a facility has multiple daily services. Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Provide disposable or washable covers on pillows used as seating on floors and change/wash them after each use. Install hand sanitizer dispen sers, touchless whenever possible, at entrances and contact areas such as meeting rooms, lobbies, and elevator landings. When choosing disinfecting chemicals, establishments should use products approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved list and follow pr oduct instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Pro vide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers and volunteers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves or other protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma - safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. Wash religious garments and linens after each service or event, at the highest water setting possible. As k congregants/visitors to bring their own storage bags for personal garments and shoes. Workers , congregants, and visitors should wear gloves when handling others' 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 28 of 130 Page ID #:885 Discontinue passing offering plates and similar items that move be tween people. Use alternative giving options such as secure drop boxes that do not require opening/closing and can be cleaned and disinfected. Consider implementing digital systems that allow congregants/visitors to make touch -free offerings. Mark walking paths between spaces designated for congregants/visitors to sit/kneel so that people do not walk where someone may touch their head to the floor. During meetings and services, introduce fresh outside air, for example by opening doors/windows (weather permitting) and operating ventilation systems. Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible. Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in worship areas, offices, and other spaces. Physical Distancing Guidelines Places of worship should continue to provide services through alternative methods (such as via internet live and/or recorded streaming, telephone, drive -in, etc.) whenever possible. Consider holding in -person meetings and providing in -person se rvices outside whenever possible. Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between workers and congregants/visitors, etc. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor or pew markings or signs to indicate where people should sit and stand). Reconfigure seating and standing areas to maintain physical distancing of six feet or more between congregants/visitors from different households. Consider limiting seating to alternate rows. Members of the same household may be seated together but should maintain at least six feet of distance from other households. Consider dedicating workers to help people maintain distances during activities. Shorten services to limit the length of time congregants/visitors spend at facilities whenever possible. This could include limiting speeches, asking congregants/visitors to put on garments at hom e before arrival, etc. 10 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 29 of 130 Page ID #:886 Close places of worship for visitation outside of scheduled services, meetings, etc., whenever possible. Consider implementing a reservation system to limit the number of congregants/visitors attending facilities at a time. This can include the use of digital platforms or other types of tools. Encourage congregants/visitors to meet with the same group, particularly when services meet frequently and/or require a certain number of people to be present. This can reduce the spread of transmission by minimizing the number of different individuals who come into close contact with each other. Consider offering additional meeting times (per day or per week) so that fewer guests attend meetings and services at one time. Clean meeting areas between each use as described in this guidance. Discontinue large gatherings that encourage congregants/visitors to travel and break physical distances during activities, such as concerts, large holiday and life event celebrations and remembrances. Childre n should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at any time while visiting facilities. Close play areas and discontinue activities and services for children where physical distancing of at least six feet cannot be maintained. Encourage congregants/visitors to physically distance themselves from others outside their household, avoid touching surfaces, and to leave the facility if they do not feel well. Consider limiting touching for religious and/or cultural purposes, such as holding hands, to members of the same household. Dedicate workers to direct guests to meeting rooms upon entry to places of worship rather than congregating in lobbies or common areas. Consider using ushers to he lp people find places to sit and stand that are at least six feet apart from other guests/household groups. Ask congregants/visitors to arrive and leave in a single group to minimize crossflow of people. Welcome and dismiss congregants/visitors from altars , podiums, meeting rooms, etc. in an orderly way to maintain physical distancing and minimize crossflow of traffic, to the extent possible. Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when congregants/visitors are entering and exiting facilities, if possib le and in accordance with security and safety protocols. Close or restrict common areas, such as break rooms, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 30 of 130 Page ID #:887 etc. where people are likely to congregate and interact. Consider installing barriers or increase physical distance between tables/seating when there is continued use of these areas. Remove from service or find low -community touch alternatives for communal/religious water containers such as fonts, sinks, and vessels. Empty and change water between uses. Where there is a possibi lity of contaminant splash, workers , congregants, visitors, etc., are strongly encouraged to use equipment to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth using a combination of face coverings, protective glasses, and/or face shields. Reusable protective equipment su ch as shields and glasses should be properly disinfected between uses. When washing is a required activity, modify practices whenever possible to limit splashing and the need to clean and disinfect washing facilities. Encourage necessary washing to be perf ormed at home prior to entering a facility, if possible. Reconfigure podiums and speaker areas, office spaces, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc., to allow for at least six feet between people. Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, and designate separate routes for entry and exit into meeting rooms, offices, etc., to help maintain physical distancing and lessen the instances of people closely passing each other. Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator at a time . Post signage regarding these policies. Utilize practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of workers and congregants/visitors in office, meeting spaces, etc., at one time. Th is may include scheduling (e.g. staggering start/end times), establishing alternating days for onsite reporting, returning to places of worship in phases, or continued use of telework when feasible. Consider offering workers and volunteers who request modi fied duties options that minimize their contact with congregants/visitors and other workers (e.g., office duties rather than working as an usher or managing administrative needs through telework). Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour reg ulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings via phone and internet. Close self -service item selection such as pamphlet displays and bookshelves and provide these items to congregants/ visitors individually as necessary. Consider delivering items and information electronically. 12 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 31 of 130 Page ID #:888 Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow for physical distancing. Discourage workers , congregants, visitors, etc., from engaging in handshakes, hugs, and similar greetings that break physical distance. Take reasonable measures to remind people to wave or use other greetings. Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper separation (e.g., closi ng every other space). If performing drive -in services, ensure vehicle windows and doors are closed if six feet of distance is not possible between vehicles. Continue to support non -in person attendance of services and other related activities by those who are vulnerable to COVID -19 including older adults and those with co-morbidities. Considerations for Places of Worship Discontinue offering self -service food and beverages. Do not hold potlucks or similar family -style eating and drinking events that incr ease the risk of cross contamination. If food and beverages must be served, provide items in single -serve, disposable containers whenever possible. Workers or volunteers serving food should wash hands frequently and wear disposable gloves. Discontinu e singing (in rehearsals, services, etc.) , chanting , and other practices and performances where there is increased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets. Consider practicing these activities through alternative methods (such as internet streaming) that ensure individual congregation members perform these activities separately in their own homes. Consider modifying practices that are specific to particular faith traditions that might encourage the spread of COVID -19. Examples are discontinuing kissing of ritual objects, allowing rites to be performed by fewer people, avoiding the use of a common cup, offering communion in the hand instead of on th e tongue, providing pre -packed communion items on chairs prior to service, etc., in accordance with CDC guidelines . 13 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 32 of 130 Page ID #:889Consid erations for Funerals Consider reduced visitor capacity and stagger visitation times at funerals, wakes, etc., if possible. Follow all cleaning and disinfection measures as described in this guidance. Whenever possible, remind visitors to maintain physical distance from each other, from workers and volunteers, and from the deceased. Consider modifying religious or cultural practices when washing or shrouding bodies of those who have died from COVID -19, in accordance with guidance from CDPH and the CDC . If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, work with funeral home staff and families to reduce exposure as much as possible. All people participating in these activities must wear disposable gloves and if there will be splashing of fluids, people must use additional protecti ve equipment including protection for the eyes, nose, and mouth, such as face shields. Consult and comply with local guidance regarding limits on gathering sizes, travel, holding funerals for those who died from COVID -19, etc. Consider other recommendations and modifications of services related to places of worship outlined above, as applicable for funeral services. 1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Places of worship must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) . Additionally, places of worship must be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change. 14 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 33 of 130 Page ID #:890Stay home Q&A - Coronavirus COVID-19 Response https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/ 1 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 34 of 130 Page ID #:891Stay home Q&A - Coronavirus COVID-19 Response 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 35 of 130 Page ID #:892Stay home Q&A - Coronavirus COVID-19 Response 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 36 of 130 Page ID #:893Stay home Q&A - Coronavirus COVID-19 Response 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 37 of 130 Page ID #:894Stay home Q&A - Coronavirus COVID-19 Response 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 38 of 130 Page ID #:895Stay home Q&A - Coronavirus COVID-19 Response 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 39 of 130 Page ID #:896Stay home Q&A - Coronavirus COVID-19 Response 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 40 of 130 Page ID #:897 COVID -19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Dine -In Restaurants July 29, 2020 All guidance should be implemented only with county health officer approval following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing, and testing. 1 EXHIBIT E Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 41 of 130 Page ID #:898 OVERVIEW On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the Ca lifornia Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID -19 among the population. The impact of COVID -19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported illness ranges fr om very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. Precise infor mation about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at ri sk of acquiring or transmitting COVID -19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. As stay -at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to ensure the safety of workers and the public. Key prevention practices include: physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required) and customers/clients, frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, training workers on these and other elements of the COVID -19 prevention plan. In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. PURPOSE This document provides guidance for dine -in restaurants, brewpubs, craft distilleries, brewe ries, bars, pubs, and wineries to support a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health - related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID -19 webpage . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has guidance for restaurants and the CDC has additi onal requirements in their guidance for businesses Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 42 of 130 Page ID #:899 Brewpubs, breweries, bars, pubs, craft distilleries, and wineries should remain closed until those establishments are allowed to resume modified or full operation unless they are offering sit -down, dine -in meals. Alcohol can only be sold in the same transaction as a meal. Brewpubs, breweries, pubs, craft distilleries, and wineries in counties whose health officer has approved further reopening may follow the guidance for restaurants, wineries, and bars on the COVID -19 County Roadmap website. Dine -in restaurants, brewpubs, breweries, bars, pubs, craft distilleries, and wineries that provide sit -down meals should follow the restaurant guidance below and should continue to encourage takeout and delivery service whenever possible. Brewpubs, breweries, bars, pubs, craft distilleries, and wineries that do not provide sit-down meals themselves, but can contract with another vendor to do so, can serve dine -in meals provided both businesses follow the guidance below and alcohol is only sold in the same transaction as a meal. Venues that are currently authorized to provide off sale beer, wine, and spirits to be consumed off premises and do not offer sit -down, dine -in meals should follow the guidance for retail operations and offer curbside sales only, until local and/or statewide rules allow additional retail activity. Producers of beer, wine, and spirits should follow the guidance for manufacturing operations . This guidance is not intended for c oncert, performance, or entertainment venues. Those types of establishments should remain closed until they are allowed to resume modified or full operation through a specific reopening order or guidance. Establishments that serve full meals must discontin ue this type of entertainment until these types of activities are allowed to resume modified or full operation. Required Use of Face Coverings On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings , which broadly requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any m ember of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walki ng through common areas, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 43 of 130 Page ID #:900 elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person's own household or residence) are present when unable to physically distance ; Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended. Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can b e found in the guidance . Face covering s are stron gly encouraged in other circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers. 4 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 44 of 130 Page ID #:901 Workplace Specific Plan Establish a written, work place -specific COVID -19 preve ntion plan at every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and work tasks , and designate a person at each establishment to implement the plan. Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions . Identify contac t information for the local health department where the restaurant is located for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among workers or customers. Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan ava ilable to workers and their representatives . Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak , in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive worker( s) and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. Topics for Worker Training Information on COVID -19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to contracting the virus. Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks using CDC guidelines . The importance of not coming to work : 5 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 45 of 130 Page ID #:902 o If a worker has symptoms of COVID -19 as described by the CDC , such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or sme ll, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea , OR o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID -19 and has not yet been released from isolation , OR o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID -19 and is considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation ). To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 test . To seek medic al attention if their symptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webpage . The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Physical Distancing section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be share d and should be washed or discarded after each shift. 6 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 46 of 130 Page ID #:903 Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled . Ensure any independent contractors, temporary or contract workers, and volunteers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker's compensation for COVID -19, including workers' sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Governor's Executive Order N -51-20, and workers ' rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor' s Executive order N -62-20 while that Order is in effect . Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19 to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective equipment, including face coverings and gloves where necessary. Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items contaminated by body fluids. Servers, bussers, and other workers moving items used by customers (dirty 7 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 47 of 130 Page ID #:904 cups, plates, napkins, etc.) or handling trash bags should use disposable gloves (and wash hands before putting them on and after removing them) and provide aprons and change frequently. Dishwashers should use equipment to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth from contaminant splash using protective glasses, goggles, or a face shield in addition to a face covering . Dishwashers must be provided impermeable aprons and change frequently. Reusable protective equipment such as shields and glasses should be properly disinfected between uses. Establishments must take reasonable measures, including posting signage at all entrances and in strategic and highly -visible locat ions and in reservation confirmations, to remind the public that they must use face coverings while not eating and drinking and practice physical distancing and that they should frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, use hand sanitizer , and not touch their face. Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. Guests and visitors should be screened for temperature and/or symptoms upon arrival, asked to u se hand sanitizer, and to wear a face covering when not eating or drinking. Employers have the right to cancel reservations for individuals/parties with symptomatic guests. Display a set of clearly visible rules for customers and restaurant personnel at th e restaurant entrance(s) that are to be a condition of entry. The rules could include instructions to use hand sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other customers, avoid unnecessary touching of restaurant surfaces, contact information for the local health department, and changes to restaurant services. Whenever possible, the rules should be available digitally, include pictograms, and included on/with menus . Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as customer waiting areas and lobbies, break rooms, lunch areas and areas of ingress and egress including host stands, entry ways, stairways, stairwells, escalators, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including doors, door handles, crash bars, light switches, waiting area chairs, credit card terminals, ATM PIN pads, receipt trays, bus tubs, serving trays, phones, toilets, and handwashing facilities. Frequently clean items touched by patrons, especially those that might attract contact from children including candy and toy vending machines, 8 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 48 of 130 Page ID #:905 decorative fish tanks, display cases, decorative fountains, etc. Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is more frequent, including but no t limited to working surfaces, phones, registers, touchpads/touchscreens, tablets, timeclocks, appliances, kitchen and bar utensils and implements, oven doors, grill and range knobs, carts and trolleys, keys, etc. Avoid sharing audio equipment, phones, tab lets, laptops, desks, pens, and other work supplies wherever possible. Never share PPE. Discontinue shared use of audio headsets and other equipment between workers unless the equipment can be properly disinfected after use. Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam earmuffs. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of the workers ' job duties. Procure options for third -party cleaning companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed. Equip spaces such as dining rooms, bar areas, host stands, and kitchens with proper sanitation products, including hand sa nitizer and sanitizing wipes to all staff directly assisting customers. Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tables poons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves as required by the product instructions and ensure proper ventilation . Continue to follow existing codes regarding requirements for sanitizing (rather than disinfecting) food contact surfaces. To minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Restaurants should increase fresh air circulation by opening windows or 9 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 49 of 130 Page ID #:906 doors, if possible and in accordance with security and safety protocols . Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible. Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all working areas. Provide disposable menus to guests and make menus available digitally so that customers can view on a personal electronic device, if possible. If disposable menus cannot be provided, properly disinfect menus before and after customer use. Consider options for customers to order ahead of time. Discontinue pre -setting tables with napkins, cutlery, glassware, food ware, etc. These should be supplied individually to customers as needed. Do not leave card stands, flyers, napkin holders, or other items on tables. Suspend use of shared food items such as condiment bottles, salt and pepper shakers, etc. and provide these foods in single serve containers, if possible. Where this is not possible, shared items such as condiment bottles, shakers, etc., should be supplied as needed to customers and disinfected after each use. Pre-roll utensils in napkins prior to use by customers. Workers must wash hands before pre -rolling utensils in napkins. The pre -roll should then be stored in a clean container. After customers are seated, the pre -roll should be put on the table by a worker who recently washed their hands. Reusable cu stomer items including utensils, food ware, breadbaskets, etc., must be properly washed, rinsed, and sanitized. Cleaned flatware, stemware, dishware, etc., must be properly stored away from customers and personnel until ready for use. Use disposable items if proper cleaning of reusable items is infeasible. Takeout containers must be filled by customers and available only upon request. Dirty linens used at dining tables such as tablecloths and napkins should be removed after each customer use and transported from dining areas in sealed bags. Workers should wear gloves when handling dirty linens. Thoroughly clean each customer dining loca tion after every use. This will include disinfecting tables, chairs, booster seats, highchairs, booths, etc. and allowing adequate time for proper disinfection, following product instructions. Many EPA -approved disinfectants require minimal contact 10 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 50 of 130 Page ID #:907 time (s econds to one minute) against human coronavirus. Consider using disposable seat covers, particularly on porous surfaces. Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Provide disposable or washable covers on pillows used in seating areas and change/wash them after each use. Close areas where customers may congregate or touch food or food ware items that other guests may use. Modify delivery of these items by providing items to guests individually, converting to cafeteria -style service, etc. Discard or clean, disinfect, or sanitize shared items after each use, as appropriate. The areas that should be closed include but are not limited to: o Self-service areas with pitchers, to-go containers, etc. o Self-service machines including ice, soda, frozen yogurt dispensers, etc. o Self-service food areas such as buffets, salsa bars, salad bars, etc. Discontinue tableside food preparation and presentation such as food item selection carts and conveyor belts, guacamole preparation, etc. Do not leave out after -meal mints, candies, snacks, or toothpicks for customers. Offer them with the check or provide only on request. Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless if possible, at guest and worker entrances and contact areas such as driveways, reception areas, in dining rooms, near elevator landings, etc. Discontinue use of shared entertainment items such as board games, pool tables, arcade games, vending machines, etc. Close game and entertai nment areas where customers may share items such as bowling alleys, etc. Physical Distancing Guidelines Prioritize outdoor seating and curbside pickup to minimize cross flow of customers in enclosed environments. Restaurants can expand their outdoor seating, and alcohol offerings in those areas, if they comply with local laws and regulations. Provide takeout, delivery, and drive through options for customers when possible. Takeout items should be made available using contactless pick - up and delivery protocols. Eliminate person -to-person contact for delivery of goods whenever 11 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 51 of 130 Page ID #:908 possible. Designate drop -off locations to receive deliveries away from high traffic areas. Maintain physical distance of at least six feet with delivery drivers. Encourage reservations to allow for time to disinfect restaurant areas and provide guidance via digital platforms , if possible , to customers for physical distancing while at the restaurant. Cons ider allowing dine -in customers to order ahead of time to limit the amount of time spent in the establishment. Ask customers to wait in their cars or away from the establishment while waiting to be seated. If possible, alert patrons through their mobile phones when their table is ready to avoid touching and use of \"buzzers.\" Adjust maximum occupancy rules inside the establishment based on its size to limit the number of people inside and/or use impermeable barriers between service tables to protect customers from each other and workers. For outdoor seating, maintain physical distancing standards of at least six feet and as outlined in this guidance. Limit the number of patrons at a single table to a household unit or patrons who have asked to be seat ed together. People in the same party seated at the same table do not have to be six feet apart. All members of the party must be present before seating and hosts must bring the entire party to the table at one time. Implement measures to ensure physical d istancing of at least six feet between workers and customers. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where workers and/or guests should stand). Install physical barriers or partitions at cas h registers, bars, host stands, and other areas where maintaining physical distance of six feet is difficult. Any area where guests or workers queue should also be clearly marked for appropriate physical distancing. This includes check -stands and terminals , deli counters and lines, restrooms, elevator lobbies, host stands and waiting areas, valet drop off and pickup, and any other area where customers congregate. Physical distancing protocols should be used in any office areas, kitchens, pantries, walk -in freezers, or other high -density, high -traffic work areas , where possible . Worker pre-shift meetings and trainings should be conducted virtually or in areas that allow for appropriate physical distancing between workers . Food, beverages, food ware, etc., must not be shared. Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 52 of 130 Page ID #:909 maintain physical distancing protocols. Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrativ e needs through telework ). Reconfigure office spaces, lobbies, beverage bars, kitchens and workstations, host stand areas, and other spaces wherever possible to allow for at least six feet of distance between people dining, working, and passing through are as for entry and exit. Remove tables and chairs from dining areas so that six feet of physical distance can be maintained for customers and workers . If tables, chairs, booths, etc., cannot be moved, use visual cues to show that they are not available for u se or install Plexiglas or other types of impermeable physical barriers to minimize exposure between customers. Bar areas should remain closed to customers. Discontinue seating of customers where customers cannot maintain six feet of distance from worker s, work areas , and food and drink preparation areas. Limit the number of workers serving individual parties, in compliance with wage and hour regulations. All restaurant workers should minimize the amount of time spent within six feet of guests. Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and seating that ensures physi cal distancing. Reconfigure kitchens to maintain physical distancing in those areas where practical and , if not practical , stagger shifts , if possible , to do work ahead of time. Discourage food preparation workers from changing or entering others' workstations during shifts. Discourage people from congregating in high traffic areas such as bathrooms, hallways, bar areas, reservation and credit card terminals, etc. Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to elimi nate workers from passing by one another. Require workers to avoid handshakes and similar greetings that break physical distance. 13 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 53 of 130 Page ID #:910 Guests should enter through doors that are propped open or automated, if possible. Hand sanitizer should be available for guests who must touch door handles. Adjust music volume so that workers can maintain distance from customers to hear orders. Implement peak period queueing procedures, including a host to remind guests to queue with at least six feet of distance between pa rties outside or in waiting areas. Workers should not open the doors of cars or taxis. Avoid touching others' pens and clipboards. If possible, install transfer - aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin boards, to reduce person - to-person hand -offs. 1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Dine -in restaurants, breweries, brewpubs, craft distilleries, and wineries that provide meals must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be p repared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) . Additionally, employers should be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change. 14 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 54 of 130 Page ID #:911COVID -19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Schools and School - Based Programs Updated : August 3 , 2020 All guidance should be implemented only with local health officer approval following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing, and testing. EXHIBIT F Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 55 of 130 Page ID #:912 OVERVIEW Communities across the state are preparing for the forthcoming school year. To assist with that planning process, the following guidelines and considerations are intended to help school and community leaders plan and prepare to resume in-person instruction. This guidance is interim and subject to updates . These guidelines and considerations are based on the best available public health data at this time, international best practices currently employed, and the practical realities of ma naging school operations; as new data and practices emer ge. Additionally, the guidelines and considerations do not reflect the full scope of issues that school communities will need to address, which range from day -to-day site -based logistics to the social and emotional well -being of students and staff. California public schools (traditional and charter) , private schools (including nonpublic nonsectarian schools), school districts, and county offices of education , herein referred to as schools, will determi ne the most appropriate instructional model, taking into account the needs of their students and staff, and their available infrastructure. This guidance is not intended to prevent a school from adopting a distance learning, hybrid, or mixed -delivery instr uctional model to ensure safety. Schools are not required to seek out or receive approval from a state or local public health officer prior to adopting a distance -learning model. Implementation of this guidance will depend on local public health conditions , including those listed here . Communities meeting those criteria, such as lower incidence of COVID -19 and adequate preparedness, may implement the guidance described below as part of a phased reo pening. All decisions about following this guidance should be made in collaboration with local health officials and other authorities. Implementation of this guidance should be tailored for each setting, including adequate consideration of instructional pr ograms operating at each school site and the needs of students and families. School leaders should engage relevant stakeholders \u2014including families, staff and labor partners in the school community \u2014to formulate and implement plans that consider the followin g: Student, Family and Staff Population: Who are the student, family and staff populations who will be impacted by or can serve as partners in implementing any of the following measures? Ability to Implement or Adhere to Measures: Do staff, students and families have the tools, information, resources and ability to successfully adhere to or implement the new measures? Negative or Unintended Consequences: Are there any negative or unintended consequences to staff, students or famili es of implementing the measures and how can those be mitigated?

General Measures Establish and continue communication with local and State authorities to determine current disease levels and control measures in your community. For example: o Review and refer to, if applicable, the relevant county variance documentation. Documentation can be found here . o Consult with your county heal th officer, or designated staff, who are best positioned to monitor and provide advice on local conditions. A directory can be found here . o Collaborate with other schools and school partners in your region, including the county office of education. o Regularly review updated guidance from state agencies, including the California Department of Public Health and California Department of Education . Establish a written, worksite -specific COVID -19 preven tion plan at every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each school to implement the plan. o Identify contact information for the local health department where the school is located for communicating information about COVID - 19 outbreaks among students or staff . o Incorporate the CDPH Guidance for the Use o f Face Coverings , into the School Site Specific Plan that includes a policy for handling exemptions. o Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan. Make the written plan avail able and accessible to workers and worker representat ives. o Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. o Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. o Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH g uidelines . o Identify individuals who have been in close contact (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected person and take steps to isolate Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 58 of 130 Page ID #:915 COVID -19 positive person(s) and close contacts. See Section 10 for more detail. o Adhere to these guidelines. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cause classrooms or the entire school to be temporarily closed or limited. Evaluate whether and to what extent external community organizations can safely utilize the site and campus resources. Ensure external community organizations that use the facilities also follow this guidance. Develop a plan for the possibility of repeated closures of classes, groups or entire facilities when persons associated with the facility or in the commu nity become ill with COVID -19. See Section 10 below. Develop a plan to further support students with access and functional needs who may be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness due to COVID -19. For example, review existing student health plans to identify students who may need additional accommodations, develop a process for engaging families for potentially unknown concerns that may need to be accommodated or identify additional preparations for classroom and non -classroom environments as needed. Groups who might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness include the following: o Individuals who have limited mobility or require prolonged and close contact with others, such as direct support provid ers and family members; o Individuals who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and physical distancing; and o Individuals who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness. Schools should review the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings and any applicable local health department guidanc e and incorporate face -covering use for students and workers into their COVID -19 prevention plan. Some flexibility may be needed for younger children consistent with child development recommendations. See Section 3 for more information. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 59 of 130 Page ID #:916 2. Promote Healthy Hygiene Practices Teach and reinforce washing hands , avoiding contact with one's eyes, nose, and mouth , and covering coughs and sneezes among students and staff. o Teach students and remind staff to use tissue to wipe their nose and to cough/sneeze inside a tissue or their elbow. o Students and staff should wash their hands frequently throughout the day, including before and after eating; after coughing or sneezing; after classes where th ey handle shared items, such as outside recreation, art, or shop; and before and after using the restroom. o Students and staff should wash their hands for 20 seconds with soap, rubb ing thoroughly after application. Soap products marketed as \"antimicrobial\" are not necessary or recommended. o Staff should model and practice handwashing. For example, for lower grade levels, use bathroom time as an opportunity to reinforce healthy habits and monitor proper handwashing. o Students and staff should use fragrance -free hand sanitizer when handwashing is not practicable. Sanitizer must be rubbed into hands until completely dry. Note: frequent handwashing is more effective than the use of hand san itizers. o Ethyl alcohol -based hand sanitizers are preferred and should be used when there is the potential of unsupervised use by children. Isopropyl hand sanitizers are more toxic when ingested or absorbed in skin . Do not use hand sanitizer s that may contain methanol which can be hazardous when ingested or absorbed . o Children under age 9 should only use hand sanitizer under adult supervision. Call Poison Control if consumed: 1 -800-222-1222. Consider portable handwashing stations throughout a site and near classrooms to minimize movement and congregations in bathrooms to the extent practicable. Develop routines enabling students and staff to regularly wash their hands at staggered intervals. Ensure adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors, including soap, tissues, no -touch trashcans, face coverings , and hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent ethy l alcohol for staff and children who can safely hand sanitizer. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 60 of 130 Page ID #:917 Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the U se of Face Coverings should be provided to staff and families, which discusses the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Employers must provide and ensure staff use face coverings in accordance with CDPH guidelines and all required protective equipment. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) and the Department of Public Health (CDPH) are and will be working to support procurement and distribution of face coverings and personal protective equipment. Additional information can be found here . Strongly recommend that all students and sta ff be immunized each autumn against influenza unless contraindicated by personal medical conditions, to help: o Protect the school community o Reduce demands on health care facilities o Decrease illnesses that cannot be readily distinguished from COVID - 19 and would therefore trigger extensive measures from the school and public health authorities. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted as restricting access to appropriate educational services. 3. Face Coverings Face coverings must be used in accordance with CDPH guidelines unless a person is exempt a s explained in the guidelines, particularly in indoor environments, on school buses, and areas where physical distancing alone is not sufficient to prevent disease transmission. Teach and reinforce use of face coverings , or in limited ins tances, face shields . Students and staff should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering and to wash their hands frequently. Information should be provided to all staff and families in the school community on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings . Training should also include policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be addressed. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 61 of 130 Page ID #:918 STUDENTS Age Face Covering Requirement Under 2 years old No 2 years old - 2nd grade Strongly encouraged** 3rd grade - High School Yes, unless exempt **Face coverings are strongly encouraged for young children between two years old and second grade, if they can be worn properly. A face shield is an acceptable alternative for children in this cohort who cannot wear them properly. Persons younger than two years old, anyone who has trouble breathing, anyone who is unconscious or incapacitated, and anyone who is otherw ise unable to remove the face covering without assistance are exempt from wearing a face covering. A cloth face covering or face shield should be removed for meals, snacks, naptime, or outdoor recreation, or when it needs to be replaced. When a cloth face covering is temporarily removed, it should be placed in a clean paper bag (marked with the student's name and date) until it needs to be put on again. In order to comply with this guidance, scho ols must exclude students from campus if they are not exempt from wearing a face covering under CDPH guidelines and refuse to wear one provided by the school. Schools should develop protocols to provide a face covering to students who inadvertently fail to bring a face covering to school to prevent unnecessary exclu sions. Schools should offer alternative educational opportunities for students who are excluded from campus. STAFF All staff must use face coverings in accordance with CDPH guidelines unless Cal/OSHA standards require respiratory protection. In limited situations where a face coverings cannot be used for pedagogical or developmental reasons, (i.e. communicating or assisting young children or those with special needs) a face shield can be used instead of a cloth face covering while in the classroom as long as the wearer maintains physical distance from others, to the extent practicable. Staff must return to wearing a face covering outside of the classroom. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 62 of 130 Page ID #:919 Workers or other persons handling or serving food must use gloves in addition to face coverings. Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to supplement frequent han dwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched items. 4. Ensure Teacher and Staff Safety Ensuring staff maintain physical distancing from each other is critical to reducing tra nsmission between adults. Ensure that all staff use face coverings in accordance with CDPH guidelines and Cal/OSHA standards. Support staff who are at higher risk for severe illness or who cannot safely distance from household contacts at higher risk, by providing options such as telework, where appropriate, or teaching in a virtual learning or independent study context . Conduct all staff meetings, professional development training and education, and other activities involving staff with physical distancing measures in place, or virtually, where physical distancing is a challenge. Minimize the use of and congregation of adults in staff rooms, break rooms, and other settings. Implement procedures for daily symptom monitoring for staff. 5. Intensify Cleaning, Disinfection, and Ventilation Consider suspending or modifying use of site resources that necessitate sharing or touching items. For example, consider suspending use of drinking fountains and instead encourage the use of reusa ble water bottles. Staff shoul d clean and disinfect frequently -touched surfaces at school and on school buses at least daily and, as practicable, these surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected frequently throughout the day by trained custodial staff. Buses should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected daily and after transporting any individual who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19. Drivers should be provided disinfectant wipes and disposable gloves to support disinfection of frequently touched surfaces during the day. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 63 of 130 Page ID #:920 Frequently touched surfaces in the school include, but are not limited to: o Door handles o Light switches o Sink handles o Bathroom surfaces o Tables o Student Desks o Chairs Limit use and sharing of objects and equipment, such as toys , games, art supplies and playground equipment to the extent practicable. When shared use is allowed, clean and disinfect between uses. When choosing disinfecting products, use those approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - approved list \"N\" and follow product instructions. o To reduce the risk of asthma and other health effects related to disinfecting, programs should select disinfectant products on list N with asthma -safer ingredients (hydrogen peroxide, citric acid or lactic acid) as recommended by the US EPA Design for Environment program. o Avoid products that contain peroxyacetic (p eracetic) acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or quaternary ammonium compounds, which can cause asthma. o Follow label directions for appropriate dilution rates and contact times. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions, Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use , and as applicable and as require d by the Healthy Schools Act. o Custodial staff and any other workers who clean and disinfect the school site must be equipped with proper protective equipment, including gloves, eye protectio n, respiratory protection , and other appropriate protective equipment as required by the product instructions. All products must be kept out of children's reach and stored in a space with restricted access. o Establish a cleaning and disinfecting schedule in order to avoid both under - and over -use of cleaning products. Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectant and keep products away from students. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 64 of 130 Page ID #:921 Ensure proper ventilation during cleaning and disinfecting. Introduce fresh outdoor air as much as poss ible, for example, by opening windows where practicable. When cleaning, air out the space before children arrive; plan to do thorough cleaning when children are not present. If using air conditioning, use the setting that brings in outside air. Replace and check air filters and filtration systems to ensure optimal air quality. o If opening windows poses a safety or health risk (e.g., by allowing pollen in or exacerbating asthma symptoms) to persons using the facility, consider alternatives. For example, maxim ize central air filtration for HVAC systems (targeted filter rating of at least MERV 13). Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in classrooms, offices and other spaces. Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, drinking fountains and decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water. 6. Implementing Distancing Inside and Outside the Classroom Arrival and Departure Maximize space between students and between students and the driver on school buses and open windows to the greatest extent practicable. Minimize contact at school between students, staff, families and the community at the beginning and end of the school day. Prioritize minimizing contact between adults at all times. Stagger arrival and drop off -times and locations as consistently as practicable as to minimize scheduling cha llenges for families. Designate routes for entry and exit, using as many entrances as feasible. Put in place other protocols to limit direct contact with others as much as practicable. Implement health screenings of students and staff upon arrival at schoo l (see Section 9 ). Ensure each bus is equipped with extra unused face coverings on school buses for students who may have inadvertently failed to bring one. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 65 of 130 Page ID #:922 Classroom Space To reduce possibilities for infection, s tudents must remain in the same space and in cohort s as small and consistent as practicable , including for recess and lunch . Keep the same students and teacher or staff with each group, to the greatest extent practicable. Prioritize the use and maximization of outdoor space for activities where practicable. Minimize movement of students and teachers or staff as much as practicable. For example, consider ways to keep teachers with one group of students for the whole day. In secondary schools or in situations where students have individualized schedules, plan for ways to reduce mixing among cohorts and to minimize contact . Maximize space between seating and desks. Distance teacher and other staff desks at least six feet away from student desks. Consider ways to establish separation of students through other means if practicable, such as, six feet between desks, where practicable, partitions between desks, markings on classroom floors to promote distancing or arranging desks in a way that m inimizes face -to-face contact. Consider redesigning activities for smaller groups and rearranging furniture and play spaces to maintain separation. Staff should develop instructions for maximizing spacing and ways to minimize movement in both indoor and o utdoor spaces that are easy for students to understand and are developmentally appropriate. Activities where there is increased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets such as band and choir practice and performances are not permitt ed. Activities that involve singing must only take place outdoors. Implement procedures for turning in assignments to minimize contact. Consider using privacy boards or clear screens to increase and enforce separation between staff and students. Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 66 of 130 Page ID #:923 Non -Classroom Space s Limit nonessential visitors, volunteers and activities involving other groups at the same time. Limit communal activities where practicable. Alternatively, stagger use, properly space occupants and disinfect in between uses. Consider us e of non -classroom space for instruction, including regular use of outdoor space, weather permitting. For example, consider part - day instruction outside. Minimize congregate movement through hallways as much as practicable. For example, establish more ways to enter and exit a campus, create staggered passing times when necessary or when students cannot stay in one room and create guide lines on the floor that students can follow to enable physical distancin g while passing . In addition, schools can consider eliminat ing the use of locker s and moving to block scheduling, which supports the creation of cohort groups and reduces changes of classroom s. Serve meals outdoors or in classrooms instead of cafeterias or group dining rooms where practicable. Where cafe terias or group dining rooms must be used, keep students together in their cohort groups, ensure physical distancing , and consider assigned seating. Serve individually plated or bagged meals. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils and buffet or family -style m eals. Consider holding recess activities in separated areas designated by class. Sports and Extra Curricular Activities (Updated August 3, 2020 ) Outdoor and indoor sporting events, assemblies, dances, rallies, field trips, and other activities that require close contact or that would promote congregating are not permitted at this time . For example, tournaments , events , or competitions, regardless o f whether teams are from the same school or from different schools, counties, or states are not permitted at this time. Youth sports and physical education are permitted only when the following can be maintained: (1) physical distancing of at least six f eet; and (2) a stable cohort, such as a class , that limits the risks of transmission ( see CDC Guidance on Schools and Cohorting ). Activities should take place outside to Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 67 of 130 Page ID #:924 For sports that cannot be conducted with sufficient distancing or cohorting, only p hysical conditioning and training is permitted and ONLY where physical distancing can be maintained. Conditioni ng and training should focu s on individual skill building ( e.g., running drills and body weight resistance training ) and should take place outside, where practicable. Indoor physical conditioning and training is allowed only in counties where gyms and fitn ess centers are allowed to operate indoors. Avoid equipment sharing, and if unavoidable, clean and disinfect shared equipment between use by different people to reduce the risk of COVID -19 spread. Consistent with guidance for gyms and fitness facilities, cloth face coverings must be worn during indoor physical conditioning and training or physical education classes (except when showering). Activities that require heavy exertion should be conducted outside in a physically distanced manner withou t face coverings. Activities conducted inside should be those that do not require heavy exertion and can be done with a face covering. Players should take a break from exercise if any difficulty in breathing is noted and should change their mask or face co vering if it becomes wet and sticks to the player 's face and obstructs breathing. Masks that restrict airflow under heavy exertion (such as N-95 masks) are not advised for exercise. Youth sports programs and s chools should provide information to parents or guardians regarding this and related guidance , along with the safety measures that will be in place in these settings with which parents or guardians must comply. Activities where there is increased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled dr oplets such as band and choir practice and performances are not permitted. 7. Limit Sharing Keep each child's belongings separated and in individually labeled storage containers, cubbies or areas. Ensure belongings are taken home each day to be cleaned. Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high -touch materials (art supplies, equipment, etc.) to the extent practicable or limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of children at a time and clean and disinfect between uses. Avoid sharing ele ctronic devices, clothing, toys, books and other games or learning aids as much as practicable . Where sharing occurs, clean 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 68 of 130 Page ID #:925 8. Train All Staff and Educate Families Train all staff and provide educational materials to families in the following safety actions: o Enhanced sanitation practices o Physical distancing guidelines and their importance o Proper use, removal, and washing o f face coverings o Screening practices o How COVID -19 is spread o COVID -19 specific symptom identification o Preventing the spread of COVID -19 if you are sick, including the importance of not coming to work if staff members have symptoms, or if they or someone they live with has been diagnosed with COVID - 19. o For workers, COVID -19 specific symptom identification and when to seek medical attention o The employer's plan and procedures to follow when children or adults become sick at school. o The employer's plan and procedures to protect workers from COVID - 19 illness. Consider conducting the training and education virtually, or, if in -person, ensure a minimum of six -foot distancing is maintained. 9. Check for Signs and Symptoms Prevent discrimination against students who (or whose families) were or are diagnosed with COVID -19 or who are perceiv ed to be a COVID -19 risk. Actively encourage staff and students who are sick or who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID -19 to stay home . Develop policies that encourage sick staff and students to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure staff, students and students' families are aware of these policies. Implement screening and other procedures for all staff and students entering the facility.

If checking temperatures, use a no -touch thermometer . Ask all individuals if they or anyone in their home is exhibiting COVID -19 symptoms . Make available and encourage use of hand -washing stations or hand sanitizer. Document/track incidents of possible exposure and notify local health officials, staff and families immediately of any exposure to a positive case of COVID -19 at school while maintaining confidentiality, as required under FERPA and state law related to pri vacy of educational records. Additional guidance can be foun d here . As noted in Section 11 below, the st aff liaison can serve a coordinating role to ensure prompt and responsible notification. If a student is exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19, staff should communicate with the parent/caregiver and refer to the student's health history form and/or emergency car d. Monitor staff and students throughout the day for signs of illness; send home students and staff with a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher, cough or other COVID -19 symptoms . Policies should not penalize students and families for missing class. 10. Plan for When a Staff Member, Child or Visitor Becomes Sic k Work with school administrators, nurses and other healthcare providers to identify an isolation room or area to separate anyone who exhibits symptoms of COVID -19. Any students or staff exhibiting symptoms should immediately be required to wear a face covering and be required to wait in an isolation area until they can be transported home or to a healthcare facility, as soon as practicable. Establish procedures to arrange for safe transport home or to a healthcare facility, as appropriate, when an individual is exhibiting COVID -19 symptoms: o Fever o Cough o Shortness of breathing Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 70 of 130 Page ID #:927 o Chills o Repeated shakin g with chills o Fatigue o Muscle pain o Headache o Sore throat o Congestion or runny nose o Nausea or vomiting o Diarrhea o New loss of taste or smell For serious injury or illness, call 9 -1-1 without delay. Seek medical attention if COVID -19 symptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webpage . Notify local health officials immediately of any positive case of COVID - 19, and exposed staff and families as relevant while maintaining confidentiality as requ ired by state and federal laws. Additional guidance can be found here . Close off areas used by any indiv idual suspected of being infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 and do not use before cleaning and disinfection. To reduce risk of exposure, wait 24 hours before you clean and disinfect . If it is not possible to wait 24 hours, wait as long as practicable. Ensure a safe and correct application of disinfectants using personal protective equipment and ventilation recommended for cleaning. Keep disinfectant products away from students. Advise sick staff members and students not to return until they have met CDC criteria to discontinue home isolation , including at least 3 days with no fever, symptoms have improved and at least 10 days since symptoms first appeared. Ensure that students, including students with disabilities, have access to instruction when out of class, as required by federal and state law. Schools should offer distance learning based on the unique circumstances of each student who would be put at -risk by an in -person instructional model. Fo r example, students with a health condition, students with family members with a health condition, students who cohabitate or regularly interact with high -risk individuals, or are otherwise identified as \"at -risk\" by the parents or guardian, are students w hose circumstances merit coffering distances learning.

Investigate the COVID -19 illness and exposures and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update protocols as needed to prevent further cases. Update protocols as needed to prevent f urther cases. See the CDPH guidelines, Responding to COVID -19 in the Workplace , which are incorporated into this guidance and contain detaile d recommendations for establishing a plan to identify cases, communicating with workers and other exposed persons, and conducting and assisting with contact tracing. 11. Maintain Healthy Operations Monitor staff absenteeism and have a roster of trained back -up staff where available. Monitor the types of illnesses and symptoms among your students and staff to help isolate them promptly as needed. Designate a staff liaison or liaisons to be responsible for responding to COVID -19 concerns. Workers should kn ow who they are and how to contact them. The liaison should be trained to coordinate the documentation and tracking of possible exposure, in order to notify local health officials, staff and families in a prompt and responsible manner. Maintain communicati on systems that allow staff and families to self - report symptoms and receive prompt notifications of exposures and closures, while maintaining confidentiality, as required by FERPA and state law related to privacy of educational records. Additional guidan ce can be foun d here . Consult with local health departments if routine testing is being considered by a local educational agency. The role of providing routine systematic testing of staff or students for COVID -19 (e.g., PCR swab testing for acute infection, or presence of antibodies in serum after infection) is currently unclear. Support students who are at higher risk for severe illness or who cannot safely distance from household contacts at higher risk, by providing options such as virtual learning or independent stud y.

Considerations for Reopening and Partial or Total Closures California schools have been closed for in -person instruction since mid -March 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic. School closures to in -person instruction were part of a broader set of recommend ations intended to reduce transmission of SARS -CoV -2, the virus that causes COVID -19. For more detailed direction on measures to be taken when a student, teacher, or staff member has symptoms or is diagnosed with COVID -19, please see the COVID -19 and Reopening Framework for K -12 Schools in California. Check State and local orders and health department notices daily about tra nsmission in the area or closures and adjust operations accordingly. When a student, teacher or staff member tests positive for COVID -19 and had exposed others at the school, refer to the CDPH Framework for K-12 Schools , and implement the following steps: o In consultation with the local public health department , the appropriate school official should ensure cleaning and quarantine of exposed persons and whether any additional intervention is warranted, including the length of time necessary, based on the risk level within the specific community as determined by the local public health officer. o Close off the classroom or office where the patient was based and do not use these areas until af ter cleaning and disinfection. Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait for at least two hours and as long as possible. o Additional areas of the school visited by the COVID -19 positive individual may also n eed to be clean ed and disinfect ed. o Implement communication plans for exposure at school and potential school closure s to include outreach to students, parents, teachers, staff and the community. o Include information for staff regarding labor laws, informati on regarding Disability Insurance, Paid Family Leave and Unemployment Insurance, as applicable to schools . See additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and work er's compensation for COVID -19, including worker's sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and employee's rights to workers' compensation benefi ts and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor's Executive Order N -62-20, while that Order is in effect. o Provide guidance to paren ts, teachers and staff 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 73 of 130 Page ID #:930 the importance of community physical distancing measures while a school is closed, including discouraging students or staff from gathering elsewhere. o Develop a plan for continuity of education. Consider in that plan how to also continue nutrition and other services provided in the regular school setting to establish alternate mechanisms for these services to continue. o Maintain regular communications with the local public health department.

It applies to public and private gatherings and other gatherings not covered by existing sector guidance. Gatherings are defined as meetings or other events that bring together people from di\u0000erent households at the same time in a single space, or place. When people from di\u0000erent households mix, this increases the risk of transmission of COVID-19. To protect public health and slow the rate of transmission of COVID-19, gatherings unless otherwise specified are not permitted across the state of California until further guidance is issued by the California Department of Public Health. Background COVID-19 continues to pose a severe risk to communities and requires all people in California to follow necessary precautions and to adapt the way they live and function in light of this ongoing risk.

Box 95899- 7377 (916) 558-1784 Department Website (www.cdph.ca.gov ) O n March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer issued an order directing all individuals living in the State of California to stay at home except as needed to facilitate authorized activities or to maintain the continuity of operations of critical infr astructure sectors. (See March 19, 2020 Order .) The scope of activities authorized under this order was subsequently modified in additional state public health directives. Then, consistent with Executive Order N -60-20, the State Public Health Officer set out California's path forward from this \"Stay -at-Home\" Order in California's Pandemic Resilience Roadmap . That Roadmap identified four stages of the pandemic: safety and preparation (Stage 1), reopening of lower -risk workplaces and other spaces (Stage 2), reopening of higher -risk workplaces and other spaces (Stage 3), and finally an easing of final restrictions leading to the end of the stay -at-home order (Stage 4). On July 13, 2020, in response to a significant increase in the spread of COVID -19, the State Public Health Of ficer ordered the statewide closure of operations in certain high-risk sectors. (See July 13, 2020 Order .) Counties on the County Monitoring List for three consecutive days were also required to close additional indoor operations for certain sectors in order to further slow community transmission. C ommunity spread of infection remains a significant concern across the state. In addition to the impact on the general population, community spread increases the likelihood of expanded transmission of COVID -19 in congregate settings such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, jails and prisons. Infection of vulnerable populations in these settings can be catastrophic. Higher levels of community spread also increase the likelihood of infection among individuals at higher risk of serious outcomes from COVID -19, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions who might live or otherwise interact with an infected individual. COVID -19 infection is also disproportionately impacting our essential workforce. The anticipated influenza season is likely to impose additional burdens on the healthcare delivery system, increasing demand for space, supplies, and personnel. T he COVID -19 pandemic continues to evolve, and CDPH is continually monitoring new scientific evidence and improving its understanding of the disease. Based on the current state of the pandemic in C alifornia and current scientific understanding of transmission, it is my judgment that it is appropriate to further refine the approach in order to gradually reopen businesses and activities while reducing the risk of increased community spread. A targeted system for sector reopenings which considers both current epidemiological conditions and the latest understanding of transmission risk in certain EXHIB IT H Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 77 of 130 Page ID #:934 sectors will allow CDPH to monitor both counties and sectors for evidence of increased epidemiological risk and will reduce risk as California continues to reopen its economy and protect public health. California's Plan for Reducing COVID -19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe sets forth in detail the basis for the new Framework. NOW, THEREFORE, I, as Acting State Public Health Officer of the State of California, order all of the following: 1. The updated framework for reopening, which shall be known as California's Plan for Reducing COVID -19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe, will rely on a set of Tiers corresponding to specific epidemiological profiles based on indicators of disease burden including case rates per capita and percent of positive covid-19 tests and proportion of testing and other covid-19 response efforts addressing the most impacted populations within a county. For each progressive Tier, this framework will permit a broader range of reopening guided by risk -based criteria pertinent to each sector. I may modify the epidemiological criteria for each Tier as well as the sectors, businesses, establishments, or activities within the Tiers as necessary based on the latest available public health information and research to protect public health and safety. The up-to -date Tier profiles and those sectors, businesses, establishments, or activities that are permitted to open in each Tier will be posted (along with necessary modifications), at https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID - 19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx . 2. Pursuant to this framework, all local health jurisdictions in the state may reopen specified sectors according to their respective county's Tier. However, a local health jurisdiction that moves to a Tier permitting further reopening must pause for 21 days, or a different period that I identify, before reopening additional sectors. 3. Conversely, a local health jurisdiction must also close sectors according to their respective county's Tier consistent with the timeline and procedures set forth in California's Plan for Reducing COVID -19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe. 4. A local health jurisdiction may continue to implement or maintain more restrictive public health measures if the jurisdiction's Local Health Off icer determines that health conditions in that jurisdiction warrant such measures.

This order shall go into effect August 31, 2020 and shall supersede the July 13, 2020 State Public Health Officer Order. 6. This order shall remain in effect until I determine it is appropriate to modify the order based on public health conditions. 7. I will continue to monitor the epidemiological data and will modify California's Plan for Reducing COVID -19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe as required by the evolving public health conditions. If I determine that it is necessary to change what will reopen or close, or otherwise modify the Plan, these modifications will be posted at California's Plan for Reducing COVID -19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe . 8. Except to the extent this order or other state public health directives expressly provide otherwise, all CDPH guidance continues to apply statewide. 9. All references in CDPH or other State guidance to the County Monitoring List or the County Data Monitoring List shall refer to those counties falling within Tier 1 of California's Plan for Reducing COVID -19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe. 10. This order is issued pursuant to Health and Safety Code sections and other authority provided for under the Emergency Service s Act; and other applicable law. Eri ca S.

The impact of COVID -19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Tra nsmission is most likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID -19 infect ion. Examples of these workplaces include hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. As stay -at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to ensur e the safety of workers and the public. Key prevention practices include: physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, use of face coverings by worker s (where respiratory protection is not required) and customers/clients, frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, training worker s on these and other elements of the COVID -19 prevention plan. In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. PURPOSE This document provides guidance for retailers to support a safe, clean environment for workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health - related regulatory re quirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage .

People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any member of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walk ing through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person's own household or residence) are present when unable to physically distance; Drivin g or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended . Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance . Fac e covering s are strongly encouraged in other circumstances , and employ ers can implement additiona l fac e covering requirem ents in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meet s one of the exemptions from wearing a fac e covering . If a worker who would otherwise be required to wear a fac e covering because of frequent contact with o thers cannot wear o ne due to a medica l conditio n, they should be provided with a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medica l condition permit s it. Business es that are open to the public should be cogniza nt of the exemption s to wearing face covering s in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if tha t person i s complying with the guidance . Bus iness es will need to develop polic ies fo r handling these exemptio ns amo ng customers , clients, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 82 of 130 Page ID #:939 Work place Specific Plan Establish a written, workplace -specific COVID -19 prevention plan at every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and work tasks, an d designate a person at each establishment to implement the plan . Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. Identify contac t information for the local health department where the operation is located for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among workers or customers. Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan avai lable to workers and their representatives. Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive worker(s) and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.

To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first posit ive COVID -19 test. The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible to unsupervised c hildren) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Physical Distancin g section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be shared and sho uld be washed or discarded after each shift. Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 5 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 84 of 130 Page ID #:941 must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies o n how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Di scuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home . See additional inform ation on government programs supporting sick leave and workers' compensation for COVID -19, including workers' sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers' rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor's Executive Order N -62-20 while that Order is still in effect. Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above Encourage workers w ho are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19 to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. This includes protections for cashiers, baggers, and other wo rkers with regular and repeated interaction with customers. Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or h andling commonly touched items. Workers must also be provided and use protective equipment when offloading and storing delivered goods. Workers should inspect 6 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 85 of 130 Page ID #:942 deliveries and perform disinfection measures prior to storing goods in warehouses and facilities when there are signs of tampering. Retailers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in strategic and highly -visible locations, to remind the public that they must use face coverings and practice physical distancing. Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as break rooms, lunch areas and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, escalators, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfa ces, including shopping carts, baskets, conveyor belts, registers (including self -checkout), scanners, register telephones, hand -held devices, counters, door handles, shelving, ATM PIN pads, customer assistance call buttons, handwashing facilities, etc. Clean and sanitize shared equipment, including but not limited to, pallet jacks, ladders, supply carts, time clocks, payment portals, and styluses between each use. Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is more frequent, inclu ding but not limited to working surfaces, tools, and stationary and mobile equipment controls. Equip customer entrances and exits, checkout stations, customer changing rooms with proper sanitation products, including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, an d provide personal hand sanitizers to all frontline staff (e.g., cashiers). Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. To minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Provide resources to promote worker s' personal hygiene. This will include tissues, no -touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for hand -washing, alcohol -based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and disposable towels. When choos ing disinfecting chemicals , employers should use products approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against 7 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 86 of 130 Page ID #:943 emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe u se. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma -safer cleani ng methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. Adjust or modify store hours to provide adequate time for regular, thorough cleaning and product stocking. Stagger stocking so that associates are in differ ent aisles. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of the worker s' job duties. Procure options for third -party cleaning companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed. Install hands -free devices, if possible, including motion sensor lights, contactless payment systems, automatic soap and paper towel dispensers, and timecard systems. Encourage the use of debit or credit cards by customers, for example, through signage . Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilat ion in offices and other spaces. Physical Distancing Guidelines Retailers should create clearly -marked curbside or outside pickup points that maintain physical distance with visual cues or other measures, and have purchased goods available there or available through home delivery. Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between workers and customers. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers and/or customers should stand). Take measures at checkout stations to minimize exposure between cashiers and customers, such as Plexiglas barriers. Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that minimize their contact with customers and other worker s (e.g., managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative 8 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 87 of 130 Page ID #:944 needs through telework). Adjust in -person meetings, if they are necessary, to ensure physical distancing and use smaller individual meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing guidelines. Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and seating that ensures physical distancing. Close in -store bars, bulk -bin options, and public seating areas and discontinue product sampling. Dedicate shopping hours for vulnerable populations, including seniors and those medically vulnerable, preferably at a time following a complete cleaning. Increase pickup and delivery service options for customers to help minimize in-store contact and maintain social distancing, such as online ordering and curbside pick -up. Provide a single, clearly designated entrance and separate exit to help maintain physical distancing where possible. Adjust maximum occupancy rules based on the size of the facility to limit the number of people in a store at one time, using no more than 50% maximum occupancy. Be prepared to queue customers outside while still maintaining physical distance, including through the use of visual cues. Encourage worker s to practice physical distancing during pickup and delivery by talking with the customer through a passenger window, loading items directly into the customer's trunk without contact, or leaving items at their door. Make some locations pickup -or delivery -only to minimize worker /customer contact, where possible. Install transfer -aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin boards, to reduce person -to-person hand -offs where possible. Wherever possible, use contactless signatures for deliveries. Expand direct store delivery window hours to spread out deliveries and prevent overcrowding. 9 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 88 of 130 Page ID #:945 1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The retail industry must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) . Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change. 10 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 89 of 130 Page ID #:946 COVID -19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Limited Services 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 90 of 130 Page ID #:947 OVERVIEW On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID -19 among the population. The impact of COVID -19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious compl ications. Transmission is most likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting CO VID-19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. As stay -at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be t aken to ensure the safety of workers and the public. Key prevention practices include: physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, use of face coverings by worker s (where respiratory protection is notrequired) and customers/clients, frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, training worker s on these and other elements of the COVID -19 prevention plan. In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases of il lness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. PURPOSE This document provides guidance for limited services which do not generally require close customer contact. This guidance is intended to support a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. Limited services include those businesses that can provide services while maintaining appropriate physical distancing from customers or the public. Examples of such businesses include laundromats, dry cleaners, other laundry services, auto repair shops, car washes, landscapers, door to door services and sales, pet grooming, and dog walking. Additionally, this guidance applies to those businesses for which service provision may necessitate entry to private residences or community 2 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 91 of 130 Page ID #:948 facilities, but physical distance can still be maintained. Those businesses include residential and janitorial cleaning services, HVAC services, appliance repair persons, electricians, plumbers, other mechanical tradespersons, handypersons, and general contractors. Business owners or operators must acknowledge that lessees or subcontractors should only resume operations when they are ready and able to implement the necessary safety measures to provide for their safety and that of their customers. NOTE: This guidance is not intended for personal care, in -home healthcare, in - home care, assist ed living, and personal care services that necessitate close customer contact, including hair salons, barbershops, nail salons, massage parlors, aestheticians and cosmetology, ear piercing salons, and tattoo parlors. Additional guidance for such industries is available on the COVID -19 Resilience Roadmap website . The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health -related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID -19 webpage . CDC has additional requirements in their guidance for businesses and employers. Required Use of Face Coverings On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings , which broadly requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any member of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person's own household or residence) are present when unable to y 3 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 92 of 130 Page ID #:949 distance; Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended . Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance . Fac e covering s are strongly encouraged in other circumstances , and employ ers can implement additiona l fac e covering requirem ents in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meet s one of the exemptions from wearing a face covering . If a worker who would otherwise be required to wear a fac e covering becau se of frequent contact with o thers cannot wear o ne due to a medica l conditio n, they should be provided with a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medica l condition permits it. Business es that are open to the public should be cogniza nt of the exemption s to wearing face covering s in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if tha t person i s complying with the guidance . Bus iness es will need to develop polic ies fo r handling these exemptio ns amo ng customers , clients, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 93 of 130 Page ID #:950 Work place Specific Plan Establish a written, workplace -specific COVID -19 prevention plan at every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and work tasks, an d designate a person at each establishment to implement the plan. Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemption s. Identify contact information for the local health department where the operation is located for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among workers or customers. Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors cou ld have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive worker(s) and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be t emporarily closed or limited. Topics for Worker Training Information on COVID -19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to contracting the virus. Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks using CDC guidelines . The importance of not coming to work: o If a worker has symptoms of COVID -19 as described by the 5 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 94 of 130 Page ID #:951 CDC , such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fati gue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, OR o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID -19 and has not yet been released from isolation, OR o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID -19 and is considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 test. To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the ch est, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webpage . The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Physical Distancing section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded after each shift. Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 6 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 95 of 130 Page ID #:952 Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. Ensure any inde pendent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or co ntract workers. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home . See additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers' compensation for COVID -19, including workers' sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers' rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work - relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor's Executive Order N - 62-20 while that Order is in effect. Mechanical tradespeople that work near plumbing vents, HVAC exhaust, or other type of exhaust fans must be informed that exhaust air could contain the virus that causes COVID -19 if infected persons are in the residence or building. Mechanical tradespeople that work on sewage, plumbing, and custodial or janitorial services must be informed that the virus that causes COVID -19 has been found in the feces of some persons with COVID -19. Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shi ft and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Train ing section above. Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19 to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 7 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 96 of 130 Page ID #:953 supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched items. Mechanical tradespeople work ing near plumbing vents and rooftop HVAC exhaust, or other types of exhaust fans in residences and buildings, must be provided and use a face shield and a NIOSH -approved particulate respirator. If respirators are not available, an ASTM -rated surgical mask must be used. Mechanical tradespeople working on sewage plumbing must be provided and use a face shield and an impermeable face cover. Ifthe work may disperse sewage droplets into the air (such as sewer drain snaking), a NIOSH -approved particulate respira tor, if available, is required. Employers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in strategic and highly -visible locations, to remind the public that they must use face coverings and practice physical distancing. Cleaning and Disinfecti ng Protocols Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as reception areas, waiting rooms and lobbies, front desk check -in areas, break rooms and lunch areas, changing areas, and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, and ha ndrails. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including credit card terminals, counters, door handles, light switches, phones, toilets, and handwashing facilities. Regularly clean and sanitize shared equipment, including but not limited to time cloc ks, landline phones, handles, hoses, spray nozzles, washers and dryers, any machinery or tools, and any other equipment between each use or when it is transferred to a new customer or worker . Avoid sharing phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, other work supplies, wherever possible. Never share PPE. All dirty linens should be placed in a covered, non -porous container and washed at a high temperature and cleaned in accordance with CDC guidelines . All properly cleaned linens should be stored in closed cabinet or covered shelving until used. Ensure worker s performing this function have the proper protective equipment. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be ass igned during working hours as part of the worker s' job duties. Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 8 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 97 of 130 Page ID #:954 and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. Provide additional sanitary facilities, wher e feasible, if several workers need to use the restroom at the same time, e.g., during scheduled breaks. To minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Place signage in workspace and common areas, including lobbies, waiting rooms, and reception areas, emphasizing basic infection prevention measures, including posting hand -washing signs in restrooms. When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA )-approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are app ropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other protective equipme nt as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma -safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper vent ilation. Discontinue the use of shared food and beverage equipment in worker breakrooms (including shared coffee brewers). Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible. Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all working areas. Physical Distancing Guidelines Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between and among workers and customers. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers and/or customers should stand). Take measures at customer service desks or other areas where physical 9 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 98 of 130 Page ID #:955 distancing cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between workers and customers, such as Plexiglas or other barriers. Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that minimize their contact with customers and other worker s (e.g., managing inventory rather or managing administrative needs through telework). If feasible and appropriate for the business, implement an appointment system to help with scheduling and reduce walk -in customers. Consider staggering appointments to reduce reception or waiting area congestion. Consider entry queuing systems that do not disrupt foot tra ffic or violate physical distancing requirements. Any area where customers or worker s queue should be clearly marked for appropriate physical distancing. Alternate entry requirements to facilities should be developed and could include digital reservations for entry and pre -order guidelines. Implement strategies that encourage customers to stay in their cars or outside the business or residence, where possible. This could include \"no - contact\" pick -up or delivery processes or curbside payment. Designate drop -off or pick -up locations away from high traffic areas. Provide clearly designated entrances and separate exits to help maintain physical distancing and direct foot traffic, if possible. Wherever possible, doors should be left open if they do not open and close automatically. Stagger shifts, split or rotate work schedules, and stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to minimize worker overlap and maintain physical distancing protocols. Reconfigure reception and waiting areas, lobbies, workstations, and worker breakrooms, if possible, to allow for at least six feet of distance between customers and worker s. Discourage worker s from congregating in high traffic areas such as bathrooms, hall ways, passageways, credit card terminals, etc. Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to eliminate customers and worker s from passing by one another. Require worker s to avoid handshakes and similar greetings that break physical distance. Hold meetings over the phone or via webinar for worker s wherever possible. When not possible, adjust staff meetings to ensure physical distancing and use smaller individual meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing gui delines. 10 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 99 of 130 Page ID #:956 Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs to separate workers an d discourage congregating during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and seating that ensures physical distancing. Additional Considerations for Services that Require Entry to Residential, Commercial, or Public Buildin gs Workers who must enter private residences or commercial or public buildings to complete their work should be provided personal hand sanitizer, which should be replenished or restocked by the employer as needed. Contact customers in advance, ideally the day before the appointment is scheduled, to confirm the appointment and ask if any member of the household or personnel on -site is exhibiting any symptoms, has been sick or is currently sick, or whether anyone on t he premises has been exposed to someone who has been sick. If the customer answers in the affirmative for any of those questions, reschedule the appointment at least 10 to 14 days in the future. During the advance call, request customers use face coverings during the appointment and emphasize the importance of maintaining a safe distance of at least six feet from the worker entering the residence or building. Develop a process workflow with questions and talking points for workers to use upon arrival on -site to identify suspected COVID -19 concerns. The workflow should give workers the flexibility to gauge the situation and determine whether they can safely enter the residence or building. Allow workers to call a \"safety stop \" when they are reluctant to enter a residence or building due to unsafe or unhealthy work conditions related to COVID -19 hazards. During such situations, workers should call a supervisor, if feasible, and discuss what work is essential to complete immedia tely and proper precautions to take. Based on an evaluation of the circumstances, supervisors should inform workers if they should not enter the residence, avoiding workers feeling pressured to make the ultimate decision. Workers should also be able to mak e that determination themselves without fear of reprisal or retaliation. Limit exposure for workers who must enter private residences or buildings 11 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 100 of 130 Page ID #:957 by implementing virtual customer service support or service provision, wherever possible. This could include self-install/repair strategies through phone consultations or support through video calls and instruction videos, if possible. When working in a private residence, workers should minimize contact with customers' personal belongings. Similarly, in commercia l or public buildings, workers should limit their interaction in the facility and avoid touching surfaces where possible. Where possible, appliances or other items the worker must touch should be cleaned with disinfecting wipes prior to and after the servi ce is performed. Conduct virtual safety briefings weekly, or as needed, prior to workers going on service calls and develop internal communications that can be regularly updated on the use of protective equipment and other mitigation requirements. After co mpletion of work at a residence or building, workers must remove all PPE and face coverings and wash their hands and face. Face coverings must be washed before being reused. Considerations for Homeowners and Building Residents Homeowners and residents must postpone all non -emergency, in -home services if there are any COVID -19 positive persons, persons with COVID - 19 symptoms, or persons under quarantine in the residence. For emergency service repairs, homeowners and residents should inform workers of any COVID -19 positive persons, persons with COVID -19 symptoms, or persons under quarantine in the residence and take measures to minimize exposure risks to any person entering the home. These include: o Airing out the residence if weather permits. o Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in areas where the service person may work or need to access. o Maintaining physical distancing of at least six feet when letting the service worker into the home. o Wearing face coverings at all times during the visit, unless unable to per the exemption criteria in the CDPH face coverings guidelines . o Staying out of the area where the repair person is working. 12 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 101 of 130 Page ID #:958 Additional Considerations for Those Limited Services That Operate Out of Vehicles All work trucks and vehicles must have hand sanitizer available and all workers should sanitize their hands when arriving on-site. Provide workers with an adequate supply of materials required to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces of the delivery vehicle. Provide lined trash receptacles to be placed in delivery vehicles to properly dispose of disinfectant wipes and other items. Clean and disinfect the cabs of work trucks and vehicles, including dashboard controls, steering wheel, gear shift, handles, etc., as well as other touch points on the vehicle such as handles and latches. Where alternatives to physical contact with delivery -related items cannot be avoided, workers should wipe down and disinfect equipment, pens, clipboards, and electronic signature pad s after each use when shared with customers while performing a delivery. Touch pads and punch keys on terminals such as card readers or handheld digital devices must be cleaned and disinfected after every transaction. Workers should limit contact with freq uently touched surfaces during deliveries, such as doorbells or door handles. If possible, avoid contact with hands or bare skin when opening doors. Communicate to workers where they can access soap, clean running water, and drying materials, and provide a lcohol -based hand sanitizers; adjust schedules to build in time for frequent handwashing. For workers who make service calls, normally accessible restrooms on routes (e.g., restaurants, coffee shops) may be closed. Employers should provide worker s alternat ive restroom locations and allow time for worker s to use them. Guidelines for delivery services are available on the COVID -19 Resilience Roadmap 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 102 of 130 Page ID #:959 Additional Considerations for Auto Repair Shops Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are shared, sanitize between each use, according to CDC guidelines . Sanitize all tools daily after the work day ends. Allow for customers to drop off and pick up vehicles after hours using a \"night drop\" box or slot to limit personal contact and consider allowing use of a drop box style system during working hours. Request customers to wear face coverings when dropping off the vehicle and interacting with workers. Request that customers remove personal items from the vehicle. Customers should be asked not to bring children or others with them during the vehicle drop -off. Discontinue any customer pick -up or drop -off services and ensure customers know that they are responsible for their own travel to and from the repair shop. Clean touchab le surfaces regularly, including tools, handles and latches, and controls on stationary and mobile equipment. If a tow truck or other company vehicle is frequently shared amongst workers, thoroughly clean the surfaces in the cab whenever a new driver uses the vehicle. Disinfect keys, key fobs, and the vehicle before and after servicing a customer's vehicle. Wipe down all surfaces and controls touched by the driver or technician. Communicate with customers via text, email, or phone to provide estimates and get repair authorizations. Implement digital vehicle inspections, where possible, to identify service needs and provide estimates. Consider closing waiting rooms or lounges. If that's not possible, waiting rooms or lounges should be reconfigured so tha t physical distancing can be maintained, this could include taping off chairs or benches that should not be used or removing furniture from the room. Amenities, including magazines, books, coffee, water, self -serve stations (unless touchless), and other items for customers, must be removed from waiting or lounges to help reduce touch points and customer interactions. 14 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 103 of 130 Page ID #:960 Additional Considerations for Car Washing Operations Regularly clean payment terminals, vacuum hoses, bay guns, wash selector equipment, vending machines, and cleaning machines and high traffic areas like waiting rooms or lounges. Consider requiring customers to make reservations for in -person services that are not automated, e.g. detailing. Request customers to bring an d use face coverings during the appointment and ask that customers remove personal items from the vehicle. Customers should be asked not to bring children or others with them for the service. Vehicles should be ventilated with a blower and air should be recirculated through the vehicle before workers clean them to minimize exposure to air that might contain contaminants. Limit interior vehicle cleaning to one worker at a time. Ensure vacuum nozzles are cleaned after every use. Customers should line up in their cars at facilities with automated car washing and not exit the vehicle. For self -serve car wash operations, remove dirty towels or cloth wipes after each customer interaction. Place them in a closed container where they cannot be used again until properly laundered either by a commercial laundering service or a laundering process which includes immersion in water of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 25 minutes. Store all clean linens in a clean, covered place. Ensure workers who ha ndle dirty linens or laundry wear gloves. Close every other vacuum stall, if necessary, to maintain physical distancing. For self -service car washes, provide disposable gloves for customers to use when handling hoses, wands, vacuum hoses and other cleaning devices. Frequently clean and disinfect these surfaces. Consider closing waiting rooms or lounges. If that's not possible, waiting rooms or lounges should be reconfigured so that physical distancing can be maintained, this could include taping off chairs or benches that should not be used or removing furniture from the room. Amenities, including magazines, books, coffee, water, self -serve stations, and other items for customers, must be removed from waiting or lounges to help reduce touch points and custom er interactions. 15 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 104 of 130 Page ID #:961 Additional Considerations for Cleaning and Janitorial Services Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are shared, sanitize between each use, according to CDC guidelines . Sanitize all tools daily after the work day ends. Janitorial or custodial workers must be told if they are going to b e working in a location where an infected person has been so they can tak ethe necessary precautions to protect themselves and can provide needed cleaning and disinfecting services. Any area where an infected person has been must be ventilated, according to Table 1 in the Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission o f Mycobacterium Tuberculosis at 99.9% removal efficiency before workers can enter. If jan itorial or custodial workers are asked to disinfect an area with known COVID -19 confirmed cases, they must not start operations until the employer has provided the proper protective equipment and hazard training, or a refresher training. Make sure all work ers have been trained to use and have an adequate supply of all -purpose cleaners and disinfectants, when needed. Follow the complete CDC guidelines for cleaning and disinfection . Follow Cal/OSHA requirements and manufacturer instructions for safe use and required personal protec tive equipment for cleaning products. Workers should have enough ventilation (air flow) in areas where they are disinfecting. If cleaning in a bathroom or other small space, make sure the door is propped open. Follow the safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Health Services. Workers should be supplied with bandages or other items to cover any cuts, scratches, or open wounds on skin and hav e sufficient supply to change the bandages often. Customers must be reminded to maintain six feet of distance from janitorial or custodial staff. Implement a process to regularly check in with workers to ensure customers are following this protocol. Ensure workers are able to share such information without fear of reprisal or retaliation. 16 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 105 of 130 Page ID #:962 Additional Considerations for Pet Grooming and Dog Walking Pet grooming services should evaluate their existing cleaning and sanitation protocols and determine what additional hygiene and cleaning measures should be implemented. All items and equipment, including tables, baths, and grooming tools, should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between each pet appointment. Pet grooming services should require customers to make reservations for in-person services and walk -in appointments should be suspended. Appointments should be staggered, where feasible, to limit customer interactions. Pet grooming services should require pets be dropped off for their appointment throu gh a contactless process instead of hand -to-hand delivery, when possible. This could include curbside check -in and pick - up, where feasible. Pets should be transferred to and from their grooming services with slip leads owned by the pet grooming facility. T he pet grooming facility should not handle anything belonging to pets, including collars and leashes. To help keep six feet of distance between people at all possible times, place tape on the grooming room floors and in areas indicating where customers sho uld stand and where groomers can walk. Pet groomers should be instructed to maintain a distance of at least six feet between themselves and any person, including fellow groomers. Limit the total number of groomers in the grooming facility, consistent with physical distancing requirements, instructing groomers to work at every other table and limit only one groomer at a time in the pet bathing area. Dog walking services should establish protocols to ensure customers cancel their dog walking s ervice if any person in the household has been diagnosed with COVID -19 or is sick or exhibiting any symptoms. Dog walking services should maintain regular contact with customers to ask about any such issues if not told by the customer in advance. If the dog walker or pet owner has any COVID -19 symptoms, has been sick, or has been exposed to someone who has, dog walking services should be cancelled. Dog walkers and pet owners should k eep their interactions limited. If unable to discuss important pet care details virtually, in -person interaction 17 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 106 of 130 Page ID #:963 must be short and a six -foot distance throughout any conversation must be maintained. Dog walkers and pet owners should practice contactless ha nd-offs. The pet owner should make all efforts to allow the dog walker to let themselves in and all essential materials should be left near the door. If a lead hand -off is necessary, keep the interaction quick and wash hands after or use proper hand saniti zer. When the pet owner is not home, they should make sure the pet is easily accessible and should gate the pet near the entry area whenever possible. If the pet owner is dropping the dog off at the dog walker's residence, the dog walker should ensure the drop -off occurs at the home's door or, in a multi -family building, an established common area, preferably outdoors. When possible, the dog walker should bring and use their own lead and disposable waste bags. Clean and sanitize all materials, including leads, food containers, water, and food bowls before and after a walk. Additional Considerations for Landscaping and Yard Maintenance Services Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are shared, sanitize between each use, according to CDC guidelines . Sanitize all tools daily after the work day ends. Avoid contact with touch points at the jobsite, such as gate handles, and ensure any employe r-provided equipment is disinfected before use (mowers, hoses, etc.). Whenever possible, workers should drive separately to job sites, only one person per vehicle, unless a vehicle is large enough to maintain social distancing. If workers meet at a central location and travel to job site in company - owned vehicles, assign one truck to one crew and do not rotate the vehicle. The vehicle cab and all touch points should be cleaned at the end of each work day. Eliminate customer contact whenever possible . When customers are present, maintain six -foot social distance at all times. Announce yourself by phone instead of ringing the doorbell. Take payment over the phone or online, if possible. 18 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 107 of 130 Page ID #:964 Additional Considerations for Laundromats, Dry Cleaning, and Othe r Laundry Services This guidance does not include product handling hazards in laundromats that process biologically contaminated laundry from health care institutions. Additional requirements apply to those facilities. All garments should be handled using extra precautions. Garments should be brought in a sealed bag and left sealed for at least 24 hours and handled as little as possible. Workers should avoid shaking the garments once they are removed from the bag. Workers should wear disposable gloves and wash hands before wearing and after removing them. Disinfect counters, pay terminals, and other commonly touched items between each customer visit. Limit the total number of customers in laundromats to ensure physical distancing can be maintained. This could also require that some washing and drying machines are made inoperable to ensure customers have adequate distance when using the machines. If linens are to be transported on routes, any containers used to transport clean linens, if previously used f or soiled linens, must be properly cleaned and disinfect ed. Containers need to be labeled appropriately. 1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Limited service providers must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Departmen t of Public Health (CDPH) . Additionally, employers should be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change. 19 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 108 of 130 Page ID #:965 COVID-19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Logistics and Warehousing Facilities July 29, 2020 covid19.ca.gov K Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 109 of 130 Page ID #:966 OVERVIEW On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID -19 among the population. The impact of COVID -19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported illness ranges from very mild (some peop le have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and se rious complications. Transmission is most likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. Precise information about the number and rates of COVID -19 by industry or occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or tran smitting COVID -19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include hospitals, long -term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. As stay -at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to ensure the safety of workers and the public. Key prevention practices include: physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required) and customers/clients, frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, training workers on these and other elements of the COVID -19 prevention plan. In addition, it will be critical to have in pla ce appropriate processes to identify new cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. PURPOSE This document provides guidance for businesses operating in the logistics/warehousing industry to support a safe, clean environment for workers . The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health -related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/loc al orders, as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA COVID -19 Infection Prevention for Logistics Employers and Workers webpage. CDC has additional requirements in their guidance for businesses and employers and specific guidance for mail and parcel delivery . 2 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 110 of 130 Page ID #:967 Required Use of Face Coverings On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings , which broadly requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any member of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person's own household or residence) are present when unable to physically distance; Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended. Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance . Fac e covering s are strongly encouraged in other circumstances , and employ ers can implement additiona l fac e covering requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meet s one of the exemption s from wearing a fac e covering. If a wo rker who would otherwis e be required to wear a fac e covering because of frequent contact with o thers cannot wear o ne due to a medica l conditio n, they should be provided with a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medica l condition permit s it. Business es that are open to the public should be cogniza nt of the exemption s to wearing face covering s in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may no t exclude any member of the public for not wearing a fac e covering if that person i s complying with the guidance . Bus iness es will need to develop polic ies fo r handling these exemptio ns amo ng customers , clients, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 111 of 130 Page ID #:968 Worksite Specific Plan Establish a written, worksite -specific COVID -19 prevention plan at every facility, perform a comprehensive risk as sessment of all work areas and work tasks ,and designate a person at each facility to implement the plan. Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions . Identify contac t information for the local health department where the facility is located for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among workers . Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan available to worke rs and their representatives . Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive worker( s) and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. Topics for Worker Training Information on COVID -19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to contracting the virus. Self-screening at home, including tempe rature and/or symptom checks using CDC guidelines . The importance of not coming to work : 4 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 112 of 130 Page ID #:969 o If a worker ha s symptoms of COVID -19 as described by the CDC , such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or sme ll, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, O R o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID -19 and has not yet been released from isolation, OR o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID -19 and is considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation ). To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 test . To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webpage . The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Physical Distancing section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for p hysical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded after each shift. 5 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 113 of 130 Page ID #:970 Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled . Ensure independent contractors, temporary , or contract workers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporar y and/or contract workers. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker's compensation for COVID -19, including worker s' sick leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and worker s' rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor's Executive Order N -62-20 while that orde r is in effect . Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the ext ent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above . Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19 to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. Employers should consider where disposa ble glove use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 114 of 130 Page ID #:971 examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched items. Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as break rooms, lunch areas, and changing areas, and areas of ingress and egress including stairways and stairwells, handrails, elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including tables, amenities, doorknobs, toilets, and handwashing facilities. Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, machinery, tools, equipment, shelves, storage rooms, handles, latches and locks, and controls on stationary and mobile equipment. Require workers to wash hands or use sanitizer between use of shared equipment, such as time clocks and forklifts, and allow work time to do so. Avoid sharing phones, other work tools, or equipment wherever possible. Never share PPE. Clean delivery vehicles and equipment before and after delivery, carry additional sanitation materials during deliveries, and use clean personal protective equipment for each delivery stop. For delivery drivers, normally accessible restrooms on routes (e.g., restaurants, coffee shops) may be closed. Employers should provide workers alternative restroom locations and allow time for workers to use them. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as par t of the worker' s job duties. Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. Provide additional sanitary facilities (portable toilets and handwashing stat ions) if necessary and practical. Stagger breaks if feasible to ensure physical distancing and the chance to clean restrooms frequently. When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products approved for use against COVID -19 included on the Environmenta l Protection Agency (EPA) -approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 115 of 130 Page ID #:972 gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropr iate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves as required by the product instr uctions. Follow the asthma -safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. Workers should be provided and use protective equipment when offloading and storing delivered goods. Workers should inspect deliveries and perform disinfection measures prior to storing goods in warehouses and facilities when deliveries appear tampered with. Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible. Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the h ighest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in work and break areas. Physical Distancing Guidelines Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between worke rs, including transportation personnel. These can include use of physical partitions or visual cues such as floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand. Minimize transaction time between warehouse workers and transporta tion personnel. Perform gate check -ins and paperwork digitally if feasible. Reconfigure workspaces and shared outdoor spaces to allow for at least six feet between workers . Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing administrative needs through telework). Use the following hierarchy to prevent transmission of COVID -19 in work areas especially where physical distancing is difficult to maintain : engineering controls, administrative controls, and PPE. o Engineering controls include creating physical or spatial barriers between workers such as Plexiglas or other sturdy 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 116 of 130 Page ID #:973 o Administrative controls include increasing the number of shifts to reduce the number of personnel present at one time and ensure adequate physical distancing. o PPE includes face shields, some types of masks , and impermeable gloves. Note that some disposabl e equipment such as respirators are prioritized for health care workers and workers that handle pathogens and should not otherwise be used. Adjust safety and other meetings to ensure physical distance and conduct smaller individual meetings at facilities t o maintain physical distancing guidelines. Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers on the jobsite at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g., staggering shift start/end times) or rotating crew access to a designated area during a shift. Stage the jobsite to stagger work and limit overlap of work crews. Place additional limitations on th e number of workers in enclosed areas, where six feet of separation may not be sufficient to limit transmission of the virus. Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and seating that ensures physical distancing. Close commo n areas where personnel are likely to congregate and interact (e.g., kitchenettes, break rooms, etc.). Discourage workers from congregating in high traffic areas. 1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The logist ics and warehousing industry must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) . Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change. 9 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 117 of 130 Page ID #:974 COVID-19 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE: Family Entertainment Centers July 29, 2020 All guidance should be implemented only with county health officer approval following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing, and testing. 1 EXHIBIT L Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 118 of 130 Page ID #:975 OVERVIEW On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID -19 among the population.

PURPOSE This document provides guidance for family entertainment center operators to support a safe, clean en vironment for workers and customers. Examples of such businesses include bowling alleys, miniature golf, batting cages, arcades, and movie theaters. NOTE: This guidance is not intended for ice rinks, roller rinks, laser tag arenas, etc., where guests are l ess able to maintain physical distancing of at least six 2 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 119 of 130 Page ID #:976 feet, where a central part of the activity is circulating in the space, and which can accommodate a large number of guests who are mainly from different households. It is not intended for amusement, theme, or water parks; however, these types of parks that have stand -alone bowling alleys, miniature golf, arcades, movie theaters, etc., may open those operations provided they adhere to applicable state and local guidance and keep other attractions close d including amusement park rides. Discontinue demonstrations, such as magic, live animal shows etc., unless physical distancing and sanitation protocols can be met. Family entertainment centers with convention space, rentable meeting rooms, other areas for private events such as birthday parties, etc., should keep those areas closed until such activities are allowed to resume modified or full operation through a specific reopening order and guidance. Family entertainment centers with restaurants, bars, coff ee shops, gift shops, museums and interactive exhibits, etc., should refer to guidance on such industries as it becomes available on the COVID -19 Resilience Roadmap website . Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a setting bringing multiple different households to engage in the same activity carries a relatively higher risk for widespread transmission of the COVID -19 virus, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, a nd death, especially among more vulnerable populations. *Movie theaters must therefore limit attendance to 25% of theater capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. The California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county De partments of Public Health, will review and assess the impact of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased -in restoration of leisure activities. This guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health -related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID -19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID -19 webpage . CDC has additional requirements in their guidance for businesses and employers. Required Use of Face Coverings On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings , which broadly requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 3 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 120 of 130 Page ID #:977 People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether at the workplace or performing work off -site, when: Interacting in -person with any member of the public; Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time; Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others; Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, elevators, and parking facilities; In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the person' s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically distance ; Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private car service or ride -sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no passengers are pr esent, face coverings are strongly recommended. Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance . Fac e covering s are strongly encouraged in other circumstances , and employ ers can implement additiona l fac e covering requirem ents in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meet s one of the exemptions from wearing a fac e covering . If a worker who would otherwise be required to wear a fac e covering because of frequent contact with o thers cannot wear o ne due to a medica l conditio n, they should be provided with a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom ed ge, if feasible, and if the medica l condition permit s it. Business es that are open to the public should be cogniza nt of the exemption s to wearing face covering s in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member of the public for not wearing a fac e covering if that person i s complying with the guidance . Bus iness es will need to develop polic ies fo r handling these exemptio ns amo ng customers , clients, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 121 of 130 Page ID #:978 Workplace Specific Plan Establish a written, work place -specific COVID -19 prevention plan at every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and work tasks , and designate a person at each facility to implement the plan. Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemption s. Identify contact information for the local health department where the facility is located, for communicating information about COVID -19 outbreaks among workers. Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives . Regularly evaluate the facility for compliance with the plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. Investigate any COVID -19 illness and determine if any work -related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to prevent further cases. Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines . Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID -19 positive worker (s) and close contacts. Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. Topics for Worker Training Information on COVID -19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to contracting the virus. Self-screening at home, including tempe rature and/or symptom checks using CDC guidelines . The importance of not coming to work : o If a worker has symptoms of COVID -19 as described by the CDC 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 122 of 130 Page ID #:979 as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or sme ll, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, OR o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID -19 and has not yet been released from isolation , OR o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID -19 and is considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation ). To return to work after a worker receives a COVID -19 diagnosis only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID -19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID -19 test. To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further details are available on CDC's webpage . The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines ). The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see Phys ical Distancing section below). Proper use of face coverings, including: o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal protective equipment (PPE). o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or adjusting face coverings. o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. o Face coverings must not be share d and should be washed or discarded after each shift. Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 6 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 123 of 130 Page ID #:980 Coverings , which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer's policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled . Ensure any independent contractors, temporary , or contract workers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID -19 prevention po licies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker's compensation for COVID -19, including workers' sick leave rights unde r the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Governor's Executive Order N -51-20, and workers' rights to workers' compensation benefits and presumption of the work -relatedness of COVID -19 pursuant to the Governor' s Executive order N -62-20 while that Order is in effect . Individual Control Measures and Screening Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the ext ent possible. If requiring self -screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines , as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above . Encourage workers and visitors who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID -19 to stay home. Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. Employers should consider w here disposable glove use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items contamin ated by body fluids. Employers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in strategic and highly -visible locations and in reservation confirmations, to remind the public that they must use face coverings and practice physical distancing, and should frequently wash their hands with soap for 7 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 124 of 130 Page ID #:981 at least 20 seconds , use hand sanitizer , and not touch their face . Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them available to anyone who arrives without one, if pos sible. Guests and visitors should be temperature and/or symptom screened upon arrival, asked to use hand sanitizer, and to bring and wear a face covering when not eating or drinking. Display a set of clearly visible rules for customers and personnel at entrance(s) that are to be a condition of entry. The rules could include instructions to use hand sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other customers, avoid unnecessary touching of surfaces, contact information for the local health department, and ch anges to services. Whenever possible, the rules should be available digitally, include pictograms, etc. Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as customer waiting areas and lobbies, worker break rooms, etc., and areas of ingress and egress, including stairways and elevator banks. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including counters, credit card machines, touchscreens, buttons, doorknobs, armrests, toilets, hand washing facilities, coin -operated and redemption games, vending machines, etc. Disinfect rented or shared items before issuing to and when returning from customer use, including bowling balls, golf balls, putters, writing implements, bats, shoes, helmets, etc. Close self -service i tem selection areas for games or activities, such as bowling balls on accessible racks, and provide these items to customers individually. Provide hand sanitizer dispensers throughout activity areas, lobbies, and service areas, for use by customers and workers. Hand sanitizer should be available for customers to use when activity items come into contact with shared surfaces (e.g., golf balls and golf cups, bowling balls and return machinery, etc.). Encourage guests to wash hands and/or use hand sanitizer of ten while using equipment and items. Remind members of the public (with signs and/or verbally) not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth. Consider providing disposable gloves at each activity area for use by members of the public. Make available a means of disposal at each location where gloves are provided. Provide disposable or single -use items whenever possible. This could include scorecards, pencils, 3D glasses, etc. If disposable replacements cannot be provided, properly disinfect items before and after customer use. Thoroughly clean and disinfect each customer activity area after every 8 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 125 of 130 Page ID #:982 use. This can include disinfecting tables, chairs, booster seats, booths, touch screens, etc. Allow adequate time for proper disinfection, following product instructions. Environmental Protection Agency -approved disinfectants require a minimum contact time (seconds to minutes) to be effective against human coronavirus. Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces shared by workers between shifts or between users, whichever is mo re frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, time clocks, copy machines, keys, cleaning equipment, gaming machinery, etc. Avoid sharing equipment such as phones, tablets, office machinery, and tools wherever possible. Never share PPE. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of the employee's job duties. Equip terminals, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation products, inclu ding hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, and provide personal hand sanitizers to all staff directly assisting customers. Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand saniti zer when needed. Provide resources to promote employees' personal hygiene. This will include tissues, no -touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for handwashing, alcohol -based hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, and disposable towels. When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products approved for use against COVID -19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted househo ld bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer's directions , ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSH A requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma -safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation . To minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a pr olonged facility shutdown. Adjust or modify facility hours to provide adequate time for regular thorough cleaning. Install and encourage the use of credit cards and hands -free devices, if 9 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 126 of 130 Page ID #:983 possible, including motion sensor lights, contactless payment system s, automatic soap and paper towel dispensers, and timecard systems. Inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible disinfection measures when receiving goods. Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can disperse pathog ens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible . Consider installing portable high -efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the building's air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in offices and other spaces. Physical Distancing Guidelines Adjust maximum occupancy rules to limit the number of people at family entertainment centers as appropriate to support physical distancing. Limit customer groups to a household unit. People from the same household do not need to be six feet apart. Close ball pits, foam pits, indoor playgrounds, climbing structures, enclosed bounce houses, etc., in accordance with CDC guidelines , as these areas promote congregation and are difficult to properly disinfect between uses. Family entertainment centers with prize redemption counters , gift shops, etc., should refer to and follow the guidelines for retail available on the COVID -19 webpage . Family entertainment centers that offer food a nd drink concessions should encourage customers to order online or over the phone, whenever possible, and make items available for counter pick -up. Use visual cues to ensure customers maintain physical distances of at least six feet while waiting in line. Install impermeable barriers at concession counters, if possible. Install physical, impermeable barriers or partitions between game, seating, and other types of activity areas to minimize exposure between customers. If this is not possible, discontinue ac tivity areas from use (using visual cues, removing items, etc.) so that customers can maintain at least six feet of distance at all times. Employers should take into consideration whether an activity may cause a customer to require additional space and mak e modifications to ensure adequate physical distances. Implement timed and/or advanced reservation ticketing systems and 10 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 127 of 130 Page ID #:984 pre-assigned seating or activity areas, whenever possible, to stagger customer visits and help maintain physical distances. Ask visitor s to wait in their vehicle until their reservation time and to arrive and leave in a single group to minimize crossflow of visitors and staff. Dedicate staff to manage movement of customers when activities could bring people within six feet of distance from each other, such as ushering customers to seats, preventing congregation in bottleneck areas, limiting groups from playing through courses, etc. Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between people, such as when customers are waiting in line. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where workers and customers/visitors should stand). Install impermeable barriers where physical distancing cannot b e maintained to minimize exposure between workers and customers. All workers should minimize the amount of time spent within six feet of guests. Designate separate routes for entry and exit into facilities, activity areas, seating areas, work areas, etc., if possible, to help maintain physical distancing and lessen the instances of people closely passing each other. Establish one -way directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to eliminate workers and guests from passing by one anoth er. Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative needs through telework). Reconfigure worksp aces, if possible, to allow for six feet between workers. Hold smaller meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing guidelines and consider holding meetings outside or via online platforms or telephone. Close or limit access to breakrooms, use ba rriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Place additional li mitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas, such as supply rooms and counter areas, to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to maintain phy sical distancing protocols. Redesign parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper 11 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 128 of 130 Page ID #:985 separation (e.g., every other space, contactless payment, etc.) Additional Considerations for Indoor Movie Thea ters Limit the number of attendees in each theater to 25% of theater capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. Implement a reservation system to limit the number of attendees entering the theater at a time whenever possible. Designate arrival times as part of reservations, if poss ible, so that customers arrive at and enter the theater in staggered groups. Establish directional entry and exit into theaters where possible. Reconfigure, close, or otherwise remove seats from use to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet betwee n attendees. This may require seating every other row or blocking off or removing seats in a \"checkerboard\" style (use each row but make sure no one is directly behind other patrons) so that distances are maintained in all directions. Members of the same h ousehold may be seated together but should maintain at least six feet of distance from other households. Dedicate staff to help people maintain distances before and after screenings. This could include ushering to seats prior to the start of a show and dis missing customers in an orderly fashion to reduce the crossflow of traffic or crowding in exit rows. Consider using disposable or washable seat covers in theaters, particularly on porous surfaces that are difficult to properly clean. Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when attendees are entering and exiting facilities, if possible and in accordance with security and safety protocols. Consider limiting the number of people that use the rest room at one time to allow for physical distancing. Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper separation (e.g., closing every other space). Additional Considerations for Drive -In Movie Theaters 12 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 129 of 130 Page ID #:986 Reconfigure parking spaces to ensure that vehicles have at least six feet of distance between them. Each vehicle may only be occupied by members of the same household who have already been in close contact with each other. If not utilizing restroom facilities or picking up concessions, patrons must remain in their vehicles. Patrons cannot sit outside of their vehicles, e.g., to view a drive - in movie near their vehicle. Ensure regular cleaning and disinfecting of on -site restrooms . Cashless and touchl ess transactions systems are preferred wherever possible. If available, orders, reservations and payments for the drive -in business should be made in advance online or over the phone. Drive -in movie theater concessions should be ordered online or over the phone, if possible, and be available for curbside pick -up. Walk -up concession services should be available for pick -up of pre -ordered items. If pre -ordering items is not possible, ensure that customers maintain proper physical distancing when waiting to o rder food items. Drive -in movie theaters should suspend double -feature offerings avoid the need for intermissions . 1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) . Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change. 13 Case: 20-55907, 09/21/2020, ID: 11830259, 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 58-4 Filed 12/04/20 Page 130 of 130 Page ID #:987 No. _____ IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HARVEST ROCK CHURCH, INC.; HARVEST INTERNATIONAL MINISTRY, INC., itself and on behalf of its member Churches in California, Applicants , v.

On July 17, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the above -captioned cause in this Court, filing a Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminar y and Permanent Injunctive Relief, Declaratory Relief, and Damages (dkt. 1), and a Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. 4). 2. On July 20, 2020, this Court denied Plaintiffs' Motion to the temporary restraining order, and set a briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' Motion as to a preliminary injunction, with Defendants' response due on August 3, 2020. 3. On August 3, 2020, the Governor filed his Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (d kt. 31, \"Opposition\"). In his Opposition, the Governor contended that Plaintiffs are not entitled to any injunctive relief because they have not presented any evidence that the government in California is attempting to enforce the Governor's COVID -19 Execu tive Orders and California Public Health Directives. (Dkt. 31, Opposition at 16 -17). 4. As Plaintiffs pointed out in their Reply in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction (dkt. 37), actual enforcement is not a prerequisite in the First Amendment context , as the mere existence of the power to enforce an unconstitutional restriction on free speech is sufficient to warrant injunctive relief. (Dkt. 37, Reply aat 15-17). 5. However, enforcement and threatened enforcement is not merely theoretical now . Contrary to the assertions in the Governor's Opposition, the Planning Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 41 Filed 08/11/20 Page 2 of 5 Page ID #:641 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 and Community Development Department, Code Enforcement Division, for the City of Pasadena has now issued a letter to Plaintiff Harvest Rock Church threatening criminal penalties, inclu ding fines and imprisonment. A true and correct copy of the City of Pasadena Code Enforcement Letter is attached as EXHIBIT A to the Declaration of Che Ahn, filed simultaneously herewith . 6. In that Letter, the City of Pasadena states quite plainly that it h as been and will continue to enforce the Governor's Orders. It states: \"Violations of [the Governor's] Orders constitute misdemeanors under California and Pasadena law punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment. The City of Pasadena is enforcing these Orders and will continue to do so .\" (Ahn Decl., Exhibit A (emphasis added)). 7. Though the Letter was dated July 28, 2020, Plaintiff Harvest Rock Church did not become aware of the Letter sent to them until today, August 11, 2020. Plaintiffs were not aware of this Letter's existence until that time, and therefore did not have an opportunity to bring it to this Court's attention in its Reply in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction. 8. Pastor Ahn's Declaration is submitted to supplement the record with relevant f acts concerning the actual enforcement of the Governor's Orders and the threat of continued enforcement absent injunctive relief.

On July 17, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the above -captioned cause in this Court, filing a Verified Co mplaint for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief, Declaratory Relief, and Damages (dkt. 1), and a Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. (Dkt. 4). 2. On July 20, 2020, this C ourt denied Plaintiffs' Motion to the temporary restraining order, and set a briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' Motion as to a preliminary injunction, with Defendants' response due on August 3, 2020. 3. On August 3, 2020, the Governor filed his Opposition to Pl aintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (dkt. 31, \"Opposition\"). In his Opposition, the Governor contended that Plaintiffs are not entitled to any injunctive relief because they have not presented any evidence that the government in California is attempting to enforce the Governor's COVID -19 Executive Orders and California Public Health Directives. (Dkt. 31, Opposition at 16 -17). 4. As Plaintiffs pointed out in their Reply in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction (dkt. 37), actual enforcement i s not a prerequisite in the First Amendment context, as the mere existence of the power to enforce an unconstitutional restriction on free speech is sufficient to warrant injunctive relief. (Dkt. 37, Reply aat 15-17). 5. However, enforcement and threatened enforcement is not merely theoretical now . Contrary to the assertions in the Governor's Opposition, the Planning Case 2:20-cv-06414-JGB-KK Document 45 Filed 08/21/20 Page 2 of 5 Page ID #:658 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 and Community Development Department, Code Enforcement Division, for the City of Pasadena has now issued a letter to Plaintiff Harve st Rock Church threatening criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. (See Dkt. 41 -1, 1-2). 6. Moreover, if the threatened criminal sanctions were not apparent from the Code Enforcement Division (dkt. 41 -2), Plaintiffs have received a letter from the Office of the City Attorney/City Prosecutor, Criminal Division, threatening to impose criminal sanctions on Plaintiffs for merely holding worship services. A true and correct copy of the Office of the City Attorney/City Prosecuto r, Criminal Division, i s attached as EXHIBIT A to the Declaration of Che Ahn, filed simultaneously herewith . 7. In that Letter, the City Attorney/City Prosecutor informed Plaintiffs that \"violations of [the Governor's Orders] are criminal in nature.\" (Ahn Dec laration, EXHIBIT A at 1). It further st ates that \"[e]ach day in violation is a separate violation and carries with it a potential punishment of up to one year in jail and a fine for each violation.\" ( Id.). 8. Finally, the Letter states that \"[a]ny violations in the future will subject your Church , owners, administrators, operators, staff, and parishioners to the above - referenced criminal penalties as well as the potential closure of your Church.\" ( Id.). 9. Pastor Ahn's Declaration is submitted to supplement the record with relevant facts concerning t he actual enforcement of the Governor's Orders and the threat of continued enforcement absent injunctive relief.
