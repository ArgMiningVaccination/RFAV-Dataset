The spine is an important structure that houses and provides protection for the spinal cord. Multiple joints called vertebrae joint together to form the spinal column. When these vertebrae are not in their normal position, it can create stress on the body's nervous system which in turn will alter normal function. This is called a vertebral subluxation. Where conventional or \"allopathic\" medicine focuses on curing illness through the use of drugs and surgery, the goal of chiropractic is to optimize health with a non-invasive approach that utilizes specific spinal adjustments to restore normal alignment and function. In the example of nerve root compression, a misaligned spinal joint can cause direct pressure on a nerve that exits the spine, resulting in dysfunction to the body part controlled by that nerve. So, Chiropractic is not just about manual care of the spine, although it has certainly built a reputation caring for that often troublesome piece of anatomy, it is the way to optimize the health of the whole human system and not just a means to relieve back complaints. There are many techniques used in the chiropractic profession today. The chiropractors at Lake Mary Chiropractic Center utilize a technique called Chiropractic Biophysics\u00ae (CBP). CBP technique uses corrective exercise, traction and adjusting protocols to correct spine and posture deviations back towards normal alignment. By correcting whole spine misalignments, more permanent corrections of your ailments can be achieved. CBP is the most thoroughly researched technique in chiropractic today, with more than half of the technique publications being published in medical and orthopedic scientific journals. Check Out Our "}
