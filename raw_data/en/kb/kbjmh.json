Then, please read on for some tips and suggestions on how to speed up the body's self-healing response to the COVID-19 virus. Which crystals have anti-viral properties? [ The two most accessible crystals with anti-viral properties are Green Fluorite and Chevron Amethyst. If you can wear the Green Fluorite that is ideal. Putting a piece of Green Fluorite in one pocket and a piece of Chevron Amethyst in the other pocket, is also an easy and effective way to go. About once per hour, hold the crystals and heat them up with your hands. Heating crystals activates them, and that's what you need to do - activate the crystals. Note: Green Fluorite can give some protection against the common cold. There are no crystals that have been proven to protect against COVID-19.] Which crystal will help my immune system and cellular metabolism? Shungite will help both your immune system and your cellular metabolism. The easiest way to access the energy of Shungite is to rub a Shungite Sphere all over your body. This action infuses the Shungite energy into your energy system and from there, the Shungite affects your physical body in a very positive way by stimulating cellular metabolism. Which crystals can help lungs? There are two kinds of crystals that help lung function: Clevelandite and Vanadinite. It is probably easier to get hold of Vanadinite. A helpful way to engage the Vanadinite energy will also be to rub the chest area, and the upper back with the Vanadinite, to infuse energy into the lungs. Is there a crystal that helps with dehydration? Yes, Moonstone will help! You can infuse Moonstone into your energy system by rubbing your body with it ... and of course, remember to drink water and add electrolytes. Is there a crystal healing technique that can help the upper respiratory tract infection? Yes, the Anti-Inflammatory Technique for Acute Conditions has consistently helped people with upper respiratory tract infections. It does not cure the condition, but does speed up the physiological responses and the healing, at the same time as reducing discomfort and misery. Even if you don't know how to do this technique, you can still engage the stones to help you - and here's the list of stones that we use: Green Fluorite, Green Calcite, Green Apophyllite, Zincite. If you want a practitioner to do this for you, please email us at [crystalhealingtechniques@gmail.com](mailto:crystalhealingtechniques@gmail.com) Is there anything else I can do to help? Yes, but please first ask: \"Do I need medical care?\" because after a certain point of physical deterioration only appropriate medical intervention can help. Here are some additional tips: Boost your liver function, by eating liver supportive foods and by not eating foods that stress your liver. Look this up online. The liver is a very important organ in supporting your immune system and the strength of your overall energy. Aromatherapy is another powerful tool. You can increase your comfort by putting a drop of peppermint oil under your nose, on your chest, on your forehead along your hairline and on the back of your neck. This will help with congestion and will also help with headaches and feelings of heaviness.
