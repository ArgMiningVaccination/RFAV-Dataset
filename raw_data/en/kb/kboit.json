REVIEWS - I moved to the area about 9 months ago and found this place through the internet. Dr. Chevigny was great! He made my back aches and migraines go away after two appointments. He understood that I was fresh out of college and had just moved and had other priorities. We discussed that it would be best for me to come in with a regular schedule, but agreed it wasn't realistic for me financially at the time. All around great! - Dr. Chevigny provides great-individualized care to all of his patients. For example, I have an extremely hyper mobile neck making it very difficult for many chiropractors to adjust. In the past, many chiropractors I have seen give up on my neck after the first few visits leaving me in extreme pain. Not Dr. Chevigny!! He went above and beyond to make sure my neck was adjusted. To this day he still provides the best neck adjustments I have ever had! He is always learning new techniques to help my specific situation. Another example: when I was having some complications during pregnancy that did not allow for the use of \"normal\" or the \"most commonly used\" adjustment techniques he found ways to still make sure I was getting the proper care and adjustments I needed. - I come here for massage and it is always wonderful. Nicole works out the kinks in my muscles and I feel better. The place is low key and the price is right! Get Personalized Treatment Get chiropractic care, massage therapy, and "}
