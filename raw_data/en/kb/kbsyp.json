Exhibit & Support Opportunities For information on exhibit and support opportunities during this and many other Scripps educational conferences, please contact: Scripps Conference Services & CME 858-652-5400 med.edu@scrippshealth.orgwww.scripps.org/conferenceservicesCourse Overview Integrative holistic medicine embraces conventional medicine and complementary therapies that are based in science. It focuses on the whole person, mind-body-spirit, with a strong emphasis on the physician-patient partnership. Integrative holistic medicine is based in the following principles: Health is more than the absence of disease. A person is more than their symptoms and healing requires a whole-person approach. Empowered patients make long-term and lasting changes that support healing and optimal health. Research shows that nearly one in three Americans seek out comple-mentary and alternative medicine to supplement conventional care. Patients are now asking their physicians about the medical value of these treatments and therapies. Since complementary and alternative medicine has not become routinely incorporated into most medical school curricula, health care providers are seeking trusted sources for learning about these techniques. This course was created with these needs in mind and sets reasonable standards for the application of integrative holistic medicine. Join Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine and the American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine for a one-of-a-kind educational experi-ence that includes an up-to-date review of integrative holistic medicine science and research, as well as an opportunity for personal renewal. The course format includes lectures followed by question-and-answer sessions and experiential morning programs. Faculty are renowned experts in integrative holistic medicine and provide practical summa- ries on a wide range of mind-body-spirit topics. 2010 Conference Highlights Comprehensive week-long educational course Evidence-based integrative holistic medicine presented by leading experts Interactive educational formats including: case studies, small group exercises, experiential demonstrations, Q&A and panel discussions Opportunities to interact with faculty and fellow attendees to establish a network of like-minded professionals Credits available for many health care professionals Bayfront resort providing a natural and idyllic setting for your own self renewalCo u r s e In t r o d u CtIo n \" quick note to say that the conference has totally changed my practice and my life (no exaggeration)... my passion was so ignited by what I heard, that I have continued to focus on all the great information that I have gained.
