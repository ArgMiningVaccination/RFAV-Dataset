In this realm of alternative therapy (known as crystal therapy), quartz is perhaps considered the Taj Mahal of crystals, if you will. Not only is quartz the second most abundant mineral on earth's crust (behind feldspar), but it is also said to be a \"master healer\". It's found in as many forms as you can imagine, offers a wide variety of metaphysical benefits and happens to be a free gift inside [our Intention Kits](https://nefertemnaturals.com/collections/intentionkits). Quartz is a hard mineral made up of silica. There are 2 distinct forms of quartz - a \"normal\" one and a high temperature one. The high temperature variety of quartz forms underground at temperatures of over 1,063\u00b0F! Quartz crystals that fall under this variety include chalcedony, agate, onyx, carnelian, and jasper. Quartz crystals that fall under the \"normal\" variety (also known as macrocrystalline for their obvious crystal formations) include the famous clear quartz, rose (pink), smoky (grey), amethyst (purple), and citrine (yellow). Clear quartz is arguably the most powerful of all the quartz stones because of its purity of color, its ability to absorb and regulate energy in the environment and its extreme versatility. Clear quartz can be used on its own or paired with other crystals to intensify their individual strengths. It can be used in replacement for any other crystal when performing chakra specific energy work. It is even used to make glass! What an amazing stone...and to think you get one [FREE in every Intention Kit](https://nefertemnaturals.com/pages/meditation-alternative) from us! Clear quartz can be used in as many ways as you can think of... You can place one in your pocket or drop it in your bra for day-long protection. You can hold it in the palm of your hand during meditation to help quiet your mind or set it under your pillow at night for enhanced dreams. You can wear it in jewelry or set it near your journal to enhance creativity and focus. You can place one on your altar for improved connection to the ancestor world or keep on the edge of your bathtub for enhanced purification during your daily shower or bath. You can add it to a crystal bag full of other crystals and trinkets and store in your purse or car. You can even take a quartz crystal point and set it right on your third eye to immediately tap into your natural, intuitive abilities. You can literally use it any which way you want! To maximize your quartz crystal's benefits, it's best to cleanse it as soon as you get it and then \"charge\" it, which is to infuse your energy and intentions into it. Cleanse your crystal by rinsing it in cold water, leaving it outside under the moonlight, burying it in the earth for a few hours or \"rinse\" it with sage smoke. You can also spray it with a [sage aroma spray](https://nefertemnaturals.com/collections/aromatherapy/products/spirit-cleanse-aromatherapy-spray) intended to purify its energy. [Learn more about crystal cleansing.](https://nefertemnaturals.com/blogs/news/how-to-cleanse-your-crystals) To charge your crystal, simply hold it in the palm of your hand, close your eyes, and imagine your spiritual light infusing into the crystal. To charge it with a specific purpose, focus your mind's eye (attention) on whatever benefit you are trying to manifest, be it peace, joy, wealth, protection, or love. Cleansing and charging your quartz crystal regularly will help to restore its equilibrium and neutralize the energy it has picked up. If you notice your crystal isn't providing the same level of benefit as it may have in the past, it could be because it's bogged down with too much negative energy. You then know it's time to cleanse and recharge once again. As a rule, it's a great idea to cleanse and recharge your crystals once a month, especially around the full or new moons. Adding a quartz stone, particularly a clear one, to your daily routines and rituals is a great way to keep your mind clear and your body and soul healthy. Simply placing it in your bathroom and connecting to it with great intention before you hop in your shower or bath, can help purify your spirits, allowing you to enjoy a light-hearted, positive day.
