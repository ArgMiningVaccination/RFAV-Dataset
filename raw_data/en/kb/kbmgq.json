Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 2/18/2019 I've been dealing with alopecia areata for about 5 years now. I've tried all the typical treatments such as topical scalp medications and direct injections to the scalp of cortisone. It was a very slow process to see any results of hair growth with these treatments. I've seek Dr. Tonnu at Cypress Natural Medicine about my condition in which she recommended to try PRP therapy. I was expecting to experience pain and discomfort with the multiple injections, but Dr. Tonnu was very gentle. She even made the process of drawing blood a breeze. After the first session, I immediately saw hair growth within two weeks. WHICH IS AMAZING to see when you constantly wake up in the morning and check in the mirror. I definitely feel better knowing that it is a more natural process without resorting to steroids and chemicals; not dealing with potential side effects. I'm definitely going to continue with the treatment to resolve my condition. I also recommend getting the vitamin boost injections. - 1/20/2020 For people with chronic illnesses, it is near impossible to find a medical professional who can both believe/validate your experience AND solve it. I've been seeing Dr. Bryan for a year now (appts every month) and with each appointment, I make significant progress against a whole host of issues I came to him with. I recently told my friend that the reason I so highly recommended him was for the two above reasons in addition to the front staff's executional abilities. I am always able to get an appt, my prescriptions are always ordered after appointments, I always know what I'm paying for. It's amazing how effective this office is!! - 9/1/2018 I had way much more pain after a adjustment from the osteopathic . She did nt look at my mri, x ray images before she do adjustment. A very bad experience ! Business owner information Bryan S. 9/4/2018 Hello Siu, I am sorry to hear about your recent experience. Good communication is the foundation of any therapeutic relationship. As I do not have any patients by this Yelp name, it is unfortunate that I cannot reach out to you personally in order to collect more information, so I will do my best to respond generally in this public forum. I allot one and a half hours for my new patient appointments. During this time the patient begins to tell me his or her story. I do my best to let the patient talk uninterrupted. When a person feels seen and heard, trust begins to develop which facilitates the healing process. After the patient has told his or her story, I have asked any clarifying questions, and the patient has indicated that s/he has nothing further to add, we move on to the evaluation and treatment portion of the appointment. Osteopathic manipulation is a gentle form of manual medicine that serves to help the structure of the body be as sound as possible so that it can function as best as possible. When the treatment is complete I talk with the patient about my findings, answer any questions s/he may have, and we make a plan for where to go from there. At this time I always let the patient know that s/he may be quite sore in the day or so after the treatment, that it is a normal (though not universal) reaction, and how to deal with it. Usually this information is sufficient so that the patient is not concerned should s/he experience a treatment reaction. Occasionally a patient is concerned that his or her experience is outside of the range of normal, and s/he will call so we can discuss it. Usually that is enough to reassure the patient, but on rare occasions, after that conversation we decide that it would be worthwhile for the patient to come in so we can figure out what is causing the discomfort. In this way we work together to unravel the puzzle that the person's body has presented so that s/he can express health as fully as possible. Sincerely, Dr. Jennifer Logan, D.O. - 5/24/2018 They are the best in the Bay. My family and I have been going to Cypress Natural Medicine for over 10 years. They have successfully treated my mother's cataract condition, my son's eczema/ allergy issues and pre / post pregnancy concerns. I had terrible sciatica while I was 6 months pregnant. My obgyn said I would need a wheelchair to get through the rest of my pregnancy. I was treated by Dr. Destia Skinner using cranial sacral and homeopathic remedies and within a few days I was without pain. The care we have received here is invaluable. - 4/2/2011 Overall a good experience, but only OK results for my symptoms. The Good: -Friendly and caring staff. -Dr.Bryan had some easy to implement treatment suggestions that I never considered in the past. -some improvement in my symptoms. - allowed for a sliding scale price visit when I was unemployed. The Mediocre: -The visits are costly, and only partially covered by health insurance. Also, the supplements that I was prescribed were quite costly and not covered by insurance at all. - After ~6 visits using the BIOSET anti-allergy machine, I still experience an allergic reaction to nuts. Aside: the biggest change to increase my energy levels and reduce allergic reactions was to switch to a Paleo Diet and use Garden of Life probiotics. - 12/20/2017Updated review I'm adding to my review from years ago. After I finished writing it, I realized that it was really long and drawn out. If you don't want to bother with the details, the basics are Dr. Bryan and Dr. Marie are great, kind, and saved my life - go see them! I saw Dr. Destia once this year to help me deal with some grief issues which seemed to help - she's great too! If you have time to kills and want the details: I had stopped seeing Dr. Bryan since I was feeling great - it's amazing what basic diet and lifestyle changes can do for your health. However, a couple of years ago I started getting a mysterious whole body pussing rash that had a deep nerve itch like the kind you get when you have poison oak or chicken pox. It was maddening! I was losing sleep, self-conscious about my skin, and exhausted. It would start with a bug bite then show up in patches all over my body. It didn't occur to me to see Dr. Bryan so I first went to see a bunch of conventional doctors and specialists since they were covered by my insurance. They ran a battery of blood work, had me do stool tests, and even did biopsies but nothing showed up and none of these \"experts\" could figure out what I had. The only treatment they suggested that worked was prednisone which basically just shut down my immune system and made me feel terrible. It did stop the rash enough to let me heal though. It just wasn't a good long-term solution. Every time I got a bug bite, I would get another flare up. It didn't make any sense. I would get bitten by a flea on my ankle and both my arms and legs would end up in a huge rash. Something was seriously wrong. I finally went to Dr. Bryan earlier this year and he was able to immediately diagnose me. He told me that I had a parasite and told me the exact name of the parasite. He said all I needed to do was take an antiparasitic medication then I should be good to go. At first, I didn't completely believe him since parasites seem to be the popular default diagnosis from natural doctors and the internet these days and the treatment seemed too easy. However, I read up on the parasite and it all made sense. The parasite was endemic to East Asia and not found in the US so conventional doctors don't test for it. People got it from eating raw or undercooked river fish which I ate plenty of since I love food and was looking for the best fish amok. I had spent a few weeks in Vietnam and Cambodia about nine months before my first rash showed up. The timing seemed so far apart that no one considered it except Dr. Bryan even though I told the other doctors about my travels. I took the antiparasitics and it got considerably better but it wasn't 100% gone. When Dr. Bryan retested me, he said the parasites didn't go completely away and told me to take another dose. When this happened a third time, he referred me to Dr. Marie who had recently joined their office. She's also a naturopathic doctor but also a shaman. I was a little weary since it seemed a little out there which isn't usually my style but I trusted Dr. Bryan and I was kind of desperate. You can read my separate review about Dr.Marie but basically, she is great! She definitely has some special, if not magical skills. I know that sounds crazy and had I not experienced it for myself, I would probably not believe it. Dr. Marie and Dr. Bryan completely cured me of my mysterious rash and got me back to good health. It's been about 6 months since they treated me. Since then, I've been bitten by many insects and have not had any more problems. I hope I never have to see either of them for health issues like this again but I highly recommend both of them to anyone who has any health issues!5/14/2014Previous review Dr. Bryan and Dr. Destia are fantastic doctors. They are well educated in both conventional medicine and natural/alternative medicine. They are also compassionate and patient. I've seen them on and off for the last year and a half and have always left feeling better! I feel fortunate to have found them. - 1/30/2011Updated review I was referred to Destia by an acupuncturist in Redwood city. I had a very serious neck injury because of which I was sufferring from blocked cerebrospinal fluid which used to give me a terrible headache and muscle weakness throughout my whole body.My symptoms were horrible and the quality of my life was very bad. I couldnot go to work and was feeling very low. I had a phone conversation with Dr Bryan for 15 mins free of cost and he suggested craniosacral therapy with Dr Destia. On my first visit everything seemed like Greek and I did not understand what was happening. Dr Destia thoroughly checked my head and neck and told me that I would need 5-6 visits to fix this problem. It has been 4 visits and I already started feeling better. She is very passionate, confident, knowledgeable and knows what the problem with the patient is. Thanks Destia for giving my life back to me.10/23/2010Previous review Destia is one of the best doctors I have ever seen. I got injured in a skiing accident long time back, however I have been sufferring from serious complications due to it. I have seen so many western doctors and no one could diagnose the problem. In just one visit destia said my problems are due to blockage of CSF in the brain and she gave me homeopathic remedy for it. I took the medicine for 3 months and I completely recovered. Thanks destia for giving my life back to me.10/20/2010Previous review Destia is very friendly, professional and at the same time very thorough in her judgement. I really like the place. She understands you very well and very accommodative. - 5/13/2008First to Review I met Destia Skinner, co-owner and naturopathic doctor, several years ago. She is very warm and responsive to any ailment you have. She helped me with my post-partum insomnia and whipped up a tincture for me. It helped me and she was very understanding. She owns this business with her husband, Brian, also a naturopathic doctor. - 6/23/2011 I have been seeing Dr. Destia Skinner for the last eight months for hypothyroidism, and cant rave enough about her! She diagnosed and treated me for adrenal fatigue as well, had me do a detox and a bunch of other things, and I'm feeling so much better now. She is the warmest and most compassionate doctor I've ever worked with and genuinely cares about you. I also love that she is totally committed to getting you back to vibrant health, listens carefully to you, and spends enough time with you each visit. My insurance doesn't cover the treatment, but Dr. Destia is mindful of that and tries her best to give me the cheaper supplements. And Arlene (their administrator) is an absolute delight to work with! All in all, I'm so grateful for her. If you need to see a naturopath, I'd strongly recommend Dr. Destia; you'll be so glad you did! - 4/26/2010 I have been faithfully for 2 years seeing Dr, Destia. She is a warm,understand and happy Doctor. I was experiecing dizziness that would not go away.. I had been to multiple Doctors in Western Medicine and they all told me I was fine... sometimes you begin to feel like you are crazy....Dr. Destia was different....She patiently worked with me doing hands on cranial sacral therapy and doing some blood tests and found out I was deficient on cortisol which made me very lackluster and tired most of the time. It took a while but everything worked. i feel like my old self again.....Don't give up! See Dr. Destia! There is a whole complete different world beyond Western Medicine ! Keep an open mind. You deserve not to be sick your whole life!
