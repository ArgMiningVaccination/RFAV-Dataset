It's a time to give our body a much needed rest. Think of it like a vacation for your liver and digestive tract. From the preservatives in our food, chemicals in the air we breathe and water we drink, to the electromagnetic radiation from wireless devices and of course stress, our bodies are always filtering out toxins and free radicals. Here are a few signs that your body might be trying to tell you that it's time for a detox. In this two week gentle detox, you will receive meal plans tailored to reducing toxic load and stress off your system, thus helping your body to break down food easier and prepare your body to receive optimal nutrition. This detox protocol is dairy free and gluten free but does include some organic animal protein. With this protocol you will also receive specific supplement recommendations to purchase from our online dispensary Fullscript, to further help with the detoxification process. And to top this all off you will receive access to our online Holistic Nutritionist via email, for the duration of the two week protocol. This means that during your two week protocol you can ask questions or go over any concerns you have with the nutritionist. The Value for this entire detox protocol, which includes your two week meal plan, a shopping list and recipes, as well as supplement recommendations and access to our online Holistic Nutritionist is $175.00 ***Please note that detox diets are not recommended for pregnancy, or anyone with a severe health condition.*** Copyright \u00a9 2018 Nature's Way Holistic Health Centre - All Rights Reserved.
