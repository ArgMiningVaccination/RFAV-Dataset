At the foundation, it involves supporting what we call pillars of health - the ways in which we move, eat, think, rest and connect. We see our long term and sustainable change come from shifts within these pillars. As we make these bigger lifestyle shifts, we have tools such as intentional supplementation, lab work, herbal medicine and acupuncture to manage symptoms and get you where you want to be. hormone balance What is considered \"normal\" in terms of hormonal balance differs throughout our lifespan. Many of the symptoms we perceive as \"normal parts of womanhood\" like PMS, breast tenderness, hotflashes, menstrual migraines etc. are actually symptoms we can control and improve our quality of life. You don't need to be suffering - we want to help you thrive! We believe that education around hormonal health is an important part of empowering women in their healthcare. gut health The gut is crucial for our overall health - its where we digest nutrients, where most of our beneficial bacteria live and where a large portion of our immune system resides. Gastrointestinal dysfunction can impact many aspects of our health and quality of life and therefore it is an area where we focus heavily! Healthy gut, healthy you.
