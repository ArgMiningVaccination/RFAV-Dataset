I love continuing education seminars. These seminars give me a chance to fill the blanks on what formal education has omitted. I have a special interest in the Mind-Body-Spirit connection. The body has an innate intelligence that has the ability to heal itself once we get out of its way. - What types of customers have you worked with? Stress relief, chronic headaches, muscle pains, back pains, neck pain, shoulder pain, painful periods, depression, anxieties, substance addictions, those looking to stop smoking, etc. - Describe a recent project you are fond of. How long did it take? I work well with patients who are going through the process of trying to get pregnant. I understand that it can be a frustrating time. Doing regular acupuncture sessions helps prepare the body for fertilization by calming the nervous system. Calming the nervous system is key to the body feeling \"safe & secure\" in order to procreate. If the body is stressed, then it's in \"fight or flight\" mode. Chances for fertility are significantly reduced as a result. "}
