An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women 's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach con-sensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel 's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syn- drome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depend-ing on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treat-ment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodicreevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindica- tions, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venousthromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistentVMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopausesymptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone ther-apy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal or oral arerecommended.

METHODS An Advisory Panel of clinicians and research experts in the field of women 's health and menopause were enlisted to review \"The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society, \"evaluate the literature published subsequently, and conduct an evidence-based analysis, with thegoal of reaching consensus recommendations. NAMS acknowledges that no single trial 's findings can be extrapolated to all women. The Women 's Health Initiative (WHI) is the largest, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of hormone ther-apy in women aged 50 to 79 years, and its findings were therefore given prominent consideration. However, it is important to note that the WHI employed just one route of administration (oral),one formulation of estrogen (conjugated ace-tate [MPA] 2.5 mg), with limited enrollment of women with both-ersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flashes, night sweats)who were aged younger than 60 years or who were fewer than10 years from menopause onset \u2014the group of women for whom hormone therapy is currently primarily indicated. In addition, the WHI trials did not include women with early or premature meno-pause. In achieving consensus, the panel took into considerationthe level of evidence (RCTs>longit udinal studies>cross-sectional studies), sample sizes, risk of bi as, data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and expert opinion from guidelines fromother major medical societies, when appropriate. \"The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society \"was written after this ex- tensive review of the pertinent literature and includes key pointsidentified during the review process. The resulting manuscriptwas submitted to and reviewed and approved by the NAMSBoard of Trustees. When recommendations are provided, they are graded ac- cording to these categories: \u0081Level I: Based on good and consistent scientific evidence. \u0081Level II: Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence. \u0081Level III: Based primarily on consensus and expert opinion. EXPLAINING HORMONE THERAPY RISK Healthcare professionals caring for menopausal women should understand the basic concepts of relative risk and absolute riskto communicate the potential benefits and risks of hormonetherapy and other therapies. Relative risk (risk ratio) is the ratioof event rates in two groups, whereas absolute risk (risk differ- ence) is the absolute difference in the event rates between two groups. 1Absolute risks are more useful to convey risks and ben- efits in the clinical setting. Findings on hormone therapy from RCTs are generally con- sidered to provide stronger evidence, and those from observa-tional studies should be interpreted with greater caution, giventhe potential for confounding. Very small effect sizes may havemore limited clinical or public health importance, especially if outcomes are rare (Table 1). 2 Key points \u0081Findings from RCTs of hormone therapy can be interpretedwith greater confidence than observational studies. (Level I) \u0081Smaller effect sizes may be less clinically relevant, particu-larly for rare outcomes. (Level I) FORMULATION, DOSING, ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, AND SAFETY Formulation Estrogens Available estrogen preparations include CEE, synthetic trials,contain mixture of CE purified from the urine of pregnantmares, including estrone sulfate. In postmenopausal women, es-trone sulfate is a naturally occurring estrogen that serves as aprecursor and intermediate for the formation of estrone (a weak estrogen) and estradiol (a more potent premenopausal estrone sulfate, equilin sulfate, and estradiol sulfate. Pre-scription formulations of micronized 17 -estradiol are identical to the structure of estradiol that is produced by the ovaries. Es-tradiol is reversibly converted to estrone. Ethinyl estradiol is asynthetic estrogen primarily used in combination with a proges- tin in hormone contraceptives. Progestogens administered with estrogen Progestogens (general category that includes synthetic progestins and progesterone) commonly coadministered with estrogen in women with a uterus include MPA, norethindrone acetate (NETA),and micronized progesterone (M P). Medroxyprogesterone ace- tate, levonorgestrel, and NETA a re synthetic progestins, whereas MP is structurally identical to th e progesterone produced by the corpus luteum. Progestogen indication: need for endometrial protection Chronic unopposed estrogen in- risk hyperplasia or cancer. menopause-related indication for progestogen use is to preventendometrial overgrowth and the increased risk of endometrialcancer during estrogen therapy (ET) use. Women with an intact uterus using systemic ET should receive adequate progestogen, unless they are taking CEE combined with bazedoxifene (BZA). 5-7 TABLE 1.

When adequate progestogen is com-bined with systemic estrogen, the risk of endometrial neoplasiais not higher than in untreated women. In the WHI, use of con-tinuous oral CEE plus MP A daily was associated with a risk ofendometrial cancer similar to pl acebo (hazard ratio [HR], confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.36), 8with significant re- of risk after a 13 years 'cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.91).9As y s t e m a t i cr e v i e ws u g g e s t e d an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia with MP containingestrogen plus progestogen gested of endometrial cancer (relative risk [RR],1.2) with noncontinuous combined EPT (type of progestogennot specified) but not with continuous EPT. 10Oral MP should be adequately dosed for prevention of endometrial hyperplasia (eg, 200 mg/d for 12-14 d/mo).11,12Off-label use levonorgestrel- containing intrauterine device to prevent endometrial hyperpla-sia may avoid adverse systemic effects of progestogens and canprotect against unwanted pregnancy in women initiating hor-mone therapy for symptom management before their final men-strual period. There are limited clinical trial data to support thisuse. 13In women using EPT, unscheduled bleeding occurring more than 6 months after initiation should be investigated. Tissue-selective estrogen complex or antagonist), been CEE to form a tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC). Studies of up to 2 years in duration suggest that the combination of BZA plusCEE provides endometrial protection without the need for aprogestogen. 7,14-16In women using BZA plus CEE, unsched- uled bleeding occurring more than 6 months after initiationshould be investigated. Dosing Estrogen therapy The therapeutic goal should be to use the most appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treat-ment goals. The appropriate dose of progestogen is added toprovide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unlessCEE is combined with BZA. Progestogen therapy Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endo- metrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose. Different types and doses of progestogens, routes of administration, and types of regimen(sequential or continuous-combined) may have different associ-ations with health outcomes, and patient preference can andshould be considered because many women will opt for regi-mens that avoid periodic menstrual bleeding. 17 Routes of administration For treating VMS, systemic estrogens can be prescribed as oral drugs; transdermal patches, sprays, and gels; or as vaginal rings.Meta-analysis of estrogen preparations found no evidence of asignificant difference between transdermal EPT and oral EPTfor alleviating VMS. 18Transdermal estradiol and oral CEE aresimilarly effective in alleviating VMS19; however, clinical trials directly comparing risk of myocardial infarction stroke,breast cancer, and venous thromboembolism estrogen routes and doses are lacking. Progestogensare available as oral drugs or combination patches with estrogen. Nonoral routes of administration (eg, transdermal, vaginal) may offer potential advantages because nonoral routes bypass the first-pass hepatic effect; however, it is unknown whether nonoral routes of ET or EPT are associated with lower risk (vsoral routes) of VTE, breast cancer, and cardiovascular (CV)events because clinical trials have not been designed to examinethose outcomes. Safety During the active treatment phase of the WHI, a higher inci- dence of breast cancer (risk is considered rare; Table 1) was seenin women assigned to CEE plus MP A compared with placebo but a reduced incidence in women assigned to CEE alone com- pared with placebo. 20After a median of 20 years 'follow-up (in- cluding intervention and postintervention follow-up), the lowerincidence of breast cancer in women assigned to CEE alone ver-sus placebo and the higher incidence of breast cancer in womenassigned to CEE plus MP A persisted. 21In contrast to findings of the WHI, observational data have shown that breast cancer riskwas increased in women using either systemic ET or EPT and was duration-dependent. 22 Meta-analysis of studies in which most participants (70%) were aged older than 60 years and had some degree of comorbidityshows that EPT is associated with small increases in the riskof a coronary event (after 1 y), VTE (after 1 y), stroke (after 3 y),breast cancer (after 5 y), and gallbladder disease (after 5 ET(included oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, and intranasal prepa-rations without disaggregation of data by route of administration) increases the risk of VTE (after 1-2 y), stroke (after 7 y), and gall- bladder disease (after 7 y). One trial examined outcomes inwomen aged 50 to 59 years who were relatively healthy andfound that the only significantly increased risk was of VTE inwomen on EPT. 23Although comparative RCT data are lacking, there may be less VTE risk associated with lower doses oforal ET than with higher doses. 24,25Observational studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of VTE with trans- dermal ET, and limited observational data suggest less risk with transdermal versus oral ET, but comparative RCT dataagain are lacking. 26-28The choice of progestogen may also af- fect risk for VTE, with MP potentially being less thrombogenicthan other progestins. 26,28 The WHI provided information on the rare risks of CEE com- bined with MPA. It is unknown whether oral MP-containing EPTsimilarly increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke, gallbladder disease, MI, or VTE because clinical trials have not yet been de- signed to examine these outcomes. Clinical trials are needed toestablish the effect of different types of progestogens and differentestrogen doses and administ ration routes on VTE risk. 29Overall, ET and EPT are each associated with rare increased risk of gall-bladder disease, stroke, VTE, and urinary incontinence; EPT alsois associated with increased risk of breast cancer. 22,30StudiesNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 769were not designed to determine whether the combination of BZA plus CEE further increases the risk of VTE beyond the in-creased risk conferred by CEE alone. In women in the WHI aged 50 to 59 years, CEE plus MPA (average, 5.6 y of use) or CEE alone (average, 7.2 y of use inwomen with previous hysterectomy) did not increase cancermortality or CV mortality after a median of 18 years 'follow-up compared with placebo. In women aged 50 to 59 years at ran- domization, all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in thepooled trials versus placebo (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94). Withage groups combined, breast cancer mortality was reduced inwomen using CEE alone (HR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33-0.92), andAlzheimer disease or dementia mortality was reduced in womenusing CEE alone (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.94) and in thepooled trials (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.98) after a median of 18 years 'follow-up. 31After a median of 20 years 'follow-up (including intervention and postintervention follow-up), thelower breast cancer mortality in women assigned to CEE aloneversus placebo persisted, whereas breast cancer mortality wasnot significantly different in women assigned to CEE plus MPAversus placebo. 21 Contraindications for oral and transdermal hormone therapy include unexplained vaginal bleeding; liver disease; prior estrogen- sensitive cancer (including breast cancer); prior coronary heart dis- ease (CHD), stroke, MI, or VTE; or personal history or inheritedhigh risk of thromboembolic disease. Potential risks of hormone therapy for women aged younger than 60 years include the rare risk of breast cancer with EPT; en-dometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer with inadequatelyopposed estrogen; VTE; and gallbladder disease (Figure 1). 9 More common adverse events (AEs) include nausea, bloating, weight gain, fluid retention, mood swings (progestogen related), breakthrough bleeding, headaches, and breast tenderness.Key points \u0081The appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals that provides benefits andminimizes risks for the individual woman should be the ther-apeutic goal. (Level III) \u0081The various formulations, doses, and routes of prescriptionhormone therapy preparations have comparable high efficacy for relieving VMS. (Level I) \u0081Formulation, dose, and route of administration for hormone therapy should be determined individually and reassessed pe-riodically. (Level III) \u0081Different hormone therapy doses, formulations, and routes ofadministration may have different effects on target organs,potentially allowing options to minimize risk. (Level II) \u0081The appropriate formulation, dose, and route of administra- tion of progestogen is needed to counter the proliferative ef- fects of systemic estrogen on the endometrium. (Level I) \u0081Overall, the increased absolute risks associated with EPTandET are rare (<10/10,000/y) and include increased risk forVTE and gallbladder disease. In addition, EPT carries a rareincreased risk for stroke and breast cancer, and if estrogen isinadequately opposed, an increased risk of endometrial hy-perplasia and endometrial cancer. (Level I) \u0081The absolute risks are reduced for all-cause mortality, fracture,diabetes mellitus (EPT and ET), and breast cancer (ET) inwomen aged younger than 60 years (Figure 1). 9(Level I) FDA-APPROVED INDICATIONS Vasomotor symptoms Hormone therapy has been shown in double-blind RCTs to relieve VMS32and is FDA approved as first-line therapy for re- lief of moderate to severe VMS because of menopause.

Adapted from Manson JE, et al.9NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 770 Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 \u00a9 2022 The North American Menopause SocietyPrevention of bone loss Hormone therapy has been shown in double-blind RCTs to prevent bone loss, and in the WHI, to reduce fractures in post-menopausal women without osteoporosis. 33,34The FDA indica- tion includes prevention, but not treatment, of postmenopausalosteoporosis. Nonestrogen medications are preferred for treat-ment of existing osteoporosis. Premature hypoestrogenism Hormone therapy is FDA approved for women with hypoestrogenism resulting from hypogonadism, bilateral oopho-rectomy (BO), or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Healthbenefits have been shown, with greater evidence for women withBO, for menopause symptoms and for prevention of bone lossand in observational studies, heart disease and cognitive decline or dementia. 35-44 Genitourinary symptoms Hormone therapy has been shown in RCTs to effectively treat symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VV A).45,46Hormone ther- apy is FDA approved to treat moderate to severe symptoms ofVV A and dyspareunia because of menopause but with the pref-erence for low-dose vaginal therapy if solely prescribed for vul- var or vaginal symptoms. Two vaginal therapies, vaginal ET and vaginal dehydroepian- drosterone (DHEA), have been FDA approved for treatment ofmoderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VV A resultingfrom menopause. One oral therapy (a SERM) has FDA approvalas well. Key point \u0081Hormone therapy is FDA approved for four indications: mod- erate to severe VMS; prevention of osteoporosis in women; treatment of hypoestrogenism caused byhypogonadism, BO, or POI; and treatment of moderate to se-vere vulvovaginal symptoms. FDA guidance for treatment ofgenitourinary symptoms related to menopause in the absenceof indications for systemic ET suggests the use of low-dosetopical vaginal ET. (Level I) COMPOUNDED BIOIDENTICAL HORMONES The term bioidentical hormone therapy (similar to endogenous) can be misleading because there are both government-approvedand compounded bioidentical hormone therapies. Government-approved (in the United States, FDA-approved) bioidenticalhormones include estradiol, estrone, and MP , which are regu-lated and monitored for purity and efficacy. These are dispensedwith package inserts containing extensive product information(based on RCTs) and may include black-box warnings for AEs. In contrast, compounded bioidentical hormone therapies are pre- pared by a compounding pharmacist using a provider 'sp r e s c r i p - tion. These therapies may combine multiple hormones (estradiol,estrone, estriol, DHEA, testosterone, progesterone) and use un-tested, unapproved combinations or formulations or are admin-istered in nonstandard or untested routes such as subdermal im-plants, pellets, or troches. 47-50Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy has been prescribed or dosed on the basis of serum, salivary, or urine hormone test-ing; however, the use of such testing to guide hormone therapydosing is considered unreliable because of differences in hor-mone pharmacokinetics and absorption, diurnal variation, andinterindividual and intraindividual variability. 51-54 There is a dearth of safety and efficacy data with little or no high-quality pharmacokinetic data to provide evidence of safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy andinsufficient evidence to support overall clinical use of compoundedbioidentical hormone therapy for treatment of menopause symp-toms. Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy presents safetyconcerns, such as minimal government regulation and monitor-ing, overdosing and underdosing, presence of impurities and lack of sterility, lack of scientific efficacy and safety data, and lack of a label outlining risks. 55 Patient preference for compounded bioidentical hormone therapy should be discussed.56Prescribers should only consider compounded hormone therapy if women cannot tolerate agovernment-approved therapy for reasons such as allergies toingredients in a government-approved hormone therapy formu-lation or for a dose or formulation not currently available ingovernment-approved therapies. Patient preference alone should not be used to justify use of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. Prescribers of compounded bioidentical hormone ther-apy should document the medical indication for a compoundedbioidentical hormone over government-approved therapies. 55 In addition to including financial disclosures of prescribers,pharmacists, and pharmacies, compounding pharmacists shouldprovide standardized content information, include warnings forpotential AEs, note that the preparation is not government ap- proved, and provide guidance on reporting AEs. Key points \u0081Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy presents safety concerns, such as minimal government regulation and moni- toring, overdosing and underdosing, presence of impuritiesand lack of sterility, lack of scientific efficacy and safety data,and lack of a label outlining risks. (Level I) \u0081Salivary and urine hormone testing to determine dosing areunreliable and not recommended. Serum hormone testing israrely needed. (Level II/III) \u0081Shared decision-making is important, but patient preference alone should not be used to justify the use of compounded bioidentical hormone preparations, particularly when government-regulated bioidentical hormone preparations are available.(Level III) \u0081Situations in which compounded bioidentical hormones couldbe considered include allergies to ingredients in a government-approved formulation or dosages not available in government-approved products. (Level III) MENOP AUSE SYMPTOMS Vasomotor symptoms Vasomotor symptoms are associated with diminished sleep quality, irritability, difficulty concentrating, reduced quality ofNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 771life,57and poorer health status.58Frequent VMS persisted on average 7.4 years in the Study of Women 's Health Across the Nation59and appear to be linked to CV , bone, and cognitive risks.60-65Compared with placebo, ET alone or EPT was found to reduce weekly symptom frequency by 75% (95% CI, 64.3-82.3)and significantly reduce symptom severity (odds ratio CI, 0.07-0.23), 34with no other pharmacologic or alterna- tive therapy found to provide more relief. Considering the dose, there are no appreciable differences in the efficacy of oral versusnonoral formulations, but EPT appears slightly more effectivethan ET alone. Lower doses of hormone therapy (oral CEE 0.3 mg; oral 17 - estradiol 0.5 mg; or estradiol patch 0.025 mg) may take 6 to 8 weeks to provide adequate symptom relief. Although the low-est dose-approved estradiol weekly patch (0.014 mg/d) appears effective in treating VMS, 66it is FDA approved only for preven- tion of osteoporosis. Progestogen-only formulations have been found to be effective in treating VMS,67,68including MPA 10 mg,69oral megestrol acetate 20 mg,70and MP 300 mg.68No long-term studies have addressed the safety of progestogen-only treatment of meno-pause symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms return in approximately 50% of women when hormone therapy is discontinued. 71,72There is no consensus about whether stopping abruptly or gradually tapering the doseis preferable. Sleep disturbances Sleep disturbances are common after menopause and begin in perimenopause. Sleep disruptions are strongly associated withVMS and a decreased quality of life. Poorer sleep quality has beenassociated with mood fluctuations, memory problems, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and other CV risk factors. Short (or very long) sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and insomnia have been asso-ciated with greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. 73-76 Hormone therapy in the form of low-dose estrogen or proges- togen may improve chronic insomnia in menopausal women,with 14 of 23 studies reviewed showing positive results. 77There is some evidence that transdermal ET may benefit sleep in peri-menopausal women, independent of VMS. 78 Oral MP has mildly sedating effects, reducing wakefulness without affecting daytime cognitive functions, possibly througha GABA-agonistic effect, 79and should therefore be adminis- tered at night. A systematic review and meta-analysis concludedthat MP improved sleep-onset latency but not sleep duration orsleep efficiency in RCTs in postmenopausal women. 80 Genitourinary symptoms The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) includes the signs and symptoms associated with menopause-related es- trogen deficiency involving chang es to the labia, vagina, urethra, and bladder and includes VVA.81Symptoms may include genital dryness, burning, and irritation; sexual symptoms of diminished lubrication and pain with sexual activity; and urinary symptomsof urgency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI).Estrogen therapy, specifically vaginal ET, is an effective treatmentfor GSM, with no evidence to suggest a difference in safety or ef- ficacy between the various vaginal ET preparations. 45,82,83 Low-dose vaginal ET preparations include creams, tablets, rings, and a softgel vaginal insert. The different preparationsall contain estradiol, and one cream preparation contains CEE.One ring is available for long-term (3 mo) delivery of low-doseestradiol to the vagina, but another is aimed at providing systemic levels of estradiol. The low-dose v aginal estradiol products avail- able result in minimal systemic absorption. 84-86It is preferred to insert vaginal products (except for the vaginal ring) in the prox-imal, lower third of the vagina rather than in the upper third.This improves efficacy for genitourinary symptoms and attenu-ates estradiol absorption. 86 Because of the potential risk of small increases in circulating estrogens,87the decision to use low-dose vaginal ET in women with breast cancer should be made i n conjunction with their on- cologists.88,89This is particularly important for women on aroma- tase inhibitors (AIs) with suppressed plasma levels of estradiol,90 although no increased risk was seen in an observational trial ofsurvivors of breast cancer on tamoxifen or aromatase therapywith low-dose vaginal ET during 3.5 years 'mean follow-up. 91 A progestogen is generally not indicated when ET is adminis- tered vaginally for GSM at the recommended low doses, although clinical trial data supporting endometrial safety beyond 1 year are lacking.85Vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal woman requires thorough evaluation. Long-term follow up of women in the WHI observational study and in the Nurses 'Health Study who used vaginal ET indicated no increased risk of adverse CVor canceroutcomes. 92,93 Nonestrogen therapies that improve genitourinary symptoms and are approved for relief of dyspareunia in postmenopausal women include ospemifene94and intravaginal DHEA.95 Urinary tract symptoms (including pelvic floor disorders) Vaginal ET increases the number of vessels around the periurethral and bladder neck region96and has been shown to reduce the frequency and amplitude of detrusor contractions to promote detrusor musc le relaxation.97,98Estrogen therapy, along with pelvic floor training, pessaries, or surgery, may improve synthe-sis of collagen and improve vaginal epithelium, but evidence foreffectiveness for pelvic organ prolapse is lacking. 99 Two large trials found that users of systemic hormone therapy (CEE 0.625 mg plus MP A 2.5 mg) had an increased incidenceof stress incontinence. 100,101Increased incontinence was found in women using oral ET alone (rel ative risk [RR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.17-1.48) and 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18). 102Vaginal estrogen use showed incontinence (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.86) and overactivebladder, with one to two fewer voids in 24 hours and reducedfrequency and urgency. A reduced risk of recurrent UTIs withvaginal but not oral estrogen has been shown in RCTs. 103,104 Sexual function Systemic hormone therapy and low-dose vaginal ET provide effective treatment of GSM, improving sexual problems by in-creasing lubrication, blood flow, and sensation in vaginal tis-sues. 105Studies have not found a significant effect of ET onNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 772 Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 \u00a9 2022 The North American Menopause Societysexual interest, arousal, and orgasmic response independent from its role in treating menopause symptoms.106-108 If systemic hormone therapy is indicated in women with low libido, transdermal ET formulations may be preferred to oral,given increased sex hormone-binding globulin and reduced bio-availability of testosterone oral Conjugated equine estrogens combined with BZA relieves dyspareunia and improves some aspects of sexual function in postmenopausal women.111-114 Key pointsVasomotor symptoms \u0081Vasomotor symptoms may begin during perimenopause, andfrequent VMS may persist on average 7.4 years or longer.They affect quality of life and may be associated with CV ,bone, and brain health. (Level I/II) \u0081Hormone therapy remains the gold standard for relief of VMS. -Estrogen-alone therapy can be used for symptomatic women without a uterus. (Level I) -For symptomatic women with a uterus, EPT or a TSEC protects against endometrial neoplasia. (Level I) \u0081Shared decision-making should be used when consideringformulation, route of administration, and dose of hormonetherapy for menopause symptom management, with adjust-ment tailored to symptom relief, AEs, and patient prefer- ences. (Level III) \u0081Periodic assessment of the need for ongoing use of hormone therapy should be individualized on the basis of a woman 's menopause symptoms, general health and underlying medi-cal conditions, risks, treatment goals, and personal prefer-ences. (Level III) \u0081Micronized progesterone 300 mg nightly significantly de-creases VMS (hot flashes and night sweats) compared with placebo and improves sleep. Synthetic progestins have also shown benefit for VMS in some studies. No long-term studyresults are available, and use of progestogens without estro-gen for either indication is off-label.

(Level I) \u0081Hormone therapy improves sleep in women with bothersomenighttime VMS by reducing nighttime awakenings. Estrogenmay have some effect on sleep, independent of VMS.

Prema- ture menopause is defined as menopause before age 40 years, and early menopause is defined as menopause that occurs be-tween the ages of 40 and 45 years. Whereas menopause impliesthe permanent cessation of menses, POI describes the loss ofovarian function before age 40 years but with the potential forintermittent, transient return of hormone production and men-strual cycles. Women with early or premature loss of ovarianfunction at any age are at increased risk for AEs related to ovar- ian hormone deficiency. Causes of early or premature loss of ovarian function may be genetic, autoimmune, toxic, metabolic,and iatrogenic, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Health risks of POI and premature menopause are well docu- mented. 40,41The strongest evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews links early loss of ovarian function to de-creased quality of life and increased risk of fracture, CVD, heartfailure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and overall mortality. 115-121Other significant issues may include persistent VMS, loss of fertility, bone loss, genitourinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cogni-tive and mood changes, and increased risk of dementia, ophthal-mic conditions, and depression. 40,41,122-124Although these risks are generally because of estrogen deficiency, some of these risksmay be reflective of premature aging, as evidenced in somestudies by shortened telomere length. 125NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 773In addition to an increased risk of incident CVD, POI and pre- mature menopause are associated with an increased risk of aorticstenosis, VTE, ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, atrialfibrillation, and hypertension. 123,126Early menopause is also as- sociated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.127 The surgical removal of both ovaries leads to a much more abrupt loss of the ovarian steroids estrogen and progesterone than does natural menopause and includes a significant decrease in testosterone that does not occur with natural menopause.128 Vasomotor symptoms as well as a variety of estrogen deficiency-related symptoms and diseases are more frequent and more se-vere after oophorectomy and can have a major effect on qualityof life. 129,130In meta-analyses, oophorectomy is associated with an increased risk of CVD,131cognitive dysfunction and dementia,132 metabolic syndrome,133low bone mineral density (BMD),134 evidence for elevated frac- ture risk.136Bilateral oophorectomy before age 40 is associated with elevated rates of incident CVD as well as mitral regurgita-tion, VTE, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and hyperten-sion. 123Other risks may include depression, anxiety, sexual dys- function, bone loss, parkinsonism, DM, ophthalmologic conditions,and stroke, some of which have been shown in observationalstudies to be reduced by ET. 35 Effective management of POI and premature or early meno- pause may include appropriate doses of hormone therapy, cal-cium with vitamin D, exercise, and screening to detect medicalissues, as well as fertility counseling and mental health ser-vices. 40Hormone therapy is recommended at least until the av- erage age of menopause, approximately 52 years.35,40,41Oral contraceptives may be an alternative form of hormone therapywith contraceptive benefits, because spontaneous pregnancy may occur in about 5% of women with POI. 137Higher doses of hormone therapy may provide better bone protection thanoral contraceptives, but this is uncertain. 36,37,138 Unless contraindications are present, ET is indicated for women who have had BO before the average age of menopauseto treat VMS, improve BMD, and reduce the risk for osteoporo-sis. 139Y ounger women may require higher doses to relieve symptoms and protect against bone loss.41,140Observational data reveal potential benefits of ET in reducing risk of cognitive impairment or dementia and CV mortality in women with earlyoophorectomy. 35,141Estrogen therapy may improve aspects of sexual function and GSM, particularly in women with VMSwho have had BO. 107Vaginal estrogens are effective in treating symptoms of GSM.45,46,142Ovarian conservation is recom- mended, if possible, when hysterectomy for benign indicationsis performed in premenopausal women at average risk for ovar- ian cancer. 143 Key points \u0081Women with POI and premature or early menopause may be at increased risk for fracture, CVD, heart failure, DM, overallmortality, persistent VMS, loss of fertility, bone loss, genito-urinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cognitive and moodchanges, increased risk of dementia, open-angle glaucoma,depression, and poor quality of life. (Level II)\u0081In the absence of contraindications, hormone therapy is rec-ommended at least until the average age of menopause (ap-proximately age 52 y), with an option for use of oral contra-ceptives in healthy younger women. (Level II) \u0081Results of the WHI trials in older women do not apply towomen with POI or premature or early menopause. (Level II) \u0081In women with BO before the average age of menopause, early initiation of ET, with endometrial protection if the uterus is preserved, reduces VMS, gen itourinary symptoms, risk for osteoporosis and related fractures, and likely CVD and overallmortality, with benefit seen in observational studies for CVmortality and cognitive impairment or dementia. (Level II) \u0081Fertility preservation and counseling should be explored foryoung women at risk for POI. (Level III) \u0081Ovarian conservation is recommended when hysterectomy is performed for benign indications in premenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. (Level II) SKIN, HAIR, AND SPECIAL SENSES Estrogen therapy may benefit wound healing through modi- fying inflammation, stimulating granulation tissue formation, and accelerating re-epithelialization. Estrogen therapy increasedepidermal and dermal thickness, increased collagen and elastincontent, and improved skin moisture, with fewer wrinkles. 144 Although menopause is associated with a decrease in hair den-sity and female pattern hair loss, research on the role of hormonetherapy in mitigating these changes is lacking. 145 In the WHI, ET reduced intraocular pressure in postmeno- pausal women and mitigated the risk for open-angle glaucoma in Black women.146,147Similar effects were not seen for EPT.148 Further, hormone therapy decreased the risk of neovascular andsoft drusen age-related macular degeneration but not 149Evidence on the effect of hor- mone therapy on cataract, dry eye disease, and optic nerve disordersis mixed, and good-quality RCTs are lacking. 150-152Observational data linking hormone therapy to hearing loss is mixed.153,154 Little is known about olfactory changes and hormone ther- apy.155In small trials, hormone therapy appears to decrease diz- ziness or vertigo and improve postural balance.156,157 Key points \u0081Estrogen therapy appears to have beneficial effects on skinthickness and elasticity and collagen when given at meno-pause. (Level II) \u0081Changes in hair density and female pattern hair loss worsenafter menopause, but research is lacking regarding a rolefor hormone therapy in mitigating these changes.

(Level II) \u0081In small trials, hormone therapy appears to decrease dizzi-ness or vertigo and improve postural balance. (Level II) HORMONE THERAPY AND QUALITY OF LIFE Quality of life is defined as an overall assessment of one 'sl i f e in relation to one 's goals and expectations. Quality of life can be applied to one 's mental and physical health, which is termed health-related quality of life, or specifically to menopause, or menopause-specific quality of life, which emphasizes the bother and interference of menopause symptoms. Clinical trials indi-cate that in women with menopause symptoms, such as VMS,systemic hormone therapy (ET, EPT, TSECs) can improvemenopause-specific quality of life. 158-160These effects appear to be explained largely by the effect of hormone therapy onthe frequency of these symptoms. Key points \u0081Menopause symptoms are associated with poorer health-related and menopause-specific quality of life. (Level II) \u0081Systemic hormone therapy can improve menopause-specificquality of life in women experiencing menopause symptoms. (Level II) OSTEOPOROSIS Menopause is associated with increased bone resorption, and ET decreases bone resorption. 161For osteoporosis treatment, hormone therapy has not been demonstrated in RCTs to reducefractures in postmenopausal women with established osteoporo-sis; therefore, hormone therapy does not carry an FDA indica-tion for treatment of osteoporosis. 162,163 In women who have osteoporosis, hormone therapy has not been demonstrated in RCTs to decrease fracture risk. In the WHI, for women aged 50 to 79 years (N = 16,608), enrolled without regard to bone density or fracture risk, EPT (0.625 mgCEE plus 2.5 mg MPA) significantly increased lumbar spineand total hip BMD by 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, relative toplacebo and reduced fracture risk. 34The BMD benefits of pre- venting bone loss persist as long as therapy is continued butabate rapidly when treatment is discontinued. Within a few months,markers of bone turnover returned to pretreatment values, whereas BMD fell to pretreatment levels within 1 to 2 years of stopping therapy. 164 Women with POI experience long-term AEs on bone density, in addition to other health risks.35,140Higher-than-standard doses of hormone therapy may be needed to provide protectionagainst bone-density loss in younger women, particularly thoseaged younger than 40 years and thus lower future osteoporoticfracture risk. 140,165 In the setting of prevention, RCTs show that hormone therapy decreases fracture risk.162,163Various oral and transdermal es- trogen preparations, alone or in combination with progestogensor BZA, have government approval for prevention of osteoporosis.A meta-analysis and a systematic review, based primarily on theWHI, demonstrated that 5 to 7 years of hormone therapy signifi-cantly reduced risk of spine, hip, and nonvertebral fractures. 166,167During the WHI intervention phase in women of all ages, theCEE plus MPA group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 womenand six fewer vertebral fractures per 10,000 women comparedwith the placebo group. 9The CEE-alone group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women and six fewer vertebral fracturesper 10,000 women compared with the placebo group. However,in the subset of women aged 50 to 59 years at the time of treatment initiation, neither CEE plus MPA nor CEE alone was associated with decreased risk of hip fracture. The reason that hormone therapy was not shown to reduce hip fracture in the subset of women aged 50 to 59 years in the WHImay be partly because of the lower baseline absolute risk of frac-ture in women aged between 50 and 59 years who did not haveestablished osteoporosis. 9,168 In the WHI hormone therapy trials, after hormone therapy discontinuation, there was a return of fracture risk to levels seen in women who had received placebo, with no excess fracturerisk observed after discontinuation of hormone therapy. 169,170 There are no prospective fracture studies directly comparingthe efficacy of hormone therapy in preventing fractures withother approved pharmacologic therapies. Key points \u0081Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-related effects on bone density. (Level I) \u0081Hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmeno-pausal women. (Level I) \u0081Discontinuing hormone therapy results in rapid bone loss;however, no excess in fractures was seen in the WHI after dis-continuation. (Level I) \u0081Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of boneloss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis. (Level I) \u0081In the absence of contraindications, in women aged youngerthan 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, sys-temic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss. (Level I) \u0081Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best servedwith hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bonedensity loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than otherbone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause,when treatment may be reassessed. (Level II) \u0081Decisions regarding initiation and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks. (Level III) JOINT PAIN Direct binding of estrogen to estrogen receptors acts on joint tissues, protecting their biomechanical structure and function and maintaining overall joint health, but the exact effect of estro- gen on osteoarthritis remains controversial.171-173There is no clearly observed association between hormone therapy use andosteoarthritis. 171 Meta-analyses of clinical trials of ET have reported inconsistent results. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to form strong con-clusions regarding the effects of estrogen on osteoarthritis. 173NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 775In the WHI, women on CEE plus MPA had less joint pain or stiffness compared with those on placebo (47.1% vs 38.4%;OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.24-1.64) and afterstopping. 174In the CEE-alone arm, women randomized to CEE had a statistically significant reduction in joint pain frequency af-ter 1 year compared with the placebo group (76.3% vs 79.2%;P= .001). 175 In the WHI, using arthroplasty as a clinical indicator of se- verely symptomatic osteoarthritis, the association of CEE alonewith any arthroplasty was borderline significant (HR, 0.84; 95%CI, 0.70-1.00; P= .05), but CEE alone did not significantly re- duce the risk of hip or knee arthroplasty. The EPT trial showedno relationship between hormone use and arthroplasty risk. 176 Key points \u0081Women in the WHI and other studies have less joint pain or stiff-ness with hormone therapy compared with placebo. (Level I) \u0081There is a need for further understanding of estrogen 'sp o t e n - tial effect on joint health. (Level III) SARCOPENIA Frailty is associated with AEs such as falls, hospitalization, disability, and death.177Skeletal muscle has been shown to have estrogen receptors,178but there is a paucity of studies evaluating the interplay between estrogen and muscle. The regulation ofenergy intake and expenditure by estrogens in women has notbeen well studied, with limited basic and preclinical evidencesupporting the concept that the loss of estrogen with menopauseor oophorectomy disrupts energy balance through decreases in resting energy expenditure and physical activity. 179 Reviews of preclinical studies and limited clinical studies of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women suggest a benefiton maintaining or increasing mus cle mass and related connective tissue and improving strength and posttraumatic or postatrophymuscle recovery when combined with exercise. 180-182 In the WHI hormone therapy trials, women assigned to ET or EPT (vs placebo) had early preservation of lean body mass after 3 years, but hormone therapy did not ameliorate long-term loss in lean body mass associated with aging.183Similarly, low-dose oral estradiol 0.25 mg per day plus cyclical MP did not signifi-cantly change skeletal muscle mass or lean body mass. 184 Systematic reviews find that hormone therapy had neither a beneficial nor harmful association with muscle mass185,186; therefore, it is likely that interventions other than hormone ther-apy will have to be developed to aid in the retention of muscle in aging women. Key points \u0081Development of frailty with aging is a health risk. (Level I) \u0081Sarcopenia and osteoporosis are related to aging, estrogen depletion, and the menopause transition. (Level II) \u0081Intervention to improve bioenergetics and prevent loss of mus- cle mass, strength, and performance is needed. (Level III) \u0081Preclinical studies suggest a possible benefit of ET whencombined with exercise to prevent the loss of muscle mass,strength, and performance, but this has not been shown inclinical trials. (Level II)GALLBLADDER AND LIVER Estrogens increase biliary cholesterol secretion and satura- tion, promote precipitation of cholesterol with increased bile crystallization. of cholelithiasis, cholec ystitis, and cholecystectomy. 23 However, no risk of biliary cancer has been demon- strated.189The transdermal route of administration, which bypasses first-pass metabolism of the liver, has been associated with lessrisk of gallbladder disease in observational studies. 190The at- tributable risk for gallbladder disease as self-reported in theWHI was an additional 47 cases per 10,000 women per yearfor CEE plus MP A and 58 cases per 10,000 women per yearfor CEE, both statistically significant ( P<. 0 0 1 ) . 9 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is more common after the menopause transition when the prevalence surpasses men.191 Older women also have higher rates of severe hepatic fibrosis and greater mortality compared with men. Animal models havedemonstrated a causal relationship between the loss of estrogenand increase in fatty liver and steatohepatitis, whereas observa-tional studies show dietary factors also may exacerbate liver dis-ease. Preclinical and observational studies suggest possible ben-efits of hormone therapy on liver fibrosis and fatty liver, 192but more research is needed before definitive recommendations can be made. Key points \u0081Risk of gallstones, cholecystitis, and cholecystectomy is in- creased with ET and EPT. (Level I) \u0081Observational studies report lower risk of gallstones withtransdermal hormone therapy than with oral, and with oralestradiol compared with CEE, but neither observation is con-firmed in RCTs. (Level II) \u0081In women with hepatitis C and with fatty liver, a slower fibro-sis progression has been observed with use of hormone ther- apy, but RCTs are needed to establish the potential benefits and risks with liver disease. (Level II) DIABETES MELLITUS, METABOLIC SYNDROME, A N DB O D YC O M P O S I T I O N Metabolic syndrome and diabetes In the WHI, women receiving continuous-combined CEE plus MPA had a statistically significant 19% reduction (HR, 0.81;95% CI, 0.70-0.94; P= .005) in the incidence of type 2 DM, translating to 16 fewer cases per 10,000 person-years of therapy. 9 In the CEE-alone cohort, there was a reduction of 14% in new di-agnoses of type 2 DM (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98), translat-ing to 21 fewer cases per 10,000 person-years. A meta-analysisof published studies found that EPT reduced multiple components of the metabolic syndrome; incidence of type 2 DM was de- creased by 30%. 193A second, smaller meta-analysis confirmed these findings and reported that women with type 2 DM usingET or EPT had better glycemic control. 194The benefit reverses when hormone therapy is discontinued. For these reasons, hor-mone therapy can be considered for symptomatic menopausalw o m e nw i t ht y p e2D M .NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 776 Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 \u00a9 2022 The North American Menopause SocietyWeight and body composition The menopause transition is associated with an increase in body fat and a decrease in lean body mass, which results in anincrease in the fat-to-lean ratio and decreased basal metabolicrate. After controlling for body size and ethnicity, the averageweight gain during midlife and the menopause transition is1.5 lb per year. 195,196Central fat distribution (gynoid-to-android pattern) also occurs after menopause after adjustment for aging, total body fat, and physical activity level.196By about 2 years af- ter the final menstrual period, weight changes flatten.197Women who used hormone therapy did not have observable differences inthe trajectory of weight or body fat gain compared with those whodid not take hormones, although numbers are relatively small. Estrogen-progestogen therapy either has no effect on weight or is associated with less weight gain in women who are using it than in women who are not. 198-202In the WHI, women ran- domized to hormone therapy with CEE with or without MPAhad no statistically significant difference in slowing of weightgain and a lesser increase in waist circumference over the first3 years of use compared with those randomized to placebo. In-creasing physical activity was independently associated withless weight gain over time. 195 Key points \u0081Hormone therapy significantly reduces the diagnosis ofnew-onset type 2 DM, but it is not government approved forthis indication. (Level I) \u0081Hormone therapy is not contraindicated in otherwise healthywomen with preexisting type 2 DM and may be beneficial interms of glycemic control when used for menopause symp-tom management. (Level II) \u0081Although hormone therapy may help attenuate abdominaladipose accumulation and weight gain associated with themenopause transition, the effect is small. (Level II) COGNITION Small clinical trials support the use of ET for cognitive bene- fits when initiated immediately after hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. 203,204Three large RCTs demonstrated neutral effects of hormone therapy on cognitive function when usedearly in the postmenopause period. 205-207 Two hypotheses \u2014thecritical window ortiming hypothesis and the healthy-cell bias hypothesis \u2014provide a framework for understanding the scientific literature on hormone therapy andcognition, but neither has been definitively supported in RCTs of postmenopausal women. The critical window or timing hy- pothesis 208,209holds that estrogen can confer cognitive benefits if given early in the menopause transition but that later use isneutral or detrimental. The healthy-cell bias hypothesis 210holds that estrogen confers cognitive benefits when the neural substrateis\"healthy \"but not diseased, for example in a woman with DM. Later initiation of hormone therapy Several large clinical trials indicate that hormone therapy does not improve memory or other cognitive abilities and that CEEplus MPA may be harmful for memory when initiated in womenaged older than 65 years. 211-213Alzheimer disease Four observational studies provide support for the opinion that the timing of hormone therapy initiation is a significant de-terminant of Alzheimer disease risk, with early initiation lower-ing risk and later initiation associated with increased risk. 214-217 However, long-term effects may differ from short-term effects.Eighteen-year follow-up data from the WHI showed a reduction in Alzheimer disease mortality in women randomized to hor- mone therapy; this effect was significant for CEE alone butnot for CEE plus MP A and was driven by women aged in their70s at the time of enrollment. 31Two nested case-control studies investigated the risk of dementia associated with hormone ther-apy use and showed no increased risk overall but did suggest anincreased risk of Alzheimer disease, specifically, with the use ofEPT for more than 5 years. 218 All-cause dementia In the WHI Memory Study, CEE plus MPA doubled the risk of all-cause dementia (23 cases/10,000 women) when initiated in women aged older than 65 years,213whereas CEE alone did not significantly increase the risk of dementia.219The effect of hormone therapy may be modified by baseline cognitive func-tion, with more favorable effects in women with normal cogni-tive function before hormone therapy initiation. 220,221 Key points \u0081In the absence of more definitive findings, hormone therapyis not recommended at any age to prevent or treat a decline incognitive function or dementia. (Level I) \u0081Initiating hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 yearsincreased the risk for dementia, with an additional 23 cases per10,000 person-years seen in women randomized to CEE plus MPA in the WHI Memory Study. (Level I) \u0081The effect of hormone therapy may be modified by baseline cognitive function, with more favorable effects in womenwith normal cognitive function before hormone therapy initi-ation. (Level II) \u0081Estrogen therapy may have cognitive benefits when initiatedimmediately after hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy,but hormone therapy in the early natural postmenopause pe- riod has neutral effects on cognitive function. (Level II) DEPRESSION Depressive symptoms worsen as women transition through menopause, although evidence is mixed as to whether depres-sive disorders are more common during the menopause transi-tion relative to premenopause. Most women who present withdepressive disorders during the menopause transition are womenwith a history of depression before the menopause transition, andwomen with a history of depression are at high risk for recurrence during the menopause transition. 222 For that reason, clinical guidelines recommend that clinicians screen for depression in women with a history of depression and useantidepressants or proven psychothe rapies (eg, cognitive-behavior therapy, interpersonal therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)as the primary treatment for recurrent major depressive episodes. 223 Use of hormone therapy to treat menopause symptoms such asNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 777V M Si nm i d l i f ew o m e nw i t hd e p r e s s i o ns h o u l db ec o n s i d e r e d . Vasomotor symptoms increase the risk for elevated depressivesymptoms, in part because of nocturnal VMS and sleep inter-ruption, 224and on a day-to-day basis, VMS co-occur with neg- ative mood and predict negative mood the next day.225Vasomo- tor symptoms appear to be more strongly associated with theonset of depressive symptoms than depressive disorders. 226 Estrogen therapy shows some efficacy in the management of depression in midlife women, but its effect varies by menopausestage. For perimenopausal women with depression, there is evi-dence that ET improves depressive symptoms to a degree simi-lar to antidepressant medications. 227This antidepressant effect of ET applies to perimenopau sal women with and without VMS. In women with major depression treated with ET, depres-sive symptoms improve in relation to improvements in sleep but not VMS. 228Estrogen therapy does not appear to be effective in treating depressive disorders in postmenopausal women, sug-gesting a window of opportunity in the perimenopause. 229Little is known about the effects of EPT in treating depressive disor-ders at any menopause stage. There is some evidence that ETenhances mood and improves well-being in nondepressed postmenopausal women. 205Initial evidence suggests that hormone therapy (specifically transder- mal estradiol with intermittent MP) may prevent the onset of de- pressive symptoms in euthymic perimenopausal women.230 Estrogen therapy may augment clinical response to antidepres- sants in midlife and older women, preferably when also indicatedfor other concurrent menopause-related symptoms such as VMS. 231 Key points \u0081There is some evidence that ET has antidepressant effects ofsimilar magnitude to that observed with antidepressant agentswhen administered to depressed perimenopausal women with or without concomitant VMS. (Level II) \u0081Estrogen therapy is ineffective as a treatment for depressive disorders in postmenopausal women. Such evidence suggestsa possible window of opportunity for the effective use of ETfor the management of depressive disorders during the peri-menopause. (Level II) \u0081There is some evidence that ETenhances mood and improveswell-being in nondepressed perimenopausal women. (Level II) \u0081Transdermal estradiol with intermittent MP may prevent theonset of depressive symptoms in euthymic perimenopausalwomen, but the evidence is not sufficient to recommendestrogen-based therapies for preventing depression in asymp-tomatic perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, and therisks and benefits must be weighed. (Level II) \u0081Estrogen-based therapies may augment clinical response toantidepressants in midlife and older women, preferably when also indicated for other menopause symptoms such as VMS. (Level III) \u0081Most studies on hormone therapy for the treatment of depressionexamined the effects of unopposed estrogen. Data on EPT or fordifferent progestogens are sparse and inconclusive.

(Level I)CARDIOV ASCULAR DISEASE AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY Observational data and reanalysis of older studies by age or time since menopause, including the WHI, suggest that for healthywomen who are within 10 years of the menopause transition andwho have bothersome menopause symptoms, the benefits of hor-mone therapy (ET or EPT) outwe igh its risks, with fewer CVD events in younger versus older women. 9,31,219,232-242 Initiation of hormone therapy fewer than 10 years after menopause onsetSurrogate markers of coronary heart disease Surrogate markers of CHD are intermediate measures that have been associated with the development of CVD and events such as coronary artery calcification (CAC) and subclinical ath-erosclerosis. Some studies have suggested that initiating hormonetherapy in symptomatic women within 10 years of menopausemay have benefit in reduction of atherosclerosis progressionas measured by CAC, 243-245whereas RCTs in younger, re- cently postmenopausal women have not.246,247In the Early Versus Late Intervention Trial With Estradiol, hormone therapy (oral 17 -estradiol 1 mg/d plus progesterone vaginal gel 45 mg administered sequentially for women with a uterus) reducedsubclinical atherosclerosis progression measured by carotid ar-tery intima-media thickness after a median of 5 years when ini-tiated within 6 years (median, 3.5 y) of menopause onset but notwhen initiated 10 or more years (median, 14.3 y) afterward. 246 The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study in healthy post-menopausal women aged 42 to 58 years who received hormone therapy (oral CEE 0.45 mg/d; transdermal estradiol patch 50 g/wk; each with sequential oral MP 200 mg for 12 d/mo) showed noeffect on subclinical atherosclerosis progression. 247 Meta-analyses of clinical outcomes A2 0 1 5 Cochrane review of RCT data found that hormone therapy initiated fewer than 10 years after menopause onset loweredCHD in postmenopausal women (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96). 236 It also found a reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.70; 95%,0.52-0.95) and no increased risk of stroke but an increased riskof VTE (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.11-2.73). and meta-analysis of RCTs pub- lished from 2000 to 2019 showed null effects of hormone therapy initiated fewer than 10 years after menopause or at an age youn- ger than 60 years on all-cause mortality, stroke, and VTE. 248 A 2019 systematic review and meta-regression analysis of RCTs that examined the timing hypothesis of hormone therapycompared with controls or nonusers of hormone therapy foundthat younger hormone therapy initiation (participants aged <60 y)was associated with lower odds of CHD (OR, CI,0.37-1.00), all-cause mortality (OR, mortality (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-1.00) but with higher odds of a composite measure of incidence stroke, transientischemic attack, and systemic embolism (OR, 1.40; 95% CI,1.10-1.78). 249However, the results for CHD, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality were all attenuated after excludingopen-label trials in which the knowledge of active treatmentmay affect treatment options and outcomes.

Cardiovascular outcomes in the Women 's Health Initiative Intervention phase For CEE alone, CHD, MI, and coronary artery bypass grafting orpercutaneous coronary intervention showed a lowered HR in women aged younger than 60 years and fewer than 10 years sincemenopause onset, including in intention-to-treat analyses. 9In the 50- to 59-year-old age group, the HR for CHD was elevated but not statistically significant at 1.34 (95% CI, 0.82-2.19) for CEEplus MPA. When data from the two WHI trials were combinedand analyzed, a reduction in all-cause mortality was shown inyounger but not in older women; HRs in women aged 50 to59 years, 60 to 69 years, and 70 to 79 years were 0.69 (95% CI,0.51-0.94), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.87-1.25), and 1.13 (95% respectively ( P for trend =. 0 1 ) .31 Cumulative follow-up For CEE alone, in the 13-year cumulative intervention and post- intervention follow-up, significant age-treatment interaction wasshown for MI such that only in the 50- to 59-year-old age group a reduction in MI risk was significant (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39- 0.91). 9Although a similar interaction was not significant for CHD and all-cause mortality, there was a significant reduction inCHD risk (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96) in this age group. Inthe 18-year intervention and postintervention cumulative follow-up, the reduction in all-cause mortality was shown to be statisticallysignificant for the 50- to 59-year-old age group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI,0.64-0.96), 31although interaction between age and treatment was not significant. Additional analysis focusing on oophorectomy sta- tus in the CEE-alone trial revealed a significant age-treatment inter-action for all-cause mortality; younger women with BO assignedto CEE alone showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortalitycompared with placebo (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.96). 242 Initiation of hormone therapy more than 10 years frommenopause onset or in women aged older than 60 years For women who initiated hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or aged older than 60 years, a 2015Cochrane meta-analysis found no evidence that hormone ther- apy had an effect on CHD (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96-1.20) or all-cause with an aver-age follow-up of 3.8 years. 236There was an increased risk of stroke (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.38) and VTE (RR, 1.96;95% CI, 1.37-2.80). A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs showed similar results as the 2015 Cochrane analysis for older women who initiated hormone therapy. 248Compared with placebo or nonusers of hormone therapy, initiating hormone therapy in women aged 60 years or older or after 10 years since menopausehad a null effect on CHD (summary estimate, 1.00; 95% CI,0.87-1.14) and all-cause %C I0 . 9 6 - 1 . 0 5 )b u tw a sa s s o c i a t e dw i t hh i g h e rr i s ko fs t r o k e(summary estimate, 1.17; 95% 1.39-2.29).Similarly, in a 2019 systematic review and meta-regression analysis of RCTs testing the timing hypothesis, women who ini-tiated hormone therapy relative to placebo or nonusers of hor-mone therapy aged 60 years or older showed a null effect onCHD and all-cause mortality but was associated with higher riskof a composite measure of incidence stroke, transient ischemicattack, and systemic embolism (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.39-1.71). 249 Attributable risk of stroke in women aged younger than60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset The 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis found no increased risk of stroke in women who initiated hormone therapy aged youngerthan 60 years or fewer than 10 years from menopause onset. 236 In subgroup analysis, the attributable risk of stroke in the WHIfor women who initiated hormone therapy aged younger than60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset was rare(<10/10,000 person-years) and statistically nonsignificantfor CEE plus MPA, with an absolute risk of 5 per 10,000 person-years, 9,240similar to other studies.232 Findings were inconsistent for CEE-alone in the WHI. For women aged 50 to 59 years at randomization, a decrease of 1 per 10,000 person-years was seen for stroke; whereas for women fewer than 10 years from menopause onset, an increase in 13 strokes per10,000 person-years was seen. 9 On the basis of only observational studies, lower doses of either oral250or transdermal251estrogen may confer less risk of stroke; no clear association with age has been found. No head-to-head datacomparing oral to transdermal hormone therapy are available. Venous thromboembolism Women who began hormone therapy fewer than 10 years af- ter menopause onset or who were aged younger than 60 yearshave higher risk of VTE compared with placebo (RR, 1.74;95% CI, 1.11-2.73), according to the 2015 Cochrane meta- analysis. 236In a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs published between 2000 and 2019, risk of VTE was ele- vated in women who initiated hormone therapy aged older than60 years or after 10 years since menopause (summary estimate,1.79; 95% CI, 1.39-2.29) and a null effect in women who initiatedhormone therapy aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years ofmenopause (summary estimate, 0.69; 95% CI 0.25-1.93). 248 Lower doses of oral ET may confer less risk of VTE than higherdoses, 24,25but comparative RCT data are lacking. Micronized progesterone may be less thrombogenic than other progestins.26 Transdermal hormone therapy has not been associated with VTE risk in observational studies, limited observational data and a sys-tematic review suggest less risk with transdermal hormone therapythan oral 26,27,29; however, comparative RCT data are lacking. Areas of scientific uncertainty and need for randomized, controlled trial data Although observational studies, meta-analyses of RCTs, and smaller RCTs with surrogate CVD risk markers suggest thathormone therapy may reduce CVD risk when initiated in womenaged younger than 60 years and/or who are within 10 years ofmenopause onset, significant research gaps remain regarding dose,formulation, route of delivery, and duration of use. Furthermore,NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 779because most RCTs are performed on North American and European women, future studies should also evaluate the roleof ethnicity with respect to hormone therapy and CVD. Data areinsufficient for risk related to long-term hormone therapy use inperimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women agedyounger than 50 years. 23,252Hormone therapy is not govern- ment approved for prevention of CVD. Key points \u0081For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on CHD and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breastcancer, VTE, and stroke. (Level I) \u0081Hormone therapy is not government approved for primary orsecondary cardioprotection. (Level I) \u0081Personal and familial risk of CVD, stroke, VTE, and breastcancer should be considered when initiating hormone therapy.(Level III) \u0081The effects of hormone therapy on CHD may vary dependingon when hormone therapy is initiated in relation to a woman 's age or time since menopause onset.

(Level I) BREAST CANCER Breast cancer affects approximately one in eight US women, so an understanding of the potential effect of hormone therapyon breast cancer risk is of considerable importance. Potentialdifferences of the effects of ET, EPT, and CEE plus BZA on breast tissue may exist. Different types of estrogen or progesto- gen, as well as different formulations, timing of initiation, dura-tion of therapy, and patient characteristics, may play a role in theeffects of hormone therapy on the breast. Estrogen-progestogen therapy In the WHI, daily continuous-combined CEE plus MPA re- sulted in an increased risk of breast cancer, with nine additionalbreast cancer cases per 10,000 person-years of therapy. 9The HR remained elevated at a median of 20 years 'cumulative follow-up in the unblended, postintervention phase (HR, 1.28; 95% CI,1.13-1.45). 21 Estrogen-alone therapy Compared with women who received placebo, women who received CEE alone in the WHI showed a nonsignificantreduction in breast cancer risk after an average of 7.2 years of ran- domization, with seven fewer cases of invasive breast cancer per10,000 person-years of CEE (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02). 9As i g - nificant reduction in breast cancer became evident in the postinter-vention phase, with a median 20 years 'cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93). 21 Longer duration of hormone therapy use No large RCTs have assessed the effect of long duration of hormone therapy use. Both the ET and the EPT componentsof the WHI reported data for finite intervals because both wereterminated early because of predefined safety considerations,with a median of 7.2 years for ET and 5.6 for EPT. Notably, al- though long-term follow-up at 13 and 20 years provided infor- mation about use for 5 to 7 years, no data were available regard-ing longer-term use. The recent pooled analysis of observationaldata in the Collaborative Group Study included information onduration of hormone therapy use in women starting hormonetherapy when aged 45 to 54 years. 22In each age category, the risk of breast cancer increased with duration of use. Specifically,for ET, the HRs increased from 1.23 (95% CI, 1.11-1.35) for 1 to 4 years of use, to 1.29 (95% CI, 1.21-1.37) for 5 to 9 years, to 1.44 (95% CI, 1.35-1.53) for 10 to 14 years, and to 1.61 (95% CI,1.49-1.74) for 15 or more years. For EPT, increases for similarperiods were 1.66 (95% CI, 1.55-1.78) for 1 to 4 years of use,1.96 (95% CI, 1.87-2.05) for 5 to 9 years, 2.31 (95% CI, 2.18-2.44) for 10 to 14 years, and 2.68 (95% CI, 2.44-2.95) for15 or more years. Attributable risk of breast cancer The attributable risk of breast cancer in women (mean age, 63 y) randomized to CEE plus MPA in the WHI is less than one addi-tional case of breast cancer diagnosed per 1,000 users annually, 9 a risk slightly greater than that observed with one daily glass ofwine, less than with two daily glasses, and similar to the risk re- ported with obesity and low physical activity. 253,254Compared with placebo or nonusers of hormone therapy, there appears to beno additive effect of hormone therapy with age or elevated personalbreast cancer risk factors on breast cancer incidence. 21,22,255-259Al- though the relative risk of breast cancer associated with hor-mone therapy use is similar in women at average or high risk,the actual number of cases or attributable risk will be greaterin women with an increased underlying risk. 86 Use of hormone therapy in women with genetic risk factorsfor breast cancer Observational evidence suggests that hormone therapy use does not further increase the relative risk of breast cancer inwomen with a family history of breast cancer, in women afteroophorectomy for BRCA 1 or2genetic variants, or in women having undergone a benign breast biopsy. 255-258,260-266Ap r o - spective longitudinal cohort study of BRCA 1 genetic variant carriers without prior history of breast cancer who underwentBO (mean age, 43.4 y) showed no increased risk of developingbreast cancer associated with any use of hormone therapy after amean follow-up of 7.6 years; however, there was a difference be-tween ET and EPT, with a nonsignificant increase in breastNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 780 Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 \u00a9 2022 The North American Menopause Societycancer risk associated with the latter.266Similarly, the Two Sister Study of 1,419 sister-matched cases of breast cancer in womenaged younger than 50 years and 1,665 controls showed no in-creased risk of young-onset breast cancer with use 95% CI, 0.41-1.59), and unopposed (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-0.99). 267The absolute risk of breast cancer is low in women with genetic variants who un- dergo risk-reducing BO at a young age, and use of hormonetherapy is considered acceptable. Role of type of hormone use, dose, and route of administration Some but not all observational data suggest that MP and dydrogesterone may have a lesser association with breast can- cer, whereas other synthetic progestogens such as MPA mayhave a more adverse effect. 268Randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings. Prec linical data suggest that CEE may have lesser effects on occult breast cancer growth thanestradiol, 269but clinical data from observational studies, such as the Collaborative Group study, do not report a difference.22 Regarding route, both oral and transdermal estrogens appear to have similar effects on number of breast cancers diagnosed, whereas vaginal estrogens have no effect. Insufficient clinicaldata on newer therapies such as TSECs, including CEE plusBZA, are available to assess their breast cancer risk, 270al- though preclinic al data suggest greater safety.271 Mammographic breast density and hormone therapy Different hormone therapy regimens may be associated with increased breast density, which may obscure mammographic in-terpretation. 272More mammograms and breast biopsies were performed in women receiving CEE plus MP A than placeboin the WHI. 273In trials up to 2-years 'duration, breast cancer, breast density, and breast tenderness showed no difference be-tween oral CEE plus BZA and placebo. 274-276 Hormone therapy after breast cancer Two RCTs reported conflicting outcomes of breast cancer re- currence with hormone therapy. One study ( \"Hormonal Replace- ment Therapy After Breast Cancer \u2014Is It Safe? \")s h o w e da ne l e - vated risk of breast cancer recurrence in hormone therapy usersrelative to nonusers after a median follow-up of 2.1 years (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, years, (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3- 4.2),278whereas another trial (Stockholm Breast Cancer Study) showed no effect on breast cancer recurrence in hormone ther-apy users relative to nonusers after median follow-up of 4.1 (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.9) but did show an increased risk of breast cancer inthe contralateral breast (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-10.9). 280 Although systemic use of hormone therapy in survivors of breast cancer is generally not advised, if symptoms of estrogen deficiency are severe and unresponsive to nonhormone options,women, in consultation with their oncologists, may choose hor-mone therapy after being fully informed about the risks and ben-efits. Several observational studies in women with a history ofbreast cancer have shown a decreased risk of recurrent breastcancer or neutral effects compared with nonusers. 281-286Inaddition, mortality was reported to be reduced in breast cancer survivors who used hormone therapy relative to those who didnot. 282,284Four meta-analyses reported similar findings.281,284-286 A confounding factor in all of these observational studies is thatwomen at low risk of breast cancer recurrence are more likely toelect hormone therapy use than women at high risk. Low-dose vaginal ET remains an effective treatment option for GSM in survivors of breast cancer, with minimal systemic absorption. Treatment with low-dose vaginal ET or DHEAmay be considered if symptoms persist after an initial trial ofnonhormone therapies and in consultation with an oncologist,with more concern for women on AIs. 88,90 Breast cancer mortality and hormone therapy Only one randomized trial, the WHI, examined breast cancer- specific mortality. After 20 years of median cumulative follow-up,CEE alone was associated with significantly lower breast cancer in-cidence (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93) and breast cancer 95% CI, 0.37-0.97) compared with placebo. In con-trast, CEE plus MPA was associated with significantly higher breast cancer incidence (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13-1.45) but no significant difference in breast cancer mortality (HR, 1.35;95% CI, 0.94-1.95) compared with placebo. 21 The mortality risk of breast cancer in hormone therapy users has been reported to be reduced in many but not all observationalstudies. 287-295The breast cancers in hormone therapy users (ET and EPT) appear in most (but not all) studies to have more benignhistologic features (localized, smaller, better differentiated, lower mean tumor proliferation rate) than in hormone therapy nonusers. The most recent study, using a large data registry in Finland andcomparing populations rates, reported a reduction in breast can-cer mortality in users of both ET and EPT. 296A confounding fac- tor in all these studies is that hormone therapy users undergomore frequent mammograms and diagnostic examinations, espe-cially with occurrence of signs or symptoms. 297-301This is likely to result in earlier diagnosis and th erefore more benign histologic features and lower mortality. Key points \u0081The risk of breast cancer related to hormone therapy use is low, with estimates indicating a rare occurrence (less thanone additional case per 1,000 women per year of hormone therapy use or three additional cases per 1,000 women when used for 5 years with CEE plus MP A).

Unopposed systemic ET in a post-menopausal woman with an intact uterus increases the risk ofendometrial cancer, which is dose- and duration-related. Greater risk is seen with higher estrogen doses used for longer duration, and risk persists after discontinuation. Progestogen used contin-uously or cyclically for 10 to 14 days monthly significantly reducesthis risk. With long-duration hormone therapy use, observa-tional studies suggest a potentially increased risk of endometrialcancer with cyclic progestogen regimens compared with contin-uous progestogen use with use of MP compared withother progestogens. 3,4,302In the WHI, women with a uterus re- ceiving EPT had a lower risk of endometrial cancer than women randomized to placebo after 13 years of cumulative follow-upbecause of the baseline risk of endometrial cancer in postmeno-pausal women from endogenous estrogen production. 9Ade- quate concomitant progestogen is recommended for a womanwith an intact uterus when using systemic ET. Low-dose vaginal ET does not appear to increase endometrial cancer risk, 92,93although trials with endometrial biopsy end points are limited to 1 year in duration. Progestogen is not ad- vised in women using low-dose vaginal ET for the treatmentof GSM, although intermittent use may be considered in womenat increased risk of endometrial cancer. Postmenopausal bleed-ing must be evaluated thoroughly in any woman, whether sheis using hormone therapy or not, because this may be a sign ofendometrial hyperplasia or cancer.Hormone therapy after endometrial cancer Although hormone therapy is generally contraindicated in women with estrogen-responsive cancers, hormone therapy maybe used to treat bothersome menopause symptoms in womenwith low-grade, Stage I endometrial cancer after hysterectomy.Meta-analyses of retrospective studies, with one RCT, do notidentify an AE on the risk of recurrence or survival in these cases. 303-306Aw o m a n 's oncologist should be included in shared decision-making. Systemic hormone therapy is not advised withhigh-grade, advanced-stage endometrial cancers or with endome-trial stromal sarcomas because there are in-sufficient studies assessing safety. 307,308 Key points \u0081Unopposed systemic ET in a postmenopausal woman with anintact uterus increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so ade-quate progestogen is recommended. (Level I) \u0081Low-dose vaginal ET does not appear to increase endome-trial cancer risk, although trials with endometrial biopsy end points are limited to 1 year in duration.

Use of oral contraceptives is associated witha significant reduction in ovarian cancer risk. Risk declines withlonger duration of use, with risk reduction seen after 1 to 4 yearsof use, which persists for up to 30 years after oral contraceptivediscontinuation. 309Current and recent use of hormone therapy is associated with statistically significant but small increased risk of ovarian cancer in observational studies, principally for serous type, with an estimate of one additional ovarian cancerdeath in 1,700 to 3,300 hormone therapy users. 310,311This risk is seen with combined EPT and ET alone and dissipates within5 years of discontinuing hormone therapy. In the WHI, therewas no significant increase in ovarian cancer risk with EPT. 9 Hormone therapy after ovarian cancer The use of hormone therapy after a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer does not appear to affect recurrence risk or sur-vival. 312,313Although most studies are obs ervational, this finding also is supported by two RCTs. Several studies identify improvedsurvival in women with ovarian cancer who use hormone therapy, but this likely represents selection bias. 307Use of hormone ther- apy is not advised in women with hormone-dependent ovariancancers, including granulosa-cell tumors and serous carcino-mas. 306,314Tumors of low malignant potential (borderline) often affect younger women, with excelle nt survival rates. Limited data are available, but hormone therapy may be considered in womenwith completely resected disease, especially given the benefits ofNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 782 Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 \u00a9 2022 The North American Menopause Societyhormone therapy in the setting of early menopause.315Short-term hormone therapy use appears safe in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants who underg o risk-reducing BSO before t h ea v e r a g ea g eo fm e n o p a u s e .308 Key points \u0081Use of oral contraceptives is associated with a significant re-duction in ovarian cancer risk.

(Level II) \u0081In women with a history of ovarian cancer, benefits of hor-mone therapy use generally outweighs risks, especially withbothersome VMS or early menopause; use of hormone ther-apy is not advised in women with hormone-dependent ovar-ian cancers, including granulosa-cell tumors and low-gradeserous carcinoma. (Level II) \u0081Short-term hormone therapy use appears safe in women withBRCA1 andBRCA2 genetic variants who undergo risk-reducing BSO before the average age of menopause. (Level II) COLORECTAL CANCER Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in US women. 309Risk fac- tors include physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and decreaseduse of screening strategies, which may be more likely in hor-mone therapy nonusers. Observational studies generally support a reduced risk of colorectal cancer in current hormone therapy users compared with never users (HR, 0.6-0.8), with no benefitassociated with past hormone therapy use. 310-312In observa- tional studies, both EPT and ET alone are associated with re-duced colorectal cancer risk 313,314and mortality.315Although confounding may contribute to the reduced risk of colorectal can-cer seen in hormone therapy users, there is also biologic plausibil-ity, because estrogen receptors are present in colonic epithelium, 316 and estrogen reduces colon cancer cell growth in vitro.317 In the WHI trials, use of CEE plus MPA, but not CEE alone, was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer com-pared with placebo (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.89). 9Although EPT reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, the cancers that weredetected in EPTusers were more likely to be diagnosed at an ad-vanced stage, with positive lymph nodes. 318The reduced risk of colorectal cancer in EPT users was no longer seen during the postintervention phase of the WHI at 13 years, and there was no difference in colorectal cancer mortality with either EPT orET alone. 31The reason for disparate findings between observa- tional studies and the WHI with regard to colorectal cancer riskand mortality is unclear. Key points \u0081Observational studies suggest a reduced incidence of colo- rectal cancer in current hormone therapy users, with reducedmortality. (Level II) \u0081In the WHI, EPT, but not ETalone, reduced colorectal cancerrisk, although cancers diagnosed in EPT users were diagnosedat a more advanced stage. There was no difference in colorec- tal cancer mortality with either EPT or ET. (Level I) LUNG CANCER Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the lead- ing cause of cancer death in US women. 309Smoking is the prin- cipal risk factor. An interaction between hormone therapy andlung cancer is biologically plausible because estrogen receptors(and) and aromatase are identified in both healthy lung tis- sue and lung cancers. 319,320Non-small cell lung cancer, includ- ing adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, is the most common type and the type affected by hormone therapy in ob-servational studies and RCTs. Observational studies, includingseveral large meta-analyses, are conflicting and in aggregateidentify no consistent association between hormone therapyuse and lung cancer risk. 321-327Smoking may influence the as- sociation between hormone therapy use and lung cancer risk.326 For women with lung cancer, the effect of hormone therapy use on survival is unclear, with studies showing improved, wors- ened, or no difference in risk of death. In the WHI, in the intervention phase or after a median of 13 years 'cumulative follow-up, the incidence of lung cancer did not differ significantly between placebo and treatment with CEEplus MPA or CEE alone. 9In a post hoc analysis of the intervention phase of the WHI, women treated with CEE plus MPA had moredeaths from lung cancer compared with placebo (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.16-2.52). 328Cancers were more likely to be poorly differentiated, with distant metastasis. This increase in lung can-cer deaths was not seen with treatment with CEE alone 329and dissipated over time after stopping hormone therapy.330 Key points \u0081There appears to be an overall neutral effect of hormone ther-apy on lung cancer incidence and survival. (Level II) \u0081Smoking cessation should be encouraged, with increasedlung cancer surveillance for older smokers, including currentor past users of hormone therapy. (Level I) DURATION OF USE, INITIATION AFTER AGE 60 YEARS, AND DISCONTINUATION OF HORMONE THERAPY Benefits of hormone therapy use generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome menopause symptoms who are aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause on-set. Because increasing risk is observed with advancing age andextended duration of use, 9,22women are advised to use the ap- propriate dose for the time needed to manage their symptoms.Because many women will experience bothersome VMS formany years, long-duration hormone therapy use may be needed,and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appro- priate. Frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years. 59,331In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least severaltimes per week, 332and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.333 There are important questions related to long-duration hor- mone therapy use and discontinuation that are unanswered byNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 783available data, because the WHI, the longest adequately pow- ered blinded RCT, was limited to 5 to 7 years of therapy. Inthe WHI, initiating hormone therapy in women aged older than60 years or more than 10 years beyond the onset of menopausewas associated with greater risk, and initiating hormones inwomen aged older than 70 years was associated with the highestrisk. 9It is not known whether women who initiate hormone therapy at the time of menopause and continue use at older ages will incur the same risks as women initiating hormones later inlife. The WHI studied only one formulation of oral hormones(CEE with or without MP A). Observational data suggest lowerCVD risk, including VTE and stroke, with other hormone formu-lations and routes of administrati on, estrogens, and different progestogens. 25,251,334-336 through the appropriate choice of dosing, formu- lation, and route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy. Factors thatshould be considered include severity of symptoms, effective-ness of alternative nonhormone and lifestyle interventions,and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascular ac-cident, VTE, and breast cancer. The decision regarding durationof treatment and when to stop hormone therapy must be consid-ered in the context of the individualized risk-benefit profile, as well as the woman 's personal preferences. 337,338 Initiation after age 60 years Initiation of hormone therapy in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years from menopause onset has com- plex risks and requires careful consideration, recognizing that there may be well-counseled women aged older than 60 yearswho choose to initiate or restart hormone therapy. For womenrequesting to initiate hormone therapy because of VMS appear-ing many years after menopause onset, further evaluation isneeded. Although new-onset VMS in an older woman couldbe caused by estrogen-deficiency, hot flashes or night sweatsmay be related to an underlying medical problem (eg, obstruc- tive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, carcinoid, lymphoma, Lyme disease, tuberculosis, HIV) or medication or substance use(eg, antidepressants, hypoglycemic agents, or withdrawal fromalcohol or opioids). Extended use after age 65 years There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years. The Beers criteria from the AmericanGeriatrics Society 339has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recom-mendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy inw o m e na g e d6 5y e a r sa n do l d e ri sn e i t h e rc i t e do rs u p p o r t e db yevidence nor is it recommended by the American College ofObstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Meno- pause Society. 340,341Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low riskfor breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence re-garding safety, risks, and benefits. For otherwise healthy women with persistent VMS, continu- ing hormone therapy beyond age 65 years is a reasonable optionwith appropriate counseling, regular assessment of risks andbenefits, and shared decision-making. Hormone therapy also may be considered for prevention of fracture in healthy olderwomen at elevated fracture risk when bothersome VMS persistor when hormone therapy remains the best choice because oflack of efficacy or intolerance of other fracture-prevention ther-apies. 23,340Long-duration hormone therapy use and use in older women is not appropriate for reduction in the risk of CHD or dementia.23,236,342When providing hormone therapy to older women, clinicians must remain vigilant about risk stratifica-tion and potential mitigation strategies, such as switching fromoral to transdermal hormone therapy, choice of progestogen,and lowering of dose. 337,338 Discontinuation of hormone therapy Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued. Based onfindings from the WHI, breast cancer risk becomes detectableafter 3 to 5 years in women using EPT. For women without auterus using ET alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be ac- ceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way for women to stop hormone therapy, and VMS will recur in approx-imately 50% of women after discontinuation. 71Data directly comparing the effects of abrupt discontinuation with those ofslowly tapering are lacking, 343although clinical experts gener- ally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses overtime. 338,343If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, it is important to remember that protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with dis- continuation.164Although VMS generally improve with time, GSM worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, so womenshould be provided with treatment options on discontinuationof systemic hormone therapy. Observational studies confirmthe long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET, 92,93ah i g h l ye f f e c - tive treatment for GSM. In the absence of contraindications, awoman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formu- lation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional. 337,338 Key points \u0081The safety profile of hormone therapy is most favorablewhen initiated in healthy women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, so initiation of hor- mone therapy by menopausal women aged older than 60 yearsrequires careful consideration of individual benefits and risks.(Level I) \u0081Long-term use of hormone therapy, including for womenaged older than 60 years, may be considered in healthy womenat low risk of CVD and breast cancer with persistent VMS or at elevated risk of fracture for w hom other therapies are not ap- propriate. (Level III) \u0081Factors that should be considered include severity of symp- toms, effectiveness of alternative nonhormone interventions,and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascularaccident, VTE, and breast cancer. (Level III) \u0081Hormone therapy does not need to be routinely discontinuedin women aged older than 60 or 65 years. (Level III)NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 784 Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 \u00a9 2022 The North American Menopause Society\u0081Mitigation of risk through use of the lowest effective dose and potentially with a nonoral route of administration be-comes increasingly important as women age and with longerduration of therapy. (Level III) \u0081Longer durations or extended use beyond age 65 should in-clude periodic reevaluation of comorbidities with consider-ation of periodic trials of lowering or discontinuing hormone therapy. (Level III) \u0081For women with GSM, low-dose vaginal ET may be consid- ered for use at any age and for extended duration, if needed.(Level III) \u0081In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determineher preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and durationof use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-makingwith her healthcare professional. (Level III) SUMMARY Hormone therapy formulation, dose, regimen, route of admin- istration, and the timing of initiati on of therapy likely produce dif- ferent effects, although these have yet to be evaluated in head-to-head RCTs. There is a significant difference in the benefits andrisks of ET alone compared with EPT. Decision-making sur-rounding the use of hormone therapy should be individualized,with recommendations for the us e of the appropriate dose, dura- tion, regimen, and route of administration required to manage a woman 's symptoms and to meet treatment goals. Given the more favorable safety profile of ET alone, longer durations may bemore appropriate. Risk stratification by age and time since men-opause is recommended. Transdermal routes of administrationand lower doses of hormone therapy may decrease risk of VTEand stroke; however, comparative RCT data are lacking. Personalization with shared decision-making remains key, with periodic reevaluation to determine an individual woman 's benefit-risk profile. Benefits may include relief of bothersome VMS, prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture, treat-ment of GSM, and improved sleep, well-being, and quality of life.Absolute attributable risks for w o m e ni nt h e5 0 -t o5 9 - y e a r - o l d age group or within 10 years of menopause onset are low, whereasthe risks of initiation of hormone therapy for women aged 60 yearsand older or who are further than 10 years from menopause onsetappear greater, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset, with more research needed on potential risks of longer durations of use. Women with POI and premature or early menopause have higher risks of bone loss, heart disease, and cognitive or affec-tive disorders associated with estrogen deficiency. In observa-tional studies, these risks appear to be mitigated if ET is givenuntil the average age of menopause, at which time treatment de-cisions should be reevaluated. In limited observational studies, women who are BRCA -positive and have undergone risk-reducing BO appear to receive similar benefits from receiving hormonetherapy, with minimal to no increased risk of breast cancer. Thereis a paucity of RCT data about the risks of extended duration ofhormone therapy in women aged older than 60 or 65 years, al-though observational studies sugg est a potential rare risk of breast cancer with increased duration o f hormone therapy. It remains anindividual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy. There are no data to sup-port routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For select survivors of breast and endometrial cancer, obser- vational data show that use of low-dose vaginal ET for thosewho fail nonhormone therapy for treatment of GSM appearssafe and greatly improves quality of life for many. The use of systemic hormone therapy needs careful consideration for survi- vors of estrogen-sensitive cancers and should only be used forcompelling reasons in collaboration with a woman 'so n c o l o g i s t after failure of nonhormone therapies. Additional research is needed on the thrombotic risk (VTE, pulmonary embolism, and stroke) of oral versus transdermaltherapies (including different formulations, doses, and durationsof therapy). More clinical trial data are needed to confirm or re- fute the potential beneficial effects of hormone therapy on CHD and all-cause mortality when initiated in perimenopause or earlypostmenopause. Additional areas for research include the breasteffects of different estrogen preparations, including the the relationship be-tween VMS and the risk for heart disease and cognitive changes;and the risks of POI. Studies are needed on the effects of longer use of low-dose vaginal ET after breast or endometrial cancer; extended use of hormone therapy in women who are early initi-ators; improved tools to personalize or individualize benefitsand risks of hormone therapy; the role of aging and genetics;and the long-term benefits and risks on women 'sh e a l t ho fl i f e - style modification or complementary or nonhormone therapiesif chosen in addition to or over hormone therapy for VMS, bonehealth, and CVD risk reduction. CONCLUSIONS \u0081Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM and has been shown to prevent bone loss andfracture. \u0081Risks of hormone therapy differ for women, depending ontype, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timingof initiation, and whether a progestogen is needed. Treatmentshould be individualized using the best available evidenceto maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation. \u0081For women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset and without contra indications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS andfor the prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture. Basedon the WHI RCTs, longer duration may be more favorable forET than for EPT. \u0081For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or when aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable than foryounger women because of greater absolute risks of CHD,stroke, VTE, and dementia. \u0081For GSM symptoms not relieved with therapies,low-dose vaginal ET or other government-approved therapies(eg, vaginal DHEA or oral ospemifene) are recommended.NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 29, No. 7, 2022 785ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND DISCLOSURES NAMS appreciates the contributions of the Advisory Panel and the work of the NAMS Board of Trust ees on this position statement.
