The article remindsme of many I have read in your Journal down the years where my interest hasbeen aroused by the description of apotentially useful tool to improve practice,only to be frustrated by the absence of anydescription of the tool itself. The report begs more questions than it answers; for example, if responses to theinitial questionnaire 'reflect inconsistentadvice for each question', who is to judgethat the designers of the questionnaire arein possession of the correct answers? Theauthors cite references regarding supple-mentary fluids, frequent feeding, poorgrowth, and test weighing, but withoutseeing the way in which the questionswere phrased it is impossible to draw anyconclusions at all. I shall write to the authors of the report asking for a copy of their questionnaire,and their version of the 'detailed explana-tory answers', but why on earth could younot have saved me the trouble by printingthem as The editor regrets that there is not sufficient available space in the Journal to publish all the extraneous information topapers such as this one. He would like topoint out that publication of such materialwould consequently result in less paperspublished per issue, which, in turn, wouldresult in less papers being accepted in thelong term.

The use of scoring systems should be emphasized. Since we adopted the policyof Barry 2in our practice, our management of BPH has been revolutionized, and thesatisfaction of our patients has risen.However, we do not routinely performdigital rectal examinations (DREs). The use of DREs should not be taken lightly. It is an unpleasant test to havedone and is, in its way, humiliating for thepatient. I can only think of two reasons forperforming it: OTo assess the size of the prostate. I sus- pect this is highly inaccurate, bears norelation to prostate volume and, whenperformed by a GP, is next to useless. OTo assess whether there is any malig- nancy. We agree with those who do notsee the value in screening for prostaticcancer in the absence of treatment forearly disease; therefore, we do notinclude PSA estimation as one of ourinvestigations. Why then use an exami-nation such as DRE which is only poor-ly sensitive and the result of which can-not be any more beneficial than PSEestimation? Therefore, only perform DRE if you feel that estimating the size of the prostateis something that you are capable of doingaccurately and that it will alter your man-agement, and only do it with the consentof the patient, who knows that if you finda malignant prostate there is little to bedone of proven benefit. We rightly debate the value of investi- gations and screening tests, but rarely dowe include examinations in our discussionof BPH. Digital rectal examination in thiscontext needs some thought.T IMWILSON Mill Stream Surgery References 2. Barry MJ, Fowler FJ, O'Leary MP, et al.

Sir, I was most interested to read the paper byMathers and Rowland (March Journal). I cannot claim to know much about post-modernism, but it seems that modernismembraces the enlightenment of the eigh-teenth century with its assumption that through reason alone a reliable body ofknowledge about the universe can beassembled. Much of this involves applyingscientific methods to a broad range offields. While postmodernism is helpful in pointing out some of the limitations of nat-uralistic enlightenment science and its holdover medicine, some postmodernistswould see such scientific endeavour asinherently futile, self-deceptive, andoppressive. 1 At a time when general practice is becoming more evidence based, postmod-ern scholarship appears to promote theidea that there is no such thing as objectivetruth. As Michael Novak warned in hisTempleton Prize speach, if there is no pur-chase of intellect upon reality, nothing elseis left but preference and will-to-powerunchecked by any regard to truth. To sur-render the domain of intellect is to make astraight road to totalitarianism. 2Alexander Solzhenitsyn observed that what was takenfrom the East by force is now being reject-ed by the West by its own free will. 3 In an age when medicine was a mixture of superstition, dogmatic opinion, andspeculation, Dr Thomas Sydenham(1624-1689) \u2014 who may be consideredthe father of British general practice \u2014discarded much of the medical wisdom ofthe day and, like Hippocrates, stressed theimportance of personal scientific observa-tion, logical deduction, accurate diagnosis,and rational therapy. However, far frombeing a narrow rationalist, his lifestyle washolistic with all the awareness, activity,enjoyment, development of personal pow-ers, and creativity integrated in the singlepurpose of honouring God. 4Thus, unlike the modernists, he would not regard scien-tific method as the exhaustive source ofknowledge and recognized its limitations.Of the pioneers of modern medicine, SirDennis Burkitt, with his work on preven-tive medicine and dietary fibre, and DameCicely Saunders, with her work on pallia-tive care, also recognized the limitations of'modernism' and the inability of scientifictechnology to provide all the answers. I would submit that it is possible to rec- ognize and allow for the uncertainties ingeneral practice without succumbing tosome of the more extreme dogmatic asser-tions of postmodern theory. We all need tocontinue our learning and recognize thelimitations of our knowledge. I hope thatthe Royal College of General Practitioners'motto, Cum Scienta Caritas, with its allu- sion to knowledge and compassionate care,will not be surrendered in deference topostmodernism in the brave new generalpractice of the twenty-first century.S 1996; 1: 63-68. 2.

Sydenham, the physician. Nucleus 1996; Jan: 22-24. Sir, I to discussion(March Journal) 1to consider viewing general practice researchas a postmodern enterprise. General practice research involves both quantitative and qualitative methodolo-gies. Quantitative research remains thepredominant methodology and is based ona 'modern' view of the world, and worksusing scientific method. The underlyingphilosophical position of quantitativeresearch as beingproblematic; it simply exists. 2,3Qualitative research4,5is generally used in general practice research either as a technique thatis methodologically subservient to quanti-tative research or as a pragmatic exercisein which its findings complement qualita-tive research ('researching the parts othermethods cannot reach'). 4An example of the former might be the use of a focusgroup to generate themes which are thentransformed, using quantitative steps, intoa structured questionnaire. An example ofthe latter might be the use of in-depthinterviewing to explore what GPs meanwhen they use the term 'depression'. What is often absent, however, is an explicit discussion of the underlyingphilosophical position of qualitativeresearch. This continues to be an area ofdebate in social and educational research,and there are those who would argue thatquantitative research is phenomenological.That is, there are multiple realities. Theserealities are are socio-psychological con-structions forming an interconnectedwhole and can only be understood assuch. 2It leads to a research approach that is interpretative and naturalistic; one seeksto make sense of phenomena in terms ofthe meanings people ascribe to them.Letters 402 British Journal of General Practice, June 1997British Journal of General Practice, June 1997 403Letters One interpretation of the above is that quantitative research is 'modern', qualita-tive is 'postmodern'. A postmodernistwould, however, not deny the validity ofthe quantitative approach, but would notregard it as the only valid means of look-ing at the world. I would argue that if gen-eral practice research is to see itself asbeing postmodernist then it needs to lookbeyond the use of qualitative research as aresearch technique and to take on board itsphilosophical and theoretical underpin-nings. This will require GP researchers tobecome more acquainted with sociologicaland anthropological theory. T IMSTOKES HospitalGwendolen RoadLeicester LE5 4PW References 1. Mathers N, Rowland S.

Fam Pract 1995; 12: 104-114. is a postmodern specialty (MarchJournal), 1and present another example of the current institutional self-reflectionbeing undertaken in general practice andhow the British Journal of General Practice is becoming a catalyst for such reflection. In using the concept of post-modernism, the authors inevitably chal-lenge the appropriateness of the continueddomination of scientific method in generalpractice development, and reinforce thecall for a 'paradigm shift' in medical prac-tice and education. Modern philosophers have progressed the case that knowing about the 'world' issubjective, and have challenged the notionof the existence of an objective 'world'separate to man. In so doing, it is now rec-ognized that generalization is not value-free, and that an understanding of the'world' is constructed from human inter-pretation. As a result, the notion of univer-sality is believed to reflect the power of one individual over another to exert theirview of the world as superior to all others,rather than representing some inviolatetruth. Mathers and Rowland illustrate this by referring to the development of the newmedical curriculum, indicating the diffi-culties GPs face in establishing their owncontent, and enforce their legitimacywhen they say, 'how we can establish ourcredentials as a serious academic subjectalongside the major specialties.' Whatthey are illustrating, under the symbol ofthe curriclum, is the current negotiationfor power and the attempt by GPs toassert their authority in the field of med-ical knowledge. The enlightenmentgained for them through postmodernistthinking appears to be the demystificationof the 'consultant's control' on medicalknowledge, and the recognition that theeveryday actions of GPs are an equallyvalid source for medical knowledge. Theyre-inforce the need for change with refer-ence to the strict application of biomedi-cine taught at medical school and its inad-equacies for GPs facing uncertainty andhaving to contend with 'illness incontext.' It is interesting to see, in this example, how new philosophies are incorporatedinto institutionalized practices, and illus-trates the effectiveness of the postmodernphilosopher in setting the individual onthe path of enlightenment. However, post-modernism is not a practice nor a set ofprocedures that, once adopted, delivers anexpected outcome. Postmodernism ismore like a tool and is limited by thecapacity of its user. Mathers andRowland's view of a general practice cur-riculum, published in a journal specifical-ly designed for general practitioners,unsurprisingly provides an analysis thatremains within the biomedical framework.Despite challenging the status quo, theycontinue to place the control of medicalknowledge and the organization of themedical curriculum in the hands of thedoctor, albeit the GP. To a non-medical observer, the phrase 'postmodern specialty' could be viewed asan oxymoron, and the thesis generated byMathers and Rowland to fall short of themark. A wider perspective, for example,could embody a review of not just thedelivery of health care, but look to ques-tion the meaning of health care. Were theparadigms upon which medical educationis based to undergo a real shift, then gen-eral practice may become reinvented suffi-ciently to legitimize the phrase 'postmod-ern specialty.' However, it is unlikely thatthis can be done solely from within bydoctors alone, and it is more likely to require participation from all societymembers that interact with general prac-tice to be involved in some way in thecontent and organization of the medicalcurriculum.

J Gen Pract 1997; 47: 177-179. and general practitioners Sir, Colquhoun,1and West and Penfold,2 (January Journal) suggest an optimistic success rate from general practitionerattendence at out-of-hospital cardiacarrest, and encourage more GPs to carrydefibrillators. In 1994 and 1995, we recorded all cases of myocardial infarction in patients under75 years of age in the three UK health dis-tricts of Brighton, South Glamorgan(Cardiff), and York. The aim of the study(as yet unpublished) was to re-examinethe natural history of acute heart attacksfollowing the earlier studies from Englandand Wales published over 20 years ago.We studied all acute events, including out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths, anddelay times of admission to hospital. Over two years, we recorded more than 3000 cases. Less than half of the patientswere recorded as calling their GP. Thereare approximately 700 GPs in the threedistricts, so that each year, on average,each GP may have been contacted by onepatient in this age group suffering fromacute myocardial infarction. Not all ofthese patients were seen, however, assome GPs contacted the emergency ambu-lance service before they visited. The overall 30 day mortality in our study was 45%. Three quarters of thesedeaths occurred before admission to hos-pital; 27 patients arrested with a GP aswitness, this representing only 2% of allout-of-hospital deaths. Twenty-six percent of this group were successfully resus-citated compared with 40% of the 5% ofarrests that were witnessed by paramedics. Rapid thrombolysis saves lives and404 British Journal of General Practice, June 1997Letters improves overall morbidity from acute myocardial infarction; 'minutes meanmyocardium.' It has been shown thatpatients who call their GP arrive morethan one hour later in hospital than thosewho dial '999' for an ambulance. 3This delay may reflect differing presentations,but it is highly likely that a GP in a busysurgery will take longer to reach a patientwith chest pain and then arrange transportto a hospital than an emergency ambu-lance waiting for such an event. Whateverthe cause, a delay of this magnitude mayreduce the benefits of thrombolysis. Both papers suggest that GPs should be equipped with defibrillators and attend lifesupport courses, and this would of coursebe desirable. Assuming an average of onemyocardial infarction in this age groupwas sent to hospital per year, and a 2%incidence was witnessed by a GP, theaverage GP would witness one arrest in 50years; even if we assume a 5% arrest rate, 1 only one arrest per 20 years would beseen. The conclusion made by the partici- pants in our study is that patients with per-sistent pain should call '999' rather thanthe GP. Paramedics will be quicker, moreexperienced, and better equipped to dealwith a cardiac arrest should this occur. Aneducational programme to this effect hasbeen initiated in Brighton. 4 KATHRYNE GRIFFITH University Health Centre York UniversityHeslington York 7HE R OBINM NORRIS UK Heart Attack Cardiac DepartmentThe Royal Sussex 5-6. 2.

The discipline of general practice1,2 Sir, The first responsible public statement of the status of general practice as a disci-pline was made by Sir Douglas Black, theprofessor of medicine at ManchesterUniversity, at about 4.30 pm on Sunday16 April, 1961, in his concluding perora-tion as chairman of the CollegeSymposium at the Midland Hotel inManchester. I listened to it with amusedastonishment as I had written it myself afew weeks preciously in a letter to PatrickByrne, who organized the symposium.Professor Black described general prac-tice, no doubt unknowingly, in my veryown words, as a 'discipline as exact andas exacting as the other specialties.'

Management of involuntary Sir, article Management of invol- untary childlessness, Himmel et al,1 and Jillian Morrison's editorial (February Journal),2need, I think, a response from a totally different perspective: the psychoso-cial perspective. The low technological techniques for fertility treatment (male sperm count andcycle diaries that are the province of theGP) and high tech. techniques that follow(referral to fertility clinic, and the invasiveand high technology investigations andtreatment as stated) are only 20 to 20+%successful in terms of 'take homebabies', 2which means that the GP is left with approximately 75% of miserable,grieving, and depressed couples who are, all too often, left to 'come to terms' withtheir childlessness. These couples needhelp in two areas, neither of which werediscussed fully in the article. The first iscounselling, which is very important, andthe second is adoption/fostering, whichoffers a real chance of making a family. The recent government white paper is very postitive in its approach towards fos-tering and adoption. At last, age is no bar-rier, colour and religion have also beenrelegated to their rightful positions, and allGPs should know the address of the localSocial Services Fostering and AdoptionUnit, the local branch of the CatholicRescue and Church of England societies,and local Independent Adoption Agencies.It is, of course, a substitute family whichis thus being created, but this substitutecan give great satisfaction to infertile cou-ples, and a real family to children in realneed.

Practice nurse intervention Sir, In their paper, Roderick et al (January Journal) have attempted to show whether more intensive practice nurse interventionis effective in changing the cholesterol,weight, and diet of the general population.This is an important area of relevance togeneral practice, but their study raisesissues for discussion, both in terms oftheir results and their interpretation. The authors argue that dietary advice given by the practice nurse is not an effec-tive use of resource, but their results arenot generalizable for a number of reasons.First, by using the pragmatic method ofopportunistic recruiting, patient selectionbias is possible. We would be reassured ifdata had been kept on those patients whowere excluded, at least in terms of num-bers, compared with those recruited.Secondly, by recruiting practices involvedin the general practice research frame-work, it is likely that the patients had beenBritish Journal of General Practice, June 1997 405Letters exposed to previous screening for other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors;e.g. for hyertension, and so there is a prac-tice selection bias. In addition, patientsattending a CHD clinic were excluded,and so those patients seen may have lowerrisk factors than average. It has also beenshown 1that those patients who attend for screening after invitation by letter havelower than average risk factors. This mayalso apply when the invitation is offeredby the doctor directly. Finally, what is deemed by the study team to be routine intervention, i.e. the useof leaflets, is perhaps unlikely to beachieved in the average practice, and wewould consider it to be proactive. Nomention is made of the situation wherepatients who receive such informationreturn for further advice or follow up,although this may have happened on occa-sion. The assumption that 'non-responders were assumed not to have changed theirbaseline measures' is an unsubstantiatedone and may have led to a large change ininterpretation. We note that in theOXCHECK study, 2results were presented both with and without this group of non-attenders, and feel this would have beenhelpful in this study. In CHD prevention we work within nar- row margins, and it would have required avery large sample to detect clinically sig-nificant end-point measures. Primary care-based intervention via practice nurses canwork. 3The whole primary health care team needs to kindle and reinforce a cul-ture of healthy living, rather thanfocussing in on narrow targets and endpoints. The assumption that what goes onin primary care is not population based isslightly out of touch with reality when weare seeing over a million patients a week.

The risk of cardiovascular disease in hypertensive patients Sir, Barton and colleagues (March Journal)1 are right to say that the use of risk factors to identify individuals who will actuallyhave cardiovascular events is an imperfectmethod, and that it complicates the man-agement of hypertension. It needs to besimpler, but does not have to be perfect tobe useful. We are considering introducing a scor- ing system for use by doctors and nursesin our practice, which is imperfect butsimple enough for mental arithmetic. TheAPROVD score (Annual Percentage Risk Of Vascular Death) for an individual isobtained by adding together estimates ofrisk derived from a variety of sources: 2-4 6 for stroke, 5 for early vasculopathy, smoking,obesity, and male sex, 1\u00bc2 for each decade above the age of 60, and 1\u00bc2 for each 10 mm of diastolic pressure above 80 mmHgor 20 mm of systolic pressure above 140mmHg. It differs from other scoring systems 2,5-11 in having all of the following properties: itapplies to both vasculopaths and non vas-culopaths, it incorporates both modifiableand unmodifiable risk factors, it producesan absolute risk estimate which is inher-ently meaningful rather than a relativescore or ranking, it uses vascular death asthe end point in recognition of the multi-focal nature of vasculopathy, and it isintuitively attractive because you can tot itup in your head or on your fingers and geta feel for it rather than depending onstrange formulae and charts that are rarelyto hand when needed. Only two scoring systems are wide ranging enough to be usefully comparedwith the APROVD scoring system (Table1). The Coronary Risk Chart, 7which applies only to non-vasculopaths, givesanalogous scores across the full range ofrisks. The New Zealand guidelines 2give analogous scores for non-vasculopaths buthas too broad an upper risk band and givesmarkedly discrepant scores for two groupsof female vasculopaths. There are manypossible explanations for this and I amplanning to compare this group of womenin our practice with the correspondinggroup of women from the Framingham Table 1.

Non-compliance to long-term asthma treatment \u2014 our greatestachievement Sir, Considerable effort and resources have been concentrated on increasing theawareness and early diagnosis of asthma.This has been done via national asthmaeducation programmes world wide, and inmost cases these programmes have beenhighly successful. One of the greatest challenges facing asthma care giverscomes in the form of the pervasive non-compliance that occurs with inhaled 'pre-venter' medication. For optimal control ofasthma, prolonged and consistent anti-inflammatory therapy is required even inthe absence of symptoms. The rationalebeing that this approach will prevent exac-erbations and control the long-term mor-bidity of the disease. Adherence to prescribed medication regimes has recently become a subject ofgreat interest. The physician of old wouldpaternalistically assume that their obedientpatient would comply religiously with thetreatment protocol. However, compliancestudies have surprised all of us with theirsobering findings. 1Fewer than 50% of patients take their medication in effectivetherapeutic dosages. The reasons for thisare varied and complex, and numerousefforts to improve patient compliancehave been disappointing. To address thisissue, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society(RPS) has advocated that \u00a31.8 million beset aside to research this subject. The RPShas also eloquently recommended that theterm 'compliance' be substituted with theterm 'concordance'. 2This will help to remove the 'doctor knows best' stigmafrom treatment and highlight a softer,more consensual, or 'mutually co-opera-tive' approach. In general, doctors tend to greatly over- estimate adherence to their medicationregimes. A recent study 3in the USA on compliance to long-term inhaled corticos-teroids in asthma showed that despitepatients having a good understanding ofthe inflammatory nature of asthma anddiligently filling in diary cards, non-adher-ence has remained high. In the study,95.4% of patients claimed to be takingtheir inhalers on a regular twice-dailybasis, while their actual use was only58.4% as determined by an electronicmonitor. An interesting observation wasthat the more poorly controlled asthmasufferers who required rescue oral steroidsor hospitalization had even worse compli-ance data. In this sub-group, only 13%took their inhaled 'preventer' cortico-steroids regularly as prescribed. This study has far-reaching implications when one considers the financial impactof wasted medication and the tendency forthe attending physician to go on and co-prescribe additional medication. Non-compliance also leads to unnecessary hos-pitalization for exacerbations and worsen-ing long-term morbidity due to uncon-trolled illness. It is imperative that physicians re-eval- uate their roles as 'treatment prescribers'and critically search for methods to improve 'concordance' to asth-ma treatment. A DRIANMORRIS 13 Colinton 1.
