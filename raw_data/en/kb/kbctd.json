Part of this strategy is the first-ever \"multivalent\" vaccine candidate that \"combines mRNA-1273, Moderna's authorized vaccine against ancestral strains, and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine at the 50 \u00b5g dose level and lower.\" As [advocated here Jan. 31](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2021/01/31/covid-multivalent-vaccines-for-multivariant-viruses/), multivalent vaccines should be developed against multivariant viruses to prevent re-infections, more variants and a prolonged pandemic. Also on [this IDSA Science Speaks site Dec. 22](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/), a rationale was presented for concern regarding antibody-evasion by this variant B.1.351 (501Y.V2) first found in South Africa, due to Spike protein mutations E484K and K417N. Of note, however, [the updated guidance for COVID-19 vaccines from the FDA Feb. 22](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) focusing on virus variants in appendix 2 explicitly pertained to single-valent booster candidate vaccines. On page 18 of 21 of this guidance, FDA stated (my boldtype added): \"This document also does not address considerations for multivalent COVID-19 vaccines\". Thus, further FDA guidance on multivalent vaccine candidates is anticipated. [Moderna reported](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-it-has-shipped-variant-specific-vaccine) multivalent booster candidate as only one of its three approaches: - \"A variant-specific booster candidate, mRNA-1273.351, based on the B.1.351 variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa, at the 50 \u00b5g dose level and lower. - A multivalent booster candidate, mRNA-1273.211, which combines mRNA-1273, Moderna's authorized vaccine against ancestral strains, and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine at the 50 \u00b5g dose level and lower. - A third dose of mRNA-1273, the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, as a booster at the 50 \u00b5g dose level.
