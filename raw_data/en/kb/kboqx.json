This Article focuses on one of the current scientific debates surrounding cholera and the im- plications of that debate for public health -related climate change ad- aptation strategies. Since the 1970s, Rita Colwell and her co -researchers have been ar- guing a local reservoir hypothesis for cholera, emphasizing that river, estuarine, and coastal waters often contain more dormant forms of cholera attached to copepods, a form of zooplankton. Under this hy- pothesis, climatically driven increases in sea surface temperatures, sea surface levels, and phytoplankton production \u2014such as during El Ni\u00f1o years or beca use of climate change \u2014can then spur cholera outbreaks * James I.

As such, the local reservoir hypoth- esis has immediate implications for climate change public health ad- aptation strategies. In November 2017, however, two teams of sci entists published ge- nomic research in Science concluding that epidemic and pandemic cholera outbreaks in the Americas and Africa originate from Asia, sug- gesting that the local reservoir hypothesis needs modification. The two research articles also suggeste d a very different strategy for dealing with cholera in the Anthropocene \u2014namely, genetic detection and in- tensely focused control efforts in Asia. This Article examines in more detail this emerging scientific de- bate about cholera reservoirs and the ultimate source(s) of cholera out- breaks and epidemics. It then explores the implications of that debate for climate change public health adaptation strategies, suggesting sim- ultaneously that the cholera debate is one concrete example of how identifying the stakes at issue in different climate change adaptation strategies can help communities and nations to choose appropriate ad- aptation strategies despite scientific uncertainty.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y INTRODUCTION : CLIMATE CHANGE , DISEASE , AND ADAPTATION Climate change directly and indirectly changes human health vul- nerabilities, including disease vulnerabilities. Indeed, in its 2014 Fifth Assessment, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) devoted an entire chapter of its adaptation report to the human health impacts of climate change.1 It summarized that: The health of human populations is sensitive to shifts in weathe r patterns and other aspects of climate change ( very high confidence ). These effects occur directly, due to changes in temperature and precip- itation and occurrence of heat waves, floods, droughts, and fires. Indi- rectly, health may be damaged by ecological disruptions brought on by climate change (crop failures, shifting patterns of disease vectors), or social responses to climate change (such as displacement of popula- tions following prolonged drought).2 As is true for climate change impacts generally, a com munity's vulnerability to changing disease patterns depends on a complex mix of environmental and social factors.3 For example, \"[t]he background climate -related disease rate of a population is often the best single in- dicator of vulnerability to climate ch ange\u2014doubling of risk of disease in a low disease population has much less absolute impact than dou- bling of the disease when the background rate is high.\"4 However, the changing climate itself and impacts on environmental attributes also matter: Climate ex tremes may promote the transmission of certain infec- tious diseases, and the vulnerability of populations to these diseases will depend on the baseline levels of pathogens and their vectors. In the USA, as one example, arboviral diseases such as dengue are rarely seen after flooding, compared with the experience in other parts of the Americas. The explanation lies in the scarcity of dengue (and other pathogenic viruses) circulating in the population, before the flooding. On the other hand, the high prevalenc e of HIV infection in many 1 INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE , CLIMATE CHANGE 2014: IMPACTS , ADAPTATION , AND VULNERABILITY 709-54 (2014) [hereinafte r 2014 IPCC ADAPTATION REPORT ]. 2 Id. at 713. 3 See id. at 717. 4 Id.

For example, vector -borne diseases li ke malaria, den- gue fever, and tick -borne encephalitis, which are spread through insect vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks, often have complex relationships to changes in temperature and rainfall.8 Thus, in malaria -prone regions where climate change is pu shing temperatures past mosquitoes' max- imum tolerance, malaria may actually decrease (although heat -related health problems will increase); in contrast, malaria is likely to increase in regions that historically have existed toward the lower end of mos- quitoes' temperature tolerance.9 Nevertheless, globally, climate 5 Id. 6 Rita R.

These variable impacts become more pronounced at more extreme increases in global average temperature: Substantial warming in higher -latitude regions will open up new terrain for some infectious dis- eases that are limited at present by low temperature boundaries, as already evidenced by the northward extensions in Canada and Scandinavia of tick populations, the vectors for Lyme disease and tick -borne encephalitis. On the other hand, the emergence of new temperature regimes that exceed optimal conditions for vector and host species will reduce the potential for infectious disease transmission and, with high enough temperature rise, may eventually eliminate some infectious diseases that exist at present close to their upper to lerable temper- ature limits. For example, adults of two malaria -transmitting mosquito species are unable to CRAIG - FINAL WORD (DO NOT DELETE ) 11/19/2018 2:56 PM 34 HOUS. J.

These factors all affect the spatial and temporal range of the organism and also in- fluence exposure routes (e.g., direct contact or via seafood). In coun- tries with endemic cholera, there appears to be a robust relationship betw een temperature and the disease. In addition, heavy rainfall pro- motes the transmission of pathogens when there is not secure disposal of fecal waste. An unequivocal positive relationship between Vibrio numbers and sea surface temperature in the North Sea h as been estab- lished by DNA analyses of formalin -fixed samples collected over a 44 - year period. Cholera outbreaks have been linked to variations in tem- perature and rainfall, and other variables including sea and river lev- els, sea chlorophyll and cyanobacter ia contents, and Indian Ocean Di- pole (IOD) and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event.12 While the IPCC offered no specific projections for cholera inci- dence in the future, its discussion nevertheless suggested that cholera outbreaks may be more likely a s temperatures increase and heavy rainfall events become more likely. At a basic level, what climate change means for future disease risk, including cholera, in a specific community depends on a number of survive temperatures much above 40\u00b0C in laboratory experiments, although in the external world they may seek out tolerable microclimates. Reproductio n of the malaria parasite within the mosquito is impaired at lesser raised temperatures. Larval development of Aedes albopic- tus, an Asian mosquito vector of dengue and chikungunya, also does not occur at or above 40\u00b0C. Id. at 736. 10 Id. at 725 -26. 11 Id. at 726. 12 Id.

Scientific debates over this etiology, and hence the disease's relationship to climate change, bring into sharp focus one of the most pervasive impediments to the process of identi- fying and pursuing public health climate change adaptation strategies: scientific uncertainty regarding what climate change actually means for a given community's or population's disease vulnerability. Recent discoveries about cholera's etiology, at least for some outbreaks, have brought this scientific uncertainty squarely into the realm of identify- ing cholera climate change adaptation strategies. This Article examines how nations should be thinking about chol- era adaptation in light of a recently sharpened and profound scientific disagreement regarding where cholera epidemics and pandemics come from. Dr. Rita Colwell and her colleagues have been pursuing a local reservoir hypothesis for cholera since the 1970s, based on discov- eries that the cholera bacterium, Vibrio cholera , exists in local lakes, es- tuaries, and coastal waters in conjunction with copepods, a common form of zooplankton. Under this hypothesis, changes in climatic con- ditions can play a direct role in cholera outbreaks, putting cholera pre- vention squarely within the subject matter of climate change adapta- tion strategies. Two recent papers in Science , in contrast, use genomic analyses to trace all recent cholera epidemics to Asia, suggesting strik- ingly different strategies for dealing with cholera and a substantially reduced need for public health climate change adaptation strategies. This Article thus examines cholera as a case study example of the climate change adaptation/scientific uncertainty con undrum. Part I presents a brief history of humanity's interactions with cholera, espe- cially the seven pandemics that have ravaged the world since the early 19th century. Part II then explains the local reservoir hypothesis of cholera outbreaks, emphasizing how researchers working under this hypothesis have identified environmental changes related to climate variability as both important causes and predictors of cholera out- breaks. Part III, in turn, examines the new \"Asia origin\" hypothesis and its implicati ons for predicting and managing cholera \u2014including the renewed hope that cholera could be eradicated. In Part IV, this Article examines the issue of public health climate change adaptation strategies for cholera in light of the ongoing CRAIG - FINAL WORD (DO NOT DELETE ) 11/19/2018 2:56 PM 36 HOUS. J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y scientific debate ov er the disease's etiology, especially debates regard- ing the importance of climatic variation to cholera outbreaks. After more specifically examining the stakes of the scientific debate over cholera for public health measures and surveying existing strategi es for dealing with scientific uncertainty in climate change adaptation planning, it turns to four approaches to on -the-ground cholera preven- tion and treatment and their places within public health climate change adaptation policies: early warning systems for cholera out- breaks; improved drinking water treatment and sanitation; investment in a cholera vaccine; and efforts to eliminate cholera by eliminating its sources in Asia \u2014a strategy that necessarily assumes that the new sci- ence is wholly and exclusively correct. The Article concludes that, in a world of limited resources, multi -benefit adaptation strategies such as investing in improved drinking water and sanitation should probably take first priority in most countries, although it acknowledges that coun try-specific exigencies and priorities may justify (or allow) invest- ment in disease -specific public health strategies such as the cholera vaccine. I. A BRIEF HISTORY OF CHOLERA AS A HUMAN DISEASE A. Basic Overview of Cholera Cholera appears to have a relative ly long relationship with hu- manity. \"There are descriptions of a disease resembling cholera in Sushruta Samshita from India, written in Sanskrit -500 to 400 B.C. His- torical records tracing back 2000 years, in both Greek and Sanskrit, de- scribe diseases simi lar to cholera.\"13 The original reservoir of the chol- era bacterium, Vibrio cholera , was the Ganges River delta in India.14 Exposure to the cholera bacterium through contaminated drink- ing water or shellfish leads to infection of the small intestine and diar- rhea.15 Most infected people display only mild symptoms and readily 13 Colwell, supra note 6, at 2025. 14 Cholera Fact Sheet , WORLD HEALTH ORG., http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/ (last updated Dec. 2017) [hereinafter Cholera Fact Sheet ]. 15 See id.; D.

This can lead to death if left un- treated.\"17 Scientists learned how to control the spread of cholera before they pinned down its actual cause. In 1854, during the third global cholera pandemic (see below), British physician John Snow succeeded in identifying contami- nated water as the transmitter of the disease, a breakthrough in even- tually bringing it under control. Snow carefully mapped the cases of cholera in the Soho area in London and traced the source to a water pump. After convincing offi- cials to remove the pump handle, the number of cholera cases in the area immediately declined.18 John Snow's discovery remains critically important to cholera pre- vention even today. As the World Health Organization (WHO) em- phasizes, \"[p]rovision of safe water and sanitation is critical to control the transmission of cholera . . . .\"19 Connecting cholera to however, took a little longer. Filippo Pacini actually discovered this bacterium in 1854, the same year as John Snow's epidemiological discovery.20 How- ever, the prevailing theory of disease at the time, the miasmal theory of disease, provided no scientific context in which to connect the bac- terium to cholera.21 Later in the 19th century, howeve r, the scientific CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTION 191, 191 (2014). 16 Cholera Fact Sheet , supra note 14. 17 Id. 18 Cholera's seven pandemics: Disease has killed millions since 19th century , CBC NEWS, (Oct. 22, 2010), http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cholera -s-seven -pandemics -1.758504.

J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y transition to the germ theory of disease allowed Robert Koch to con- nect the bacterium to the disease when he rediscovered Vibrio cholerae in 1883.22 Even then, skepticism over the role of V. cholerae in causing cholera persisted until 1959 , when Sambhu Nath De discovered the bacterium's toxin and completed the explanation of how it could cause diarrhea.23 Cholera disease occurs in three forms: endemic outbreaks, re- gional epidemics, and global pandemics. As WHO notes, \"[c]holera is endemi c in many countries,\" and \"[a] cholera -endemic area is an area where confirmed cholera cases were detected during the last 3 years with evidence of local transmission (meaning the cases are not imported from elsewhere).\"24 Therefore, as Parts II and III wil l discuss in more detail, local reservoirs of the cholera bacterium probably re- main critical sources of endemic cholera outbreaks, which also tend to be far less lethal than the epidemic and pandemic versions. Cholera epidemics, in turn, are a significant increase, often sudden, in cholera cases in a specific area.25 \"[E]pidemic cholera is an acute, painful and often lethal disease\" that can lead to death from dehydration in a few hours.26 Major cholera epidemics continue to occur in South America and Africa.27 In addition, social unrest and war can foster cholera epi- demics,28 as occurred in Yemen in 2017.29 Max von Pettenkoffer, who considered cholera to be an airborne disease, caused by a combi- nation of three factors: a germ, the local and seasonal conditions, and a constitutional predis- position to infection\" (citation omitted)). 22 Id. at 191. 23 Id. at 194; see generally S.N.

B. The Seven Cholera Pandemics While cholera has been a human disease for over two millennia, cholera pandemics are relatively new and date to 1817.32 Each cholera pandemic represents the global spread of a new infectious variant of the V. cholerae bacterium, and cholera bacteria have a wide range of genetic variations33\u2014one reason why genomic studies like those pub- lished in 2017 can be revealing. All recent cholera outbreaks have been caused by the toxin -producing V. cholerae O1 serogroup.34 Within this serogroup, cholera exists in two biotypes, classical and El Tor, and both biotypes are further classified into two serotypes, Ogawa and Inaba.35 Classical strains of V. cholera O1 probably caused the first six cholera pandemics, but El Tor stra ins are responsible for the seventh.36 \"Compared with the classical strains, El Tor persists for longer in the environment, causes more asymptomatic cases and is shed more ex- tensively in excreta, even in asymptomatic cases.\"37 30 What is a pandemic? , WORLD HEALTH ORG.

Also, there is a potential for increases in cholera outbreaks resulting from rising sea levels and increases in water temperature, since brackish water and estuaries are natural reservoirs of V. cholera e.67 61 Dalong Hu et al., Origins of note 14. 62 Fran\u00e7ois -Xavier Weill et al., Genomic history of the seventh pandemic of cholera in Africa , 358 SCI. 785, 785 (2017). 63 Id. 64 CBC NEWS, supra note 18. 65 Cholera Fact Sheet , supra note 14; Weill et al., supra note 62, at 785. 66 See generally id. 67 2010 WHO Cholera Vaccines Paper, supra note 33, at 119.

This region has been the focus of research regarding the local reservoir hypothesis for cholera; the re- gion has also been the starting point of all seven cholera pandemics.68 An environmental theory of cholera outbreaks pre -dated the 20th century. For example, Robert Koch offered such a hypothesis in the late 19th century but could not prove it \"because of the ability of Vibrio cholerae , the causative agent of cholera, to enter a dormant phase between epidem- ics.\"69 Beginning in the 1960s, however, Dr. Rita R. Colwell has sought to document the origins of cholera outbreaks and pandemics, focusing on local reservoirs and triggering environmental conditions. In 1996 in Sci- ence, she reported that cholera bacteria can su rvive in dormant states in coastal and marine waters. Specifically, \"[a]ll Vibrio spp. that are 68 Map courtesy of QUORA and posted and used in conformity with its re -posting policies.

Sa- linities favorable for growth of V. cholerae are found primarily in inland coastal area s and estuaries, but the bacterium thrives in seawater as well.\"70 Cholera bacteria can survive in a dormant and non -infectious state in association with copepods, a form of small marine zooplankton, \"but apparently can be resuscitated by heat shock.\"71 In addition: The association of V. cholerae with zooplankton has proven to be a key factor in deciphering the global nature of chol- era epidemics. V. attaches to in zoopla nkton in cholera endemic regions. Ocean currents sweeping along coastal areas thereby translocate plankton and their bacterial passengers.72 Thus, according to Colwell, the sea and changes to the sea play an im- portant environmental role in cholera outbreaks and pandemics, alt- hough of course \"poor sanitation, lack of hygiene, and crowded living conditions\" also play important roles in the disease's spread.73 Never- theless, \"[t]he history of cholera reveals a strong associa- tion with the sea. The great pandemics followed coastlines of the world oceans.\"74 Continuing research indicated that the release of dormant cholera bacteria from copepods was linked to algal blooms (on which the co- pepods feed), changing sea surface temperatures, and changing sea surface heights.75 All of these tend to occur during El Ni\u00f1o events, and research published in 1999 connected cholera outbreaks in Peru to the 1997 -1998 El Ni\u00f1o event.76 As such, the researchers concluded, ad- vanced computational power in combination with increas ed interdis- ciplinary understanding of the role of copepods in cholera 70 Colwell, supra note 6, at 2027. 71 Id. 72 Id. 73 Id. 74 Id. 75 Colwell & Huq, supra note 69, at 136S. 76 Id.

As the researchers noted: cholera epidemics involve a complex and critical interplay of intrinsic dynamics with extrinsic drivers. For example, cholera is no longer a dis- ease threat for developed countries, including the United States, even though the presence of V. cholerae O1 in the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and coastal states of the Gulf of Mexico has long been known.90 Nevertheless, the researchers' main points for public health pur- poses were that \"environmental as well as epidemiological data need to be collected and compiled expediently to provide useful and reliable predictions of the onset, epidemics, and trends of c holera based on en- vironmental variability\" and that studies could improve cholera 85 Id. at 17676, 17678. 86 Id. at 17678. 87 Id. 88 Id. 17678 -79. 89 Id. at 17679. 90 Id.

Cash and his colleagues, expanding upon the local reservoir hypothesis and the postulated importance of climatic changes to cholera outbreaks and epidemics, noted a connec- tion between the autumn in cidence of cholera in Bangladesh and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events the previous winter \u2014a po- tentially important climate connection in terms of predicting cholera outbreaks and epidemics.93 ENSO affects both sea surface tempera- tures in the Bay of Bengal and rainfall in Bangladesh, and above -aver- age rainfall in turn \"provid[es] a plausible physical link between win- ter El Ni\u00f1o events and cholera incidence in Bangladesh through increased flooding and breakdowns in sanitation.\"94 The researchers noted that \"the El Tor strain of cholera replaced 'the Classical' strain in the environment during the mid -1970s\" and hence that their re- search focused purely on the El Tor strain, although they acknowl- edged that \"the two strains may respond differently to envir onmental drivers.\"95 For the El Tor strain and recent incidences of cholera, they concluded that \"that Bangladesh summer precipitation is generally higher following winter El Ni\u00f1o events when the warm [sea surface temperature] anomalies in the central tropi cal Pacific persist through the summer months,\" establishing \"a physical basis for the observed correlation between cholera incidence and ENSO.\"96 Their results, moreover, potentially allowed for improved ability to predict cholera risk in Bangladesh, with initial predictions based on sea -surface tem- peratures and the state of ENSO in the winter and then modified through monitoring of sea surface temperature through the spring and summer.97 91 Id. 92 Benjamin A.

CRAIG - FINAL WORD (DO NOT DELETE ) 11/19/2018 2:56 PM ROBIN KUNDIS CRAIG 49 A year later, researchers showed that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is also relevant to cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh.98 As these researchers reported, the IOD: is a climate mode arising from an ocean -atmosphere inter- action that causes interannual climate variability in the tropical Indian Ocean. A positive IOD indi cates SST [sea surface temperature] anomalies with warmer than usual SSTs over the western basin and cooler than usual SSTs in the eastern basin near Sumatra. A negative IOD occurs when the SST is anomalously warm in the eastern basin and anomalously cold in the western tropical Indian Ocean. Although the extent to which the IOD is independ- ent of ENSO has been debated, there is growing evidence that this air -sea interaction is specific to the Indian Ocean.99 The IOD can also affect sea level in the Bay of Bengal and regional cli- mate, including monsoonal rainfall.100 Specifically, a negative IOD tends to raise sea level in the eastern equatorial region of the Indian Ocean and to increase flooding in Bangladesh.101 As is true with other scientists working to elu cidate the role of en- vironmental factors in cholera outbreaks, the researchers here hoped to contribute to \"the development of accurate early warning systems for cholera epidemics and aid in disease control.\"102 Using a time series analysis, they concluded t hat a positive IOD was associated with in- creased hospital visits for cholera 0 -3 months later, as opposed to 8 -11 months later for ENSO events.103 They hypothesized that the IOD's ef- fect on rainfall upstream was partially responsible for increased chol- era in cidence: Although the causal pathways are thought to be very com- plicated, high river levels/flooding are likely to be one of 98 Masahiro Hashizume et al., The Indian Ocean Dipole and Cholera Incidence in Bangladesh: A .

HEALTH L. & POL'Y the important causal pathways. Increased river levels and flooding adversely affect water sources and sewerage sys- tems and increase the exposure to water contaminated with V. cholerae . The possible link between flooding and cholera may also be associated with the growth and multiplication of V. cholerae , because flooding increases the level of insol- uble iron, which in turn improves th e survival rate of V. cholerae . It has also been suggested that flooding washes away the vibriophages that prey on V. cholerae , resulting in increased concentration of the bacterium in the water, alt- hough a recent simulation study did not support this hy- pothesis. It is unlikely that these possible pathways explain all cholera cases during the monsoon season, because the incidence of cholera often dips during monsoon flooding. This dip is thought to result from a reduction in salinity levels due to increased river discharge, which reduces the survival of V. cholerae and decreases its concentration by monsoon rainfall (dilution effect).104 Despite these complexities, however, the researchers concluded that their findings \"suggest that Indian Ocean [sea surface t empera- ture] variability should be taken into account when building predictive models for cholera using ocean -climate data,\" including the early warning system for cholera that WHO had proposed \"based on cli- matic parameters.\" 105 As the references above to Per uvian cholera outbreaks indicate, the local reservoir (copepod) hypothesis has also been proposed for other locations. In 2009, Colwell and Guillaume Constantin de Magny published a more general proposal that cholera outbreaks are related to climate. 106 Noting that cholera \"is reemerging in many parts of the world in epidemic form, especially in tropical areas,\" the two research- ers emphasized that \"V. cholerae is naturally present in the 104 Id. at 243. 105 Id. 106 Guillaume Constantin de Magny & Rita R.

In these regions, the same physical or environ- mental drivers most likely explain the patterns of disease.\" 108 The the- ory is relevant even to the United States, where cholera had gradually disappeared in the early 1900s because of improved sanitation and drinking water treatment. 109 The United States is not entirely free of cholera, and \"its first reappearance in the twentieth century [was] re- ported in 1973 in Texas. Since then, sporadic cases are reported each year in the United States, some of which have been confirmed as in- digenous in origin.\" 110 Chesapeake Bay is a proven reservoir of the V. cholera bacterium, and de Magny and Colwell developed a model to predict the presence and abundance of cholera bacteria in that bay. 111 While the model itself is not necessary to protect public health in the Chesapeake Bay region, it \"illustrate[s] how an interdisciplinary re- search effort that includes microbiology, ecology and climatology can concretize academic research to a near -opera tional water -borne path- ogen forecasting system.\" 112 of cholera outbreaks and epidemics to environmental factors\u2014especially factors such as precipitation, sea surface tempera- ture, and sea surface height \u2014fairly directly renders continued control of cholera a climate change adaptation issue. Indeed, researchers in this field clearly recognize the climate change connection.

This can be achieved by considering how systems i nteract. With few exceptions, zoonotic and vector -borne diseases are readily understood as having links with the natural environment, and cholera is one of the best examples to illustrate this bi- ocomplexity.113 This research also informed the IPCC's conclusi ons about the links be- tween climate change and human disease. As such, studies of the links between environmental factors and cholera incidence \"provide a founda- tion on which to build a predictive capacity for cholera epidemics, hence, an early warning sys tem for enhancing public health measures, especially for developing countries and areas of the world undergoing social disrup- tion or climate change.\"114 III. THE ASIAN DISPERSION HYPOTHESIS : IS CLIMATE REALLY RELEVANT ? As noted, although much of the researc h supporting the local res- ervoir/copepod hypothesis regarding cholera etiology has occurred around the Bay of Bengal, researchers claim for it a broader application to cholera's origins. However, two genomic studies recently published in Science call into question the ubiquity of the local reservoir hypoth- esis, especially as pertains to cholera outbreaks in Africa and in Latin America. Focusing on strains of the El Tor variety of the V. cholera bacterium, the Africa study115 identified two El Tor strains \"known to have in- vaded Africa in 1970: one in West Africa (serotype Ogawa) and the other in East Africa (serotype Inaba).\"116 The Ogawa bacteria in Africa were related to three Chinese variations and one Indian variation, 113 Id. at 122. 114 de Magny et al., supra note 78, at 17679. 115 Weill et al., supra note 62, at 785 -89. 116 Id. at 786.

STRATEGIES FOR CHOLERA PREVENTION IN LIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY AND CLIMATE CHANGE The debate over the etiology of cholera epidemics and pandemics provides a concrete example of a recurring issue in developing public health climate change adaptation strategies: the problem of scientific uncertainty. This Part looks first at the specific st akes for public health strategies of the cholera etiology debate, then reviews general ap- proaches to climate change adaptation planning in the face of uncer- tainty. It then uses those approaches to assess four cholera -specific strategies: develop an early w arning system; improve drinking water access and treatment and basic sanitation; invest in a cholera vaccine; and seek to control emerging cholera epidemics at their source. A. The Stakes of the Debate: Why Does Cholera's Etiology Matter to a Public Healt h Climate Change Adaptation Strategy? Notably, neither of the two 2017 genomic studies of cholera study posits that Asia -derived cholera strains are the sole source of cholera infection. The authors of the Africa study specifically noted that their researc h does not exclude the possibility that other cholera strains cause sporadic disease on that continent.144 More decisively, the Latin America study explicitly found that there are different types and sources of cholera in Latin America, concluding that \"[a]n appreciation of the differences between pandemic and local lineages should inform the design of disease control strategies in Latin America.\"145 Nor does Latin America between 1991 and 1993, and another in Haiti that started in 2010 and is ongo- ing. The analysis confirms previous strong evidence that the Haiti outbreak was inadvertently introduced by United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal, and it shows that the '90s outbreak was also caused by Asian strains, both introduced in 1991. One arrived in Peru by way of Africa, and the other landed in Mexico, having traveled from southern Asia, possibly via Eastern Europe.\"). 144 Weill et al., supra note 62, at 785. 145 Domman et al., supra note 12 4, at 793. CRAIG - FINAL WORD (DO NOT DELETE ) 11/19/2018 2:56 PM ROBIN KUNDIS CRAIG 57 either study refute (and, by affirming a southern Asian origin for many cholera pandemics, might in some ways affirm) the climate -related eti- ology of cholera epidemics in Bay of Bengal countries like India and Bangladesh . Nevertheless, as the Lat in America study emphasized, epidemic and pandemic strains of cholera impose a much greater global disease burden than the other types. As a result, an Asian origin hypothesis for these forms of cholera outbreaks has direct implications for where public he alth officials should focus their limited resources. Indeed, the Latin America study researchers discussed the stakes at issue: [E]xploratory analyses have demonstrated since the 1970s that V. chol- erae is an integral member of many coastal, estuarine, and brackish wa- ter ecosystems, as are other Vibrio species, in which it is often associated with copepods and zooplankton. Accordingly, a view of V. cholerae ep- idemiology emerged in the following decades, which posits that locally evolving, but globally distributed, V. cholerae populations are respon- sible for cholera outbreaks, which occur when climatic or environmental stimuli provide favorable bacterial growth conditions in these environs. This perception has had profound effects on all levels of global public health; cholera is now considered to be ineradicable because its etiolog- ical agent is ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems.146 The Asian origin hypothesis leads to different cholera public health strategies than the local reservoir hypothesis, p articularly in terms of how to assemble early warning systems for developing chol- era epidemics and pandemics and of what the eventual global health goal for cholera should be. With respect to early warning systems, such systems based on the local reservoir hypothesis focus on detecting rel- evant changes in environmental variables, such as sea surface temper- ature, sea surface height, and chlorophyll or phytoplankton concentra- tions. In contrast, under the Asian origin hypothesis, early warning systems take the form of genetic detection.147 As for the ultimate public health goals for cholera, the local reservoir hypothesis means that chol- era can never be completely eliminated \u2014only controlled and treated.148 In contrast, an Asian origin means that cholera \u2014at least in 146 Id. at 789. 147 Kupferschmidt, supra note 14 3 (based on an interview with Nicholas Thomson, a researcher at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, U.K.). 148 Domman et al., supra note 12 4, at 789.

B. General Strategies for Planning Under Uncertainty So, where should public health officials concerned about cholera and its possible future under climate change invest their time, adapta- tion efforts, and li mited funding? The costs of public health climate change adaptation strategies \"may be considerable.\"150 As a result, few individual nations nor the international community at large are likely to be able to afford all -out, multi -stranded disease adaptation e fforts. Under these circumstances, the stakes at issue in adaptation choices, as well as potential multiple benefits from certain choices, should be- come important factors in how the public health sector chooses to adapt to climate change. At the outset, pu blic health -focused climate change adaptation strategies should reflect well -established public health principles and a proactive approach.151 One such principle is prevention , which can oc- cur at three levels: Primary prevention aims to prevent the onset of injury or illness; clinical examples include immunization, smoking cessation efforts, and the use of bicycle helmets. Secondary prevention aims to diagnose disease early to control its ad- vance and reduce the resulting health burden; clinical ex- amples inclu de screening for hypertension, hyper- lipidemia, and breast cancer. Tertiary prevention occurs once disease is diagnosed; it aims to reduce morbidity, avoid complications, and restore function.152 149 Kupferschmidt, supra note 14 3. 150 2014 IPCC ADAPTATION REPORT , supra note 1, at 717. 151 Howard Frumkin et al., Climate Change: The Public Health Response , 98:3 AM.

The mandate to maxim- ize health protection at the lowest short -term and long -term cost is highly relevant to climate change.\"157 \"Finally, ethical considerations guide public health attention to climate change.\"158 A number of general guidelines and procedures have already been proposed to alleviate the risk planning stagnation in the face of scie n- tific uncertainty, particularly with respect to climate change. For ex- ample, scenario planning provides one method of extrapolating a va- riety of future conditions based on varied assumptions about climatic impacts and social and economic factors.159 \"The ce ntral idea of sce- nario planning is to consider a variety of possible futures that include many of the important uncertainties in the system rather than to focus on the accurate prediction of a single outcome.\"160 Scenarios may encompass realistic projection s of current trends, quali- tative predictions, and quantitative models, but much of their value lies in incorporating both qualitative and quantitative understandings of the system and in stimulating people to evaluate and reassess their beliefs about the s ystem. Useful scenarios incorporate imaginative speculation 153 Id. at 437. 154 Id. 155 Id. (emphasis added). 156 Id. 157 Id. 158 Id. 159 Garry D.

Within these storylines the internal assumptions of the scenario and the differences between stories must be clearly visible. To be plausible, each scenario s hould be clearly anchored in the past, with the future emerging from the past and present in a seamless way.\"163 The goal of scenario planning is to enhance institutional and individual capacity to productively respond to future change: A successful scenario -planning effort should enhance the ability of peo- ple to cope with and take advantage of future change. Decisions can be made, policies changed, and management plans implemented to steer the system toward a more desirable future. New research or monitoring activities may be initiated to increase understanding of key uncertain- ties, and they may stimulate the formation of new coalitions of stake- holder groups.164 A related approach more specific to public health is vulnerability mapping.165 Vulnerability mapping c an reveal potentially increasing vulnerabilities for a number of climate change -related health impacts, including disease.166 For example, the IPCC has applauded a number of vulnerability mapping efforts in response to climate change: spatial modeling of geo -referenced climate and environmental infor- mation was used to identify characteristics of domestic malaria trans- mission in 2009 -2012 in Greece, to guide malaria control efforts. 161 Id. at 360 (citation omitted). 162 Id. 163 Id. at 361. 164 Id. at 362. 165 2014 IPCC ADAPTATION REPORT , supra note 1, at 733 (\"Vulnerability mapping is being in- creasingly used to better understand current and possible future risks related to climate change.\"). 166 Id. at 733 -34.

In Portugal, modeling of Lyme disease indicates that future con- ditions will be less favorable for disease transmission in the south, but more favorable in the center and northern parts of the country. This in- formation can be used to modify surveillance programs before disease outbreaks occur.167 Moreover, as the IPCC noted, vulnerability mapping can inform surveillance and early warning systems, another adaptation strategy that can mitigate uncertainty.168 Once future possibilities are understood, a search f or \"no regrets\" measures can become an effective means of starting a climate change adaptation strategy. \"No regrets\" measures are adaptation strategies that are a good idea under all or at least most future scenarios and gen- erally offer current benefits, as well.169 \"No regrets\" strategies are often options that communities or nations should be pursuing anyway but that have been stymied for any of several reasons \u2014\"[m]any obstacles explain the current situation, including (i) financial and technology constrai nts, especially in poor countries; (ii) lack of information and transaction costs at the micro -level; and (iii) institutional and legal con- straints.\"170 Climate change adaptation can thus provide the impetus for overcoming these obstacles. For example, as Hu rricane Harvey am- ply demonstrated in late August and early September 2017, toxic sites in the U.S. coastal zone pose both a current health and safety risk and a future vulnerability in light of sea -level rise and the expected increas- ing numbers of increasi ngly violent coastal storms.171 As such, coastal cleanup efforts pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund)172 and parallel state laws qualify as \"no regrets\" climate change adapta- tion st rategies in the United States. 167 Id. at 734. 168 Id. 169 St\u00e9phan e Hallegatte, Strategies to adapt to an uncertain climate change , 19 GLOBAL ENVTL .

The aim is to keep as low as possible the cost of being wrong about future climate change.\"173 For example, re- strictive land u se planning can be a helpful but also changeable legal adaptation strategy, allowing development patterns to reflect evolving understanding of climate change impacts in a community.174 \"Third, there are 'safety margin' strategies that reduce vulnerabil- ity at null or low costs.\"175 Such strategies are often most relevant when communities or nations are investing in new infrastructure related to climate change impacts (for example, infrastructure to handle runoff or flooding), when building in additional capacity to handle the worst of expected impacts generally incurs relatively small marginal costs.176 Institutional strategies are a fourth form of adaptation strate- gies.177 These strategies, often referred to as \"soft\" and \"timing\" strat- egies, are usually flexible an d reversible, and they often take the form of ensuring that climate change risk assessment and planning occur more often and at different levels of governance (international, na- tional, local).178 However, institutional strategies can also be financial, such as through insurance laws or funding schemes to promote certain behaviors or investments.179 Finally, adaptation planning in the face of uncertainty requires that planners be cognizant of potential conflicts and synergies among adaptation strategies.180 \"For instance, an increased use of snow -mak- ing to compensate for shorter skiing seasons in mountain areas would have negative consequences for water availability and, e.g., agricul- ture.

The \"Preparedness\" Option: Early Warning Systems for Cholera Epidemics From a public health perspective, cholera surveillance a nd early warning systems clearly serve a public health preparedness function. Most obviously, a few extra months of warning that a cholera epidemic is likely would allow public health officials time to stockpile compo- nents for effective treatment \u2014antibioti cs, I.V. fluids, disinfectants, and so forth.182 Moreover, in light of improved vaccines,183 early warning systems could also allow many cases of cholera to be prevented. Notably, researchers working under both of the cholera etiology hypotheses are looking to develop an early warning system for chol- era. However, the proposed systems are completely different. As sev- eral researchers working under the local reservoir hypothesis empha- size, the importance of an environmental theory of cholera etiology is that it al lows scientists to develop predictive models, based on indica- tor environmental conditions, that in turn can provide warnings to public health officials regarding potential cholera outbreaks and epi- demics.184 Climatic events to be monitored for include El Nin o events,185 changes in the IOD,186 and more general environmental changes and climate change impacts.187 In contrast, the early warning system under the Asian origin hy- pothesis consists of increased genetic testing. Specifically, \"When a new cholera case appea rs, researchers can now sequence the bacterium to determine whether it belongs to the pandemic lineage from Asia. 181 Id. at 246. 182 See Donald G.

What remains to be sat- isfactorily articulated, however, is whether scientists and public health officials should pursue both approaches \u2014i.e., whether the two types of early warning are in fact complementary and synergistic rather than contradictory, especially with respect to the Bay of Bengal and the countries that surround it. Until that issue can be resolved, it is proba- bly worth pursuing both strategies, particularly in S outh Asia. Genetic composition is clearly relevant to cholera's infectious characteristics and lethality; nevertheless, again, nothing in the two new genomic studies directly undermines the importance of the environmental fac- tors to the emergence of choler a epidemics in South Asia \u2014epidemics, if the genomic studies are correct, that can then spread to the rest of the world. D. The \"No Regrets\" Option: Improve Drinking Water Access and Treatment and Sanitation According to the IPCC's 2014 report, climate change adaptation strategies for public health impact need to consider a variety of factors: The degree to which programs and measures will need modification to address additional pressures from climate change will depend on the current burden of i ll health; the effectiveness of current interventions; projections of where, when, and how the health burden could change with climate change; the feasibility of implementing additional pro- grams; other stressors that could increase or decrease resilience; and the social, economic, and political context for intervention.189 Despite this complexity, however, \"[t]he most effective measures to reduce vulnerability in the near term are programs that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provis ion of clean wa- ter and sanitation , secure essential health care including vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster preparedness and 188 Kupferschmidt, supra note 14 3 (based on an interview with Nicholas Thomson, a researcher at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, U.K.). 189 2014 IPCC ADAPTATION REPORT , supra note 1, at 733.

Priority interventions include improved management of the en- vironmental determinants of health ( such as provision of water and sanita- tion), infectious disease surveillance, and strengthening the resilience of health systems to extreme weather events.191 As cholera researchers have observed, \"Because infection results from ingesting contaminated water, cholera epidemics typically occur in regions with a limited or damaged infrastructure.\"192 Many of the studies discussed above noted that cholera no longer occurs with any frequency in the United States and other developed countries because these countries have safe drinking water and their citizens practice good sanitation and hygiene \u2014not because natural reservoirs of the V. cholerae bacterium are lacking.193 As WHO has emphasized repeatedly, improved sanitation and drinking water supplies are and should be the primary goal to address cholera.194 Invest ments in basic sanitation \u2014clean drinking water and human waste facilities \u2014are \"no regrets\" public health climate change adapta- tion strategies because such infrastructure provides multiple benefits.

According to WHO, in 2015: 2.3 billion people still do not have basic sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines. Of these, 892 million still defecate in the open, for example in street gutters, behind bushes or into open bodies of water. At least 10% of the world's population is thought to consume food irrigated by wastewater. Poor sanitation i s linked to transmission of dis- eases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepa- titis A, typhoid and polio. Inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 280 000 diarrhoeal deaths annually and is a major factor in several neglected tropical diseases, includi ng intes- tinal worms, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Poor sanitation also contributes to malnutrition.197 In addition, the number of people lacking basic sanitation is pro- jected to increase throughout the 21st century in concert with generally increasing popu lations, and various organizations project \"that about 1.4 billion people will be without access to basic sanitation in 2050.\"198 A large factor in nations' failure to invest in the \"no regrets\" op- tions of clean drinking water supply and waste sanitation is cost. In 2008, WHO calculated the cost of achieving the Millennium Develop- ment Goal for drinking water and sanitation \u2014i.e., \"to 'halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation'.\"199 It estimate d the total cost of new ser- vices over the implementation period of 2005 -2014 to be $42 billion 196 Id. 197 Fact Sheet: Sanitation , WORLD HEALTH ORG., (last updated July 2017), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs392/en/. 198 2014 IPCC ADAPTATION REPORT , supra note 1, at 720. 199 GUY HUTTON & JAMIE BARTRAM , REGIONAL AND GLOBAL COSTS OF ATTAINING THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION TARGET (2008), http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/econo mic/mdg_global_costing.pdf.

Moreover, countries should also be ensuring that any new invest- ment in drinking water and sanitation infrastructure includes a \"safety margin\" strategy that accounts for potentially worsening climate change impacts on water supplies and co ntaminating runoff. In places where drinking water supplies are becoming increasingly vulnerable or where extensive retrofitting may be required, however, this \"safety margin\" strategy could significantly increase the costs of implement- ing this first, best strategy for preventing water - and hygiene -related disease. E. The Prevention and Flexibility Option: The Cholera Vaccine Improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and internalized hy- giene practices are, everyone agrees, the long -term best investment for preventing cholera \u2014and would improve human health more gener- ally in a wide variety of ways. However, as noted, drinking water and sewage treatment infrastructure are expensive, requiring substantial governmental, international organization, or private com pany invest- ment to build. In addition, such infrastructure investment also often comes off as, well, prosaic. Boring. Far more exciting and newswor- thy\u2014and funding -attracting \u2014are new and effective treatments for an individual disease. Thus, for example, in February 2017, The New York Times waxed poetic about a new I.V. treatment protocol for cholera \"so effective that it saves 99.9 percent of all victims\" of the disease and the new \"effective cholera vaccine,\" enough of which may soon be stock- piled \"to begin routine vaccination is countries where the disease has a permanent foothold.\"202 \"The world finally has a vaccine that, with 200 Id. 201 Id. at 16. 202 McNeil, Jr., supra note 18 2.

What exactly that role should be, however, is an important public health and climate change adaptation planning question, the exact answer to which is likely to vary accord- ing to t he specific risks faced by and financial circumstances of indi- vidual nations and regions. In 2010, five different cholera vaccines existed: (1) Dukarol, an oral vaccine; (2) Shanchol, oral vaccine; (3) mORCVAX, an oral vaccine; (4) CVD 103 - HgR, an oral , live, attenuated single -dose vaccine that was not being produced at the time; and (5) an injectable vaccine pre- pared from strains of V. cholerae made inactive with phenol.205 In its 2010 position paper on these vaccines, WHO recommended against use of the injectable vaccine, \"mainly because of its limited efficacy and short duration of protection.\"206 With regard to the three oral cholera vaccines that remained in production in 2010, Swedish researchers developed Dukoral and first licensed it in 1991, with ov er 60 countries eventually approving the vaccine for use.207 Dukoral is used \"primarily as a vaccine for travelers to cholera -endemic areas. However, it has also been used in crisis sit- uations in Indonesia, Sudan and Uganda, and in a demonstration pro- ject in an endemic area of Mozambique.\"208 The vaccine is relatively safe to take and was \"tested in randomized placebo -controlled double - blind prelicensure efficacy trials in both Bangladesh and Peru\"209 as 203 Id. 204 Cholera vaccines , WORLD HEALTH ORG., http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/vaccines/en/ (last visited Jan. 23, 2018). 205 2010 WHO Cholera Vaccines Paper, supra note 33, at 120. 206 Id. at 121. 207 Id. 208 Id. 209 Id. at 122.

It takes effect immediately and also works to prevent cholera locally for two to three years, effectively bridging emergency response and longer -term cholera control . . . .\"243 Moreo- ver, the vaccine important not only medically but also psychologi- cally, \"help[ing] to dispel the notion that cholera is inevitable, thereby breaking the vicious cycle of inaction and defea tism, motivating na- tional governments and partners, and buying time to implement\" longer -term cholera control measures such as water supply and sani- tation infrastructure and hygiene practices.244 An issue remains, however: Are the cholera vaccines a permanen t solution to cholera? In 1997, \"Vietnam became the first \u2014and so far only\u2014country to provide cholera vaccine to its citizens routinely, not just in emergencies.\"245 Cholera incidence in Vietnam dropped sharply and disappeared from Hue in 2003.246 Nevertheless, almost all players on the international stage empha- size that cholera vaccines, at least in their current form, are an emer- gency, stop -gap, and/or transitional disease control strategy that tar- gets cholera only \u2014a short -term injection of prevention and flex ibility into cholera control intended to be supplanted by the longer -term and more broadly beneficial \"no regrets\" measures of clean drinking water supplies and effective sanitation. Thus, the International Coordinating Group emphasizes that: The main obje ctive of the oral cholera vaccine stockpile is to ensure the timely and targeted deployment of vaccine as part of an effective out- break response. While vaccines provide a short -term effect as an imme- diate intervention to a potential cholera outbreak, expan ding access to improved drinking -water sources and sanitation is a longer term solu- tion for most waterborne diseases, including cholera.247 Similarly, WHO maintains that \"[i]n the long term, improvements in water supply, sanitation, food safety and community awareness of 243 Id. 244 Id. 245 McNeil, supra note 18 2. 246 Id. 247 2010 WHO Cholera Vaccines Paper, supra note 33.

The Ultimate Prevention Strategy: Can We \u2014and Should We\u2014Try to Eliminate Epidemic and Pandemic Cholera at the Source? The two 2017 Asian -origin pa pers in Science prompted sugges- tions that the scientific and public health communities should engage in intensive efforts in South and East Asia to eliminate the epidemic and pandemic forms of cholera at their source. One news story, for in- stance, emphasized that \"the [g enomic] research . . . highlights the of eliminating natural pandemic V. cholerae in Asia . . . . Something in the region allows new strains to evolve and spread across the world, and scientists aren't sure what it is.\"249 As with th e early warning systems, the proposed strategy of hunt- ing down the source of epidemic and pandemic strains of cholera in Asia, particularly South Asia, underscores the need for scientists and public health researchers to further elucidate the exact relatio nship be- tween the local reservoir hypothesis and the Asian origin hypothesis in Bay of Bengal countries. Could it be that something in the Bay of Bengal, combined with concentrated populations in India and Bangla- desh, is a laboratory for cholera pandemics? In the meantime, however, many countries need to weigh the costs of a potential cholera eradication program \u2014a disease -specific strat- egy\u2014against the potentially lost opportunity to invest in climate -resil- ient drinking water and sanitation infrastructure an d the plethora of public health benefits that they bring. If this is the ultimate choice that many poor and developing nations face, then the remaining uncertain- ties surrounding cholera etiology and the many co -benefits of climate - resilience water and sani tation facilities should weigh strongly in favor of the infrastructure investments. 248 Cholera vaccines, supra note 204. 249 Kupferschmidt, supra note 14 3. CRAIG - FINAL WORD (DO NOT DELETE ) 11/19/2018 2:56 PM ROBIN KUNDIS CRAIG 75 CONCLUSION Climate change is already having, and will continue to have for the foreseeable future, impacts on human health. Given limited re- sources, both public health norm s and strategies for dealing with un- certainty counsel in favor of investment in adaptation strategies that provide broad preparedness and prevention advantages, allow for ad- ditional improvements to human quality of life, fulfill human rights such as the ri ght to life and right to water, and help to reduce existing inequalities among populations, including inequalities regarding who bears global health burdens. For all of these reasons, the scientific debate over cholera epidemic etiology probably should not , at least for the moment, induce the global health community to re -think its basic approach to cholera dis- ease control. Increased investment in climate -resilient drinking water supplies and sanitation facilities remains a \"no regrets,\" multiple -ben- efit pu blic health climate change adaptation strategy and should re- main a first priority for preventing water -related disease. Where chol- era vaccines can bridge a public health transition to such infrastructure or prevent the worst scourges of an epidemic, they b ecome a helpful supplemental strategy for achieving the primary goal. The dream of eradicating cholera epidemics and pandemics cre- ates a compelling vision of public health heroism, of science triumph- ing over another of humanity's microscopic enemies. Howev er, in terms of allocating resources, it should always be remembered that clean drinking water and good sanitation facilities are also very effec- tive at preventing cholera infections during epidemics and pandem- ics\u2014and that, in addition, they can prevent en demic cholera infection, a host of other water -borne diseases, and water -based exposure to tox- ins, which an Asian eradication strategy would not. At least in this in- stance, therefore, the prosaic public health adaptation strategy should win. "}
