The \u00d6zbudak Lab is looking for a postdoctoral fellow interested in combining interdisciplinary approaches to discover systems -level mechanisms governing spatiotemporal pattern formation during embryonic development. Embryos develop spatiotemporal patterns by encoding and interpreting biological signals in real time. Despite unavoidable fluctuations in gene expression, embryonic development is robust and reproducible, which necessitates several mechanisms buffering stochastic gene expression. A striking example of robust spatiotemporal patterning is the rhythmic segmentation of somites, which are precursors of the vertebral column. Segmentation of somites is controlled by 1) oscillatory expression of Hes/Her gene family, known as the vertebrate segmentation clock, 2) short -distance Notch signaling, 3) long-distance Fgf, Wnt, and Retinoic Acid signaling gradients and 4) a network of transcription factors integrating outputs of the segmentation clock and the signaling pathways. Errors in this regulatory cascade result in various birth defects, including congenital scoliosis. We combine single-cell microscopy measurements, time biophysical modeling, and computational simulations to decipher the mechanism underlying robust spatiotemporal pattern formation and cell fate determination.

The ideal candidate should possess strong laborat ory and analytical skills & have a record of peer -reviewed publications. Contact: Ronald Panganiban 142050. Dr. Way's Laboratory in the Division of Infectious Diseases has two immediate openings for a Research Fellow and a Research Associate (3+ years of post doc experience) to perform basic research on host s ensing of commensal -pathobiont microbes; and how these interacts shape host immunity systemically and in mucosal barrier tissues. Another focus of the laboratory is reproductive and developmental biology, and integration of concepts in immunological tolerance rel ated to commensal microbes to m aternal -fetal tolerance and/or developmental shifts in how commensal tolerance to achieved are areas of active investigation. Dr. Way's laboratory has been at the leading edge of these scientific areas for the past 10 years with seminar publications in Nature, Cell and Science. Contact: Sing Sing Way, MD, PhD Email Address: Singsing.Way@cchmc.org Research Fellow Job Number: 141781. Dr. David Hildeman is currently seeking a full -time Post -Doctoral Research Fellow with a Ph.D. in Immunology. The Hildeman Lab's research focuses on the homeostasis and function of lymphocytes in health and disease, with a particular focus on transplant rejection. The lab works closely with adult and pediatric clinicians to analyze mechanisms underlying the acceptance and rejection of human allografts. The research team integrates clinical, translational, immunologic, bioinformatics, and multi - omics approaches to define the cellular and molecular landscape of human allografts. The long-term goal is to identify mechanisms th at underlie allograft injury and to foster the development of breakthrough therapeutics that enable life-long graft acceptance and durability. The position is open immediately for a motivated and detail -oriented individual with a strong interest in developing projects related to cellular mechanisms involved in transplant rejection. The candidate should have a strong background and interest in allo- or auto- immunity, possess knowledge and experience in bioinformatics, have strong oral and written communicati on skills, be able to sustain diverse activities simultaneously, have outstanding organizational skills, and be able to develop innovative approaches to solving experimental challenges. The ideal candidate should be innately motivated, dependable, detail -oriented, energetic, and have a positive attitude toward research. The preferred candidate will be team player willing to learn on the job and collaborate with the lab and division members. They will also work to ensure the highest quality of laboratory research support and have good communication skills with co- workers, the clinical team, PIs, research staff, students, and other support services.
