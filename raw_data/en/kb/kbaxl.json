The complication of this disease is peripheral neuropathy exacerbated by bacterial infection, causing ulcers (sores) on the feet, hands, knees, back, and other parts of the body. The mangosteen plant (Garcinia mangostana) is empirically believed to have antidiabetic and cure diabetic ulcers. This study aims to compare the antibacterial activity of extracts and fractions of methanol extract of mangosteen leaves at concentrations of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% against the bacteria causing diabetic ulcers in vitro. The research began with the maceration of mangosteen leaf powder extraction using methanol as a solvent. The fractions were obtained by the vacuum liquid chromatography (KCV) method. The bacteria that cause diabetic ulcers are obtained from ulcer specimens of diabetic ulcer patients. Antibacterial activity of extracts and fractions at 5 concentration series was tested using the disc diffusion method with 10% DMSO negative control and positive Gentamycin, Erythromycin, and Doxycycline. Antibacterial expressed by the large area of the inhibition zone on the media inoculated with ulcer bacteria and incubated for 24 hours at 370 C. The results showed that there were 5 dominant bacteria found in the diabetic ulcer specimens, namely Escherichia results of the antibacterial sensitivity test showed that ciprofloxacin had the largest area of inhibition zone compared to Ampicillin, Cefotaxime, Gentamycin, Erythromycin, and Doxycycline so that Ciprofloxacin could be used as a positive control.

The 15-17 years is the age group when adolescents start dating. Teenage dating activities lead to sexual behavior, such as holding hands, hugging, kissing lips, touching sensitive parts, and having sex. This study aims to determine the influence of the background characteristics of adolescents (age, area of residence, level of education) and social patterns (having friends having premarital sex, having the urge because of friends, influencing friends to have premarital sex, considering virginity important) on the incidence of premarital sex in Central Kalimantan 2017. Secondary data were obtained from the 2017 IDHS survey. Data analysis was performed by univariate, bivariate (Spearman rho test), and multivariate (logistic regression test). The results showed that 88% of respondents had sexual behavior orientation, and 12% did not. The correlation analysis explains a significant relationship between premarital sexual behavior and the area of residence. Respondents who live in cities are 3.47 times more likely to commit premarital sexual behavior (<0,05 = 0,021; OR = 3.47). In addition, there is sufficient evidence to suggest a relationship between premarital sexual behavior and education level, respondents who attend high school and above are 2.71 times more likely to have premarital sexual behavior (<0,10 = 0,066; OR = 2.71). Meanwhile, other variables from background characteristics and social patterns have no significant relationship/do not influence premarital sexual behavior. So it can be concluded that the background characteristics in the area of residence (Sig Wald <0.0) have a significant partial effect on adolescents' incidence of premarital sexual behavior in Central Kalimantan.Institute for Research and Community Gracia VictoriaLekatompessy, Claudya ANendissa, Adriana RitjePersonal Protective EquipmentFarmersFarmers in the processing of land and plants need pesticides to eradicate pests and weeds.
