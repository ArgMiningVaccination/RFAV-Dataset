Many people living with spinal muscular atrophy still have questions about the COVID-19 vaccines, so mySMAteam invited Dr. Jonathan Strober to speak with us about this topic. Dr. Strober is a specialist in childhood disorders of the nerves and muscles. He directs the [ Neuromuscular Clinic at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital](https://kids.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/clinics/neuromuscular-program). It is definitely different from the first two that came out. The first two are based on something called messenger RNA, or mRNA, which is the final part of the genetic process for making proteins. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is based on a different way of getting genetic material into cells to make a viral protein, so we can produce an immune reaction against it. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine definitely seems to be effective. The numbers were not as good as the other two vaccines, which were about 94 percent effective in preventing any level of infection in clinical trials. But the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is still 74 percent, which is great. They all work well in preventing severe infection and hospitalizations, which are the most important things. We've always encouraged our patients with SMA to get fully vaccinated with all the vaccines that we have. It is a different type of vaccine for sure, but there's nothing in the technology that would suggest it would work differently in someone with SMA than someone without SMA. We know that people with SMA are extremely high-risk for having severe complications and hospitalizations from COVID-19. The vaccine is just causing an immune reaction, not the symptoms and complications you can get from COVID-19. There's no reason to believe the vaccines should be a danger to anyone, or to people with SMA specifically. For [ Spinraza](https://www.mysmateam.com/treatments/spinraza) or [ Evrysdi](https://www.mysmateam.com/treatments/evrysdi), or even [ Zolgensma](https://www.mysmateam.com/treatments/zolgensma), there's no reason to believe that the vaccine is going to interact with the medication at all. SMA therapies only interact with the specific gene that is involved in SMA. When you initially get treated with Zolgensma, you need to go on steroids to prevent an immune reaction to the therapy. The steroids would prevent a lot of the reaction to the spike protein in the mRNA vaccines and make it less effective. However in this country, we can only give Zolgensma to kids who are less than 2 years of age, who wouldn't be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccines. It is probably best to not get the vaccine soon after getting a treatment with Spinraza to make sure that if you do get side effects, you know it's from the vaccine and not from Spinraza. It would also be best to wait at least two weeks after starting Evrysdi for the same reason. The mRNA in these vaccines does not get into your genes. It actually gets degraded or broken down pretty quickly. Yes, all caretakers should definitely be vaccinated. All eligible people with any neuromuscular disease or any other severe disorders that can be affected by COVID-19 should be vaccinated. Like many other centers for SMA care, we have a letter that can be given to caretakers to make them eligible to join a list for vaccines, even if they don't have a preexisting condition. We do not have any of that data. Both mRNA vaccines seem to be about the same efficacy for healthy people, so that's a good start. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is almost as effective, and all have been found to be safe in healthy people. Now that people with different health conditions are starting to get vaccinated, we'll get more information about comparative safety and efficacy in different conditions. No. Currently, you have to be at least 16 or 18, depending on the vaccine. I know Pfizer and Moderna are already looking at clinical trials of the vaccines in younger kids. But it will be a while before we get there. The vaccines were studied with just two doses. It's possible that one dose may be effective, but on the other hand, if you can go from a 74 percent rate of effectiveness \u2014 which is what the data appears to show for these two vaccines after one dose \u2014 to 94 percent, I would probably go for 94 percent effectiveness. To me, that makes the most sense. As long as you have some muscle cells there, it should not be a problem at all. And it doesn't have to be a muscle cell \u2014 any cell can actually take the mRNA and make the viral protein. I don't have any concerns at all. These are not new technologies, which is why we were able to get this done so fast. That's the beauty of doing things genetically these days. We can use this for a lot of things. There's definitely no connection between the two. There's no reason to think that any patients who have side effects to the flu vaccine would have the same side effects with Moderna, or Pfizer, or even Johnson & Johnson. The longer you wait, the higher chance you have of getting the infection. If you don't leave your house, you trust everyone who comes in to take care of you or visits you, and you don't mind staying in that situation during the pandemic, that's one way of preventing the virus. But if you want to get out there, have people come over, and expand your bubble a little bit, the vaccine is another way to make sure your chances are almost zero of getting COVID-19. The most important thing to know is that they're pretty safe. They've been given now to millions of people, and we know that they're working, and we know that they're safe. Now that we're dealing with real-world numbers \u2014 not just the 30,000 in each trial \u2014 the risk of a significant complication seems to be very low getting the vaccine versus the known risks of getting COVID, especially if you have a health condition.
