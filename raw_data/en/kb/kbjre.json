UM- KECC has developed a model payment s y stem that is described in this report. A. BUNDLE OF SERVICES To test the feasibility of developing and implementing a prospective payment system that encompasses the entire bundle of outpatient ESRD di alysis services, a specific bundle of services was selected in consultation with CMS as the basis of most of the analyses. The bundle definition employed includes services that are currently reim bursed through the composite rate system and the following types of services that were billed separately by either dialysis facilities or other providers on Medicare claims: Injectable drugs billed by di alysis facilities (including erythropoiesis stimulating agents , iron, vitamin D analogs, commonly used parenteral antibiotics, alteplase) Laboratory services o Billed by freestanding laboratory suppliers and ordered by physicians that received monthly capitation payments for treating ESRD patients, or o Billed by the dialysis facilities Other services billed by dialysis facilities (e.g. dialysis supplies) B. DATA SOURCES The descriptive statistics, case-mix models and othe r analyses used in this report are based primarily on CMS claims files for Medicare dialysis patients and the Medicare Cost Reports for dialysis facilities. Resource utilization for separately billab le services was based on patient level Medicare outpatient claims for the years 2001-2005. Since composite rate cost information is available only at the facility level, resource utilizati on for composite rate services was measured using the Independent Renal Dialysis Facility Cost Reports and Hospital Cost Reports. The most complete current annual cost report data were availa ble through 2004. Case-mix models fo r both separately billable items and composite rate costs, which are described in deta il in this report, use Medicare claims and Cost Reports for the years 2002-2004. Several data sources were used to measure patient and facility characteristics. These data sources include the Medicare Enrollment Database and the CMS Medical Evidence Form (CMS Form 2728), which is completed at onset of renal replacement therapy. Patient body size measures were derived from the height and weight values reported on CMS Form 2728. Patient comorbidities were measured using a combination of CMS Form 2728 and diagnoses reported on Medicare claims. The claims diagnoses were used both to identify comorbidities that were not abstracted using CMS Form 2728 and to capture changes in pati ent condition since the start of renal replacement therapy. Dialysis facility characteristics were measured using a combination of the ESRD Standard Information Management System (ownership type and geographic location), the Medicare Cost University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 1 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle Reports (facility size), the Online Survey and Certif ication and Reporting Syst em (hospital affiliation for satellite units) and other info rmation obtained from CMS (compo site rate payment exceptions). C. STRUCTURE OF CASE-MIX MODELS As noted above, the level at which resource use can be measured differs for the two principal components of an expanded bundle. Given the available patient level data on resource use for separately billable services and facility level data on resource use for composite rate services, a modeling approach could be based on either one or two estimating equations: Two equation approach: Facility level model for composite rate services and patient level model for separately billable services One equation approach: Facility level combined model for composite rate and separately billable services By utilizing patient to patient variation in both case -mix and resource use, a patient level model for separately billable services has the advantage of reducing potential bias related to unobserved facility characteristics, producing more precise coeffici ent estimates and yielding greater stability in coefficient estimates over time. Further, a patient level model for separately billable services can be combined with a facility level model for composite rate se rvices to yield a single payment model for an expanded bundle. A two equation modeling appr oach was therefore used in examining potential risk adjusters for use with an ex panded prospective payment system. D. CASE-MIX VARIABLES Evaluation of patient characteristics for use as case -mix variables in the models began with the CMS Form 2728 comorbidities, demogr aphics, and anthropo metrics to which pr eviously defined comorbidity categories developed for the Medicare Advantage managed care project were added. Patient characteristics were considered for incl usion in our models based on the magnitude and statistical significance of relationship to cost (composite rate costs and dialysis separately billable Medicare Allowable Payments), the potential for adverse incentives, and social acceptability. Whenever possible, the list of potential case-mix vari ables identified as having statistically significant associations with cost was refined by combination of clinically similar comorb idity categories having similar effect on cost. Several patient comorbidities having statistically si gnificant, low magnitude association with cost in our preliminary models and additional comorbidities with ambiguous definition, high prevalence, or both, were excluded to facilitate development of a parsimonious case- mix model. The refined list of case-mix comorbidities were evaluated for persistence of effect on cost. These analyses allowed identification of ac ute or short-lived cost associations for some case- mix categories and chronic or long-lived cost asso ciations for others. Time-specific case-mix variable definitions were used in the models reported in Table A below and in the body of this report. E. CASE-MIX ADJUSTED MODELS The table below illustrates the potential case-mix adjusters, their estimated multipliers based on a two equation approach, and a single payment multiplier for each pati ent characteristic based on its relationship to resource use for both composite rate and separately billable services.

The payment multipliers in the t hird column of Table A (Mult EB) were calculated as the weighted average of the composite rate and separately billab le multipliers. The weights that were used reflect each component's proportion of the total estimated costs, so that the resulting case-mix adjustment reflects the overall relationships between patient characteristics and estimated costs for an expanded bundle of services. The payment multipliers reported in Chapter IX, A Combined Case-mix Adjusted Model for Composite Rate and Separately Billable Services, can be used to derive case-mix adjusted payment rates for individual patients. The principal step is to calculate a patient specific multiplier. The patient multiplier is then applied to a wage-adjusted base rate to calculate the per session payment. If additional payment adjustments are needed to account for outliers, they are made once the per University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 3 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 4 - session rate has been determined.1 Given the limited ability of pa tient characteristics to explain differences in cost across patients and facilities, exploration of an outlier payment mechanism may be advisable. One possible mechanism pays facilities a fraction of their costs for injectable medications and laboratory tests to the extent that those co sts exceed a threshold. Less than 1% of total payments to dialysis facilities wo uld be devoted to this hypothetic al outlier payment system, and it would result in a meaningful decrease in the risk to facilities' revenues due to very high cost patients. Examples of the application of this modeling approach and outlier mechanism can be seen in Chapter XI, Hypothetical Examples of Case-mix Adjusted Payment Calculation. F . IMPACT ANALYSIS Figure 1 shows the distribution of current measured costs, current payments, and modeled payments per dialysis session. The variation in modeled payments is much lower than the variation in measured costs and current payments. This reduct ion is due to the current bundling of composite rate services and the substantially lower variation in composite payment rates compared to costs across facilities. The variation in the modeled payments is also lower than the variation in the current payments. Most of this reduction is explaine d by expanding the payment bundle to include separately billable services inst ead of reimbursing facilities separa tely. These comparisons reflect differences among measured costs, current paym ents, and modeled payments, not the fit of the statistical models. 1 Another budget neutrality adjustment is necessary to reflect th e fact that the average patient multiplier adjustment is larger than 1 or for potential outlier adjustments for very high cost patients.

Facility control variable s accounted for 31 percent of the variation, while the included patient characteristics contributed an additional 3 percentage points to the R-squared. Figure 2 shows the average change in the per session payments to different types of dialysis facilities. The overall average change is constrained to be zero. In other words, bot h systems use the same number of facilities, the same number of dialysis sessions, and the same to tal dollars. Each facility type has an average change of less than 6%, except for the small groups of facilities in Alaska (4 facilities, represented by 6 facility-years) and th ose currently receiving co mposite rate exception payments as isolated essential facilities (4 facilities, represented by 10 facility-years).

Urban facilities, freestanding facilities, facilities with fewer than 5,000 sessions per year, facilities owned independently, facilities owned by a region al chain, facilities wi th unknown ownership, facilities designated as isolated e ssential facilities, and facilities that provide a relatively large amount of peritoneal dialysis tend to have higher payments in the model system compared to the current system. On the other hand , rural facilities, facilities with at least 5,000 sessions per year, facilities owned by a large dialysis organization, facilities no t designated as isolated essential facilities, and facilities that provide little or no peritoneal dialysis tend to have lower payments in the model system compared to the current system. Hospital based fa cilities also receive a $3.89 lower payment under the model system, assuming the current $4 payment differential between hospital based and freestanding facilities built into the comp osite rate system does not continue. Facilities in the East North Cent ral, East South Central, South Atlantic, and West South Central census regions tend to have lower payments in the model system when compared to the current system.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES A key policy decision is whether to pay facilities pe r dialysis session or per month. This report presents an analysis of the merits of both units of payment, as well as methods of implementing both. A monthly payment system has a conceptual advantage of enhancing flexibility in treatment schedules, but introduces additional complications involving accounting for partial months of outpatient dialysis (e.g., mo nths of hospitalization) and for patien ts treated at multiple facilities (e.g., patients who switch facilities, or receive transient treatments while traveling). Other issues regarding the implementation of case-mix adjusted payments for an expanded bundle include increased data reporting requirements and contracting between services providers. Continued reporting of key utilization and outcome me asures should be required to facilitate quality monitoring and evaluating and updating the proposed payment system. Attention should focus on the regulatory specification of definitions and reporting guidelines for the patient comorbidities used as payment adjusters. A payment system including an expanded bundle of services changes the incentives facing dialysis providers. This report discusse s incentives and provides some su ggestions for managing incentives, including quality monitoring and pay-for-performance systems. The construction of the potential payment model has attempted to account for the potential for adverse incentives (e.g., over-reporting of nebulously defined comorbidities, indirectly rewarding providers for poor outcomes), but care should be taken to continue monitoring for adverse incentives, and to revise the payment model as necessary. H. CONCLUSION Building an expanded prospective payment system for renal dialysis-related services is possible given existing CMS data. A case-mix adjustment model is also feasible using existing data. Development of an outlier payment mechanism should be consid ered to ensure that those patients who require extraordinary resources to achieve appropriate clinical outcomes are not disadvantaged by the payment system. In addition, the model presented in this report should not be applied to pediatric patients. Several implementation challenges exist, and, following implementation, ongoing monitoring of comorbidity reporting, provider costs, access to care, quality of care, and new technologies is crucial. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 7 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle I. INTRODUCTION The Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA-2003) (1 ) required both the developme nt and implementation of a basic case-mix adjustment for the composite rate payment system for outpatient dialysis an d the design and demonstration of a fully case-mix adjusted bundled ESRD payment system. The Centers for Medicare an d Medicaid Services (CMS) contracted with the University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center (UM-KECC) to examine potential case-mix adjustments for composite rate payments that consist of a \"limited number of patient characteristics\" in accordance with the MMA 2003. A methodology to apply a basic case-mix adjustment to composite rate payments was developed, and wa s implemented on April 1, 2005 ( 2). In additio n to the short term basic case-mix adjustment to the existing bundle of composite rate services, the statute requires a Report to Congress that delineates the elements and features for the design and implementation of a fully bundled ESRD prospective payment system (PPS). This report is in support of that Report to Congress. The methods and elements examined in this report may also serve as the basis for the mandated three-year demonstration of a fully case-mix adjusted bundled ESRD PPS. A. PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT The purpose of this report is to describe legislative and administrative options for design of a fully bundled ESRD PPS that encompasses the entire bundle of outpatient ESRD dialysis services, excluding vascular access, furnished to Medicare be neficiaries. The report is based on work by CMS's Center for Medicare Management and by it s contractor, UM-KECC. This report builds on research that has been conducted in several phases over the period 2001-2007. Ea rlier phases of this research explored the feasibility of using availa ble data to develop a fully bundled ESRD PPS ( 3,4,5) and supp orte d the development and evaluation of a basic case-mix adjustment for the composite rate system ( 6,7,8,9). Recent work has examined factors that affect the cost of outpatient ESRD services to sup por t the development of case-mix adjustment methods for a fully bundled ESRD PPS (10,11 ,12,13,14). The overall goal of this multi-phase project is to suggest and develop improvem ents to the current Medicare paym ent policy for outpatient ESRD care. In the broadest terms, the objectives for a revised dialysis payment system are to promote the delivery of high quality dialysis related services, economic efficiency in the delivery of these services, and sufficient reimbursement to health care provider s to ensure that an efficient provider can deliver high quality services. Accomplishing these some times conflicting objectives requires a careful analysis of the workings and shortcomings of the existing payment system, an analysis of how well existing data are able to inform decisions about th e costs incurred by an efficient provider delivering high quality services, and analyses of the relationshi ps between dialysis modality, case-mix, and costs. These analyses are required to devise a system th at ensures access to quality care for more complex patients and ensures equitabl e reimbursement to those fa cilities that serve them. Currently, the Medicare ESRD system provides re imbursement for selected outpatient dialysis services under a prospective comp osite rate payment system ($4. 8 billion in 2005), while providing reimbursement for other separately billed outpatient ESRD services through a fee-for-service system ($3.1 billion in 2005). Broadening the bundle of se rvices included in the co mposite rate can simplify the billing process and remove incentives for excessive use of sepa rately billable services. However, broadening the bundle necessitates increased attention to quality assurance measures to ensure that University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 8 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle the expanded outpatient ESRD PPS do es not result in an inappropriate reduction in the use of some services that were formerly billed separately (e.g., er ythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs)). Further, case-mix adjustments may be import ant in designing equitable reimbursement levels for dialysis providers. Finally, a broader bundle makes facility revenues more predicta ble, but also places facilities at risk for the costs of providing a wider array of services to a variety of patients. If the risks are substantial, particularly for sma ll, independent facilities who cannot allocate the risk of unusually costly outliers over many patients, a mechanism to incorporate outlier payments into an expanded outpatient ESRD PPS might be warranted. The information presented will he lp determine the feasibility of an expanded ESRD PPS which reflects the costs of appropriate treatment for patients with different clinical characteristics and includes all outpatient dialysis services, drugs, laboratory services, and supplies. II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PROGRAM DESIGN The key issue in defining a bundle of services to be paid prospectively is to ensure the creation of incentives for the efficient delivery of high quality care and to avoid incentives for inappropriate or inefficient actions by providers. The decision about any set of servic es included or excluded from a bundle definition necessarily involves balancin g competing objectives. For example, including a broad set of services in a bundle creates desirable incentives for efficiency but may require a system to monitor use of services or the concurrent implementation of pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives to avoid undesirable limitations to care. Before we present data analyses in subsequent sections of this report, conceptu al issues are considered here. A. BREADTH OF SERVICE BUNDLE The first consideration is the breadth of bundled serv ices in two crucial and interrelated dimensions: 1) the clinical indication for which the service is used, and 2) which provid ers order and deliver the service. In terms of clinical indication, the narrowest bundle definition incorporates only services directly related to the delivery of dialysis sessions. Such a definition, which closely approximates the existing composite rate bundle, ex cludes care for other conditions (e.g., anemia) even if they are closely associated with ESRD. Broader definitions include conditions that are very common in ESRD patients and the broadest definitions bundle services for the treatment of a wide variety of non-ESRD comorbidities. At the extreme, full capitation would pay the dialysis unit, a physician, or some other provider to take responsibility for delivery or financing all of the patient's medical care, regardless of the clinical indication. Note that as th e list of clinical indications and related services is expanded, the question arises as to which provider is the most appropriate locus for the bundled payment and hence the management of care. In the case of the narrow bundle definition, with focuses on direct dialysis sessions, the recipient of the bundled payment is most certainly the dialysis unit. Broader definitions of the bundle make it possible to consider a nephrologist or other physician, or perhaps another type of provider or health care financing organization (e.g., insurer, managed care plan) as the recipient of the bundled payment and therefore the manager of the care. In terms of providers, the narrowest bundle definiti on includes only services delivered in the dialysis unit. With this definition the dialysis unit is not responsible for any services delivered elsewhere. A slightly broader definition includes services routinely ordered by the nephrologist who receives the University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 9 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle Medicare monthly capitation payment for the patient's dialysis related, outpatient care, even if those services are performed outside the dialysis unit (e.g., laboratory tests). A yet broader bundle definition adds more services performed in the dialysis unit, but not directly or routinely related to the dialysis session itself or to the care of main ly ESRD related services, and additional services provided elsewhere in the health care system (e.g., imaging or procedures related to vascular access). When a service is included in the bundle, an additi onal decision must be made as to how a bill for that service submitted by a provider other than the di alysis unit should be handled. One option is to define the service as part of the ESRD bundle, regardless of where it is provided. This option effectively disallows billing by other providers and requires payment arrangements between the dialysis facility and other providers. A second opti on is to prohibit separate billing by dialysis units for a given service in the bundle, but to continue to pay claims from other providers. Disallowing billing by other providers results in greater administ rative complexity for the dialysis units who have to manage the prospective payment and places dialysis units at risk of being held responsible for services for which they have little control. In addition, patient access to needed care could be inappropriately restricted. However, to allow b illing from other providers places CMS at risk of paying twice for the same services if dialysis un its collect the prospective payment that presumably includes specified services while arranging for othe r providers to actually de liver and bill for them. Similarly, to allow other providers to bill separately places patients at risk of receiving fragmented, uncoordinated care. Hence, some of the most difficult decisions of bundle design involve services that are often prescribed by dialysis units for ES RD related purposes, but are also prescribed by other providers in the community for non-ESRD related purposes. A second consideration is the existing pattern of utiliz ation by renal dialysis pa tients. A service is an ideal candidate for bundling if it is widely used at consistent frequencies in the ESRD population. For example, a laboratory test performed on every pati ent on a fixed quarterly time interval could be paid prospectively without creating any risk for the provider and saving the administrative costs of submitting and processing four annual claim line items. However, services that are used inconsistently, either in terms of the percentage of patients who use them or in terms of the frequency of use among those patients who receive them, should not necessarily be excluded from the bundle. Many of the objectives of bundling ar e best achieved by including a broad range of services. Therefore, a supportable working assumption is that dialysis services should be included in the bundle unless there are strong grounds for thei r exclusion. Inclusion of services should be strongly considered if at least one of two criteria is met. The first is concern that services are being overused for some patients or by some providers. The change in incentives from the existing fee-for- service (FFS) billing to a prospective system may encourage efficiency and allow payments to be reduced. Second, even if service use varies acro ss patients in a way consistent with appropriate clinical care, the service could be bundled if the financial risk to providers is limited and case-mix adjustments to the prospective payment system are developed to sufficient ly limit the risk to providers and creates incentives to treat patients whose care is more costly than average. Consequent to these concerns, metrics to assess the risk faced by providers under alternative bundle definitions and alternative case-mix adjustment systems are being develo ped and assessed by UM- KECC. The most important of such metrics is the distribution of gains and losses under a hypothetical budget neutral, bundled payment system relative to the existing FFS system. In order to assess the ability of payment systems to account for the risk of patients who are more costly than average, gains and losses are calculated at several levels of aggregation, which include the patient month, the patient year, and the facility year. These conceptual consider ations will be made operational through analysis of data on utilization patterns in the historical Medicare claims. Effectiv ely, using historical data to forecast the cost of services included in a bundle relies on the strong assumption that costs under a prospective, bundled University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 10 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle payment system will remain similar to those in th e historical FFS system. This assumption may be violated due to the time lag in the availability of complete claims files, which implies that recent trends in utilization patterns will not be reflected in the available data. Similarly, changes in the payment system (e.g., the new method of pricing injectable medications implemented by CMS on January 1, 2005) and subsequent changes in utilizati on would not be reflected in pre-2005 data. Such payment changes could be simulated using the historical data. Perhaps more importantly, the assumption would be violated if, as expected, prov iders reduce utilization below historical rates in response to the incentives created by prospective pa yment. The extent of such changes in behavior would be difficult to forecast. An alternative approach may help address these limitations, at the cost of being less well-grounded in broad, national claims data. Expert opinion could be sought to determine the level of services that would constitute good quality of care. For example, care prescribed in order to comply with widely accepted clinical guidelines (e.g., KDOQI) or ther apy targets (e.g., anemia ma nagement criteria) could be assessed. To base payments on historical claims data (vs. expert opinion on clinically appropriate care) has several advantages and disadvantages. Historical usage can readily be determined with Medicare claims data and may appropriately reflect a mix of practice patterns where patient needs vary or clinical guidelines are no t well established. However, historical usage may not reflect current practice or represent clinically ideal care, and data for services not currently covered by Medicare are not available. Measures based on expert opinion of clinically appropriate care also have several pros and cons. Clinical guidelines which define best practice re commendations for the care of chronic dialysis patients are available from diverse sources. Thes e guidelines include practice guidelines from USA based organizations as well as several international ef forts. Most utilize stan dardized literature review by medical expert panels to define practice guidelines based on consensus expert opinion, although at least one source of practice pattern information comes from an ongoing international, prospective, observational study (Dialysis Outcomes and Practi ce Patterns Study (DOPPS)). Although there is substantive agreement among these various guidelines, differences remain. Some of these differences likely relate to the varied reimbursement policies, political and cultural variation and differences in patient population and comorbid condition distribution from country to country. Additionally, many best practice recommendations have been made without adequate evidentiary support, given the lack of adequate clinical trials in many areas. Ex pert opinion could be used to establish adequate reimbursement for ideal care if even the ideal is no t reflected by current practice or available evidence in the medical literature. However, such an appr oach may include services that are not currently covered by Medicare, may not be budget neutral, and may result in practices ultimately shown to be ineffective as data from ongoing and future research becomes available. B. BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES CREATED BY BUNDLING Any change in the method by which dialysis units ar e paid will affect their incentives in terms of care delivery and patient selection. As a practical matter, several types of behavioral responses should be considered, with appropriate monitoring and data collection to assess their magnitudes and ensure access to care and the delivery of appropriate servi ces to the dialysis population. Substitution of services excluded from the bundle for those included is one behavioral response. For example, if only one antibiotic that could be used to treat a sp ecific type of infection is included, providers would have a strong incentive to circumvent the intent of bundling by substituting an alternative antibiotic that could still be billed separately from the bundle . Consequently, when several services or drugs are close clinical substitutes, it is advisable to include a ll or none in the bundle. In many cases, the set of close substitutes can readily be identified (e.g., all antibiotics in a particular drug class for the University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 11 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle treatment of a specified type of infection; EPO, iron and blood transfusions for the treatment of anemia). In other cases, it may be more difficult to specify the set of substitutes (e.g., laboratory tests performed for a variety of indications). Similarly, involvement of multiple providers has the potential to create administrative burdens and risks. Even a nephrologist caring for a unit's pati ents is not under the control of the unit. However, unit wide protocols for high cost care such as anemia management developed in conjunction with the medical director, other nephrologists, and nursing staff are likely to influence physician practice and/or limit physician autonomy, thereby limiting the risk that units will be held financially responsible for decisions they can no t control. Services provided outside the dialysis facility and ordered by physicians other than the nephrologist are likely to pose greater risks that the unit will be held financially accountable for clinical decisions pa rtially or totally outside their control. Certain services currently provided by dialysis units, but not essential to the core of ESRD related care, might by offloaded to other providers in the community if they remain separately billable by other providers. In particular, the dialysis unit might now serve as a collection point for specimens needed for laboratory testing for a variety of conditions. Patients benefit from such a practice both in terms of convenience and because it may preserve vascular access sites by protecting them from unnecessary venipuncture. In such cases, it may be advisable to continue to allow separate billing to avoid creating an incentive to take services out of the unit. C. SERVICE BUNDLE VALUATION To identify and measure the utilization of services that may be ad ded to the PPS bundle, several decisions must be made. To ensure that payment is adequate to cover the actual costs incurred by providers, it is ideal to measure the cost of the in puts required to deliver each service in an efficient manner (e.g., labor costs, drug acquisition costs). However, available claims data reliably include Medicare payments, from which we calculate the Me dicare Allowable Payments (MAP). Use of such a calculation to determine the payment to include the service in a bundle implicitly assumes that MAP is a reasonable proxy for the cost of provid ing the service (plus a sufficient mark-up to allow the provider an adequate rate of return on th eir investment). Alternatively, the utilization data derived from Medicare claims can be multiplied by a price other than the historical MAP if it is believed the alternative price is a better proxy for cost. For example, the changes in drug reimbursement implemented on January 1, 2006, could be incorporated in this manner. III. OVERVIEW OF DATA SOURCES Although CMS provides and UM-KECC maintains several comprehensive ESRD databases (see Appendix A), the descriptive statisti cs, case-mix models and other anal yses used in this report are based primarily on Medicare claims for Medicare dial ysis patients and the Medicare Cost Reports for dialysis facilities. Resource ut ilization for separately billable services was based on patient level Medicare outpatient claims for the years 2001-2005. Since composite rate cost information is available only at the facility level, resource utilization for composite rate services was measured using the Medicare Cost Reports for each facility. As of the date of this report, the most complete annual cost report data were available from Healthcare Cost Report Information Systems (HCRIS) through 2004. Case-mix models for both se parately billable items and composite rate costs, which are described in greater detail in a later section, use Medicare claims and Cost Reports for the years 2002- 2004. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 12 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle Several data sources were used to measure the patient and facility characteristics that were used in the case-mix analyses. Patient demographic information was obtained from the Renal Management Information System (REMIS)/Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWN) and the ESRD Standard Information Management System (SIMS). These data sources include the Medical Evidence Form (CMS Form 2728), which is completed at onset of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patient body size measures were derived from the height and weight values reported on CMS Form 2728. Patient comorb idities were measured using a combination of CMS Form 2728 and diagnoses reported on Medicare claims. The cl aims diagnoses were used both to identify comorbidities that we re not collected by using CMS Fo rm 2728 and to capture changes in patient condition since the start of renal replacement therapy. Dialysis facility characteristics were measured using a combination of SIMS (ownership type and geographic location), the Medicare Cost Reports (facility size), Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR; hospital affiliation for satellite units) and other information obtained from CMS (composite rate payment exceptions). The specific patient and facility measures that are used in the case-mix analyses are described in later sections of this report. A. PATIENT CLAIMS DATA The universe of CMS paid patient claims data is us ed to aggregate payments of separately billable services (injectable drugs, laboratory and other dialys is services) and all claim types are used to find comorbid conditions (see Chapte r VIII and Appendix B for discussi on of comorbid conditions and codes used to define these conditio ns). Data are collected for instit utional claims covering inpatient hospitals, outpatient facilities, skilled nursing facili ties, hospices, and home health agencies. Similarly, claims data are collected for physicians, other non-institutional carrier, and durable medical equipment providers. The outpatient facility paid claims file is the primary source of information for payments dialysis facilities receive for treatment of ESRD patients. All payments made to the dialysis facility are detailed on these records. Type 72 bills provid e detailed data for dialysis payments. UM-KECC receives these bills quarterly. The last data file for the data calendar year contains all claims for ESRD patients (including bill type claims other than type 72). Claims files used for analyses in this report are based on final full year claims and include all bill types, unless indicated otherwise below. To be included, patients must have at least one claim record for dialysis. Carrier claims and durable medical claims are used to enumerate dialysis related payments made to other providers such as freestanding laboratories. Claims for injectable drugs provided and paid through other carriers and durable medical providers are also collected. These claims are aggregated to the patient-month level and joined to th e patient-month facility dialysis record. As the case mix analyses were generated, the most current, complete annual data available were for calendar year 2004. To date, 2005 claims have become available and are includ ed in trend analyses. Claims data counts are reported in Table 3-1.

MEDICARE COST REPORTS Facility level cost and treatment data were obtained from CMS Medi care Independent Renal Dialysis Facility Cost Reports (CMS Form 265-94) and the Medicare Hospi tal Cost Reports (CMS Form 2552-96). CMS updates the cost report files quarterly. Case-mix analyses use the most current available HCRIS data for 2002-2004 facilities as of May 2006. The files contain Cost Reports through March 31, 2006.

In cases where Cost Reports spanned two calendar years (e.g., October through September rather than January through December), data from multiple Cost Reports spanning the same calendar year were used to calculate a weighted average of the numerical values from those Cost Reports, where the weight was the fraction of the reporting period that spanned the calendar year.

PATIENT CLAIM AND COST REPORT SUMMARY DATA 2002-2004 Case-mix analyses are based on datas ets that link claims and cost report data for each year from 2002 through 2004. Patient level claims data were merged with annual facility Cost Reports by facility identifier. Claims data for patients treated in hos pital satellite facilities were linked to the parent hospital (using OSCAR), since Cost Reports are su bmitted by only the parent facility. The table below describes the resulting analysis files that include both claims data and cost report data to measure resource utilization.

The table below summarizes the data used in the primary analyses for both composite rate and separately billable services.

Base d on the patient counts in the above tables, the case-mix analyses include 90.9% of patients with Medica re outpatient dialysis claims during 2002- 2004. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 15 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle IV. CURRENT MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR END STAGE RENAL DISEASE Legislation that supports a bundled ESRD PPS prov ides an opportunity to reexamine the overall Medicare approach to payment for dialysis related services and other services provided to dialysis patients. Key attributes of the current Medicare dialysis payment system are: Outpatient dialysis facilities are paid for a speci fied set of dialysis related services, including the dialysis session itself, either in-center or home dialysis, under the composite rate. This amounts to a limited bundled payment system. Outpatient dialysis facilities are paid for serv ices not covered by the composite rate, referred to as separately billable services, on a fee-for-service basis. Nephrologists and other physicians who manage the care of patients on dialysis are paid separately for their services, according to th e Medicare fee schedule. Basic, outpatient physician management of dialysis related servi ces is paid as a monthl y capitation payment, pro-rated if fewer than four patient encounters per month. Other providers are paid separately for dialys is related and non-dialysis related services provided to dialysis patients. Some of these providers are paid on a fee-for-service basis (e.g., physicians and clinical laboratories) while others are paid prospectively (e.g., hospitals). In some cases, such as labora tory tests covered by the composite rate system for dialysis facilities but performed by independent labo ratories, the laboratory is paid under arrangement by the dialysis facility. Oral medications provided to dialysis patients on an outpatient basis were not covered by Medicare during the time period for which the data used in this report were available. However, beginning January 1, 2006, Medicare Pa rt D covered a percentage of the cost of outpatient prescription medications. This prescription drug coverage is administered through private health plans and enrollment is voluntary. Given the high prescription drug costs faced by most ESRD patients, enrollment for this new benefit by those who had not previously been eligible for prescription dr ug coverage (e.g., through Medicaid or an employer) is expected to be high. The current Medicare system uses multiple methods to pay for services delivered by different types of providers. This situation is further complicate d by the existence of other financing sources that pay for care received by dialysis patients (e.g., co ordination of benefits with Medicaid or private health insurers). University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 16 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle A. INEFFICIENCIES IN AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT PAYMENT SYSTEM The current Medicare ESRD payment system pres ents opportunities to reduce inefficiencies, eliminate beneficiary confusion, improve quality, and possibly make care more accessible. To understand these opportunities fully it helps to understan d, in some detail, th e limitations of the current payment system. The involvement of multiple payment systems create s a major inefficiency. Because some services (i.e., composite rate services) are bundled and others (i.e., separately billable services) are paid on a fee-for-service basis, where the fees paid for items billed separately from the composite rate system generally exceed providers' marginal costs of deliver ing these services, there is an incentive to shift the service delivery process toward separately billable services and away from composite rate services. This incentive may raise the cost of producing services and distort the mix of services provided to patients. Given the recent controversy regarding data on mortality risks associated with high hematocrit among chronic kidney disease patients ( 15,16 ,17), this incentive may also have adverse clinic al conse quences. A second type of inefficiency in the process of producing dialysis services arises from the involvement of multiple care provid ers that may exacerbate gaps in coverage. A key example here is the frequent failure to secure permanent vascular a ccess, particularly via arteriovenous fistula, at the initiation of renal replacement therapy. For many patients, an arteriovenous fistula is the preferred route of vascular access, enab ling lower cost, higher quality dialysis, and fewer complications ( 18). Delayed placement of permanent vascular access can arise for several reasons including failure to identify chronic kidney disease prior to ESRD, lack of pre-ESRD referral for nephrology care, and the likelihood that vascular access placement is often performed by a surgeon not affiliated with the dialysis facility. The fact that Medicare coverage for those patients not otherwise qualified (i.e., non- disabled patients under age 65) does not begin until three months after the determination of ESRD also contributes to these delays. A third type of inefficiency is the higher administrative costs inherent in a situation with multiple providers and multiple insurance arrangements. These higher costs are borne by the dialysis facilities and other providers and are sometimes passed on to pa yers. Some of these administrative costs are borne by patients, as they are forced to navigate the complex payment situation. B. CONSTRAINTS TO AN IDEAL PAYMENT SYSTEM Ideally, Medicare would have the necessary latitude to eliminate inefficiencies and confusion while optimizing quality and access. This latitude might involve a comprehensive redesign of the system of financing ESRD care. However, constraints to the design of the ideal payment system must be recognized. The Medicare benefits structure specifies covered services, the eligibility conditions, patient cost-sharing, and the rules of coordination and subrogation of benefits between Medicare and other insurers. Of particular interest is the fact, discussed above, that there is a three- month waiting period once ESRD has been established before Medicare benefits are in force. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 17 - Results of Research on Case-m ix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 18 - Medicare Part A and Part B are separate programs . Most dialysis related services are covered under Medicare Part B. However, Medicare Part A covers hospital inpatient services. Some services for dialysis patients are or can be pr ovided in the hospital. The best example is surgery to create vascular access. In addition to relating to different types of providers, Parts A and B have different funding mechanisms and different systems of paying providers for care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Gi ven their separation, it will not currently be possible to design a bundled payment system that includes services covered by both Part A and Part B. Hence, the scope of the potenti al changes to the dialysis payment system covered in this report is limited to those se rvices covered under Medicare Part B. It is unlikely that substantial additional funds for the ESRD program will be made available. Therefore, the most plausible changes to the sy stem will be those that result in no net cost increase to the Medicare Program. A good case could be made for applying a broad concept of budget neutrality under which increases in dialysis payment could be supported by savings accrued elsewhere in the Medicare program (e.g., reduced hospitalizations). This approach would bridge Parts A and B of Medicare. However, it is possible that a narrower concept of budget neutrality would be invoked wherein no additional funds for the Part B portion of Medicare ESRD costs would be made available. Despite these constraints, there remain substantial opportunities to promote efficiency, access and quality through improvements to the payment situ ation. Such improvements can include some combination of redefining the bundle, adjusting for patient severity, and assuring and rewarding quality of care. V. DEVELOPING AN EXPANDED BUNDLE BASED ON MEDICARE SPENDING FOR DIALYSIS SERVICES A. MEDICARE SPENDING BY SERVICE CATEGORY AND PROVIDER TYPE Table 5-1 presents total Medicare Allowable Payments (MAP), by provider type, for the years 2001- 2005. In 2005, Medicare spent a total of $7.9 billion for outpatient dialysis and the related outpatient services shown in Table 5-1, up from $6.1 billion in 2001. This reflects an annualized rate of growth of about 9 percent.

Nearly all of the payments in Table 5-1 went to dialysis facilities. Figures 5-1 and 5-2 present the distribution of total MAP by prov ider type for 2001 and 2005. These da ta indicate that a bundle that includes payments only for servic es provided by dialysis facilitie s would cover 96 percent of these composite rate and separately billa ble services. Payments to other providers, mainly freestanding laboratories for laboratory tests provided to dialysis patients, accounted for the remaining four percent of the total. Comparison of the figures for 2001 and 2005 indicates a small shift over time in the distribution of payments toward freestanding dialysis facilities and other providers and aw ay from hospital based dialysis facilities.

The remainder cover separately bill able (SB) services. Through 2004, the distribution of payments shifted toward separately billable services and away from composite rate services. This shift occurred as payments for separately billable services increased at an average annual rate of about twice the average annual rate experienced by payments for composite rate services. SB payments accounted for 37 percent of total payments in 2001 and 43 percent in 2004 (Table 5-1). In 2005 this redistribution was reversed in response to change s in the pricing of composite rate and separately billable services mandated by the MMA. Table 5-2 presents Medicare Allo wable Payments per session, by provider type, for 2001-2005. In 2004, composite rate payments av eraged $129.09 per session, while separately billable payments averaged $105.37 per session. Sepa rately billable payments per sessi on to dialysis facilities were $96.39. The remaining nearly $10 per session was to laboratories for tests.

A BUNDLE FOR ANALYTICAL PURPOSES A necessary requirement in the development of models to predict ESRD dialysis resource utilization was definition of services for inclusion in an expanded payment bundle. A core group of Medicare reimbursed services separate from the compos ite rate payment for ESRD under the current reimbursement system was identified. Categories of services included several classes of injectable medications used in the majority of dialysis patien ts to treat specific medical conditions resulting from kidney failure and dialysis, including anemia, ESRD related bone disease, and thrombosis or infection of vascular access. These injectable me dications are administered almost exclusively in dialysis facilities, and include erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), injectable iron, miscellaneous injectable medications (antibiotics, thrombolytic agents). As shown in Table 5-1, the MAP for these injectable medications reached $3.4 billion in 2005, accounting for 41% of total MAP to dialysis facilities. Along with payment for separately billed laboratory services and vascular access related procedures discussed below, these services account for virtually all dialysis related Medicare payments. 1. Dialysis related laboratory tests Frequen t laboratory testing of serum chemistries and blood counts is performed as part of the regular monitoring of dialysis patients. Payment for some of these tests, performed at specified frequencies, is included in the dialysis facilit y composite rate. When performed above the ESRD payment system specified frequency, these laboratory services may be separately billed by specific diagnostic indication, based on the presumptive diagnosis determined by the treating nephrologist. In addition, many of these same common laborato ry tests are ordered by non-dialysis medical providers in the course of their care of other medica l conditions in chronic dialysis patients. Finally, some laboratory tests, separate ly billed by Medicare, are ordered by nephrologists to monitor response to treatment of ESRD related conditions and to guide prescription of injectable medications. We attempted to id entify for inclusion in the expanded bundle only those specific lab tests and frequencies ordered by physicians to monitor dialysis related conditions, including response to separately billed injectable medi cations. The specificity of lab incl usion by dialysis indication was complicated by the need to develop a model which achieved administrative simplicity. This task was complicated by the practice of some, but not all, dial ysis providers to include primary medical care to dialysis patients as part of their Medicare Capitated Payment (MCP) services. We used several strategies to identify the subset of labs generally associated with dialysis related care. First, we identified a group of freestanding laboratory providers who perform the bulk of outpatient laboratory tests on chronic dialysis patients. In addition, we identified individual outpatient laboratory tests performed in these laboratory facilities on known chronic dialysis patients and ordered them by frequency. These analyses demonstrated that most laboratory tests performed in this patient group, based on both frequency and total cost, were related to core dialysis services (anemia, bone disease, infection prevention and/or treatment). Separate analyses demonstrated that approximately 89% of all diagnostic laboratory tests performed on dialysis outpatients by the 50 largest freestanding laboratory facilities in 2003 were or dered by physicians identified as receiving an MCP for dialysis management. Fu rthermore, more than 90% paid by Medicare in 2003 for these physician MCP ordered labs, was for labs related to anemia, bone disease, dialysis or infection prevention and/or treatment. Given the significant administrative burden to Medica re fiscal intermediaries involved in evaluating separately billable laboratory cl aims, as well as to providers in documentation of the presumptive diagnosis for the claims, inclusion of dialysis re lated laboratory charges in the expanded bundle should reduce the administrative costs for both providers and the Medicare program. The vast University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 26 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle majority of these lab tests were performed in support of performance of core services by dialysis facilities as noted above. Thus, we included a ll outpatient labs performed on Medicare dialysis patients which were ordered by MCP physicians as identified by their Unique Physician Identification Number (UPIN). For a small number of labs b illed at inpatient hospitals, we were unable to distinguish whether the lab was ordered by an MCP physician or another physician. MCP physician ordered lab tests, as defined here, were included as part of the expanded bundled payment. 2. Exclusion of vascular access payments from expanded bundle We considered inclusion of payments for vascular access creation and maintenance in our expanded prospective payment models. This aspect of ESRD management is important to optimize outcomes in Medicare ESRD patients and is a significant cost contributor to the ESRD program. Inclusion of vascular access management in the PPS would provid e opportunities to create financial incentives favoring creation of arteriovenous fistulae, potentia lly contributing to the success of the Fistula First initiative currently in progress. While exploring the feasibility of including vasc ular access management in the expanded PPS, we identified several complicating issues. First, most incident dialysis patients should have initial vascular access created prior to initiation of chro nic dialysis. Approximately 50% of these incident patients are not Medicare eligible during this crit ical period. Therefore accurately identifying costs associated with creation of access in these individuals is not possible. Furthermore, development of a Medicare payment model which promotes optimal vascular access choices in individual patients not yet participating in Medicare would be problematic. A second issue relates to the multiple medical and facility providers involved in creation and maintenance of vascular access. In some situations nephrologists, vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, dialysis facilities, freestanding vasc ular access clinics and in patient and outpatient hospital facilities are all participants in creation or restoration of functionality of a vascular access. Inclusion of payments for vascular access management in the expanded PPS for dialysis facilities would create significant administrative burdens for these facilities. In addition, the scope of vascular access management spans both Medicare parts A (inpatient) and B (outpatient). For the purposes of research in support of CMS' development of an expanded PPS for outpatient dialysis, we have not included vascular access management in our models. There may be opportunity to revisit this important component of the Medicare ESRD program in the future if the barriers outlined above are satisfactorily addressed. 3. Bundle definition for analyses To determi n e the feasibility of development and implementation of a PPS that encompasses an expanded bundle of outpatient ESRD dialysis services , we selected a specific bundle of services as the basis of the analyses which follow. This selection was made in consultation with CMS, and was informed by analyses of the data described above. The bundle definition for the case-mix models and other analyses includes services that are current ly reimbursed through the composite rate system and the following types of services that were billed separately by either dialysis facilities or other providers (as specified below) on Medicare claims: Injectable drugs billed by dialysis facilities Laboratory services o billed by freestanding laboratory suppliers and ordered by physicians that received monthly capitation payments for treating ESRD patients, or o billed by dialysis facilities Other services billed by dialysis facilities (e.g., dialysis supplies) University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 27 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle C. DETERMINING THE UNIT OF PAYMENT FOR AN EXPANDED BUNDLE: PER DIALYSIS SESSION OR PER UNIT OF TIME? In the current Medicare payment system for dialysis and related services, the unit of payment varies by type of service. Payments for bundled serv ices (those included under the composite rate) are based on the number of dialysis sessions actually delivered subject to a cap of three hemodialysis sessions (or the PD equivalent) per week. Under ra re circumstances, facilities can request a medical exception to allow for payment for four sessions per week. Payment for services that are not bundled into the composite rate is based upon actual utilization. Finally, dialysis related, outpatient physician care is based on a monthly capitation payment. Under an expanded bundle, the services now billed separately could be bundled with composite rate services on either a per session basis, or a per unit of time basis. Although different units of time (e.g., day or week) could be chosen as the basis for payment, we will use the month to illustrate how e xisting data could be used to develop a time based payment. A monthly payment is analytically convenient because dialysis bills are curre ntly submitted monthly, with facilitates calculating historical costs on a monthly basis. In addition, this approach would align with the unit of time used to determine physician payment for dialysis related services, and the typical unit of time for capitated payments in managed care settings (\"per member per month\"). To base payment for an expanded bundle on a unit of time rather than on a delivered dialysis session has several potential advantages as well as several potential drawbacks. Key advantages of a monthly payment are the alignment with the method of physician payment, simplification of the payment system, and neutrality with respec t to the schedule of dialysis se ssions. Neutrality with respect to scheduling could allow greater flexibility in sele cting between the standard, three times per week schedule versus shorter, more frequent sessions. However, it should be noted that a bundled payment system, regardless of whether the unit of payment is the session with a maximum number of allowable paid sessions or per month with a maximum payment per month, could encourage more frequent dialysis. Such an incentive would be pr esent to the extent that more frequent dialysis sessions generate savings in the utilization of curre nt separately billable items. Under a bundled payment system, the facility would absorb the costs of delivering the extra sessions, and it would retain any resulting savings on other dialysis related services. One key disadvantage of a monthly payment compared to a per session payment is the possibility of creating adverse incentives which encourage fewe r than three sessions per week and indifference toward missed sessions. Therefore, it may be useful to require a minimum number of delivered sessions to qualify for the full monthly payment, wi th a pro-rated reduction for months with fewer sessions. This requirement would function analogously to the physician MCP payment formula which requires at least four visits to receive the full, monthly capitation payment. Unlike payment based on sessions, a monthly paymen t would be complicated in months in which the patient received dialysis in multiple facilities (eit her due to switching to a new facility, or due to receiving transient dialysis while away from home), or in which intervening events occurred causing the patient to be ineligible to receive outpatient dialysis for part of the month (e.g., hospitalization). Therefore, monthly payment would involve several considerations that would not be present under a per session payment approach. These issues include identifyin g a \"home\" facility and making the home facility responsible for arranging payment to facilities pr oviding transient dialysis, and appropriately pro- rating the monthly payment in months with intervening events. See the Implementation Issues section for further discussion of issues in a per month payment system. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 28 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle 1. Payment per session If the dialysis session is cho sen as the unit of payment, the payment rate for a particular patient could be determined on the basis of a case-mix adjust ment model that uses co st per session as the dependent variable. To use the model as the basis for a payment per session, one would take a base budget neutral payment price and apply the model coefficients for comorbid conditions and other patient characteristics as multiplicative payment adjusters. Under this per session payment approach, aggregate payments per month would equal the case mix adjusted payment per session multiplied by the number of sessions the patient actually receives (potentially up to a specified limit on the number of sessions, like the current system). Estimation of both the base payment price per se ssion and case-mix adjustment coefficients would be based on annual data describing composite rate costs, mont hly data on separately billable payments, and information about patient characteristics reflecting different time periods. Methods used to develop these estimates are described later in this report. 2. Payment per month Under a per month payment system, a standard \"per member per month\" base payment amount must be determined. In order to use historical cost report and claims data to derive an empirical basis for a monthly payment system, it is necessary to aggregate costs over time and to account for time at which the patient was not at risk for incurring outpatient dialysis related costs. Below, we describe two approaches that could be taken to develop a payment rate based on unit of time (patient month) rather than dialysis session. Either of these approaches requires that we first calculate \"time at risk\" for partial months of dialysis in order to prorate the monthly payment for patients who experienced one or more events that result in less than a full month of outpatient dialysis. The events that lead patients to be \"at risk\" for le ss than a full month of outpatient dialysis services include hospitalization, initiation of dialysis, death, withdrawal from dialysis, recovery of renal function, transplantation, and returning to dialysis after a transplant graft failure. The occurrence of these events would presumably reduce the payment in proportion to the fraction of the month they reduce the patient's time \"at risk.\" (A patients ' skipping sessions does reduce time at risk.) Patients who receive partial mont hs of outpatient services due to such events could have their monthly payment prorated by the percentage of days in the month during which they are eligible for outpatient services. Under a per month payment system, the special cases of partial months due to transient care and between-facility transfers would create additional administrative and operational costs for dialysis facilities, possi bly introducing disincentives to pa tient access to care and patient choice. Table 5-3 describes the frequency of patient months that are partially or fully eligible for outpatient dialysis reimbursement. Eighty one percent of patient months are eligible for a full month of payment. For the other 19 percent of patient months, the treating fa cility would receive a fraction of the full month payment proportional to the fraction of the month in which they were eligible for outpatient dialysis services. Available dialysis claims data include only a range of dates covered (typically a calendar month), and do not indicate th e specific dates on which services were delivered. Further, an examination of the timing of the intervening events revealed a variety of complex patterns of multiple and recurrent events. For example, the data currently do not allow us to determine whether a patient received outpatient dialysis on the admission date or discharge date for a hospitalization, the most common type of event. Therefore, the data do not allow us to determine whether these days should be considered at risk for outpatient dialysis. Therefore, using the claims University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 29 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle data to determine time at risk involves some uncer tainties that necessitate making assumptions and as well as substantial programming and data analysis efforts. Table 5-3 Distribution of Medicare Di alysis Patient Months, 2002-2004 2002 2003 2004 Month Type (n=2,480,430) (n=2, 646,551) (n=2,774,764) Percent of patient-months eligible for full month of payment No events 81.35 81.50 81.48 Percent of patient-months eligible for partial month of payment Start of dialysis 0.35 0.34 0.34 Hospitalization 15.42 15.30 15.37 Transplant 0.01 0.01 0.01 Transplant failure 0.02 0.02 0.02 Recovered renal function 0.04 0.05 0.05 Death or withdrawal from dialysis 0.43 0.43 0.41 Start of dialysis + hospitalization 0.98 0.96 0.94 Transplant + hospita lization 0.26 0.25 0.26 Transplant failure + hospitalization 0.05 0.05 0.05 Death/withdrawal + hospitalization 1.03 1.03 1.01 Other combination of events 0.05 0.05 0.05 Rather than make assumptions that can not be tested and impose rules to account for the complex patterns in the data, we followed a simpler approach. For patient months with an intervening event, the approach is to infer time at risk based on the number of outpatient dialysis sessions for that month. For example, if a patient had 9 sessions during a month in which he or she was hospitalized, the time at risk during the month would be 9 * 7/3 = 21 days, which in a 30-day month would correspond to 70 percent of the month. Hence, the payment for this patient would be 70 percent of the full month base rate. The utility of this approach is enhanced by its applicability to the estimates of the composite rate portion of dialysis related costs (based on Cost Reports) as well as to the separately billable portion (based on utilization reported in paid claims). Because the Cost Reports are at the facility level, are annual, and include all patients (not just Medicare patients), any feasible calculation of aggregate time at risk for the accrual of these measured costs would have to be based on a transformation from the total number of sessions to the estimated time at risk. This time at risk estimate could be employed with either of the following approaches for calculating monthly payments. 2a. Approach 1: Adjust average cost per session to ref lect a full month of dialysis This approach estimates case-mix adjustment mode ls using the same cost per session model that would serve as the basis of a system using the session as the basis of payment, but it would scale up the per session costs to estimate the monthly cost. To use the model as the basis for a payment per month for a patient with a given set of characteristics who has a full month of outpatient sessions, multiply the case mix adjusted payment per session multiplied by the typical number of sessions per month received by outpatient dialysis patients. This typical number could reflect the current average of 12.8 sessions, or the current standard protocol of 13 sessions. To ensure adequate therapy, a minimum number of sessions may be required. When a patient does not receive the minimum number of sessions in months where no intervenin g event occurred, a downward adjustment could University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 30 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle be made to the monthly payment, similar to th e current MCP reimbursement system for physician services. A hypothetical case mix adjusted per se ssion payment of $250 multiplied by the current standard protocol of 13 sessions per month would result in a monthly payment of $3,250. Alternatively, using the current average of 12.8 sessions per month would result in a monthly payment of $3,200. The chosen base amount would be the maxi mum that would be paid on a monthly basis. 2b. Approach 2: Estimate models of cost per month An alternative approach is to estimate a model of cost per month for use as a case-mix adjuster. The costs for patients who are at risk for less than a full month would be represented as dollars per full month equivalent. The time at risk calculation for partial months, described as Approach 1, also applies to this approach. Hence, the dependent variable is actual cost observed in the partial month divided by the proportion of the month at risk. This creates the cost per full month equivalent. In the analysis, each patient month is weighted by the proportion of the month at risk to ensure that these partial months receive weight in proportion to the actual time at risk represented. For example, consider a patient incurring $2,100 in costs during a month in which he or she was at risk for 21 of 30 days (70 percent). The full mo nth equivalent cost of $2,100/0.70 = $3,000 would then be used, and the observation would receive a weig ht of 0.70 in the regression model. 3. Comparison of per session and per month case-mix adjustments Table 5-4 compares the results for per session and per month case-mix adjustment models for separately billable services. These models are consistent with the case-mix adjustment payment models developed later in this report. The models presented here focus on separately billable services because patient level data are not availa ble for composite rate services. Hence, these separately billable models serve to indicate the similarity of case-m ix adjustment results in the two types of approaches and thereby to inform the selection of a unit of payment. The approach employed to estimate the per month case-mix adjustment model is that described above in Approach 2. The approach used to estimate the per session case-mix adjustment model is that described generally as payment per session. More detail on these estimation procedures is presented in later sections of this report. The cases identified as statistical outliers vary slightly between the two models. The average separately billable payment in the per month model is $1,066.50, compared to the average separately billable payment in the per sessi on model of $83.18. As shown in Table 5-4, among the 22 potential case-mix adjustment payment variables, 12 multipliers do not change, nine change by 0.01, and one, duration of RRT less than 4 months, changes by 0.03. All of the control variables have multipliers that ch ange by no more than 0.01 (not shown). The small differences in multipliers and statistical significances likely arise from definitions used for time at risk in the per month model. Given the very small differences in multipliers obs erved in the two models, the choice of unit of payment can be based on other criteria. Some of these criteria have been introduced above. We cover these and other issues in more deta il in Chapter XIII, Implementation Issues. The next several sections descri be the development of a per session payment model. As described above, a per month model can easily be adapted from a per session model. Therefore, the remainder of this report focuses on a per session model.

University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 32 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle VI. PER SESSION PAYMENT SYSTEM AND IDENTIFICATION OF DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VARIABLES A. DEPENDENT VARIABLES The analytic approach us ed to examine potential case-mix adjust ers for an expanded PPS includes a facility level regression model for composite rate services and a p atient level regression model for separately billable services. The rationale for usin g this two equation modeling approach is discussed in Chapter VII, Section A. The dependent vari ables measuring resource utilization for each of the two equations are defined below. 1. Average cost per session for composite rate services Resource use for the bundle of services included in the composite rate wa s measured at the facility level since no patient level measures of resource use are available. While the patient level Medicare claims include the composite rate payment amounts, which are adjusted for certain classes of facilities (e.g., based on area wage indexes and for hospital-based facilities) and patients (i.e., based on the basic case-mix adjustment), these payments do not vary according to the level of services or other resources used to treat individual patients within a facility. The cost of resources used to deliver composite ra te services was measured with facility level data obtained from the Cost Reports for freestanding dialysis facilities (CMS Form 265-94) and hospital based facilities (CMS Form 2552-96) for each year from 2002-2004. A more detailed description of the Cost Reports is includ ed in Chapter III, Overview of Data Sources. The average composite rate cost per session at each facility wa s calculated by dividing the total reported Medicare allowable costs for composite rate services (Worksheet B, column 11, rows 7-16 on CMS 265-94; Worksheet I-2, column 11, rows 2-11 on CMS 2552-96) by the total number of dial ysis sessions (Worksheet C, column 1, rows 1-10 on CMS 265-94; Worksheet I- 4, column 1, rows 1-10 on CMS 2552-96). CAPD and CCPD patient weeks were multiplied by 3 to yield hemodialysis equivalent sessions, as other researchers have done ( 19,20 ,21). To explore the relationship between area wages and costs, we performed some analyses where the average composite rate cost at each facility was adjusted for regional differences in th e cost of labor by dividing the estimated labor share of composite rate costs, 53.711% ( 22), by the wage index that was developed for the 200 6 payment sys tem for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) ( 23,24 ). This wage index has also been used to adjust composit e rate payments for area wage differences ( 22). Regression models were then used to explain variati on in the average wage adjusted costs. For other analyses, no wage adjustment was made to calculate the average composite rate cost per session. Instead, the SNF wage index was included as an independent variable in the regression models (see Section B, Independent Variables, below). No floor or ceiling was imposed on the SNF wage index in either case. For further discussion on the wa ge index methodology, see Chapter IX, Section B. Resource use for composite rate services was theref ore measured using the av erage annual composite rate cost per session. A log transformation was used in most analyses to account for the skewness in the cost data and to derive multiplicative pa yment adjustments (see Chapter VII, Section B, University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 33 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle Logarithmic versus Linear Model), and was calculated as the natural logarithm of the average annual composite rate cost per session. Potential outlier va lues for average facility costs were identified and excluded from the case-mix analyses. See Chapte r VII, Section C, for a discussion of the methods used to identify statistical outliers and the impact of the exclusion. 2. Average Medicare Allowable Payment per session for separately billable services Resource use for separatel y billable dialysis relate d services was measured at the patient level using the Medicare claims. Patient level measures of re source use were defined for each year during 2002- 2004. This time period corresponds to the most re cent three years of cost report data that were available to measure resource use for composite rate services. Measures of resource use include the following separately billable services: in jectable drugs billed by dialysis facilities; laboratory services provided to ESRD patients, billed by freestanding laboratory suppliers and ordered by physicians who receive monthly capitation payments for treating ESRD patients, or billed by dialysis facilities; and other services billed by dialysis facilities. Chapter V, Section B (A Bundle for Analytical Purposes), descri bes these services in greater detail, and discusses the rationale for this bundle definition. Medicare claims data for separately billable services were obtained for patient months in which outpatient dialysis was provided and Medicare was the primary payer. Measures of resource use were based on Medicare Allowable Payments (MAP), whic h were calculated using the payment data on the claims. Medicare payments were inflated by a factor of 1.25 for services that have a 20% patient obligation (e.g., most injectable drugs) to yield MAP. For services that have no patient obligation (e.g., laboratory tests and vaccines), the Medicare payment is identical to the MAP. The MAP amounts do not include the porti on of the annual Part B deduct ible ($100 per patient per year) applied to these separately billable services. For the case-mix analyses, MAP based on the 2002-2004 claims were adjusted to approximate the relative costs of these separately billable serv ices under the current Medicare payment system. Medicare reimbursement levels were recently adjust ed to reflect the typical facility acquisition costs for the top injectable drugs ( 2,22). We adjusted MAP for the top injectables to reflect reimburs ement levels during the first quarter of 2006 ( 25). MAP for each inje ctabl e was multiplied by the ratio of the Medicare payment rate in the first quarter of 2006 to the prevailing Medicare payment rate (e.g., 2006 Quarter 1 pa yment rate / 2004 payment rate). Repricing was done for the following injectables: epoetin alfa, recombinant and vancomycin. The MAP reflects the volume of services provided to each patient and the relative cost of each service based on prevailing Medicare reimbursement rates. For the primary analyses, the adjusted MAP was stan dardized to the number of Medicare outpatient dialysis sessions reported on the claims. This approa ch is consistent with the current composite rate unit of payment which reimburses facilities on a per session basis. For patients who received peritoneal dialysis (PD) during the month, the number of PD days reported on Medicare claims was multiplied by 3/7 to yield the number of hemodi alysis equivalent sessions (e.g., 7 days PD are converted to 3 HD equivalent sessions, since HD is typically performed 3 times per week). Monthly HD equivalent dialysis sessions reported on the claims were capped at 20; values exceeding 20 are implausible under the current composite rate payment system. The ratio of adjusted MAP for separately billable services to the total number of HD-equivalent sessions was used to calculate the average adjust ed MAP per session. The average MAP per session for epoetin alfa was capped to reflect no more than 30,000 units of EPO per session, since higher University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 34 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle doses may be clinically implausible or inappropriate. Medicare currently places a relatively similar limit on EPO reimbursement of 500, 000 units per patient per month ( 26). As with the analyses of composi te rate services, a log tr ansformation was used for most analyses of separately billable services (see Chapter VII, Section B, Logarithmic ve rsus Linear Model). The exclusion of potential outliers is described in Chapter VII, Section C, S tatistical Outliers for the Average Cost per Session. B. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES Payment and control variables are the two types of independent variables included in models of resource utilization. Payment variables may be used to adjust payments for the expanded PPS. The patient characteristics that were examined as potential payment variables based on models of resource use included patient demographics, measur es of body size, duration of renal replacement therapy and patient comorbidities. These patient characteristics were measured using several CMS data sources (see Chapter III). The use of regression analysis and other criteria to specify a preliminary case-mix adjustment model is discusse d in Chapter VII, Structure of the Model, and Chapter VIII, Definition and Measurement of Patient Characteristics fo r Case-mix Adjustment. Measures were defined for patient age, duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT) at time of session, and gender. Patient weight and height recorded at the start of RRT were used to calculate body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2) and body surface area (BSA, m2). BSA was calculated as a function of height (H, in centimeters) and weight (W , in kilograms) using the following formula ( 27): BSA = 0.007184 x H0.725 x W0.425 BMI values below 18.5 kg/m2 were used to identify patients who were underweight ( 28). BSA and low BMI (<1 8.5) are currently used as part of th e basic case-mix adjustment for the composite rate system. For patients who had no weight or heig ht measurements availabl e from the CMS Form 2728 because they started RRT before April 1995 (i.e., when the CMS Form 2728 be gan collecting weight and height measurements), we used the average va lues among patients of the same age group and gender. Comorbidity measures were define d for the following conditions: specific types of heart disease (cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and pericarditis), cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, AIDS, HIV positive status (without AIDS), Hepatitis B, other hepatitis, specific types of infections (septicemia, bacterial pneumonias, pn eumococcal pneumonias and opportunistic infections), specific types of bleeding conditions (gastro-intestinal tract bleeding and esophogeal varices), specific types of anemias (acquired hemolytic anemias, hereditary hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia), cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers and subset into lung, upper digestive tract, and other severe cancers; lymphatic system, head, and other major cancers; metastatic cancers; breast, prostate, colorectal, and other cancers and tumors; lymphoma; multiple myeloma; and leukemia then recombined), inability to ambulate, inability to transfer, alcohol dependence, drug tobacco ntestinal ulcer, hyperparathyroidism, monoclonal measurement of specific comorbidities depended on factors such as whether the conditions were relatively chronic or acute and whether certain related conditions might be combined to form a single measure. These comorbidity measurement issues ar e discussed in Chapter VIII. Some analyses also include a measure of local wages (SNF wage index that has been used to adjust composite rate payments for differences in labor costs) as an independent variable. The wage University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 35 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle adjustments vary according to the location of the fac ility in a specific metropo litan statistical area (of a core based statistical area, CBSA) or a rural ar ea of a specific state for facilities not in a metropolitan statistical area. By accounting for area wage differences, the inclusion of the wage index as an independent variable also allows the estimates for the other payment variables (case-mix) to be determined based on the variation in provider costs for which there is no separate payment adjustment. Control variables were included to obtain more a ccurate estimates of the effects of the payment variables. In the absence of control variables, the relationship between the payment variables and measures of resource utilization may be biased. Th e control variables were defined using several data sources (see Chapter III, Overview of Data Sources) and included the following facility characteristics: hospital based versus freestandin g; facility size (less than 5,000, 5,000-10,000 and greater than 10,000 dialysis sessions); facility owne rship (independent, large dialysis organization, regional chain, unknown); composite rate payment exception; percent of patients having a urea reduction ratio (URR) less than 65 percent; and rural versus urban location. Calendar year was included as an additional control variable in anal yses that pooled three years of data. The rationale for including these specific contro l variables is discussed in Chapte r VI, Section C, Dialysis Facility Characteristics and Control Variables. A similar set of independent variab les was included in the composit e rate and separately billable equations. To define the independ ent variables for each equation, it was necessary to link patient and facility level data. For example, measures for patient characteristics (e.g., female) are included as potential payment variables in the facility level composite rate equ ation, while measures for facility characteristics (e.g., hospital based) are included as control variables in the patient level separately billable equation. For the compos ite rate equation, we defined ca se-mix measures using data for all Medicare dialysis patients treated in each facility. Specifically, we determined the percentage of a facility's patients having each pati ent characteristic. For example, sex was measured as the percentage of patients that were female. Since separate Cost Reports are not submitted for hospital satellite facilities, case-mix data for patients treated in s atellite facilities were linked to the parent hospital using CMS (OSCAR) data. For the model of separately billable MAP, we defined measures for facility characteristics using data for all facilities that treated each Medicare dialysis patient. These patient and facility variables were calculated as the weighted average value across multiple observations, where the weight was based on the number of Medicare hemodialysis equivalent dialysis sessions at each facility. This weighting process was used to give greater emphasis to patient and facility observations that accounted for more of the care that was delivered, based on the number of dialysis sessions. For example, in defining facility leve l case-mix measures, the characteristics of patients who we re treated by the facility for tw elve full months (e.g., with 13 sessions each month) were given twelve times as much weight as the characteristics of patients who were treated by the facility for only one full mont h (e.g., with 13 sessions). Similarly, to define patient level measures for the facility control variab les, the characteristics of the facility that treated the patient for nine full months were given three times as much weight as the characteristics of the facility that treated the patient for the remaining three full months. The resulting case-mix variables were examined as potential payment variables in the composite rate equation (e.g., % female and average body surface area among patients in each fac ility). This approach was also used to define the case-mix measures examined for the composite rate basic case-mix adjustment ( 4). The resulting facility variabl es were included as control variables in the separately billable equation (e.g., % of a patient's sessions provided in hospital based facilities). Evaluation of specific control and payment variables for inclusion in a payment model involved extensive research to determine relations to cost. This research is describe d in the next section. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 36 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle C. DIALYSIS FACILITY CHARACTERISTICS AND CONTROL VARIABLES In addition to the patient case-mix factors that are potential risk adjusters, the case-mix models we estimated also include several facility characteristics. Facility characteristics can be used as either payment or control variables in a bundle d case-mix adjusted payment system. If costs are associated with facility characteristics that are considered to ju stify a payment adjustment, then the coefficient on that facilit y characteristic could serve as th e basis for a payment adjustment. For example, if hospital based dial ysis facilities are associated with higher costs of providing care by $10 per session, and there is a public policy to adjust for this cost differential, then hospital based facilities might receive a higher payment of $10 per session. Alternately, some facility characteristics might be a ssociated with cost of pr oviding dialysis services, but they may not be considered as justifying a differential payment. These characteristics are included in the case-mix models to provide more accu rate estimates of the causal effects of the case- mix measures on dialysis costs. Models that include only the case-mix measures suffer from omitted variables bias, so that the case-mix coefficients might capture not only the causal effect of case-mix but also part of the effect of those omitted variable s that are correlated with case-mix. For example, hospital based facilities treat a high er percentage of relatively youn g (aged 18-44 years) patients. If hospital location is left out of the case-mix estimation model, some of the higher cost of hospital location would be attributed to young patient age. A payment model derived from this case-mix estimation model that adjusted payments for young age would then result in a payment adjustment that exceeded the true cost differential for patients of young age. To assess the effects of including or excluding facility ch aracteristics in estim ating equations, we estimated several facility year linear regression models explaining tota l cost per session as a function of patient demographic and diagnostic characterist ics, controlling for successively more facility characteristics ( 13). We used data from 2003 Medicare Cost Reports and Medicare claims files (n= 4,275 facility years, corresponding to 212,034 patients and 23,411,303 dialysis sessions). Facility characteristics in these analyses included size, urban-rural location, chain ownership, and hospital based versus freestanding status. Results are summarized in Table 6-1 below. Our analyses demonstrate that inclusion of facility characteristics changes the coefficients for some of the patient characteristics. For example, youngest and oldest patients tend to be the most expensive to treat. When facility characteristics are included in th e model, the relationship becomes less pronounced by about half. Some diagnoses become insignificant when facility variables are included. An example is cardia c arrhythmia. Still other diagnoses , such as bacterial pneumonia, become significant. All three groups of control variables affected the magnitudes of many potential patient characteristics coefficients. A notable example is cancer. For other variables such as hepatitis B, controlling for hospital based facility versus fr eestanding facility had the most substantial impact on the estimate of the potential pa tient level adjuster. Controlling fo r facility size also influenced several potential adjusters, such as duration of RRT, substantially. Controlling for chain membership also changed the values of several patient adjusters (e.g., ischemic heart disease).

As suggested above, unless facility char acteristics associated with cost are controlled for, facility effects may be incorrectly attributed to patient characteristics. Facility characteristics that might be considered for use in estimating equations include the CMS wage index used to adjust Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities. This variable helps to account more accurately for differences in labor costs. Facility size could be included to account for differences in efficiency due to economies of scale, as the lower average costs among larger facilities are well documented ( 19,20 ). The models might control for whe t her the facility was hospital based or freestanding, and for chain ownership (e.g. indicators for the six largest chains and smaller chains versus independent). Hospital based providers tend to have substantially higher self-reported composite rate costs than freestanding providers, which may partly reflect the methods used to allocate joint costs to hospital outpatient dialysis units. Chain membership could be used to account for differences across chains (e.g., due to differenc es in reporting) as well as similarities among facilities within chains. Urban ve rsus rural location likewise can a ccount for efficiency and other cost drivers related to geography. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 38 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle The percentage of Medicare patients achieving th e KDOQI guideline for urea reduction ratio (URR 65 percent) has been used as a measure of quality of care at each facility. URR values were obtained from Medicare outpatient dialysis claims, and were weighted by the number of HD equivalent dialysis sessions reported on the claim. The resulting case-mix coefficients will be less biased by any relationship that exists between quality of care and facility costs. Estimation models also might control for whether the facility was granted a payment exception to the composite rate system (e.g., as a pediatric facility or isolat ed essential facility). The resulting higher reimbursement levels may enab le facilities to sustain higher average costs relative to those that would be sustainable by an otherwise similar fa cility that did not receive an exception to the composite rate payment. Facilit ies that were granted a payment exception between November 1993 and July 2001 were identified usin g a list obtained from CMS. Regardless of whether policy makers adjust payments for facility charac teristics, it is important to consider facility characteri stics in the model used to estimate case -mix adjusters. This is particularly true if the models are estimated at the fa cility level rather than the patient level. VII. STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL A. ONE VERSUS TWO EQUATION MODELING APPROACH To determine the structure of the case-mix models fo r an expanded ESRD PPS, it is imperative to consider the unit of analysis. This is because th e level at which resource use can be measured differs for the two principal components of an expanded bu ndle. Resource use for separately billable (SB) services can be measured for individual patients using several types of Medicare claims. In contrast, the available measures of resource use for com posite rate (CR) services are reported on the Freestanding Dialysis Facility and Hospital Cost Reports, which combine sessi on costs for all of the patients treated in each facility. Given the available data on resource use, a modeling approach could be based on either one or two estimating equations: One equation approach: Facility level combined model for co mposite rate and separately billable services Two equation approach: Facility level model fo r composite rate services and patient level model for separately billable services The relative strengths and limitations of thes e modeling approaches are discussed below. A third modeling approach, a single equation at the patient level, was also considered in preliminary work. However, as detailed below that approach was determined not to be statistically valid and was dropped from consideration. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 39 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle 1. Accuracy, precision and stability of estimates Th e major difference between the two primary modeling approaches is that a patient level model is used to explain the variation in separately billabl e services under the two equation approach and a facility level model (of combined SB+CR services) is used under the one equation approach. The first approach therefore has the adva ntage of utilizing the patient level variation in separately billable services that is available from the Medicare claims. The second approach has the relative simplicity of deriving the case-mix adjustment based on a single statistical model that is estimated at the facility level. The main similarity between the two modeli ng approaches is that the form of the resulting payment model is the same and will not depend on the form of the estimation model (one or two equation). That is, a two equation estimation model can be converted into a one equation payment model. To understand the differences between these two modeling approaches, we evaluated patient level and facility level models that were limited to separately billable serv ices. By using the same patient level data in both models, we isolate the effect of aggregating the patient level data to the facility level. These analyses are used to compare patient level models and facility level models for separately billable services (Table 7-1). Based on both models in Table 7-1, predictors of higher SB MAP per session include younger age, female, body surface area, and most comorbidities. Despite using the same data and same set of predictors, large differences emerged in the estimated coefficients for several case-mix factors, especially rare conditions having large effects on SB MAP. For example, the coefficient estimate for other cancers based on the facility level data is $27.49, while the esti mate based on the patient level data is $5.39. Both coefficients are statistically significant, and were estimated with sufficient precision that their 95 percent confidence intervals are non-overlapping. Therefore, it must be determined which of these coefficients represents an unbiased estimate of the true, underlying relationship between other cancers and dialysis costs. One theoretical source of bias in the coefficient estimates arises if a correlation exists between case- mix measures and unobserved facility characteristics. The nature of this bias is explained intuitively here, and is described in more detail in Appendix A. The theoretical equations in that appendix guide an empirical analysis that demonstrates the bias. Unobserved facility characteristics can be considered a \"latent\" variable. The biasing effect s of this latent variable can be minimized in a patient level analysis by estimating a model that uses as a dependent variable the difference between patient level cost and facility mean cost, and uses as predictor vari ables the difference between the patients' characteristics and the mean value of the characteristics at the facilit y level. This patient level model will be unbiased by omitted facility characteristics. The facility level model will be biased unless the latent variable is uncorrelated with ca se-mix. Estimating these two models yields quite different coefficients for a number of case-mix va riables, confirming the presence of bias in the facility level model. Theoretically, the bias is greatest when the correlation between the case-mix measure and the latent variable is high, the effect of the latent variable on cost is large, the standard deviation of the latent variable is large, and the standard deviation of the case-mix measure is small. Empirically, as the latent variable can not be observed implies that the first three factors cannot be directly estimated. However, the standard deviation of the case-mix measure across facilities can be measured. For rare conditions, this standard deviation is low, which helps explain why the bias is often large in the case of rare conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, pericarditis and esophageal varices).

Table 7-2 provides information about the precision and stability of the parameter estimates from both facility level and patient level models. Coef ficients from the patien t level model are more precisely estimated and more stable over time. Precision is demonstrated using the 95 percent confidence intervals reported for the pooled 3-year models. As an illustrative example, we use hereditary hemolytic or sickle cell anemias, whic h has relatively similar point estimates from the patient level and facility level models, but has mu ch wider confidence intervals based on the facility level model. Regarding stability, coefficient estimates for each individual year from 2002-2004 are reported for both patient and facility models. As an illustrative ex ample, myelodysplastic syndrome is statistically significant and has a similar coeffici ent based on patient level and facility level models using pooled 2002-2004 data, but is highly unstable from year to year in the facility level model. Cardiac arrest provides another example where the two pooled models yield similar point estimates, but the facility level model demo nstrates greater instability in the estimates over time.

Potential refinement for the two equation approach To determi ne the relationship be tween case-mix and resource use fo r separately billable services, a patient level model relies on a combination of the variation occurring among individual patients within the same facility and the variation occurring among patients in different facilities. Since the number of facility observations (~12,000) is small relative to the number of patient observations (~800,000), the impact of unobserved facility characteristics in a patient level model will be limited relative to a facility level model (i.e., as with th e one equation approach). However, the case-mix coefficients may still be influenced by unobserved facility characteristics. As an alternative modeling approach for separately billable services that fully controls for unobserved facility characteristics, we tested individual facilit y effects in a patient level model. This approach includes individual facility intercepts, or essentially a separate indicator variable for each of the approximately 4,000 facilities. This analysis includes one observation per patien t per facility, for each year from 2002-2004. The inclusion of individual facility fixed effects (versus including seve ral measurable facility characteristics in the model) increased the explanatory power of the model from 8.4 percent to 18.3 percent (Table 7-3). This increa se in explanatory power reflects the addition of approximately 4,000 individual facility indicator vari ables. The case-mix multipliers estimated by the two models, however, are generally very similar, varying within one percentage point for most factors. Those factors that had somewhat larger di fferences tended to represent rel atively small numbers of patients (e.g., pediatric, pericarditis, HIV/AIDS). The difference in multipliers was largest for the pediatric variable, and may reflect the concen tration of many pediatr ic patients in facilit ies that specialize in treating these patients. The ability to distinguish the effect of being a pediatric patient and the effect of being a patient in a largely pediatric facility ma y be limited if there are relatively few pediatric patients treated in other facilities. For pediatric facilities, the indivi dual facility effects may be at least partly capturing the effect of what is inherently a patient characteristic (pediatric), and thereby removing it from the payment adjustment for pediatric patients. This is a possible disadvantage of controlling for individual facility ef fects. Since the adjustment for individual facility effects had a limited effect on most multipliers, it was not explor ed further as part of a patient level separately billable equation. 3. An alternative form of the one equation approach Given th e available resource use data, another possible form of a one equation modeling approach is a patient level combined model for composite rate and separately billable services. Such an approach requires combining patient level costs for separate ly billable services with the average cost for composite rate services for the fac ility in which the patient is treated (i.e., as a proxy for the cost of providing composite services to each patient). This approach would both allow the variation in separately billable services to be used (as with Approach 2) and require only one estimating equation (as with Approach 1). However, this approach potentially leads to a substantial bias in the estimated case-mix coefficients.

Models of the average separately billable Medicare Allowable Payment per sessi on from the Medicare claims were weighted by the number of hemodialysis-equivalent dialysis sessions. Although we expect the true cost to provide compos ite rate services to vary among patients in each facility, there is no variation in our measure of composite rate costs amon g patients within each facility. The result is a positive measurement erro r for patients whose true composite rate cost per session is greater than their facility average and a ne gative measurement error for patients whose true composite rate cost per session is less than their fa cility average. To the extent that this measurement error is correlated with case-mix, which unlike composite rate costs is measured at the patient level, we would systematically understate or overstate the cost of treating certain types of patients in each facility. For example, the average facility cost for composite rate services is likely to understate the cost of treating patients who have a body surface area (BSA) that is greater than their facility average. The measurement error in composite rate costs is therefore likely to be correlated with BSA, and potentially with other patient characteristics. The result is a form of nonrandom measurement error University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 44 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle in the composite rate cost compon ent of the dependent variable which will tend to bias the case-mix coefficients towards zero. As a result of this pote ntially substantial bias, this form of a one equation approach was not used. 4. Conclusion The two pri m ary modeling approaches that were possible given the available resource use data differ with regard to whether a facility level model or a pa tient level model was used to explain variation in separately billable services. By utilizing patient- to-patient variation in bo th case-mix and resource use, a patient level model has the advantage of reducing potential bias related to unobserved facility characteristics, producing more precise coeffici ent estimates and yielding greater stability in coefficient estimates over time. Further, a patient level model for separately billable services can be combined with a facility level model for composite rate se rvices to yield a single payment model for an expanded bundle. A two equation modeling ap proach was therefore used to examine potential risk adjusters for use with an expanded PPS. B. LOGARITHMIC VERSUS LINEAR MODEL Models of resource use for composite rate services an d separately billable services could be estimated as either logarithmic models or linear models. Logarithmic models are useful with skewed data. Typically, health care cost data feature a skewed distribution in which a relatively small fraction of individuals account for a disproportionate fraction of costs. The cost distribution for both composite rate and separately billable servi ces exhibits this type of skewness. However, since the skewness in costs for outpatient dialysis related costs is not as pronounced as with other cost data, we examined both logarithmic and linear forms of the case-mix models. For these analyses, the dependent variable was the average cost per session in the linear models and the log of the average cost per session in the logarithmic models, while the independent variables were the same in all models. For both composite rate and separately billable services, the explanatory power of the logarithmic models was either similar to or slightly lower than that of the linear models (Table 7-4). The explanatory power of the logarithmic models wa s assessed using two separa te R-squared values. The R-squared statistic from the logarithmic model, which is labeled as R-sq (log dollars) in Table 7- 4, measures the ability of the model to explain variat ion in resource use in term s of log dollars rather than in dollars. However, the extent to which a model explains variation in resource use measured in dollars will be more relevant to pr oviders, since they are reimbursed in dollars. A separate R-sq value, R-sq (dollars), is based on a linear model in which the average cost per session (in dollars) was the dependent variable and the predicted cost per session from the lo g-linear model (i.e., retransformed to dollars) was used as the only independent variable. When evaluated in terms of dollars, the explanatory power was not affected by which functional form was used for composite rate services (39.8%) and remained slightly lower with the logarithmic form for separately billable services (9.1% vs. 10.3%). Based on the factors that had a statistically significant association with costs (not shown here; see Chapter IX, A Combined Case-mix Adjusted Model for Composite Rate and Separately Billable Services), the list of potential case-mix adjuster s implied by the two functional forms was very similar, although the magnitude of the payment adjustments varied for individual factors. A secondary analysis of residuals s howed that the logarithmic form of the separately billable model had a modest advantage in better satisfying the assumptions of the model (e.g., normality and University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 45 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle homoskedasticity of residuals). By reducing the influence of individual observations that reflect unusually high levels of resource use, logarith mic models yield more stable estimates. Table 7-4 Explanatory power of linear and log-linear models of resource utilization, 2002-2004 Functional form Linear Log-linear Measure of resource utilization n R-sq R-sq (log dollars)* 9.1% *R-sq (log dollars) is the R-sq statistic from the log-linear model, and measures the ability of the case-mix model to explain variation in log dollars. **R-sq (dollars) is a measure of the ability of the log-linear model to explain variation in dollars. This statistic is the R- sq value from a linear model in which the average cost/session is the dependent variable and the predicted cost/session from the log-linear model (i.e., retransformed to dollars) is used as the independent variable. In additio n to the skewness in the cost data, there may be other factors to consider when choosing between logarithmic and linear models. A log tran sformation was applied to the resource utilization measure that was used to develop the current basi c case-mix adjustment (BCMA) for the composite rate system (7 ). The log-transformed dependent variable allows the case-mix adjustments to be applied mul t iplicatively to the wa ge adjustment which reflects a multiplier in the composite rate system (i.e., results in a larger case-mix adjustment for facilities in higher wage areas). Hence, a logarithmic form is consistent with prior methods employed by CMS to adjust payment for dialysis services. One potential disadvantage of a logarithmic model is a by-product of the multiplicative nature of the case-mix adjustments. A given upwa rd payment adjustment based on body surface area will be larger for dialysis patients who also have a costly co morbidity. An example from the composite rate BCMA shows that larger patients who are youn ger (18-44 years) receive a greater incremental payment for their large size than do large patients in the middle age category (60-69 years). This is not necessarily inappropriate, but it does represent a different policy choice than using an additive adjustment that would pay the same number of extra dollars for each characteristic regardless of which other characteristics are present. Logarithmic models have both advantages and disa dvantages relative to lin ear models. Separate analyses of composite rate and separately billable se rvices suggest that the ch oice of functional form does not substantially affect overall model perfor mance. Based on the so mewhat skewed cost data for composite rate and se parately billable services, and based on prior methods used to adjust payment for dialysis services, we applied a log transformation to both measures of resource use for the primary case-mix analyses. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 46 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle C. STATISTICAL OUTLIERS FOR THE AVERAGE COST PER SESSION Regression models of the average cost per session were used to estimate the typical increment in cost associated with each case-mix factor. However, the average cost per session may be influenced by individual facilities and exceptionally high cost pati ents. We explored methods to restrict the study samples so that the resulting models would characterize the patterns seen among a broad spectrum that included most facilities and patients, rather than being unduly influenced by a few exceptional, non-representative, and perhaps erroneously reported cases. For example, extreme values for the average composite rate cost per session may reflec t unique circumstances for some facilities (e.g., a new dialysis facility that treated a very small number of patients) or differences in reporting across facilities (e.g., a hospital that uses different methods for allocating cost s to a dialysis unit on its cost report). In addition, to the extent there is variati on over time in the characteristics of facilities or patients with extreme average costs, individual outliers may lead estimates of the relationship between case-mix factors and cost per session to be less stable over time. This section describes the methods us ed to identify statistical outliers for the average cost per session and the impact on case-mix analyses of excluding potential outlier observations. Since a two equation modeling approach was used, potential outliers for the average cost per session were examined separately for composite rate and separately billable services. It should be noted that this sect ion focuses on identify ing statistical outliers for average costs in order to estimate accurate and stable models to develop the case-mix adjustment for an expanded bundle. The possibility of using an outlier payment methodology for dialysis providers who incur exceptionally high session costs under an expanded PPS is addressed in Chapter X, Section D, Outlier Payments. The distribution of the average cost per session for outpatient dialysis related services is shown in Table 7-5. Average composite rate costs are be tween $121 per session and $305 per session for 90% of facility observations (i.e., based on the 5 th and 95th percentiles, respectively). However, some facilities reported extreme values fo r average cost per session. For example, one percent of facilities report average costs below $100 per session and another one percent of facilities report average costs exceeding $639 per session. A standard outer fence method was examined for fa cilities with extreme average costs. The upper outer fence is defined as the 75th percentile plus three times the interquartile range (IQR, which is the 75th percentile - the 25th percentile); while the lower outer fence is the 25th percentile minus three times the IQR. The outer fences for average cost per session were calculated on the log scale, since a log transformation was used to estimate the models. When retransformed to dollars, the lower outer fence for composite rate costs was $58 per session and the upper outer fence was $457 per session. However, a model that applied these exclusion criteria yielded especially large prediction errors for facilities with reported costs below $100 per session . Approximately 95 percent of the facilities with average costs between $58 per session and $100 pe r session had studentized residuals less than -2, and approximately 50 percent had studentized residuals less than -4. Based on this analysis of studentized residuals, a slightly more restrictive lower limit of $100 per session was applied. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 47 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle Table 7-5 Distribution of average costs for outp atient dialysis-related services, 2002-2004 Average cost per session at selected percent iles of facilities or patients Measure of resource use n 1 2 5 50 95 98 99 Facility composite rate costs 11,499 $104.08 $111.39 $120.79 $206.08 $ 260.44 pact of these exclusion criteria on regre ssion models of average composite rate costs is summarized in Table 7-6. When using the slightly more restricted sample that excluded 2.8% of facilities, there was a substantial improvement in the overall explanat ory power of the model. There were relatively large changes in the estimated multipliers for several factors (e.g., age 18-44, monoclonal gammopathy) and a few factors which either gained or lost statistical significance (e.g., female, underweight, and septicemia ). Supporting analyses showed that the excluded facilities tended to be smaller and were more likely to be hospital based relative to other facilities. As a result of their typically smaller size, the 2.8% of facilities that were excluded as potential out liers reflected only 1.3% of Medicare dialysis patient years. When explorin g the use of even more restrictive criteria for average composite rate costs, there were much sma ller changes in both the overall model fit and in the estimated multipliers for most factors. Extreme values for the average cost per session were also identified for separately billable services. First, the average monthly cost for EPO, which is by far the largest component of separately billable costs, was capped to reflect no more than 30,000 units of EPO pe r session; more than that may reflect clinically implausible doses. CMS current ly places a similar limit on EPO reimbursement of 500,000 units per patient per month ( 26). As a result of capped average EPO costs, the remaining extre me v alues for average separately billable cost s described in Table 7-5 largely reflect services other than EPO. As shown in Table 7-5, the average MAP per session for separately billable services ranged from $22 to $206 for 90% of patients, and exceeded $297 for 1% of patients. The ou ter fence method yielded an upper cutoff ($1,358 per session) th at represents an unusually high level of resource use. This very high upper limit excluded only eight patien t observations from the model (from n=818,558 to n=818,550), with virtually no change in the analysis results. Supporting an alyses that used more restrictive criteria did not substantially improve the performance of the mo del and yielded similar case-mix multipliers (i.e., typically varying by no more than 0.01). In order to base potential case-mix adjusters on the largest possible number of Medica re dialysis patients while still placing a limit on extreme values, the upper outer fence method was used for average separately billable costs, as it was for average composite rate costs. No lower limit on separately billable costs was established for the purpose of identifying statistical outliers. It is pl ausible for a patient to incur no separately billable costs in a particular month. Analyses of the effects of patient characteristics on the average cost per session for outpatient dialysis and related services have the potential to be sensitive to individual facilities or patients with extreme costs. Their inclusion may lead th e resulting estimates to be less reflective of the typical increment in University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 48 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle cost associated with individual patient characteristics and to be less stable over time. Exclusion criteria can be used to develop methods that are as inclusive as possible with regard to the underlying Medicare dialysis patient population that is the basis for determining a case-mix adjustment, but are not unduly influenced by individual facilities or patients having extreme costs. Exclusion criteria were used for the average cost per session for both composite rate and separately billable services, and relied principally on a standard outer fence method, with one refinement based on an analysis of studentized residuals. The use of these exclusion criteria led to a substantial improvement in model performance for composite rate costs, while there was a relatively limited effect for models of separately billable costs.

DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS FO R CASE-MIX ADJUSTMENT Selection of case-mix adjustment patient characteristics from the extensive Medicare databases (see Chapter III, Overview of Data Sources) required ca reful consideration. As we developed predictive models suitable for implementation in a case -mix adjusted prospective payment system, we considered whether specific patient characteristics should be included in th e model, based on both magnitude and statistical significance of relationships between cost and the characteristic. In addition, the potential for creation of adverse incentives or social inequity by inclusion of a patient characteristic was considered. Subsequent rese arch informed CMS decisions about which patient characteristics to include in payment models. Ca se-mix measures were reviewed for accuracy and objectivity of diagnostic criteria, temporal relationship between comorbidity appearance and cost, and model parsimony. It will be particularly im portant to consid er how the comorbidity measures identified retrospectively in ou r models can be translated into comorbidity measures that can be reported prospectively for a future payment system. A. CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTION OF PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS 1. Inclusion in basic case-mix adjustment The basic case-mix adjustment (BCMA) recently instituted for the payment of CR services reflects several patient characteristics: age category, body surface area (BSA), and low body-mass index (BMI). These patient characteristics have demonstrated relations to CR costs. Prior to implementing the BCMA, the specific measures of these patient ch aracteristics were subject to extensive analyses. These analyses resulted in the selection of the specific age categories described in Chapter VI of this report (Section B, Independent Variables). They al so resulted in selection of a specific measure of body size, BSA using the DuBois formula ( 27), among many considered. Finally, these anal yses verified a commonly used definition of underweight status: BMI under 18.5. The analysis underlying these selections is presented fully in \"Methodology for Developing a Basic Case Mix Adjustment for the Medicare ESRD Prospective Payment System\" ( 7). Given the results of this prior work, and to be co nsistent with the consequent changes in Medi care payment policy, these patient characteristics are included in the case-mix models described throughout this report. 2. Magnitude and statistical signif icance of relationship to cost Given t he very large number of ESRD patients with Medicare claims, statistical significance is a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for includin g a variable in a case-mix adjustment system. Variables with very small relationships to cost are likely to be statistically significant in patient level analyses. Such variables add little to the explanat ory power of the models, and facilities caring for patients with those conditions will not receive me aningful increases in payments. To achieve these minor benefits in terms of explanatory power and actual payment changes, it may not be worth the additional complexity and administrative burden to collect and report variables with small, though statistically significant, relationships to cost. Therefore, each potential case-mix adjuster should be examined to ensure not only that its relationship to cost is statistically significant, but also that the magnitude of the relationship is economically meaningful. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 51 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle 3. Potential for adverse incentives Some comorbidities or clinical meas ures may themselves be adverse outcomes of dialysis related care. For example, recent or current measures of hemato crit may be strongly associated with ESAs and iron dosing, with lower hematocrit predicting higher subsequent costs. Therefore, using recent or current hematocrit in a payment mo del would effectively reward facilit ies achieving lower hematocrit. Preliminary analyses showed that measures of recent hematocrit had a strong effect on costs, with lower hematocrit predicting higher subsequent costs. For example, adding a measure of the average hematocrit six to eight months prior to the curre nt month to the case-mix adjustment model raised the R-squared of preliminary models by approximately five percent. Although these measures have been excluded from the focal models discussed in this report due to concer ns regarding incentives, they could be considered for a payment system pr ovided that adequate quality assurances could be implemented. 4. Social acceptability Some variables may have s tatistical relationships with costs but may be judged to not be appropriate for differential payments. Patients' race and ethnic ity are examples of variables that may be excluded from a payment model by policy makers. B. SELECTION OF PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS We began with a long list of patient characteristics that might be included in a bundled case-mix adjusted payment system. In addition to age, pa tient demographic characteristics included gender, race and Hispanic ethnicity. Physical characteristic s included measures of body size and underweight status. Duration of renal replacement therapy was al so examined as a potential payment adjuster. In addition, we considered an extensive list of patient comorbidities. Table 8-1 lists the comorbidity variables and data sources that were considered. Th e original list was based on diagnostic categories developed for the Medicare Advan tage managed care program (listed in Table 8-1) and categories developed for the comorbidities in the CMS Form 2728. Comorbidity measures based on diagnoses reported in Medicare claims used all available claims (e.g., inpatient, dialysis and other outpati ent, skilled nursing facility, physic ian/supplier, and laboratory). It should be noted that some diagnoses reported on laboratory claims may represent a condition being \"ruled out\" by the test, rather than an established diagnosis. Therefore, the use of laboratory claims to identify comorbidities may overestimate th e frequency of certain conditions. Conversely, excluding laboratory claims from the comorbidit y identification process may underestimate the frequency of certain conditions if the laboratory diagnosis reflects the presence of the condition and other claims do not identify the condition. In ongoing research, UM-KECC is re-estimating the case mix models without using diagnoses reported on laboratory claims in the comorbidity identification process. These alternative estimates of the prev alence of comorbidities an d the resulting case mix multipliers will be compared to those in this report. Table 8-1 also shows which of the comorbidity measures considered made the refined list of comorbidities included in most of the case-mix models desc ribed in this report. The refined list is the result of applying the considerations described above and the application of several analytical approaches.

Source and time frame used in model: claims since 1999 or 2728, any occurrence. Pericarditis 2728 or claims Yes See Table 8-2. Potentially ambiguous definition. In clinical practice, pericarditis classically presents with characteristic chest pain, physical exam findings (including friction rub) and often will have associated fluid in the pericardial sac which can be imaged with cardiac ultrasound. The problem is that pericardial fluid alone is probably not adequate to define pericarditis. The clinical features noted above are somewhat subjective. Not all patients will manifest all of the signs and symptoms and some patients may present in atypical manner. In ESRD patients, pericarditis can be a uremic manifestation. In addition, some literature suggests that the intermittent anticoagulation associated with dialysis may contribute to development of pericarditis in chronic dialysis patients. In theory, chronic poor dialysis could cause uremia and potentially increase the risk of uremic pericarditis. There are solutions for this potential problem (e.g., monitor facility for adequate dialysis provision; pay for pericarditis only if patient was adequately dialyzed by URR criteria). Source and time frame used in model: claims, same month to 3 months ago. Alcohol Dependence 2728 or claims Yes Combined with Drug Dependence to form Substance Abuse category. Requires strict definition as current claims diagnoses likely represent specific diagnostic severity (e.g. Inpatient Rehab admission). Source and time frame used in model: claims since 1999 or 2728, any occurrence. Drug Dependence 2728 or claims Yes Combined with Alcohol Dependence to form Substance Abuse category. Without specific definition, potential for significant expansion of diagnostic frequency. In addition, many ESRD patients are regularly prescribed potentially habit forming medications to treat uremic sleep disturbances, chronic pain, restless leg syndrome, and anxiety related to chronic illness. This further emphasizes the need for a specific definition. Source and time frame used in model: claims since 1999 or 2728, any occurrence. HIV Positive Status 2728 or claims Yes Combined with AIDS diagnosis (essentially either HIV and/or AIDS) Source and time frame used in model: claims since 1999 or 2728, any occurrence.

Providers may be able to order screening HIV studies, potentially expanding defined HIV positive pool. This may not be a bad thing, since effective treatments are available to slow the progression from asymptomatic HIV to AIDS with early diagnosis, but raises patient privacy issues. Source and time frame used in model: claims since 1999 or 2728, any occurrence. Gastro-Intestinal Tract Bleeding claims Yes Including severity in the definition is one issue. See Table 8-4 In theory, unethical practitioners could increase their use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or even warfarin. This may be far-fetched, but many dialysis patients have at least a relative indication for use of one or more of these agents. More likely, facilities could increase their screening efforts (obtain fecal occult blood testing on a regular basis (or more frequent basis if already using this as part of their anemia management program). Such testing would result in the identification of additional cases, probably of lower than average severity. Source and time frame used in model: claims, same month to 3 months ago. Lung, Upper Digestive Tract, and Other Severe Cancers claims Yes Combined with multiple other cancer diagnoses. Starting with all cancers except for non-melanoma skin cancers, we split them into the groups of cancers used by the Medicare Advantage Program. After further analysis we recombined the categories as they had very similar coefficients. Source and time frame used in model: claims, any occurrence since 1999 Lymphatic System, Head, and Other Major Cancers claims Yes Combined with multiple other cancer diagnoses Source and time frame used in model: claims, any occurrence since 1999 Metastatic Cancers claims Yes Combined with multiple other cancer diagnoses Source and time frame used in model: claims, any occurrence since 1999 Breast, Prostate, Colorectal, and Other Cancers and Tumors claims Yes Combined with multiple other cancer diagnoses Source and time frame used in model: claims, any occurrence since 1999 Septicemia/Shock claims Yes Use of separate category from pneumonias. See Table 8-3 Catheters have been shown to increase the risk of sepsis. Hypothetically, paying for blood infections is financial incentive to ignore permanent vascular access planning. See hepatitis B for infection control practices issue. Several quality assurance mechanisms currently in place (particularly Fistula First at Network level) or under development could counter this misaligned incentive.

This is a spectrum of diseases, ranging from clinically unimportant to life-threatening (malignant form is known as multiple myeloma). The presence of a monoclonal gammopathy is a lab definition which encompasses this very diverse set of clinical entities. Defining severity of monoclonal gammopathy will be important issue as we move forward.

As with other co-morbidities, defining which hereditary hemolytic anemias were identified with historical billing codes and writing the regulations to reflect those conditions or levels of severity will be important. Unlikely that all \"hereditary hemolytic anemia diagnoses were identified with our analytic strategy. For example, UpToDate electronic textbook estimates that 8-10% of African Americans have sickle cell trait (generally asymptomatic). Carrier states for other hereditary hemolytic anemias exist. If dialysis facilities begin widespread screening for these carrier states, the diagnostic frequency for hereditary hemolytic anemias could expand greatly. Defining severity will be critical in developing a fair payment model.

Need to align diagnostic criteria with historical billing code diagnostic criteria. In theory, facilities could stop vaccinating patients against hepatitis B, resulting in more cases. Alternatively, facilities could become more lax in infection control processes. This is not likely to happen as hepatitis B positive patients are difficult to dialyze (strict criteria from CDC for isolation), the facility surveyors could focus on infection control practices, staff are averse to providing care to patients with potentially highly contagious severe viral illness and CMS has discussed separate payment for vaccines, which would positively influence providers to continue vaccinating patients. Facilities could order screening tests more frequently, although they would end up bearing the cost in a widely bundled payment system. Source and time frame used in model: claims, any occurrence since 1999 Multiple Myeloma claims Yes Combined with multiple other cancer diagnoses Source and time frame used in model: claims, any occurrence since 1999 Congestive Heart Failure 2728 or claims No Diagnostic criteria are vague and would make implementation difficult. Potential for misaligned incentives as congestive heart failure term is used for clinical diagnosis of symptomatic fluid overload, potentially caused by poor dialysis care. Also CHF is very common claims comorbidity, diluting effectiveness in payment model. Ischemic Heart Disease 2728 or claims No Diagnostic criteria are vague and addition of this comorbidity to a payment model would likely result in increased coding. Myocardial Infarction 2728 or claims No Diagnostic criteria are vague and addition of this comorbidity to a payment model would likely result in increased coding Cardiac Dysrhythmias 2728 or claims No Claims comorbidity definition is too vague to allow definition of a regulation for payment variable. Significant potential for increased frequency of claims if used in a payment model, given the frequency of arrhythmias in ESRD patients Cerebrovascular Disease 2728 or claims No Common conditions and claims comorbidity definition too vague to allow creation of a regulation defining payment variable based on available detail level in claims data. Peripheral Vascular Disease 2728 or claims No Excluded both because of high prevalence of this comorbidity in claims and because of poor specificity in claims. Excluded from BCMA model in past for similar reasons. History of Hypertension 2728 or claims No Extremely high prevalence limits its value as a risk adjuster. In addition, control of hypertension is an outcome of dialysis treatment (related to control of volume overload). Use of hypertension as a comorbidity in a payment model would result in misalignment between quality and payment incentives.

Combined diagnostic category of diabetes mellitus is very common (when longest look-back period is used) limiting it's effectiveness as a payment variable. In addition, magnitude of effect in models is small. Excluded to enhance model parsimony. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 2728 or claims No Claims diagnosis is relatively subjective. More objective definition of COPD could be developed if additional diagnostic testing (spirometry/pulmonary function testing) was required to define condition, but this would be difficult to implement and potentially add significant cost. COPD is also common condition and inclusion could result in significant increased frequency of reporting. More severe forms might be identified based on whether chronic oxygen therapy was required (as described later in this section), but the administrative burden of verifying home oxygen use would be significant, and this possibility was dropped from consideration. Hyperparathyroidism 2728 or claims No Very common condition in chronic dialysis patients. Small magnitude effect on cost. Inability to Ambulate 2728 No Diagnosis is subjective. May be underreported in source data, which is limited to the 2728 Form. Inability to Transfer 2728 No Excluded by stepwise regression. Tobacco Use 2728 No Excluded by stepwise regression. Other infections claims No Claims comorbidity definition includes infections not otherwise classified. Extremely vague, and there is potential for significant increase in reporting. Currently, this diagnostic category includes over 1,000 specified infections, limiting its practical use as a payment variable. Myelofibrosis claims No Very rare. Type II or unspecified Diabetes (Primary or Contributing) claims No Accurate differentiation of Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes is difficult clinically and from claims. Combined diagnostic category of diabetes mellitus is very common (when longest look-back period is used) limiting it's effectiveness as a payment variable. In addition, magnitude of effect in models is small. Excluded to enhance model parsimony. Other Hepatitis (not B) claims No Excluded by stepwise regression. Acquired Hemolytic Anemias claims No The conditions are uncommon, the coefficients are small and the relationship with cost varied depending on the specific look-back period that was used (with multipliers varying above and below 1.00 depending on which month a relevant diagnosis was reported in the last year of claims). Other Anemias claims No Claims comorbidity definition is non-specific. How could this diagnosis be differentiated from anemia of CKD in dialysis patients? Gastrointestinal Ulcer not Hemorrhaging claims No Difficult to accurately diagnose without costly diagnostic study (UGI barium study or UGI endoscopy) and unclear relationship to GI bleeding. Analytic team, including clinicians at UM-KECC and CMM were concerned that this claims diagnosis might be present as a claims diagnosis in patients recently evaluated for GI bleeding. More analysis needed to define relationship between this category and GI bleeding Esophogeal Varices claims No Very rare. Specific diagnosis requires UGI endoscopy or other costly diagnostic imaging. Estimation of accurate coefficient limited by rarity of condition in claims. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 57 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 58 - We performed stepwise regression analyses to identify patient characteristics having a statistically significant association with measured costs.2 Comorbidity measures that were excluded as potential case-mix adjusters on the basis of not having positiv e significant relations to measured costs included inability to transfer, smokin g, and other Hepatitis. C. REFINING THE DEFINITIONS OF PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS We conducted several analyses to refine the definition and measurement of patient characteristics. These analyses were motivated by several types of measurement concerns. 1. Extent to which future reporting is likely to dif fer from measured historical prevalence Th e available comorbidity data are collected for purposes other than making case-mix adjustments to dialysis payments. CMS Form 2728 is used to establish renal failure for program eligibility. Because the presence or absence of specific comorbidities does not factor into the ultimate eligibility decision, underreporting is expected and has been verified empirically by comparison to conditions reported in patients' medical records (29 ,30,31). Claims based comorbidity measures are more current and are likely to be more c o mplete because they are drawn from claims submitted by many types of providers over a period of time. But even here there may not be a strong financial incentive for complete reporting. Therefore, polic y makers should be aware that if a variable is included in a case- mix adjustment model, it is possibl e that reporting will increase above the levels seen historically. This is particularly likely if the condition varies gr eatly in severity (e.g., mild cases may not have been reported historically) or if the presence of the diagnosis is relatively subjective. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one example of a condition with subjective diagnostic criteria, and for which severity of reported cases is likely to vary substantially. To explore the extent of such variation in severity and to determine if an observable marker for more severe cases could be identified, a measure of chronic oxygen therapy was derived from the Medicare claims. We investigated whether this measure could supplement or replace measures based on diagnosis codes for chronic obstructive pulmonary di sease. Use of oxygen therapy was determined based on durable medical equipment (DME) claims and carrier claims. For the purposes of exploratory analyses, a patient was deemed to be r eceiving chronic oxygen therapy based on three or more months with oxygen therapy within the past yea r. Medicare employs a series of explicit criteria to determine whether a patient is eligible for oxygen therapy payment. To the extent that these criteria are enforced, concerns about inappropriate oxygen prescriptions to increase payments would be mitigated. Chronic oxygen therapy occurred far less frequent ly than COPD diagnoses. However, the set of patients receiving chronic oxygen therapy is not strictly a subset of those with COPD claims diagnoses. This can be seen based on the relatively limited overlap between the two measures. A diagnosis of COPD was reported in the prior year of Medicare claims for 17.5 percent of patients and chronic oxygen therapy was identified for 5. 6 percent of patients. Both COPD and chronic 2 These analyses examined a relatively broad set of patien t characteristics that included age, body surface area and underweight status at start of RRT, gender, race, ethnicity, duration of RRT, hematocrit at start of RRT, and most of the individual comorbidities listed in Table 8-1. A facility level analysis of composite rate costs that included facility control variables, composite rate BCMA factors, and other statistically significant patient characteristic s yielded a model R-squared of 40.4%. A similar patient level stepwi se regression analysis of separately billable MAP yielded a model R-squared of 12.5%. Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle oxygen therapy were indicated for only 1.5 percent of patients. Therefore, most patients with COPD did not receive chronic oxygen therapy and most p atients receiving chronic oxygen therapy did not have a COPD diagnosis. The explanatory power of the new measures was examined in a series of models of 2004 separately billable services. Four models were estimated us ing variants of these measures. Controlling for a large set of other patient characteristics and como rbidities, the first model included only COPD, the second included only chronic oxygen therapy, th e third included both measures, and the fourth included a measure of patients with both a COPD diagnosis and chronic oxygen therapy. In the first two models, COPD and chronic oxygen therapy are significant predictors of cost and have similar multipliers (1.10 and 1.11, respectively). The expl anatory power is slightly higher with the COPD measure due to its higher prevalence. In the mo del that includes both measures, each remains a significant and independent predictor of separately billable services, with multipliers similar to those in models one and two (1.09 for COPD, 1.10 for ch ronic oxygen therapy. In the fourth model which uses the combination of COPD reported and chronic oxygen therapy, the multiplier rises to 1.18. Therefore, the combination of these two variables may be an indication of the relative severity of pulmonary disease. A related issue is how different \"look-back\" periods affect the prevalence of diagnoses (e.g., % of patients with a given diagnosis reported in the prior 6 months, year, or two years). One comorbidity for which unusually large differences existed betw een shorter and longer look back periods was diabetes. Sixty-five percent of patients were repo rted to have diabetes based on a longer look-back period (based on CMS Form 2728 and claims sinc e 1999), while only 17 perc ent of patients had a diagnosis reported on claims within the last year. Since the more proximate diabetes mellitus prevalence is low relative to what we and others have previously reported in the literature (e.g., USRDS data), using only a recent diagnosis may inadequately represent the reporting prevalence of diabetes mellitus in an implemented payment model. 2. Persistence of effect on cost Chroni c conditions (e.g., sickle cell and hereditary hemolytic anemias) are likely to have a persistent effect on costs over time. Once such a condition is identified, it is likely to persist. Certainly, chronic conditions might have acute manifestations that lead to higher costs over a short period of time, but it is unlikely that such acute flare-ups can be predicted. Hence, it is likely to be appropriate to use a long time-frame to identify chronic c onditions, with the resulting payment adjustments persisting for the patient. Conversely, acute cond itions (e.g., GI bleeding) may result in elevated costs for only a short period of time. Therefore, various time-frames were examined to determine the length of time post-d iagnosis that a payment adjustment should apply. To illustrate the process of selecting a look back pe riod, Table 8-2 presents the analysis of alternative look-back periods for pericarditis. The month-by-month analysis in the first column indicates that pericarditis in the same month, one month ago, and two months ago is significantly related to cost (p<0.05). There is also a significant relationship fo r pericarditis twelve months prior to the current month. Sensitivity analyses suggest that this result partly captures th e effect of pericarditis occurring more than twelve months ago, which are not adjusted for in this model. The second, third, and fourth columns in Table 8-2 show analyses indicating pericarditis is positively associated with costs for any definition of look-back period. Furthermore, as we extend the look-back period two findings emerge: (1) more patients are classified as having pericarditis and (2) the coefficient indicating the strength of the relationship decreases. Therefore, the longer the look back period, the fewer dollars allocated to each patient with pericarditis.

The results in Tables 8-2 through 8-4 were used to establish refined look back periods of up to two months ago and up to three months ago for pericarditis, specified infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. These two refined look back periods were compared in separate models. For administrative ease, we recommend using the same look back period for each of these three comorbidities. The result s indicated that a look back period of up to three months improved the fit of the model. Therefore, for these comorbidities, we recommend a look back period of up to three months. 3. Further refinements to patient characteristics If a more parsimoni ous model is desired, clinica lly related conditions could be combined. For example, HIV and AIDS were combined into a sing le comorbidity measure in our models, as were sickle cell and hereditary hemolytic anemias. In some cases, diagnoses were combined based on a priori clinical judgments regarding thei r likely comparability of effects on the use of dialysis related services. In other cases, preliminary analyses allowed certain diagnoses or sets of diagnoses to enter the model separately, but they were combined after the preliminary models revealed that their relationships to costs were of similar magnitude. The following example of measures of infection demonstrates how related diagnoses were grouped. Based on a priori clinical judgment, similar codes were grouped into three categories (septicemia, bacterial pneumonia, and a set of other specified infections, each with a look-back period of three months). Septicemia is the most common, presen t in 10.1% of patient months; bacterial pneumonia and the other specified infections occurred in 1.4% and 0.3% of mo nths, respectively. Septicemia had a multiplier of 1.70 in preliminary analyses, bacterial pneumonia had a multiplier of 1.43, and University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 61 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle other specified infections had a multiplier of 1.50. Because the two relatively uncommon categories had similar multipliers, they were combined into a single category. In a more parsimonious specification, septicemia had a multiplier of 1.70 an d the combined category had a multiplier of 1.47. This information is useful to develop mo re precise rules to define infection. Similarly, two earlier groupings of cancer measures were combined into a single measure that includes all cancers except non- melanoma skin cancers. The tw o previous cancer measures had similar multipliers in analyses of both separately billable and composite rate services. Given this result and based on our review of the diagnoses in each category, there appear ed to be no conceptual or empirical rationale to maintain separate categori es. Combining the categories resulted in a more parsimonious model. Additional research identified other opportunities to reduce the list of patient characteristics without major loss of predictive power. Any histories of alcohol or drug abuse were combined into one category of \"substance abuse\". We excluded mu ltiple comorbidity categories based on several characteristics, including low economic impact, vague definition, coefficient instability or high prevalence. These were congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus , COPD, other hepatitis, esophageal varices, hyperparathyroidism, other infection, and myelofibrosis. IX. A COMBINED CASE-MIX ADJUSTED MODEL FOR COMPOSITE RATE AND SEPARA TELY BILLABLE SERVICES A. COMPONENTS OF CASE-MIX ADJUSTMENT MODEL This section presents a case-mix adjustment model for a per session payment system. It is based on the refined list of patient characte ristics developed using several criteria (Chapt er VIII.). One of these criteria was the estimated relationship to cost . Since this was assessed using separate equations for composite rate and separately billable services (see Chapter VII, Section A), some factors may be proposed as payment adjusters fo r only one set of services. The relevant patient characteristics are listed in Table 9-1. These patient characteristics include the factors that comprise the existing basic case-mix adjustment for the composite rate system (age, body surface area, and a measure of underweight status), gender, duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 11 refined comorbidity measures. The relationships of these patient characteristics to measures of resource use for composite rate and separately billable services ar e examined below. We also provide results regarding th e precision and stability of the esti mates that determine the payment adjustments.

Adjustment for composite rate services The relati ons hips between patient characteristics and cost for composite rate services were estimated using a facility level regression model since patient level data are not available. This facility level model relates average patient characteristics to the reported facility costs. The BCMA was developed using a similar approach ( 7). As a result of the log transformation (see Chapter VII, Section B), the model estimate s are re ported as factors that can be applied multiplicatively to a base rate to derive a case-mix adjusted payment for individual patients. The models presented below were weighted by the number of dialysis sessions provided by the facility. Facility-year observations that account for a larger number of dialysis sessions will therefore have proportionately more influence in the analysis. Among the 11 refined comorbidity measures, potent ial payment variables were identified using a stepwise selection method. The criterion for se lecting and retaining co morbidity variables was statistical significance at the p<0.05 level. The analysis included 11,174 facility year observations during the three year period. The explanatory power of a model that included both facility contro l variables (described in Chapter VI, Sections B and C) and the patient characteristics in Table 9-2 was 38.74%. A separate model that included just University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 63 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle the facility control variables had an R-square d of 36.97%, while the inclusion of the patient characteristics shown in Table 9-2 contributed an additional 1.77% to the R-squared.

Based on age, the model indi cates the largest increment in cost for pediatric patients. The estimated multiplier of 1.42 indicates that costs were 42% higher for pediatric patients compared to the reference group of patients aged 60-69. This estimate is somewhat smaller than the current pediatric payment adjustment that was developed by CMS using a different approach (1.62). Using the current regression-based approach, the pr ecision of the pediatric multiplier is limited by the small fraction of pediatric pati ents in most facilities, as the 95% confidence interval ranges from 1.24 to 1.63 (Table 9-2). Elevated costs were observed for the youngest and oldest adult age groups (ages 18-44 and 80+, respectively) compared to the reference age group (ages 60-69). Previous research suggested that higher costs for ages 18-44 may partly reflect unme asured factors which are associated with patients in this age group (9 ). Our current research controls for several of these factors (male, drug depende n ce, urban) but not others (unexplained missed dialysis sessions, type I diabetes and HIV/AIDS). Relative to the BCMA, the current results include somewhat larger adjustments for both ages 18-44 and ages 80+. Differences among the three middle age groups were not statistically significant. The ability to dete c t m o d e s t d i f f e r e n c e s i n c o s t w i ll be limited by the number of observations that are available for a facility level analysis. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 64 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle The estimated BSA multiplier of 1.034 imp lies a 3.4% elevated cost for every 0.1m2 increase in BSA, which is slightly smaller th an the current adjustment in the BCMA (3.7% per 0.1m2). Previous research found this BSA measure, which was calculated using the DuBois formula ( 27), to be more highly pr edictive of composite rate costs than other measures of body size, such as weight or total body water. To be consistent with the BCMA, low BMI is included as a potential adjustment factor despite lacking a statistically significant relationship with CR cost in the current model ( 7). The rem aining patient characteristics in Table 9-2 have not previously been used to adjust composite rate payments. These would be new payment adjustments based on gender, duration of RRT (<4 months) and the presence of 3 comorbidities. The elevation in composite ra te costs for females was marginally significant, while a much larger effect was observed for newly treated ESRD patients. The three comorbidity measures in Tabl e 9-2 were selected by the stepwise regression as statistically significant predictors of cost. The remaining eigh t refined comorbidity measures were not found to be statistically significant. Based on this criterion, the model presented in Table 9-2 excludes them as potential payment variables. We used separate analyses by year to consider the stability of the estimates during 2002-2004 (Table 9-3). These analyses included the same independent variables as the pooled model. The stability of the estimates varies for individual case-mix measures. For example, the multipliers ranged from 1.24 to 1.34 for ages 18-44 and 1.13 to 1.40 for ages 80+ . The comorbidity measures tended to be less consistent predictors of composite rate costs, as the yearly comorbidity estimates varied in terms of both their magnitude and their statistical signific ance. The potential payment adjusters are based on the model that uses pooled data (Table 9-2), since it is expected to yield more stable estimates than separate models by year. Greater stability may lead payments to be more predictable for providers as the PPS is updated over time.

Adjustment for separately billable services Since resource use for separatel y billable services can be measured using Medicare claims, a patient level model was used to identify potential payment adjusters for sepa rately billable services. We specified a regression model, weighted by the numb er of dialysis sessions, which included the same control variables and examined the same refined li st of patient characteristics as the model of composite rate costs. The analysis included 809,208 patien t year observations during the th ree year period. The R-squared for a model that included both control variables and the patient characteristics in Table 9-4 was 8.82%. Unlike the pattern seen in the composite ra te model, the control variables accounted for only 0.84% of the variation in resource use, while the patient characteristics contributed an additional 7.98% to the overall R-squared.

These model results control for body size and the other patient characteristics which may vary by age and gender. The BSA multiplie r of 1.038 indicates an incr ease in cost of 3.8% for every 0.1 increase in BSA. When we controlled for BSA, there was a modest increase in cost for patients who were underweight (BMI less than 18.5 ( 28)). Together, these results indicate that the lowest costs were observed for patients who were smaller but were not considered underweight. A larger effect was observed for newly treated ESRD patients. MAP were 45% higher for patients in their initial 4 months of RRT. Supporting analyses showed that substantially higher doses of epoetin were administered during these initial months. Sinc e this analysis is based on Medicare claims data, the elevated cost in these initial months largely re flects the experience of patients who are already covered by Medicare and do not ne ed to wait 90 days for Medicare eligibility based on ESRD. This will primarily include patients who are at least 65 years of age. Similarly, this multiplier would largely be used to adjust payments for patients who are already Medicare-eligible at start of RRT. All 11 comorbidity variables had stati stically significant re lationships to cost (T able 9-4). However, the magnitudes of the comorbidity effects varied substantially. The largest increase in cost was associated with GI bleeding, two categories of sp ecified infections, and pericarditis (47% to 88% higher costs). These are the acute conditions where a recent diagnosis (i.e., no more than 3 months ago) leads to a temporary payment adjustment. For most of the remaining comorbidities, the model estimated much smaller effects on cost (4% to 16% for all other conditions except myelodysplastic syndrome). These are the chronic conditions for which a diagnosis leads to a permanent increase in payment based on the expectation that they will tend to have a more persistent effect on cost. Because of the large number of patient observations , most case-mix multipliers for separately billable services are estimated relatively precisely. The lower and upper 95% confidence intervals for the estimated multipliers typically reflect no more than a 3% difference in payments (Table 9-4). The relationships between these patient characteristics and cost are relati vely stable during 2002-2004, as the yearly multipliers are similar in most cases (Table 9-5).

For example, some patient characteristics that were associated with a smaller increment in cost are relatively common, and will frequently be us ed to adjust payments (e.g., ages 18-44 and 80+, female). In contrast, the conditions that were associated with a larger increment in cost tend to be less common, and will be used less frequently as payment adjusters (e.g., pericarditis, GI bleeding, bacterial pneumonia and other pneumonias/opportunistic infections). The case-mix adjustment model combines the separate adjustments for composite rate and separately billable services (Tables 9-2 and 9-4, respectively). Later in this chapter we show how these separate adjustments can be combined in a single payment formula for an expanded bundle. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 68 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 69 - B. WAGE ADJUSTMENT It is common in Medicare payment policy to ad just payments to provid ers using an index that measures geographical differences in health care workers' wages relative to the national average. There are two conceptual approaches to applying such an adjustment. One adjusts a base payment rate by an area wage index before applying other appropriate adjustments that reflect patient characteristics (Approach 1). This approach is used to adjust payments in the current composite rate payment system. The other approach would develop a payment model that simultaneously estimates multipliers for patient characteristics and the wage adjustment (Approach 2). To be consistent with current Medicare payment policy, we developed models using Approach 1. Therefore, the potential case-mix ad justment presented in the next section was based on analyses of measures of resource use that were adjusted to eliminate the effects of area wage differences on costs. This was accomplished by dividing the estimated labor share of the composite rate cost measure by an area wage index. The method that was used corresponds to the wage adjustment that is applied to composite rate payments (for details, see Chapter VI, Section A, Dependent Variables). No adjustment to the Medicare Allowable Paymen t amounts for separately billable services was necessary, since Medicare payments for these services are based on utilization levels and reimbursement rates which are currently no t adjusted for area wage differences. 3 The resulting regression models estimated case-mix adjustments that can be applied multiplicatively to a wage-adjusted payment amount. This is the approach used for the basic case-mix adjustment, which is applied to a SNF wage adjusted base rate . A similar wage adjustment may be applied to payments for an expanded bundle of outpatient dialysis services. A disadvantage of this method of accounting for wage differences is that it does not allow us to measure the extent to which adjustment for area wages accounts for variation in resource use for outpatient dialysis. We therefore performed analyses that address this question and also examine the sensitivity of the case-mix multipliers to another method of adjusting for area wages. We re-estimated the current version of the models using the SNF wage index as a predictor variable on an unadjusted measure of composite rate cost per session. In addition, we re-estimated the current version of the separately billable model adding the wage inde x as a predictor variable. The results of these analyses are summarized in Table 9-6. In the composite rate cost models , facility controls explained a sma ller proportion of the variation when the dependent variable was not adjusted for th e wage index. This result was expected because not adjusting for the wage index introduced more va riation in the measure of composite rate costs. Adding the wage index raised the R-squared by 7.4%, from 34.3% to 41.7% (Table 9-6). The R- squared of the model with fa cility controls, wage index, and case-mix was 43.4%. Adding the wage index had essentially no impact on the explanatory power of the separately billable model (Table 9-6) since Medicare Allowable Payments for separately billable services do not reflect an adjustment for the area wage index. In addition, measures of the actual costs of inputs such as labor are not available. 3 If the actual costs of inputs (drugs, labor, etc.) could be measured for separa tely billable services, it would be feasible an d appropriate to also adjust them for the area wage index. Ho wever, research by the CMS Offi ce of the Actuary shows that the labor share of costs for separately billable items is quite sm all. Therefore, even if cost data were available, wage adjusting for separately billable services would not have a substantial effect.

For both the composi te rate and se parately billable models, the esti mated case-mix coefficients were not substantially different when adding the wage index as a predictor variable (Table 9-7). The largest difference was observed for the pediatric mu ltiplier (1.48 vs. 1.42), which has limited precision due to the relatively small number of pediatric dialysis patients. Other multipliers varied by no more than three percentage points. To measure how well the wage adjustment accounts for the variation in resource use for an expanded bundle, we estimated two log-linear models for compos ite rate and separately billable services which included control variables and the wage index, and calculated predicted composite rate and separately billable values based on the estimated multiplier for th e wage index. We obtained actual bundle costs and predicted bundle costs by summarizing the ac tual and predicted separately billable costs for individual patients to the facilit y level and adding these two variab les to the actual and predicted composite rate costs, respectively. Then, we regressed the predicted bundle costs on actual bundle costs. The R-squared of this mo del was 4.9%. This estimate suggests that the wage index accounts for 4.9% of the variation in provider costs for an expanded bundle of outpatient dialysis services. The results from this analysis demonstrate the extent to which a wage index adjustment accounts for variation in measured dialysis costs.

Composite rate costs were adjusted for area wage differences by dividing the assumed labor share of facility CR costs (53.711% based on the 2005 ESRD final rule) by the SNF wage index that corresponds to each facility's location (using the wage index published in the 2005 fi nal rule for the SNF PPS).

COMBINING COMPOSITE RATE AND SEPARATELY BILLABLE CASE-MIX ADJUSTMENT MODELS The selection of patient characteristics as paymen t variables was based on several criteria, including the relationship to resource use for outpatient dialysis services (see Chapter VIII). This was assessed using a modeling approach that used separate equations for composite rate and separately billable services as described earlier in this section. While the potential case-m ix adjustment is based on separate estimating equations, they can be combin ed in a single payment formula for an expanded bundle. Table 9-8 demonstrates a method to combine the estimated payment multipliers for composite rate and separately billable services. The first two columns repeat the model re sults from the Case-mix section (Mult CR and Mult SB in Tables 9-2 and 9-4, respectively). The third column presents a single payment multiplier for each patient characteristic based on its relationship to resource use for both sets of services.

The payment multipliers in the third column of Table 9-8 (Mult EB) were calculated as the weighted average of the CR and SB multipliers. The weights reflect each component's proportion of the total estimated costs, so that the resulting case-mix adjustment reflects the overall relationship between patient characteristics and estimated costs for an expanded bundle of services. Measures of resource use for each component are reported in Table 9- 9. The estimated MAP amounts for separately billable services were updated to reflect the revise d payment rates for the t op 11 injectable drugs as of the 1 st quarter of 2006 (these drugs are listed in Chap ter VI, Sections A, Dependent Variables). The weights were calculated using three years of pooled data. The average cost for composite rate services was $162.00 per session based on the Medica re Cost Reports for fr eestanding and hospital- based dialysis facilities. The av erage Medicare Allowable Payment fo r separately billable services was University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 73 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle $83.18 per session based on the Medicare claims. These average costs were estimated for the Medicare dialysis patients and facilitie s included in the case-mix analyses.

MAP amounts were re priced to reflect 2006Q1 paymen t rates for the top injectable drugs. Based on total estimate d costs of $245.18 per session ($162.00+ $83.18), the resulting weights are 0.661 for composite rate services ($1 62.00/$245.18 ) and 0.339 for separately billable services ($83.18/$245.18). Using these weights, the payment multipliers presented in the third column of Table 9-8 were defined as Mult EB = 0.661\u00d7Mult CR + 0.339\u00d7Mult SB. These multipliers represent a single set of payment adjuster s for an expanded bundle of outpatient dialysis services. Several patient characteristics were identified as payment adjusters only for separately billable services. Based on the stepwise regression, these pa tient characteristics did not have a statistically significant association with composite rate costs. These include the nine comorbid conditions in Table 9-8 which have a compos ite rate multiplier of Mult CR=1. For these patient characteristics, there is no payment adjustment for composite ra te services, so that the payment adjustment multiplier is (0.661\u00d71) + (0.339\u00d7Mult SB). The modeled payment multipliers in the third column of Table 9-8 re flect the combined results from the two separate equations. The pediatric mult iplier of 1.091 implies a 9.1% upward payment adjustment for patients under age 18 relative to the reference age group (ages 60-69). This reflects the net effect of an upward payment adjustment for composite rate services and a downward payment adjustment for separately billable services. The remaining age multipliers reflect a U-shaped effect that is a somewhat diluted version of the pattern that was observed for composite rate services only, since adult age did not have a strong relati onship with the utilization of separately billable services. There are larger payment adjustments for ages 18-44 (20.9%) and 80+ (12.8%) and smaller payment adjustments for ages 45-59 (0.6%) and 70-79 (2.6%) relative to the reference age group of ages 60-69. There are upward payment adjustments for females (8 .8%), patients with a larger body surface area (3.5% per 0.1m 2 increase in BSA) and patients consider ed to be underweight (5.4%). Among the remaining factors, the largest payment multipliers generally reflect temporary adjustments to the payment amount. This includes upward adjustments for patients in the first 4 months of renal replacement therapy (55.1%) and for patients with the following diagnoses in the current month or University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 74 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle three previous months: pericarditis (20.6%), septicemia (28.5%), bacterial pneumonia, other pneumonias and opportunistic infections (15.9%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (30.0%). The remaining adjustments are for comorb idities that are relatively chroni c, and will persist following an initial diagnosis. The upward pa yment adjustment for these comorbid ities is frequently either less than 5% (cardiac arrest, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, and cancer excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) or between 5% and 10% (hereditary hemolytic or sickle cell anemias and myelodysplastic syndrome). The payment adjustments exceed 10% for alcohol/drug dependence (12.2%) and monoclonal gammopathy (28.6%). While the explanatory powers of the separate comp osite rate and separately billable equations were described earlier in this section, we also develo ped an overall measure of the explanatory power of the combined results from the two separate equations. This measure was based on a comparison between the measured cost per session for an ex panded bundle and the cost per session that was predicted using both the composite rate and sepa rately billable equations. Because no measure of composite rate cost exists at the patient level, the measure of overall explanatory power is constructed at the facility leve l. In other words, this explanatory power measure should be interpreted as reflecting the ability of differences in case mix across facilities to explain differences in average costs across facilities. We used the model estimates for both control variables and payment variables to calculate predicted costs for an expand ed bundle including both composite rate services and separately billable services. The predicted costs were then retransformed to dollars, which as the unit of reimbursement will be more relevant to pr oviders than log dollars. We calculated this for each patient in each month, and then summarized this data to determine the average predicted cost per session to the facility level for each year of data (2002-2004). A similar summarization approach was used to calculate each facilit y's measured cost per session. We then examined the percent of facility level variation in measured costs that is explained by the predicted costs by using the R-squared value from a linear regression model. The predicted cost per session for an expanded bundle explained 34 percent of the variation in the measured cost per session. Facility control variable s accounted for 31 percent of the variation, while the patient characteristics in Table 9-1 contributed an additional 3 percentage points to the R-squared. X. DETERMINATION OF PER SESSION PAYMENT AMOUNT The case-mix adjusted per session payment rate requires establishing a base payment rate and making adjustments for area wage index and patient characteri stics. In addition, there will likely need to be an outlier adjustment for very high cost patients. The manner in which these payment components are combined to determine the per sessi on payment amount is described below. A. BASE PAYMENT RATE To illustrate how payment amounts for an expanded bundle could be determined, we calculated a base payment rate in 2006 dollars. This base rate reflects estimates of the average Medicare Allowable Payment for composite ra te and separately billable servi ces in 2006. The average MAP for composite rate services was calc ulated using the 2006 base composite rates of $130.40 per session for freestanding dialysis facilities and $134.53 session fo r hospital-based facilities. We calculated a weighted average of these two rates based on the number of hemodialysis equivalent dialysis sessions University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 75 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 76 - reported for each type of facility during 2002-2004. The basic case-mix adju stment was applied using Medicare dialysis patient ch aracteristics during 2002-2004. The 2006 drug add-on and budget neutrality adjustments of 1.145 and 0.9116, respectively, were used. This resulted in an estimate of $151.48 for the average composite rate payment during 2006. The average MAP for separately billable services was calculated using Medicare claims during 2002-2004. The MAP amounts were adjusted to reflect payment rates for the top 11 injectable drugs during the 1st quarter of 2006. This resulted in an estimate of $83.18 per session for the average separately billable payment. The resulting base rate was $234.66 per session ($151.48+$ 83.18). This estimate will be used as the base rate in the hypothetical examples presented below. B. WAGE ADJUSTMENT The $234.66 base payment reflects the payment to a provider in an area where the wage index is equal to 1. For geographic areas with higher or lower wage indices, the labor portion of the base rate is adjusted by the wage index multiplier. The es timated labor related share for an expanded bundle of outpatient dialysis services is 39.278% based on analysis of the ESRD market basket by the CMS Office of the Actuary. Using a hypothetical wage index of 1.10, the new labor portion of the base payment rate will increase by 10%. The wage-adjusted base rate is then form ed by adding the labor portion, adjusted for the wage index, and the unadjusted no n-labor portion. In this example, the wage-adjusted base payment rate is calculated as: $234.66*0.39278*1.10 + $234.66*(1-0.39278) = $243.88 A budget neutrality adjustment could be applied to this value if the average wage index differs from 1. C. PATIENT MULTIPLIERS The payment multipliers reported in Chapter IX, A Combined Case-Mix Adjusted Model for Composite Rate and Separately Billable Services, can be used to derive case-mix adjusted payment rates for individual patients. The principal step is to calculate a patient-specific multiplier (PM). The PM is then applied to the wage-adjusted base rate to calculate the per-session payment. If additional adjustments are needed to account for outliers, they are made once the per session rate has been determined. Another budget neutrality adjustment is necessary to reflect the fact that the average patient multiplier adjustment (illustrate d below) is larger than 1. 4 4 Based on an average patient multiplier of 1.21 during 2002-2004, an estimate of this adjustme nt is 0.83 (1/1.21). This adjustment is not used in the hypothetical examples. Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle D. OUTLIER PAYMENTS The payment models described in this report are intended to adjust payment for patient characteristics associated with higher cost of care . In some cases, however, patients incur extremely high costs that are not adequately reflected in the payment model. To reduce the provider risk associated with very high cost patients, consideration of an outlier payment policy is recommended. A limitation in defining an outlier payment mechanism is the lack of patient-level data on the cost of composite rate services. However, it is the bundling of services now separa tely billed that creates new financial risk for facilities, may impair access to appropriate care and co uld be addressed by an outlier payment system. We therefore defined high cost patients as those who use markedly more separately billable services th an predicted by the case-mix adjusted payment model. Given the absence of patient-level cost data, we used patient-level utilization data for separately billable services to identify \"high cost\" patients. The average acquisition costs to dialysis providers of the top 11 injectable drugs, which account for 87% of separately billable payments, have been studied and reported by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) ( 32,33 ). Medicare used the OIG data to establish payment rates that more accurately reflect the cost to faciliti e s of acquiring and administering these medications. Patient-level sepa rately billable costs were estimated by applying these Medicare payment rates to historical patient- level utilization. This approach is similar to that used to define outliers for Medicare's prospective payment system for hospital inpatient care. In that system, outliers are generally patients who utilize high amounts of diagnostic and therapeutic services, which are priced at national average cost-to-charge ratios. We designed a hypothetical outlier payment system to show how such a system might work and to simulate the costs and impact of targeting extra pa yments for patient months whose costs exceeded a specified threshold. To define outlier cases, we identified patient months in which SB MAP per session exceeded the mean by 2 or more standard devi ations. This process resulted in a threshold of $240 per session for SB MAP. Th e facilities treating these patien ts were assumed to receive an outlier payment of 60% of the difference between the SB MAP and the threshold amount. This outlier payment represents an add-on to the case-mix adjusted payment that they would normally receive. Selection of the outlier payment percentage should balance concern with crea ting incentives for the use of separately billable services against the object ive of minimizing financial risk. As long as the cost to facilities of the inputs required to deliver additional services is greater than 60% of the MAP, there will be no such incentive to increase utilization inappropriately to receive outlier payments. Sixty percent was chosen to yield an outlier paym ent that would not be likely to create such an incentive for facilities. Complete data on the cost in curred in delivering additional separately billable services are not available. Based on data presente d earlier in this report, injectable drugs comprised 88% of SB MAP for outpatient dialysis related se rvices in 2005. A recent OIG report on drug acquisition costs for the top 10 ESRD drugs indica tes costs averaged 78% and 86% of MAP for the four largest dialysis organizations and for other dialysis facilities, respectively ( 32). The OIG later reported that costs for darbepoe tin alfa averaged 73% of MAP as of the first quarter of 2005 ( 33). Starting in 2 005, Medicare drug payment rates we re reduced, resulting in an increas e in these percentages. The vast majority of the input costs for injectable drugs are variable costs (e.g., drug acquisition costs and labor related to the administration of drugs) rather than fixed costs (e.g., facilities and equipment). These considerations support the conclusion that an outlier payment percentage of 60% or even higher will not create an adverse incentive. Note that the ultimate selection of an outlier payment percentage will in fluence the total dollars committed to outlier University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 77 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle payments as opposed to the base rate. As a point of reference, the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system employs an outlier payment percentage of 80%. Eligible separately billable costs can be determined thro ugh a number of different mechanisms. One model would require facilities to su bmit separately billab le data to Medicare. Medicare would then apply a predetermined payment rate to the utiliz ation data to approximate a dialysis facility's separately billable costs. The outlier threshold for separately billable services may be revised based on updated billing data. If these data are not available, the threshold could be adjusted in other ways such as applying a price index or through the setting of a targ et percentage of outlier payments. The following example illustrates the hypothetical outlier adjustment. The case-mix adjustment model generates a bundled payment of $325 per session for an exampl e patient. This hypothetical patient incurred $300 per session of SB MAP and $150 per session of composite rate costs for a total of $450 per session. Based on an outlier payment percentage of 60%, the facility payment would then be the sum of the case-mix adjusted base payment and the SB outlier add-on payment, $325 + 0.6*($300-$240) = $361 per session for that month. Application of any specific outlier payment model generates aggregate outlier payments that must be taken into account in setting payment rates to ensure budget neutrality. Using the hypothetical outlier payment model outlined ab ove, we calculated aggregate outlier payments. Using this information, we determined how much the average payment per session would rise, and then deflated the average base payment to maintain budget neutrality. Following this method, 5.3% of patient months were id entified as outliers. A reduction of 1. 8% to the separately billable portion of the base payment rate, which corresponds to an es timated 0.7% of the base payment rate for an expanded bundle, was sufficient to fund hypothetic al outlier payments for these patient months. To assess the utility of an outlie r payment model to reduce facility payment risk, one can compare the standard deviation of costs relative to payments before and after applying the model. As shown in Table 10-1, the standard deviation of SB MAP per se ssion was $57.32. The st andard deviation of the prediction error in the case-mix adjustment model was $54.92. Adding the outlier payment system with a 60% outlier payment percentage further reduced the standard deviation of the prediction error to $50.45. Therefore, adding the outlier paymen t system resulted in a larger reduction in the prediction error than th e case-mix adjustment. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 78 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle Table 10-1 Impact of a hypothetical outlier payment system on Medicare Allowable Payments (MAP) for separately billable services, 2004 (n=282,049) No outlier payment system Actual MAP per session Predicted MAP per session Prediction Error Mean Std payment system based on all SB services (budget neutral) using a 60% outlier payment percentage Actual MAP per session Predicted MAP per session + outlier payment Prediction Error Mean Std payment system based on all SB services (budget neutral) using an 80% outlier payment percentage Actual MAP per session Predicted MAP per session + outlier payment Prediction Error Mean Std of using an altern ative hypothetical outlie r payment model with a higher outlier payment percentage of 80%, which may not be sufficiently high to create an adverse incentive. Under this model, the facility payment for the same hypothetical patient described above would be increased to $325 + 0.8*($300-$240) = $ 373 per session for the month, reflecting the higher outlier payment (vs. $361 when using an outlier payment percentage of 60%). An 80% outlier payment percentage would further re duce the financial risk to facilities, as the standard deviation of the prediction error in the case-mix model declined to $49.16. In order to fund the higher outlier payments for the 5.3% of patient months identified as outliers, a slightly larger reduction of 2.5% to the separately billable portion of th e base payment rate, or a 0.9% reduction to the base payment rate for the expanded bundle (vs. a 0.7% reduct ion with a 60% outlier payment), was needed. To qualify for the outlier payment in this hypothet ical system facilities woul d report all separately billable services delivered. This system would not re sult in administrative si mplification of the billing process. To simplify the process, we defined outliers as patient months in which MAP for epoetin and darbepoetin exceeded the mean by 2 standard deviations or more. This simpler outlier method identified many of the same patient months. Of the patient months that were identified as an outlier by the original method, 82.5% were also identified as an outlier by the simpler method (Table 10-2). However, a substantial number of additional patient months were identified as outliers only by the simpler method (1.6% of all patient months, representing 26.3% of all outliers identified by the simpler method).

RELATIVELY HEALTHY, NO COMORBIDITIES A 45 year old male (height: 187.96 cm, weight: 95 kg) with chronic glomerulonephritis and hypertension underwent AV fistula creation in 2000 and was diagnosed with ESRD in 2001. The patient also has secondary hyperparathyroidism. The patient-specific multiplier (PM) for this example reflects adjustments for age and BSA.5 The BSA multiplier is calculated in the same manner employed by the basic case-mix adjustment for the Medicare ESRD prospective payment system ( 4). A patient with the average BSA of 1.87 m2 will not receive any upward or downward adjustment to the patient-specific multiplier based on their specific BSA. Patients having a BSA value above average (1.87 m 2) will receive an upward adjustment and those below will receive a downward adjustment. This does not preclude other adjustments (age, gender, or other comorbidities) from changi ng the overall patient specific multiplier. PM = M age * M BSA PM = 1.006 * 1.035^((BSA - 1.87)/0.1) = 1.006 * 1.1264 = 1.1332 For this patient there is a 0.6% increase to the wage-adjusted base rate based on age because the age category coefficient for a 45 year old is 1.006. Th ere is also a multiplicative adjustment of 12.64% due to the patient's BSA. 6 These case-mix multipliers co mbine to form the PM of 1.1332. The 1.1332 PM is then applied to th e hypothetical wage-adjusted base rate of $243.88 resulting in a per-session payment of $276.36 (1.1332 x $243.88). 5 BSA is calculated using the DuBois formula (27): BSA = 0.007184 * (height in cm^0.725) * (weight in kilograms^0.425). 6 This multiplier was derived by raising the BSA multiplier of 1.035 to the power of the difference between the patient's BSA and the average BSA of 1.87, scal ed to reflect increments of 0.1 m2; that is, there is a 1.035 multiplier for every 0.1m2 above the average BSA and a 1/1.035 multiplier for every 0.1m2 below the average BSA.

MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES A 66 year old female (height: 167.64 cm, weight: 105 kg) wi th diabetes mellitus, a history of chronic Hepatitis B, parathyroidism, and liver cirr hosis. The patient was diagnosed with ES RD in 1995 and esophageal varices in 2006 and had a diagnosis of upper gastrointest inal (GI) bleeding the previous month. The patient-specific multiplier (PM) for this example must be calculated by adjusting to account for gender, BSA, Hepatitis B, and upper GI bleeding. PM = M gender * M BSA * M Hepatitis B * M GI bleed PM = 1.088 * 1.035^((BSA - 1.87)/0.1) * 1.014 * * 1.300 = 1.5676 The patient receives an 8.8% increase in payment re lated to gender, a 9.30% increase related to BSA, and a 1.4% increase for costs associated with treating Hepatitis B. Furthermore, the patient multiplier reflects a 30.0% increase because the patien t has had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in the last three months. The 1.5676 PM is then applied to the wage adjusted base rate of $243.88 for a per session payment of $382.31 (1.5676 x $243.88). C. ELDERLY, LOW BMI (<18.5 KG/M2), AND HOSPITALIZATION An 82 year old female (height: 160.02 cm, weight: 45.36 kg) with longstanding type II diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with ESRD in 2002. The patient has known coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease. She began 2006 dialyzing via an upper arm AV fistula (created in 2002). In March, 2006, after an attempted declot of the AV fi stula (which was unsuccessful), the patient experienced additional bleeding complications and has been dialyzed via a catheter since. Patient was again admitted to hospital in the prior month after suffering a witnessed cardiac arrest during dialysis. She was diagnosed with myocardial infarction and underwent coronary artery angioplasty and coronary artery stent placement during that hospitalization. She was again admitted to the hospital on the 14 th of the current month for congestive heart failure. The current patient-specific multip lier (PM) for this example adjusts for age, gender, BSA, BMI, and cardiac arrest. PM = M age * M gender * M BSA * M BMI * M Cardiac Arrest PM = 1.128 * 1.088 * 1.035^((BSA - 1.87)/0.1) * * 1.031 = 1.1504 The patient receives a 12.8% increase related to ag e, an 8.8% increase related to gender, a 13.74% decrease related to a small BSA, a 5.4% increase for costs associated with a low BMI, and a 3.1% increase for the additional costs associated with treating a patient with a recent history of cardiac University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 81 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle arrest. The 1.1504 PM is then applied to a wage-adjusted base rate of $243.88 for a per session payment of $280.56 (1.1504 x $243.88). D. OUTLIER PAYMENTS A 59 year old female (height: 162.56 cm, weight: 81 kg) diagnosed with ESRD and lymphoma in 2002. The patient receives 120,000 units of EPO pe r week due to bone marrow hyporespo nsiveness. She has received blood transfusions every other month (2 units). The patient-specific multiplier (PM) for this example adjusts for age, gender, BSA, and cancer. PM = M age * M gender * M BSA * M cancer PM = 1.006 * 1.0858 * 1.035^((BSA - 1.87)/0.1) * 1.03 = 1.006 * 1.0858 * 1.035^((1.8640 - 1.87)/0.1) * 1.03 = 1.006 * 1.0858 * 1.035^(-0.06) * 1.03 = 1.006 * 1.088 * 0.9979 * 1.03 = 1.1250 This patient receives a 0.6% increase due to age, an 8.8% increase for gender, a 0.21% decrease for a low BSA, and a 3.0% increase related to the lymphoma. The 1.1250 PM is then applied to a wage adjusted base rate of $243.88 for a per se ssion payment of $274.37 (1.1250 x $243.88). The dialysis provider has submitted separately billable utilization data, documenting the extensive separately billable resour ces used in treatment of this patient. Medicare has applied predetermined payment rates and found the allowable separately billable payment for this patient to be $400 per session. Using a Medicare determined global thresh old of $240 per session, there is a total of $160 per session in cost that is eligible for reimbursement at 80% for a total additional payment of $128 per session. Medicare determined SB costs $400 Medicare global outlier threshold -$240 Eligible costs for reimbursement $160 Reimbursement percentage x 80% Total outlier payment $128 The total per session payment to the facility would then be $402.37 ($274.37 for the case-mix and wage adjusted rate + $128 outlier payment). E. YOUNG PEDIATRIC PATIENT A 24 month old male (height: 74.93 cm, weight: 13 kg) who began renal replacement therapy 8 months ago. Pediatric dialysis is extraordinarily rare, and its cost is not well projected by our case-mix coefficients. The downward BSA adjustments outw eigh any payment increases related to those less than 18 years of age. This is primarily due to the small number of pediatric cases in the dialysis population and their very small size. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 82 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle The patient-specific multiplier (PM) for this example is adjusted for age, and BSA. PM = M age * M BSA PM = 1.091 * 1.035^((BSA - 1.87)/0.1) = * 0.6217 = 0.6783 This patient receives a 9.1% increase due to ag e but a 37.83% decrease for a low BSA. The 0.6783 PM is then applied to a wage adjusted base rate of $243.88 fo r a per session payment of $165.42 (0.6784 x $243.88). We have conducted additional analyses that demonstrate predicted SB MAP fall substantially short of actual SB MAP for all pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age). We believe the problem is specifically related to the body size adjustment and derives from the fact that our analyses are based on very few pediatric patients. The estimated BSA multiplier (1.034) therefore does not accurately reflect the relationship between BSA and SB costs of small patients. Another potential source of the problem is that pediatric patients may not be fully and accurately identified with available data. Therefore, the model presented in this report should not be applied to pediatric patients. F . EXAMPLES AT DIFFERENT FACILITIES The five hypothetical examples presented above applied the same wage adjustment (1.10) to the estimated base rate. To illustrate the effect of th e wage adjustment on the payment amount, we used the same five examples to calculate payment amounts for facilities having other wage indices. The resulting case-mix and wage-adjusted payment amounts are presented in Table 11-1.

INTRODUCTION Legislated changes to the ESRD payment system must be studied relative to the current payment system. As described in Chapter V of this report, the current payment system consists of composite rate and separately billable services. The composite rate covers a specified, limited bundle of services that comprise the basic dialysis session. It is pa id prospectively and adjust ed for a limited set of facility characteristics (local he alth care worker wages and hosp ital-based status) and patient characteristics (age, body surface area, and low body mass index). Services outside the composite rate bundle, such as injectable medica tions and non-routine la boratory tests, are billed separately on a fee- for-service basis. The changes would expand the comp osite rate bundle to include many separately billable services, increase the prospective payment to cover thes e services, and implement several new payment adjustments to the expanded bundle. Payment adjustments are necessary because the cost to deliver both composite rate and separate ly billable services varies from one patient to another. Without appropriate payment adjustments, patients with characteristics that indicate that they would be costlier than average to treat may face difficulties gaining access to care or obtaining optimal treatment. For the impact analyses presented here, we simulated dialysis facility payments under both current and modeled payment systems to generate two different annual payments to each U.S. dialysis facility for 2002-2004. The analysis was done at the facility level due to the unavailability of a measure of composite rate costs at the patient level. First, we examined the variation of measured costs, current payments, and modeled payments across facilities. Second, we compared the average differences between current payments and mode led payments across different type s of facilities. The analyses presented in this section assume no change in re source utilization by dialysis facilities and other providers. The actual financial impact of the payment system described in this report might vary from these analyses if providers change patterns of resource utilization in response to the new payment system. B. METHODS Our analysis focused on the difference between payments in the current system and payments under the model system. We also compared payments under these two systems to estima tes of facility costs. We combined facility level costs of composite rate services, as reported in the Medicare Independent Renal Dialysis Facility Cost Reports (Form CMS 265-94) and the Medicare Hospital Cost Reports (Form CMS 2552-96), and aggregated patient level costs of separately billable services to the facility level. Measures of separately billable costs were based on utilization as reported in Medicare claims from 2002-2004, but utilization was pr iced by using Medicare fees that prevailed in the first quarter of 2006. Therefore, separately b illable cost measures were based on recent Medicare payment rates that reflect studies of acquisition costs for key injectable medications. Using these data, we calculated the per session cost for each facility year. by adding the aver age Medicare Allowable Payment (MAP) per session for separately billable services from the Medicare claims (mean $82.79) to the average cost per session for composite rate services from the facility's Cost Reports (mean $162.00). University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 84 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle We also calculated two estimated per session paymen ts for each facility year: one under the current system and another under the mo del system. For case mix adjust ments, the characteristics and comorbidities of patients were obtained from the Medical Eviden ce Form (CMS Form 2728) and Medicare claims. The per session payment under the current system wa s calculated by adding each patient's monthly separately billable per session cost s (mean $82.79) to the estimated composite rate payment used in 2006. The 2006 base rate for com posite rate payments, before wa ge adjustment, was $130.40 per dialysis session for freestanding units and $134. 53 for hospital-based units. The basic case-mix adjustment was applied using multipliers for BSA, low BMI, and age. We also used the prevailing drug add-on and budget neutrality adjustment multipliers for 2006 ( 22). The result is a mean adjustment multiplier for case-mix, drug add-on, and budget neutrality of 1.16. The pe r session payment under the model system was calculated differently. In this system, the composite rate services and separately billable services are bundled together. Therefore, a case-mix payment adjustment multiplier was first calculat ed for each patient month. This adjustment accounted for patient case-mix including age, sex, BMI, BSA, time since start of ESRD, and comorbid conditions (see the combined case-mix ad justment model presented in Chapter IX, Section C). The mean case-mix multiplier un der the model system was 1.2088. Then, we defined a base rate for this system th at preserved budget neutrality with the current payment system. This was done by setting the total dollars paid to this set of facilities between 2002- 2004 equal under each payment system. As describe d in Chapter X, the me an Medicare Allowable Payment under the current system was estimated to be $234.66 per dialysis session in 2006 prior to applying the wage adjustment. The modeled case -mix adjusted payment amount was adjusted for budget neutrality by multiplying mo deled payments by the reciprocal of the mean case-mix multiplier under the model system (1 / 1.2088 = 0.8273). Wage adjustments were calculated slightly diff erently for the current and modeled payments. The current composite rate service payment adjustment was based on a blended MSA wage adjustment and the updated CBSA wage adjustment. Modeled payments were calculated using only the updated CBSA wage adjustment. At the end of the current 4 year transition period (ending December 31, 2009) the MSA wage adjustment will no longer be used. The modeled payments also include an updated labor share of 39.278% for the expanded bundle ESRD market basket from the CMS Office of the Actuary. After applying the current wage adjustment, the estimated average wage-adjusted MAP in the current system was $237.97 per session. After applying the CBSA wage adjustment, the estimated average wage-adjusted MAP in the model system was $238.31/session. To keep the model system budget neutral with the current syst em, a budget neutrality adjustment of 0.9986 ($237.97/$238.31) was applied to th e modeled payments, setting th e mean payments in the two systems to $237.97. This value was used as the base rate for the analyses presented in this section. The small number of facilities for which we coul d not determine the wage index did not receive a wage adjustment. While it is impo rtant to note the slightly different methods for wage adjustment between the current and model systems, other versions of this analysis (not shown here) which used different wage adjustment methods and unadjusted methods showed little difference in the results presented below. This analysis did not include an outlier payment policy that reimburses facilities for treating unusually high cost patients (see Section X, Determination of per Session Payment Amount). University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 85 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle All data sources cover the time period from 2002 through 2004. The final data set included 4,007 facilities in 2002, 4,152 facilities in 2003, and 4,323 facilities in 2004 for 12,482 total facility-years. C. EFFECT ON FACILITY TYPES To study the effect of the new pa yment system on different types of facilities, patient month data was aggregated to the facility year level. Each facility year was assigned to one group in each of the following classifications, and the mean payments in each group were compared to determine if facilities in that group would receive high er or lower payment in the new system. Urban or rural - Designation is based on whether the facility's physical address in the CMS data was in a metropolitan statistical area (urban) or not (rural) according to the Core Based Statistical Areas announced in June 2003 by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Note that facilities in micro politan statistical areas we re classified as rural. Hospital-based or freestanding - Designation based on CMS data. Small, medium, or large - Designation based on the number of dialysis sessions provided per year according to CMS data.

RESULTS Table 12-1 shows descriptive statistics for measured costs, current payments , and modeled payments. Figure 12-1 shows the percent of sessions by do llars per session, while Figure 12-2 shows the distributions of costs, current payments , and modeled paymen ts as box plots. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 86 - Results of Research on Case-mix Ad justment for an Expanded Bundle The variation in payments was much lower than the variation in measured costs in both the current and model payment systems. In the current payment system, composite rate services are already bundled, and variation in the comp osite payment rate across facilities is substantially lower than variation in reported costs. The variation in the modeled payments is even lower than the variation in the current payments. Most of the difference in vari ation is explained by expansion of the bundle to include services previously separately billed by facilities. These comparisons reflect differences among measured costs, current payments, and modeled payments, not the fit of the statistical models (see the previous section on the Final Payment System for more on statistical model fit). It is interesting to note the difference in how payments are distributed around the mean of $237.97 in the current system and in the model system. In the current system, 54.6% of facility-years had a per session payment under the mean, compared to 56.0% in the model payment system. This shift is also seen in the reduction of the 99 th percentile per session payment of $296.30 under the current system to $280.03 under the model syst em, while the change in 1st percentile payments is smaller ($191.82 under the current system compared to $209.40 under the model system). Overa ll, 54.3% of facility years have an increased per session payment in th e model system when compared to the current system. Table 12-2 and Figure 12-3 show the average change in the per session payments to different types of dialysis facilities. The overall average change is constrained to be zero. Both systems use the same number of facilities, the same number of dialysis sessions, and the same to tal dollars. Each facility type has an average payment difference of less th an 6%, except for the small groups of Alaskan facilities (4 facilities represented by 6 facility-year s) and of facilities currently receiving an IEF composite rate payment (4 facilities, represented by 10 facility-years). Urban facilities, freestanding facilities, facilities with less than 5,000 sessions per year, facilities owned independently, facilities owned by a regional chai n, facilities with unknown ownership, facilities designated as IEFs, and facilities that provide a large amount of PD tend to have higher payments in the model system than in the current system. On the other hand, rural fa cilities, facilities with at least 5,000 sessions per year, facilities owned by a LDO, facilities not on the IEF lists, and facilities that provide little or no PD tend to have lower payments in the model system than in the current system. Hospital based facilities also receive a $3.89 lo wer payment under the model system, assuming the current $4 payment differential between hospital based and freestanding facilities built into the composite rate system does not continue. Facilities in the East North Cent ral, East South Central, South Atlantic, and West South Central census regions tend to have lower payments in the model system when compared to the current system.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Various specific operational issues will need to be resolved before impl ementing an expanded prospective payment system. A number of the important issues are discussed below. A. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, BILLING, AND CONTRACTING 1. Billing for sessions or months If a per session payment approach is adopted, dial ysis facilities will be requi red to bill Medicare for services provided on a per session basis. A monthly bi ll similar to that currently in place, wherein the facility reports the number of sessions provided to the patient, should be sufficient. Patients receiving outpatient dialysis sessions at more th an one facility in the month do not pose any particular problems here, as all facilities can be paid for the number of sessions they provide, subject to limitations that may be set on the total number of billable sessions per unit of time. A per session payment also preserves facilities' incentives to encourage patient compliance with the prescribed number of dialysis sessions. These incentives may even be strengthened under an expanded bundle because a skipped session also results in losing the capitation payment for drugs and labs; in the current system, the facility can make up for lost drug and lab billings by providing \"make up\" services at the next session. In addition, a per session payment allows Medicare to capture mid-month changes that may occur in payment adjusters (age, comorbidities, facility, etc.). If a per month payment a pproach is adopted, it is likely th at one facility will be designated the primary dialysis provider and will receive the paym ent for the entire month. The primary dialysis provider will bill Medicare for all covered services provided. For the roughly 80 percent of patient months where there is no event reducing the time at-risk for outpatient dialysis, and where the patient receives dialysis sessions from only one faci lity, the primary dialysis provider is clearly established and will be paid the full monthly capitation. (See Chapter V, Section C, for data on events reducing time at-risk.) For months where an event occurs that reduces the time at risk, the primary dialysis provider will be responsible for reporting both the events and the dates of these events on the patient bill. The primary dialysis provider will be paid the monthly capitation, adjusted down ward for the percentage of time not at-risk. (See Chapter V, Section C, for a method to prorate payment according to time at-risk.) Medicare may want to consider requiring a minimum number of sessions for the facility to receive a full monthly capitation payment in order to guard against disincentives to discourage patients from skipping sessions when payment is based only upon time at risk. In situations where the patient is treated at more than one outpatient dialysis facility, the primary provider will receive the monthly capitation payment (full or prorated) and other facilities will be required to bill the primary dialysis provider for services provided. Although cooperation between dialysis facilities commonly occurs, billing by secondary dialysis fac ilities of primary facilities will require additional mechanisms to capture payments and any potential changes in payment adjusters. To avoid the complications associated with designat ing a primary facility that receives the entire monthly payment for a patient, Medicare could allow each facility that provides care for a patient to bill for that patient. However, th e fiscal intermediaries processing the claims would need to match University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 91 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle dialysis claims for the same patient to detect and resolve any overlaps in reported service dates. Based on our analysis of Medicare claims, such overlaps of servi ce dates occur. Further, facilities billing through different fiscal intermediaries would re quire the fiscal intermediaries to coordinate for proper billing. Payments would then be adjusted for time at-risk. This adjusted per month payment has the benefit of avoiding potential complications between facilities but still has the drawback of not capturing changes in como rbidity payment adjusters that occur at the same facility during the month. 2. Payments to other (non-dialysis) providers Some se rvices included in the payment bundle may not be provided by dialysis facilities. Specifically, laboratory services provided by 12,000+ independen t laboratories are likely to be included in the payment bundle. As a result, the dialysis facility will be paid for these services, either on a per-session or a per-month basis. Independen t laboratories will be required to bill the primary dialysis facilities for these services. Dialysis facilities already have contractual or other relati onships with laboratories for services currently included in the Composite Rate. (See Chapter V, Section B, for a definition of dialysis related labs.) 3. Reporting patient characteristics Implem entation of the payment models described in this report, whether on a per-session or a per- month basis, requires that dialysis facilities report additional patient characteristics on the Medicare bill. Using the model that served as the basis for many of the anal yses presented here, facilities will have to report patient comorbidities and measures of health status. The list of comorbidities and measures of health status will depend on the fina l payment model selected for implementation. In terms of frequency of reporting, we recommend the approach adopted for the BCMA for composite rate payment that requires the fac ilities to report patient height an d weight. Because payments are increased for patients with specifi ed comorbidities, facilities have an incentive to report as many comorbidities as can be justified. Detailed rules will be required to increase the likelihood of consistent reporting of como rbidities across facilities. 4. Reporting resource utilization Inform ation on the use of diagnostic and therapeutic se rvices currently paid for as separately billable services is necessary for determination of potential outlier payments, quality assurance measures, updates of the case-mix adjustment model, and po ssibly pay-for-performance initiatives. Therefore, dialysis facilities will be required to report on p atient bills the use of th ese services. Tying the reporting of diagnostic and therapeutic services to forms of payment aligns incentives that will increase their likelihoo d of being reported. B. MANAGING INCENTIVES 1. Increased reporting of patient comorbidities As noted above, facili ties will have an incentive to report all comorbidities that can be justified on the patient bill. CMS should monitor the frequency of comorbidities reported and audit as appropriate. In addition, budget neutrality requires that paymen ts be calibrated for any increase in comorbidity reporting that occurs in response to the bundled payment system. The data found in Table 9-1 (frequencies of como rbidities for 2002-2004) were used to estimate the case-mix multipliers described earlier in this report and can serve as a baseline for CMS in monitoring changes. Moving University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 92 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle forward, CMS must ensure that comorbidity definitions and reporting instructions are as unambiguous as possible. 2. Reductions in services per session As is the cas e with any bundled service, there is an incentive to reduce the services provided per session in an effort to improve profit margins. This reduction has the potential to be both appropriate and inappropriate depending on the impact the reduction has on the patient. Careful development of quality assurance and pay-for-perfor mance measures is necessary to identify and prevent instances of inappropriate reductions in resource utilization. 3. Reductions in sessions per month If a pe r month payment system is adopted, ther e may be an incentive to reduce the number of sessions provided in a month. Specifically, in situations where there is a cost to the dialysis facility of providing a service but no additional revenue, ther e is the potential for inappropriate reductions in sessions. To mitigate this potential risk, appropriate quality assurance and pay-for-performance mechanisms will be required unde r a per month payment system. C. QUALITY ASSURANCE As discussed above, the determination of the components of the bundle may have implications for patient outcomes, as do the method and validity of case-mix adjustment. Some intermediate outcomes (e.g., achieved hematocrit) attributed to dialysis facilities may be influenced by other healthcare providers (12,38). In addition, caution must be used in defining appropriate targets for quality assurance purposes, as illustrated by the recent controversy over anemia management in dialysis (15,16, 39, 40, 41). Whatever the design decisions regarding bundle components and case- mix adjustment, there will remain a need to monitor the pe rformance of providers to ensure patient quality. Some specific quality measures ar e discussed in the following section. D. PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE Performance based contracting is a rapidly emerging trend in health care payment policy. Under so- called pay-for-performance (P4P) systems, payers acting on behalf of patients, employers, and/or society are linking a portion of provider payments to performance on specified measures of quality. The assumption is that ince ntive payments will stimulate increases in quality related effort on the part of providers, leading to improved health outcomes for patients. CMS has recently established an administrative policy to promote the use of incentive payments for improved performance in all Medicare programs. 1. P4P criteria With resp ect to ESRD or dialysis sessions, work on the ESRD Disease Management Demonstration has proposed several clinical indicators as criter ia for a P4P system. Paym ent is based on meeting national performance targets for each of th e measures, and improving upon each facility's performance. The set of specific measures to be adopted is still undetermined. Listed below are several measures under consideration. Some item s on this list were developed by Arbor Research University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 93 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle Collaborative for Health, an entity collaborating with UM-KECC. Some of the measures may be relevant for either quality monitoring or P4P, or both. Adequacy of Hemodialysis Percentage of patients with spKt/V > 1.2 Anemia Management Percentage of patients with Hgb > 11 g/dl Serum Calcium Percent of patients with serum calcium < 10 mg/dl Serum Phosphorous Percent of patients with serum phosphorous < 6 mg/dl Vascular Access Percent of patients with catheters (not counting catheters used while a fistula or graft is maturing) < 10% Percent of patients with AV fistula in use > 40 - 60% (varies by year) Another potential set of P4P criteria are the Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs) developed and now monitored by CMS. A recent paper by Parfrey ( 34) related the research by Rocco et al. ( 35) on the rela tionship between CPMs and patient outcomes to other research on the efficacy of CPMs. Rocco et al. looked at four CPMs: hemoglobin value of 11 g/dL (110 g/L) or greater; serum albumin value of 4 g/dL (40 g/L) or greater or 3.7 g /dL (37 g/L) or greater (bromcresol green and bromcresol purple laboratory methods, respectiv ely); use a fistula for vascular access; and measured single-pool Kt/V urea value of 1.2 or greater. These investigators report that large percentages of dialysis patients do not meet performance targets; only seven percent of patients met all four targets. Therefore, there exists opportunity for improvement, perhaps motivated by P4P. Rocco et al. ( 35) find that meeting both individual targets and the full set of targets was associated with reduced mort alit y and hospitalization. Parfrey ( 34) puts these results into context, noting that of the fo ur measures, only the Kt/V criterion is supp orted by randomized cont rolled trial evidence of improved health outcomes. However, Parfrey argues that because hemoglobin value of 11 or greater is associated with higher quality of life and because fistulas likely lead to better vascular access outcomes than grafts, these criteria also have merit. He concludes that \"quality assurance initiatives to achieve these targets can be supported.\" Be cause serum albumin is not readily amenable to intervention, Parfrey argues it is not a good candidate criterion for P4P. This recent work and other research support the feasibility of a P4P system to stimulate improvements in dialysis care. There appear to be measures of clinical care that are associated with improved patient outcomes and failure to achieve potential targets on some of these measures. 2. P4P design considerations The design of P4P systems is currently the subject of experimentation for the full range of health care services. As noted above, the ESRD Disease Management Demonstration rewards dialysis providers based on both improvements over time in the quality criteria and performance compared to national benchmarks, which are set to rise over time. There are two aspects of this design that are consistent with results of prior P4P evaluation s by members of our research team and others. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 94 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle First, rewarding both improvement and performance in comparison to a standard serves to motivate relatively low-performing providers as well as to support continued excellence in relatively high- performing providers ( 36). Further, continuous improvemen t in quality is encouraged through increases in established thresholds ( 37). Second, rewar ds are designed to be paid to dialysis fa cilities, rather than to dialysis physicians. This aspect is consistent with our research, which has shown that there is greater variation across dialysis facilities in performance than ther e is across dialysis physicians ( 38,42). Hence, dialysis facilities appea r to have more opportunity to reduce variability and achieve performance targets than do dialysis physicians. In addition, dialysis facili ties are likely to have a greater ability to establish processes necessary to achieve performance targets ( 36). Indeed, large dialysis organizations may be especi ally able to bring resources and care systems to bear to achieve improvements in care quality. Therefore, a prerequisite to successful P4P implemen tation identified in prior research, namely, an organized provider system with sufficient financial and managerial resources, appears to be in place. Finally, the ESRD Disease Management Demonstration reward system is based on withheld payment of five percent of Medicare payments to dialysis fa cilities. In the context of inpatient hospital care, this level of reward by a large payer has been shown to be sufficient to support quality improvement (37,43 ). E. PERIODIC PAYMENT SYSTEM UPDATES CMS should plan for periodic updates of the payment amounts and case-mix adjustment models. Over time, changes can occur in clinical practice (in part due to the change in incentives under bundling, and in part due to new knowledge and treatment options), input prices, the prevalence and/or reporting of comorbidities, and the rela tionships between comorbidities and costs. Therefore, CMS should ensure that sufficient data are available to re-estimate the parameters and relationships in this report in order to ensure that the payment system remains up-to-date and continues to ensure access to high quality dialysis related services. XIV . CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH A. CONCLUSIONS The primary objective of this report was to anal yze options to establish an expanded prospective payment system for outpatient dialysis services. One overall conclusion is that a reasonable expanded bundle definition can be developed using available data. Available CMS data allow the definition of a set of services associated with dial ysis care which could be included in an expanded, prospectively paid bundle of services. Although some additional coordination between dialysis units and other providers (e.g., independent laboratories ) would undoubtedly be required, for the most important separately billable services (e.g., injec table medications for anemia management), billings from providers other than the dialysis unit are rare. This research also identi fied a variety of patient University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 95 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle characteristics that could be appropriate to adjust payments to account for variations across patients in the cost of delivering dialysis related care. These patient characteristics were derived primarily from the Medical Evidence Form (CMS Form 2728) an d Medicare claims, and were used to develop case-mix adjustment models that ex plained up to 34% percent of the variation in measured costs. The implementation of a bundled payment system will reduce the variation in payments across both patients and facilities. Hence there will be a subs tantial number of facilities that will experience a material reduction in their revenues and a substa ntial number of facilities that will experience a material increase in their revenues, absent chan ges in practice patterns in response to the implementation of an expanded bundle. A more broadly bundled payment system will provid e strong financial incentives to reduce utilization of injectable medications and other services that are separ ately billable in the cu rrent system. To the extent that some of the current high utilization results from inefficient care management, a bundled payment system can produce social benefit, and the re al financial risk to facilities would be less than would be implied by the projected changes in revenues. However, to the extent that some of the current high utilization reflects true differences in the need for care not ac counted for by the case- mix adjustment model and any additional outlier payments, a bundled payment system may result in an inappropriate restriction of indicated care. Be cause of incentives to reduce use of separately billable services, increased monitoring and quality assurance systems will be necessary. Dialysis services appear to be amenable to the implementation of a pay-for-performance system because quality measures are available, providing opportuniti es to maintain high levels of performance and even make further improvements. An expanded bu ndle will also increase the predictability of Medicare expenditures and provide a mechanism for the introduction of new technologies (e.g., bundling anemia management rather than specific billable medications used to treat anemia). The variation in observed costs not predicted by the case-mix model is substantial. To the extent that some facilities canno t respond appropriately to the incentives in the bundled system to reduce costs without compromising patient outcomes, thes e facilities may face material financial risk. Therefore, developing an outlier payment system is ad visable. Due to data limitations, it is currently not possible to design an outlier payment system that uses patient-level cost data for all services in an expanded bundle. However, available patient-level data could be used to establish outlier payments for separately billable services, which are being added to the exis ting composite rate bundle and would account for the increased financial risk to facilities under a more broadly bundled payment system. A number of other implementation challenges remain. One challenge involves developing payment policies for pediatric patients. Due to the relative paucity of data on pediatric patients in the analyses, the model does not reliably estimate costs for pediatric patients. The model systematically underpredicts sepa rately billable costs incurre d by pediatric patients. Another key challenge involves the selection and measurement of comorbidities as payment adjusters. The model building process followed in this research was guid ed by several desired criteria, including model parsimony and the likelihood that diagnoses could be measured objecti vely and did not vary \"t oo much\" in severity. The ultimate effectiveness of the case-mix adjust ment model will depend not only on its explanatory power, but also on the ability to write regulations th at provide clear instructions to facilities on how to define and report co morbidities. If the co morbidities reported under a prospective payment system are inconsistent with the diagnoses that were found in the historical billing data, in terms of either prevalence or severity, the case-mix adjust ment system will have to be re-calibrated. Finally, several requirements on dialysis facilities should be recognized as a new payment system is implemented. Facilities will be re quired to report more clinical in formation relating to the case-mix measures used in the payment model. While the paym ent will be prospective, facilities should also be University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 96 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle required to continue to report data regarding service utilization to allow future updates to the case- mix adjusted payment system. Rela tionships with clinical laboratories and other providers may need to be expanded to mana ge the \"consolidated billing\" process unde r which dialysis facilities become the only providers that can be paid for services specified as part of the expanded bundle. B. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH As noted above, the implementation of a system of case-mix adjusted payments for an expanded bundle of dialysis services changes substantially the incentives facing dialysis providers and likely imposes a new set of information management requirements on providers, fiscal intermediaries, and CMS. To monitor responses to the new incentives and to enable updating of system parameters based on these responses and new data, it will be very important to extend a program of evaluation and research into the post-implementation period. Below is a description of several research and evaluation questions that merit consideration. The set is meant to be illustrative of the range of issues that could be investigated. It is by no means exhaustive. To support the research and evaluation described here, it is essential to ensure collection of data on utilization of all services provided to ESRD patients, as well as of p atient characteristics that are part of the payment model. In addition, patient characteristics that are not part of the case-mix adjustment payment model will be important to support studies info rming model revision. Finally, facility Cost Reports remain a necessary source of data going forward. A key operational question is the extent to whic h comorbidity data reported in the prospective payment system are consistent with the historical claims data used in estimating the payment multipliers in this report. It will be important to update the model to reflect data under the prospective payment system. Development of a payment model for pediatric patients requires additional research. One step toward creating a more predictive model of actual costs for pediatric patients would be to utilize newly available measures of current height and weight, as opposed to those reported on CMS Form 2728. Differences between these two sources of an thropometric data may be particularly important for children who are actively growing. A second step could be to estimate models limited to pediatric patients using most recent Medicare claims data. Perhaps the most important questions to answer regarding the new payment system concern effects on quality, cost (as determined by changes in clinical practice), and access. Regarding quality, a natural line of research is to compare performance on patient outcome measures such as urea reduction and hematocrit before and after altering the incentive system, controlling for patient characteristics. This work could be exte nded to identifying perfor mance differences across types of providers and types of patients in the new payment system. Comparing clinical practice and resulting cost of dialysis care before and after altering the incentive system is an equally important step. Clinical practice measures meriting scrutiny include route of EPO administration, use of iron, frequency of dial ysis, and utilization of home dialysis modalities. Again, identifying differences acro ss provider types and patient types will add to our understanding of incentive effects. In terms of access, as noted throughout this report, one of the main objectives of adjusting payments for patient condition is to help en sure access to care for especially ill and therefore costly patients. University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center - 97 - Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle Hence, a key component of the evaluation of the new system will be to determine its effects on access to dialysis services. The concept of access is difficult to make operational; often what is done is to draw inferences about access based on patterns of utilization. He nce, a first step is to determine if changes in patterns of dialysis services use for specific types of patients occur. Patients of particular interest are those with historically higher use of separate ly billable services than would be predicted by the payment model. For example, patient travel patterns, before and after implementation, could be examined to determine if vulnerable patients have difficulty finding convenient local care. Additionally, the ESRD Networks and patient advocacy organizations could expand tracking of complaints regarding access to care. As above, identifying differences across types of facilities in utilization pa tterns post-PPS will be important. As the new payment system may al ter patterns of dialysis servi ce utilization and clinical practice, more data will become available to support research relating outcomes performance to changes in utilization and clinical practice. This research will enhance understanding of processes of care leading to improved patient outcomes. The incentives under the new PPS might alter patterns of care for other providers and services. In particular, rates of hospitalization, use of hospital outpatient services including emergency services, and even use of primary care services may be affected. Research is necessary to document these effects and their implications for overall Medicare expenditures. The new PPS might alter the organization of dialysis and related services. Dialysis facilities might see advantage in integrating vertically with clinic al laboratories, hospitals, physicians, and other providers. Or, the new system might present increased advantage to horizontal integration of an already highly concentrated industry. Since these potential organizational changes have implications for cost, quality, and access, a research effort aimed at measuring and understanding these changes is in order. Another key factor that may interact with an expanded bundle to further influence patterns of care is the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Increased insurance coverage for outpatient prescriptions may encourage the substitution away from the injectable forms covered in the expanded bundle. This is possible for iron, and particularly likely for Vitamin D, given that each major formulation is now available in oral form. Patients on home therapies may be particularly vulnerable to such substitution. Substitution shou ld be monitored both to determine updates to the payment rate for the expanded bundle, and to ensu re that patient financial burdens, and subsequent therapeutic non-compliance, are not excessive. Finally, answers to the questions posed above, while important on their own, are essential to refinement of the new payment system in the future. Potential refinements include: (1) further expansion of the bundle to include other outpatient services, such as vascul ar access, and inpatient services; and (2) alignment of incentives for physici ans and facilities. Evalua tion of these and other potential refinements requires an ongoing program of evaluation and research.

Accomplishing this objective requires a careful analysis of the workings and shortcomings of the existing payment system, an analysis of how well existing data are able to inform decisions about the costs incurred by an efficient provider delivering high quality services, and analyses of the relationships between dialysis modality, case mix, an d costs. These analyses will be required to devise a system that ensures access to quality care for more complex patients and ensures equitable reimbursement to those facilities who serve them. Br oadening the bundle of services included in the composite rate can simplify the billing process an d can remove incentives for excessive use of separately billable services. However, broadening the bundle necessitates increased attention to quality assurance measures to ensure that an expa n d e d P P S d o e s n o t r e s u l t i n a n i n a p p r o p r i a t e reduction in the use of some services that were fo rmerly billed separately (e .g. EPO). Further, case mix adjustments may have to be developed. Data Sources We divided th e pr ospective payment system data sources into three groups. The first group consists of primary, recurring, government data sources us ed to identify ESRD patients and to provide demographics for them. The second group consists of primary, recurring, government data sources that provide information on the care and treatment of dialysis patients. Both of these sources collect data about entire populations rather than about sa mples. The third group consists of primary, recurring, government data sour ces used to identify and char acterize dialysis facilities. Databases For this p roj ect, the following group 1 databases are used. From the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Renal Management Information System (REMIS), formerly the ESRD Program Medical Management and Information System (PMMIS) and the Renal Beneficiary and Utilization System (REBUS), UM-KECC uses the Patient Master File (I DEN) and the Medical Evidence (ME) databases as the starting point for finding patients who are eligible for Medicare ESRD coverage. We add patients to this database and refine the placement of patients into facilities using the CMS Enrollment Data Base (EDB) and the Standard Management Information System (SIMS) database, which is managed by the ESRD Networks. We obtain information about transplants from the CMS Inpatient SAF and directly from the Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) through the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). The SIMS data and the SRTR data are not used for this project except to establish transplant dates for censoring dialysis months. Using these databases, UM-KECC creates a finder file containing all known cross- referenced Medicare IDs for these patients. This file is used for searching other CMS group 1 and 2 databases for additional information about these p atients. We obtain information about death dates The University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center Data Appendix A1 Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle from the Renal Management Information System (REMIS) Death Notification database as well as from the Social Security System Death Master File. We obtain claim information by using this finder file to subset the CMS Institutional Standard Analytic Files (SAFs) for inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital (dialysis facilities are a subset), Skilled Nursing Facility, Home Health Agency and Hospice claims. We also obtain carrier claims and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) claims from the National Claims History Files at CMS. We subset th e Outpatient claims into dialysis facilities and other facilities by the presence of a dialysis revenu e center. Generally we further subset the dialysis facility claims for analysis using only TYPE_OF_ BILL = '72' claims. We obtain group 3 data such as the hospital and dialysis facilit y Cost Reports (CMS Public Use Files) from CMS. We use the CMS Annual Facility Survey (AFS) and the CMS Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) database to better identify facilities and to add facility information to our database. 1. ESRD Program Medical Management and Information System (PMMIS) 2. Renal Beneficiary and Utilization System (REBUS) 3. Renal Management Information System (REMIS) The REMIS Patient Master File (IDEN) contains basic patient identification, demographics and eligibility data. It contains a Health Information Claim Accoun t Number (HICAN) number and a list of Social Security Numbers, to which the Beneficiary Identity Code (BIC) can be added to form additional HICAN numbers that have been used to identify the patient over time. UM-KECC uses this list together with a similar list obtained from the EDB to assign a KECC Identification Number, KECC_ID. We build a cross reference table associating all of the patient's HICAN numbers with this KECC_ID. The REMIS Medical Evidence contains data elements concerning dialysis, transplant, and self-care training collected from the CMS Form 2728 ESRD Medical Evidence Report form. A beneficiary may have one medical evidence record for each period of ESRD entitlement. A CMS-2728 is completed by the provider within 45 days of when the patient has been determined to have ESRD and is signed by the physician after a patient's regularly scheduled course of therapy begins (generally the first dialysis session). The REMIS Death Notification co ntains information commonly ca ptured on form CMS-2746. The information contained includes the date of death, the primary and secondary causes of death, the current ESRD provider, whether dialysis was discontinued and why, if the patient had received a transplant and the date of transplantation, and if the patient died with a functioning kidney. 4. CMS Enrollment Database (EDB) The Medicare Enrollment database is a relational database the contains demographic information as well as Part A and Part B entitlement history periods with the reason for entitlement coded (up to 6 Part A periods and up to 10 Part B), HMO status data(up to 50 periods of coverage), a history of residences(up to 50 periods), a list of other Healthcare Identification Codes that have identified that patient(up to 10), a history of ESRD coverage(up to 5 periods), and a history of primary payers(up to 20 periods of time when Medicare is the secondary payer). For this project the EDB contributes to the development of finder files for getting other CMS data like the SAFs. We also use the primary payer history and the HMO history to exclude bills received in periods when the patient has HMO coverage or when Medicare is a secondary payer. The University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center Data Appendix A2 Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle 5. CMS Standard Analytic Files (SAFs) UM-KECC predominantly uses the outpatient SAF as dialysis facilities are contained in that SAF with TYPE_OF_BILL = '72'. We use the entire ou tpatient SAF as well as the inpatient, the skilled nursing facility, the home health agency and the hospice SAFs to se arch for comorbidities. The SAFS are usually transported to researchers with a header portion of the record which contains patient demographics, total charges and payments for the entire claim, and physician information among other fields. The SAFs also contain a series of trailer records among which are diagnostic trailers, procedure trailers, claim related value trailers, claim occurrence trailers and the revenue center trailers. There are several other types of trailers but the above are those useful for KECC research. The SAFs are a set of paid claims files containi ng information on facility charges and payments for services, the attending and operating physician, the provider, some patient demographic information, International Classification of Diseases, version 9 Clinical Modification(ICD-9-CM) diagnoses and procedures and Current Procedural Terminolog y (CPT-4) and HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) procedures. Charges and payments are reported at the revenue center level where they can be directly connected to the revenue center HCPCS, which describes the services performed for the patient, since July 2000. 6. CMS Carrier Claims The CMS carrier claims are generated by physicia ns, laboratories, radiology centers, and other suppliers. For this project UM-KECC uses these claims to identify como rbidities and laboratory charges. The carrier claims are a set of paid claims files containing information on physician or supplier charges and payments, the attending and referring physician, the supplier, and some patient demographic information. They consist of a header portion with several trailers. There is a diagnostic trailer and a line item trailer. The line item trailer is analogous to the revenue center trailers in the SAFs. 7. CMS Hospital and Freestandin g Dialysis Facility Cost Reports The Medicare Cost Reports are a nearly universal pr ovider level database. All renal facilities that are certified by Medicare (freestanding or hospital based) are required to submit annually a detailed cost report containing a breakdown of costs. The Medicare Cost Reports for freestanding and hospital based renal facilities have been co llected for many years. Currently available on the CMS website are databases for the years 1994-2005. There is one observation per fac ility per quarter and there were more than 4,000 facilities reporting cost info rmation in the last available cost report. There are two separate databases for Medicare Cost Reports, one for hospital based facilities and one for freestanding facilities. In bo th databases, however, total costs, FTE costs, erythropoietin (EPO) costs, other separately billable costs, and other institutional costs can be determined. These databases could be useful for providing overall cost values. The hospital based facilities cost reports do not complete the ESRD portion of the cost reports with any great regularity, however. The University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center Data Appendix A3 Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle Two forms are used for the collection of Medicare Cost Reports. The in dependent renal facility (freestanding) form is CMS 265-94 and the Hospi tal based renal facility form is CMS 2552-96 from which the renal minimum data set is generated from Worksheets S-2 and S-5 and Worksheets I 1-5. These data collection forms are included in Appendix 1. The data for hospital based facilities and for freestanding facilities are generated in the facilities and forwarded directly to CMS. These files are public use files and are av ailable on the CMS website for downloading. CMS Annual Facility Survey The CMS Annual Facility S u rvey (AFS) is a near universe of facility level data collected annually from freestanding and hospital related dialysis facilit ies. The CMS Annual Facility Survey has been collected since 1980. With the addition of non-Medicare certified Veteran's Administration Facilities in 1992, the survey is completed by more th an 99% of existing dialysis facilities. The provider address is part of the survey and the data fields: city, SSA county code, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county code, and zip code are useful for determining urbanicity as part of potential price adjusters. The survey also provides counts by modality of treatment (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis) at the beginning and end of the survey period which can be used to validate counts determined from claims data. Similarly, data fields describe organs harvested, organs obtained, organs transplanted, and patients transplanted all of which may be relevant to cost determination. The survey contains the field, total stations, which can be utilized to determine cost effectiveness. The AFS is collected on the form CMS 2744 which can be found in the Ap pendix. The data are collected by the CMS ESRD Networks and forwarded to CMS. The AFS is a public use file available for do wnloading on the CMS website: www.cms.hhs.gov. CMS Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) Database The OSCA R database is a collection of data on facilities including a facility master list. OSCAR is used to store the surveys conducted by state surv eyors. These data are useful for checking the reliability of overlapping items on the Medicare Cost Reports and CMS and CDC facility surveys, and as a source of information on quality deficiencies identi fied by state surveyors. This can be useful in the ongoing monitoring of care under the revise d PPS. The primary weaknesses are that facilities are not surveyed every year and that although the da ta elements are uniform nationally, the survey process varies by state. Social Security Administ ration Death Master File Th e Social Security System Death Master File contains information on all persons reported to the Social Security System as being deceased. The SSA Death Master File is used by leading gove rnment, financial, investigative, credit reporting organization, medical research and other industries to verify identity as well as to prevent fraud and comply with the USA Patriot Act. To assist in this effort, NTIS and SSA are working together to offer the SSA Death Master File more frequently , with fewer delays, and in different formats. The University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center Data Appendix A4 Results of Research on Case-mix Adjustment for an Expanded Bundle The University of Michigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center Data Appendix A5 The Death Master File (DMF) from the Social Security Administration (SSA) contains over 65 million records of deaths that have been reported to SSA. This file includes the following information on each decedent, if the data are available to the SSA: SSN, name, date of birth, date of death, state or country of residence (2/88 and prior) , ZIP code of last resi dence, and ZIP code of lump sum payment. The SSA does not have a death record for all persons; therefore, SSA does not guarantee the veracity of the file. Thus, the absence of a particular person is not proof this person is alive. UM-KECC uses the SSN, the name, and the date of bi rth to link this file with our other databases and to link with our KECC_ID.

Mi chigan, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center Technical Appendix Appendix C: Technical Appendix February 2008 A Two-Level Model to Explain the Differen ces between the Regression Coefficients of Certain Patients' Characteristics on Pa tient Level and those on Facility level The differences between regression coefficients of certain patient characteristics can be explained by a two-level model. The two levels refer to patient level and facility level. For example, we would like to use regression analysis methods to explain the relationship between factor A and the outcome measure B. Now suppose we have another possible c onfounding factor C. If the values of C do not vary from patient to pati ent, then C will not be called a confou nder. Either including C or excluding C at both patient level and facility level will give the same result in terms of the relationship between factor A and outcome measure B. But if there is a strong association between C and A, then C will become a confounder. C is also a confounder if there is association between C and B. If we exclude this factor C, we will not have the same interpretation of the relationship between factor A and B. The reason is that there are some effects on B that won't be explained by A alone. Hypothetically speaking, we want to conduct weighted linear regression analysis at both the patient level and the facility level to un derstand the relationship betwee n a certain disease (factor A) and medical costs (outcome measure B). Without adjusting for a confounding factor (confounder C), we found that having this disease will induce a 100 do llar increase in medical cost. After including confounder C in the model, we fo und that having this disease will induce only 70 dollar increase in medical cost. The 30 dollar difference is explai ned by confounder C since people with this confounder are more likely to have this type of disease. If we don't include confounding factor C in the mode l, there will be bias. The extent of bias is associated with the strength of the correlation between confounder and covariate, the strength of the relationship between confounder and outcome measure and the facility level covariate variation. So to correctly model the relationship between the outcome measure and covariate factor, we should take confounding effects into consideration. If the confounder is a facility level variable, its effects on the estimated relationship between Factor B and Outcome A can be mitigated by estimating the regression model at the patient level (which makes use of variation among patients within a facility), and can be further mitigated by includ ing facility intercep ts in the model.
