They are required to co mplete the MDS f or rei mbursem ent under S NF PPS. Medicare and Medica id Payment Systems. The MDS contains i tems that re flect the acuity level of the resi dent, including diagnoses, t reatments, and an evalu ation of the resident's fu nctiona l status. The MDS is used as a data collection to ol to c lassify Medica re residents into PDPM components . The PDPM classification system is used in SNF PPS for skilled nursing fa cilities and non- critical access hospital swing bed programs . States may use PDPM, a Resource Utilization Group-based system , or an alternate system to group residents into sim ilar re source usage categ ories for the purposes of Medicaid reimburse ment. More detai led in formation on the SNF PPS is provided in Chapters 2 and 6.

Monito ring the Qua lity of Care. M DS assessment dat a are also used to monitor the quali ty of care in the na tion's nursing hom es. MDS -based qua lity m easur es (QMs) we re developed b y rese archers to as sist: (1) Sta te Survey and Certification staff in identifyi ng potent ial care problems in a nursing hom e; (2) nursing home providers with qua lity improvement act ivities/efforts; (3) n ursing hom e consumers in understanding the qua lity of care prov ided by a nursing home; and (4) CMS with long-te rm quality monitoring and program planning. CMS continuousl y evalu ates the usefulness of the QMs, which ma y be modified in the future to enhance t heir effectiveness. Consumer Access to N ursing Ho me Inform ation . Consum ers ar e also able to acces s information about every Medicare- and /or Medicaid -certified nursing home in the country. The Nursing Home Compare tool ( www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare ) provides public a ccess to nursing hom e charact eristics, s taffing and quali ty of care measures for ce rtified nursing hom es. The RAI process has m ultiple reg ulatory requirem ents. Federal r egulations 483.20 (b)(1)(xv iii), (g), and (h) requir e that the ass essment accura tely reflects the resi dent's status (2) a regi stered nurse conducts or co ordinates e ach a ssessm ent with the appr opria te participation of health p rofessionals (3) the ass essment proc ess includes dir ect obser vation, as well a s communication with the resident and direct care staff on all shif ts. Nursing hom es are lef t to determine (1) who should part icipate in the ass essment process (2) how the asse ssment process is co mpleted CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 11 that the in creased c larity of the in formation documented about a resident m akes tracking care and o utcomes easier to ac complish. The purpose of this manual is to offer cl ear gui dance, through instr uction and example, for the effective use of the RAI, and ther eby help nursing hom e staf f achieve the benef its listed above. In keeping with objecti ves set f orth in the Ins titute of Medi cine (IO M) study co mpleted in 1986 (Comm ittee on Nursing Home Regulation, IOM) that m ade r ecommendations to improve the quali ty of care in nu rsing homes, the RAI provide s each r esident with a standardized, comprehensive and reproducible ass essment. This tool ass esses a res ident's ability to per form daily life functions, identi fies significant i mpairments in a resident's functiona l capacity, and provides opportuni ties for dir ect resident inter view. In essen ce, with an ac curat e RAI c ompleted perio ly, tent recor ded \"look\" a t the resi dent and can attend to th at resident's needs with r ealistic goa ls in hand. Furthermore, with the co nsiste nt ap plication of item def initio ns, the RAI e nsures s tandardi zed communication both within the nurs ing home and between f acilities (e.g., other long-t erm care facilities or hospita ls). B asica lly, w hen everyone is spea king t he sam e language, the opportuni ty for misunderstanding or error is diminished consi derably. 1.5 MDS 3.0 In respons e to changes in nursing hom e care, res ident ch aracteristics, advances in resident assessm ent methods, and provider and consumer conce rns about the perform ance of the MDS 2.0, the Cent ers for Med icare & Med icaid Ser vices (CMS) co ntracted with the RAND Corporation and Harvard Universi ty to draf t revisions and na tionally test the MDS Version 3.0. Following is a synopsis of the goals and key findings as r eported in the Development & Validation of a Revi sed Nursing Home Assessment Tool: MDS 3.0 final report (Sa liba and Buchanan, 2008). Goals The goals of the MDS 3.0 revision ar e to i ntroduc e advances in assessm ent m easures, i ncreas e the clinic al relevan ce of items, improve the ac curacy and va lidity of the tool, inc rease user satisfaction, and incr ease the resident 's voice by introducing m ore resi dent interview ite ms. Providers, consumers, and other te chnical experts in nursing hom e care r equested that MDS 3.0 revisions focus on improving the tool's c linical utility, c larity, and accu racy. CMS a lso wanted to increase the usabil ity of the inst rument while m aintai ning the abi lity to us e MDS data for quality measure reporting and Medica re SNF PPS rei mbursem ent (via Patient Driven Payment Model [PDPM] classification). In addition to improving the cont ent and struc ture of the MDS, the RAN D/Harvard t eam also aimed to improve user satisfaction. User at titudes are key deter minants of quality improvem ent implementation. Negativ e user att itudes toward t he MDS are of ten cited as a reason that nurs ing homes have not f ully i mplem ented the in form ation from the MDS into ta rgeted care planning. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 12 Methods To address m any of the issues and challen ges previously id entified and to provide an em pirical foundation f or examining revisions to the MDS before they were i mplem ented, the RAND/Harvard t eam engaged in a c areful iterative process that incorpo rated provid er and consumer input, exper t consultation, scien tific ad vances in clinical knowl edge about screening and assess ment, CMS experience, and intens ive item developm ent and testing by a nat Veterans Ad n ational testing of MDS 3.0 to include well-developed and tes ted items. The national valid ation and evalua tion of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing h omes (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA nursing homes (764 residents regio nally distribut ed throughout the United S tates. The evaluation was designed to test and anal yze in ter-rater ag reement (reliability) between go ld-stand ard (resea rch) n urses and bet ween nursin g home and gold- standard nurses, val idity of key secti ons, response rates for in terview i tems, anonymous f eedback on changes f rom partici pating n urses, and tim e to co mplete the MDS ass essment. In addition, the nationa l test design a llowed co mparison of item dist ribut ions between MDS 3.0 and MDS 2.0 and thus facilitated mapping into paym ent cells ( Saliba and Buchanan, 2008). Key Findings for MDS 3.0 Improved R esident Inp ut Improved A ccuracy and Reliab ility In cr eased E fficiency Improved Staff Satis faction and Perception of Cl inical U tility Improvements inc orpor ated in a ass essment in strument: b etter quali ty information was obtained in l ess ti me. Such gains should improve identif ication of resident needs and enha nce res ident-focused car e planning. I n addi tion, inclusion of i tems recogn ized in other c are settings is likely to en hance co mmunication among provide rs. These signi refl ect the cu mulative of changes a cross the tool, inclu ding: use of m ore valid items, direct inclusion of resid ent reports, and improved clar ity of retai ned item s. 1.6 Components of the MDS The MDS is co mpleted for al l residents in Medic are- or Me dicaid-certified nursing hom es and resident s in a PPS stay in non- critical access hos pitals w ith Me dicar e swing bed agreements. The mandated a ssessment schedule is discussed in Chapter 2. S tates may also establish additional MDS requirem ents. For speci fic information on State requ irements, please contac t your Sta te RAI Coordinator (see Appendix B). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 1 CHA PTER 2: ASSESSMENTS FOR THE RESIDENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMEN T (RAI) This chapter presents the assessment types and instructions for the completion (including timing and scheduling) of the mandated OBRA and Prospective Payment System (PPS) assessments in nursing homes and the mandated PPS assessments in non -critical access hospit als with a swing bed agreement. 2.1 Introduction to the Requirements for the RAI The statutory authority for the RAI is found in Section 1819(f)(6)(A -B) for Medicare, and 1919 (f)(6)(A -B) for Medicaid, of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987). These sections of the SSA require the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to specify a Minimum Data Set (MDS) of core elements for use in conducting assessments of nursing home residents. It furthermore requires the Secretary to designate one or more resident assessment instruments based on the MDS. The OBRA regulations require nursing homes that are Medicare certified, Medicaid certified or both, to conduct init ial and periodic assessments for all their residents. The Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) process is the basis for the accurate assessment of each resident. The MDS 3.0 is part of that assessment process and is required by CMS. The OBRA -required asses sments will be described in detail in Section 2.6. MDS assessments are also required for Medicare payment ( Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) PPS) purposes under Medicare Part A (described in detail in Section 2.9) or for the SNF Quali ty Reporting Program (QRP) required under the Improving Medicare Post -Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 ( IMPACT Act ). It is important to note that when the OBRA and PPS assessment time frames coincide, one assessment may be used to satisfy both require ments. In such cases, the most stringent requirement for MDS completion must be met. Therefore, it is imperative that nursing home staff fully understand the requirements for both types of assessments in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and to remain in compliance with both OBRA and PPS requirements. (Refer to Sections 2.10 and 2.11 for combining OBRA and PPS assessments). 2.2 CMS Designation of the RAI for Nursing Homes Federal regulatory requirements at 42 CFR 483.20(b)(1) and 483.20(c) r equire facilities to use an RAI that has been specified by CMS. The Federal requirement also mandates facilities to encode and electronically transmit MDS 3.0 data. (Detailed submission requirements are located in Chapter 5.) While states must use all Fed erally required MDS 3.0 items, they have some flexibility in adding optional Section S items. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 2 CMS' specified RAI covers the core items included on the instrument, the wording and sequencing of those items, and all definitions and instructions for the RAI . CMS' specified RAI does not include characteristics related to formatting (e.g., print type, color coding, or changes such as printing triggers on the assessment form) . All comprehensive RAIs specified by CMS must include at least the CMS MDS Version 3.0 (with or without optional Section S) and use of the Care Area Assessment (CAA) process (including C are Area T rigger s (CAT s) and the CAA Summary (Section V) . If allowed by the State, facilities may have some f lexibility in form design (e.g., print type, color, shading, integrating triggers) or use a computer -generated printout of the RAI as long as the State can ensure that the facility's RAI in the resident's record accurately and completely represents the CMS -specified RAI in accordance with 42 CFR 483.20(b). This applies to either pre -printed forms or computer -generated printouts . Facility assessment systems must always be based on the MDS (i.e., both item terminology and definitions). However, facilities may insert additional items within automated assessment programs, but must be able to \"extract\" and print the MDS in a manner tha t replicates CMS' specified RAI (i.e., using the exact wording and sequencing of items as is found on the RAI specified by CMS ). Additional information about CMS specification of the RAI and variations in format can be found in Sections 4145.1-4145.7 of t he CMS State Operations Manual (SOM) which can be found here: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107c04.pdf . For m ore information about your State's assessment requirements, contact your State RAI coordinator (see Appendix B) . 2.3 Responsibilities of Nursing Homes for Completing Assessments The requirements for the RAI are found at 42 CFR 483.20 and are applicable to all residents in Medicare and/or Medicaid certified long -term care facilities. The requirements are applicable regardless of age, diagnosis, length of stay, payment source or payer source. Federal RAI requirements are not applicable to individuals residing in non- certified units of long -term care facilities or licensed -only facilities. This does not preclude a State from mandating the RAI for residents who live in these units. Please contact your State RAI Coordinator for State requirements. An RAI (MDS, C AA process, and Utilization Guidelines) must be completed for any resident residing in the facility, including: All residents of Medicare (Title 18) skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or Medicaid (Title 19) nursing facilities (NFs). This includes certified SNFs or NFs in hospitals, regardless of payment source. Hospice r esidents: When a SNF or NF is the hospice resident 's residen ce for purposes of the hospice benefit, the facility must comply with the Medicare or Medicaid participation requirements, meaning the resident must be assessed using the RAI, have a care plan and CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 3 be provided with the services required under the plan of ca re. This can be achieved through cooperation of both the hospice and long -term care facility staff (including participation in completing the RAI and care planning) with the consent of the resident. Short -term or respite residents: An RAI must be complete d for any individual residing more than 14 days on a unit of a facility that is certified as a long -term care facility for participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. If the respite resident is in a certified bed, the OBRA assessment schedule and t racking document requirements must be followed. If the respite resident is in the facility for fewer than 14 days, an OBRA Admission assessment is not required; however, a n OBRA Discharge assessment is required: \u2014 Given the nature of a short -term or respite resident, staff members may not have access to all information required to complete some MDS items prior to the resident's discharge. In that case, the \"not assessed/no information\" coding convention should be used (\" -\") (See Chapter 3 for more informatio n). \u2014 Regardless of the resident's length of stay, the facility must still have a process in place to identify the resident's needs and must initiate a plan of care to meet those needs upon admission. \u2014 If the resident is eligible for Medicare Part A benefits, a Medicare assessment will still be required to support payment under the SNF PPS. Special population residents (e.g. , pediatric or residents with a psychiatric diagnosis): Certified facilities are required to complete an RAI for all residents who reside in the facility, regardless of age or diagnosis. Swing bed facility residents: Swing beds of non- critical access hospitals that provide Part A skilled nursing facility -level services were phased into the SNF PPS on July 1, 2002 (referred to as swing be ds in this manual). Swing bed providers must assess the clinical condition of beneficiaries by completing the MDS assessment for each Medicare resident receiving Part A SNF level of care in order to be reimbursed under the SNF PPS. CMS collects MDS data fo r quality monitoring purposes of swing bed facilities effective October 1, 2010. Therefore, swing bed providers must complete these assessments: Swing Bed PPS assessment (SP) and Swing Bed Discharge (SD) in addition to the Entry Tracking and Death in Facil ity record. Swing bed providers may also choose to complete an Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) at any time during the resident's stay in the facility. Swing bed providers must adhere to the same assessment requirements including, but not limited to, compl etion date, encoding requirements, submission time frame, and RN signature. Swing bed facilities must use the instructions in this manual when completing MDS assessments . Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program: The IMPACT Act of 2014 establishe d the SNF QRP. Amending Section 1888(e) of the Social Security Act, the IMPACT Act mandates that SNFs are to collect and report on standardized resident assessment data. Failure to report such data results in a 2 percent reduction in the SNF's market baske t percentage for the applicable fiscal year. Data collected for the SNF QRP is submi tted through the Quality Improvement Evaluation System (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system as it currently is for other MDS assessments. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 4 Additional information regarding the IMPACT Act and associated quality measures may be found on CMS's website at: RAI process must be used with residents in facilities with different certification situations, including: Newly Certified Nursing Homes: \u2014 Nursing homes must admit residents and operate in compliance with certification requirements before a certification survey can be conducted. \u2014 Nursing homes must meet specific requirements, 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 483 (Requirements for States and Long Term Care Facilities, Subpart B), in order to participate in the Medicar e and/or Medicaid programs. \u2014 The completion and submission of OBRA and/or PPS assessments are a requirement for Medicare and/or Medicaid long -term care facilities. However, even though OBRA does not apply until the provider is certified, facilities are required to conduct and complete resident assessments prior to certification as if the beds were already certified .* \u2014 Prior to certification, although the facility is conducting and completing assessments, these assessments are not technically OBRA required, but are required to demonstrate compliance with certification requirements. Since the data on these pre -certificati on assessments was collected and completed with an ARD/target date prior to the certification date of the facility, CMS does not have the authority to receive this into the QIES ASAP system . Therefore, these assessments cannot be submitted to the QIES ASAP system. \u2014 Assuming a survey is completed where the nursing home has been determined to be in substantial compliance, the facility will be certified effective the last day of the survey and can begin to submit OBRA and PPS required assessments to the QIES ASAP system . o For OBRA assessments, the assessment schedule is determined from the resident's actual date of admission. Please note, if a facility completes an Admission assessment prior to the certification date, there is no need to do another Admission ass essment. The facility will simply continue with the next expected assessment according to the OBRA schedule, using the actual admission date as Day 1. Since the first assessment submitted will not be an Entry or OBRA Admission assessment, but a Q uarterly, OBRA D ischarge, etc., the facility may receive a sequencing warning message, but should still submit the required assessment. o For PPS assessments, please note that Medicare cannot be billed for any care provided prior to the certification date. Therefore, the facility must use the certification date as Day 1 of the covered Part A stay when establishing the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) for the Medicare Part A SNF PPS assessments. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2-5 \u2014 *NOTE: Even in situations where the facility's certification da te is delayed due to the need for a resurvey, the facility must continue conducting and completing resident assessments according to the original schedule. Adding Certified Beds: \u2014 If the nursing home is already certified and is just adding additional certified beds, the procedure for changing the number of certified beds is different from that of the initial certification. \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid residents should not be placed in a bed until the facility has been notified that the bed has been certified. Change i n Ownership: There are two types of change in ownership transactions: \u2014 The more common situation requires the new owner to assume the assets and liabilities of the prior owner and retain the current CCN number. In this case: The assessment schedule for existing residents continues, and the facility continues to use the existing provider number. Staff with QIES user ID s continue to use the same QIES user IDs. Example: if the Admission assessment was done 10 days prior to the change in ownership, the next OBRA assessment would be due no later than 92 days after the ARD (A2300) of the Admission assessment and would be submitted using the existing provider number. If the resident is in a Part A stay, and the 5- Day PPS assessment was combined with the OBRA Admission assessment, the next PPS assessment could be an Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) , if the provider chooses to complete one, and would also be submitted under the existing provider number. \u2014 There are also situations where the new owner does not assume the assets and liabilities of the previous owner. In these cases: The beds are no longer certified. There are no links to the prior provider, including sanctions, deficiencies, resident assessments, Quality Measures, debts, provider number, etc. The previous owner would com plete an OBRA Dischar ge assessm ent - return n ot anticipat ed, thus code A0310F = 10, A2000 = date of ownership change, and A2100 = 02 for those res idents who will re main in the f acility. The new o wner would complete an Adm ission assessment and Entry tracking record f or all residents, thus code A0310F = 01, A1600 = date of ownership change, A1700 = 1 (a dmission), and A1800 = 02. Staff who worked for the previous owner cannot use their previous QIES user IDs to submit assessm ents for the new owner as this is now a new facility. They must register for new user IDs for the new facility. Com pliance with OBRA regul ations, inclu ding t he MDS requirements, is expected at the time of survey f or certification of the facility with a new owner.

Nursing hom es may use elec tronic signat ures f or clinical record docum entat ion, including the MDS, when per mitted t o do so by State and loc al law and when author ized by the facility's p olicy. Use of electronic sign atures f or the MDS does not requi re that the ent ire clinical record be m aintained elec tronically. F acilities m ust have writ ten pol icies in place to ensure pr oper secur ity measures are in place to prote ct the use of an elec tronic signature by anyone other than the per son to whom the el ectronic sign ature belongs.

Detai led in structions a re provided th roughout the rest of this chapter. Admission refers to the date a pe rson ente rs the facility and is ad mitted as a res ident. A day begins a t 12:00 a.m . and ends at 1 1:59 p.m . Regardless of whether admission occurs at 12:00 a.m. or 11:59 p.m ., this date i s cons idered t he 1st day of admission. Com pletion of an OB RA Admission assessm ent must occur in any of the f ollowing ad mission s ituations: when the re sident ha s never been adm itted to th is facility be fore; OR when the re sident ha s been in t his facility previously and w as disch arged return not anticipated; OR when the re sident ha s been in t his facility previously and w as disch arged return anticipated and did not re turn wit hin 30 days of dischar ge (see Dischar ge assessm ent below). Assessment Combination refers to t he use of one asses sment to sat isfy both O BRA and PPS assessm ent req uirements when the time frames coinci de for both requir ed assessm ents. In such cas es, the m ost strin gent require ment of the two ass essments f or MDS co mpletion m ust be met. There fore, it is imperat ive that n ursing home staff fully understand the requi rements f or both t ypes of asses sments in order to avoid unnecess ary duplic ation of effort and to re main in compliance with bot h OB RA and PPS requir ements. Sections 2.10 and 2.11 pr ovide m ore detai led in formation on c ombining PPS and OBRA assessm ents. In addi tion, when all requirements f or both are m et, one assess ment m ay sat isfy two O BRA assessm ent require ments, such as Ad mission and OBRA Discharge assessm ent. Assessment Completion refers to the da te that al l information needed has been collected and record ed for a par ticular asses sment type and sta ff have signed and dated t hat the assessment is complete. For OBRA -required C omprehensive assessm ents, assess ment co mpletion is de fined as completion of the CAA process in addition to t he MDS ite ms, meaning that the RN CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 9 assessm ent coordina tor has signed a nd dated bot h the MDS ( item Z0500) and CAA(s) (item V0200B) co ttestations. Since a Comprehensive ass essment in cludes completion of both the MDS and the CAA process, the a ssessment tim ing requi rements for a co mprehensive as sessment apply to both t he completion of the MDS and the CAA process. For non- comprehensive and Discha rge assess ments, ass essment co mpletion is de fined as completion of the MDS only, m eaning that the RN assessm ent coor dinator has s igned and dated t he M DS (item Z0500) com pletion a ttestation. Completion requi rements are depen dent on the assessment type and ti ming requi rements. Completion speci fics by assessm ent type are discussed in Se ction 2.6 f or OBRA assess ments and Section 2.9 f or PPS assess ments. Assessment Referen ce Date (ARD) refers to the last day of the observa tion (or \"look back\") p eriod that the as sessm ent covers f or the reside nt. Si nce a day be gins at 1 2:00 a. m. and ends at 1 1:59 p.m ., the ARD must also cover this time peri od. The f acility is r equired to set the ARD on the MDS Item Set or in the f acility so ftware wit hin the requ ired tim e frame of the assessm ent type being com pleted. Thi s concept of setting the A RD is used f or all asse ssment types (OBRA and PPS) and varies by assessment type and f acility deter mination. Most of the MDS 3.0 it ems have a 7 -day look ba ck period. If a resi dent h as an ARD of July 1, 2011, then a ll pertinent inf ormation s tarting at 12:00 a.m. on June 25th and e nding on July 1st at 11:59 p.m. should be incl uded f or MDS 3.0 coding. Assessment Scheduling refers to the pe riod of time during which a ssessm ents t ake place, setting the A RD, t iming, com pletion, subm ission, and the observation pe riods requi red to complete the MDS ite ms. Assessment Submission refers to elec tronic MDS data being in reco rd and f ile formats that conform to standard rec ord layo uts and data di ctionaries, and passes s tandardi zed ed its defined by CMS and the St ate. Chapter 5, C FR 483.20( f)(2), and the MDS 3.0 D ata Sub mission Speci fications on the CMS MDS 3.0 web site provide m ore detai led in formation. Assessment Timi ng refers to w hen and how of ten asses sments must be conduct ed, based upon the re sident's len gth of stay and the len gth of time bet ween ARDs. The table in Section 2.6 descri bes the assess ment tim ing sc hedule f or OBRA -requi red assess ments, while information on the P PS assessm ent tim ing s chedule i s provided in S ection 2.8. For OBRA -required assessments, regulat ory req uirements f or each as sessment type dictate assessment tim ing, the sche dule f or whi ch is es tablished with the Admission (comprehensive) a ssess ment when t he ARD is set by the RN assessm ent coordina tor and the Interdisciplinary T eam (IDT). Assuming the resi dent di d not expe rience a s ignificant change in st atus, was not dischar ged, and did not have a Sign ificant Corr ection to Pri or Comprehensive as sessment (SCPA) co mpleted, as sessment scheduling would then move through a cycle of three Quarter ly assessm ents fo llowed by an Annual ( comprehens ive) ass essment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 10 This cyc le (Comprehensive ass essment - Quar terly as sessment - Quart erly assessm ent - Quarter ly assessm ent - C omprehensive ass essment) would r epeat itself annua lly for the resident who: 1) t he IDT deter mines the c riteria for a Signi ficant Change in Status Assessm ent (SCSA) has not occur red, 2) an uncor rected sig nificant error in prior comprehensive or as sessment was not d etermined, a nd 3) was not disc harged with r not ant icipated. OBRA assessm ents may be schedu led early if a nursing hom e wants to s tagger due dat es for assessm ents. As a res ult, m ore th an three OBRA Quarterly assessm ents may be completed on a par ticular resident in a given ye ar, or the Annual m ay be c ompleted ea rly to ensure that regulatory time frames between as sessments are m et. How ever, St ates may have m ore stringe nt restrictions. When a res ident does ha ve an SCSA or SCPA c ompleted, the assessm ent reset assessm ent timing/scheduling. The next Quar terly assessm ent would be s cheduled w ithin 92 days a fter the ARD of the SCSA or SCPA, a nd the next com prehens ive assess ment would be s cheduled wi thin 366 days after the ARD of the S CSA or SC PA. Assessment Tran smission refers to the electro nic transmission of sub mission files to the QIES ASAP syst em using the Medica re Data C ommunication Networ k (MDCN). Chapter 5 a nd the CMS MDS 3.0 w eb site provi de m ore detai led in formation. Comprehensive MDS assessm ents in clude both the co mpletion of the MDS as well as completion of the C AA process and care plann ing. C omprehensive MDSs incl ude A dmission, Annual, SCSA, and SCPA. Death in Facility refers to when the re sident dies in the f acility or di es while on a leave of absence (LOA) (see LOA def initio n). The f acility must co mplete a Deat h in Fac ility tracking record. No Discharge ass essment is req uired. Discharge refers to the date a resi dent l eaves t he facility or the date the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends but the resident remains in the facility . A day begins a t 12:00 a.m . and ends at 11:59 p.m . Regardless of whether dischar ge occurs at 1 2:00 a. m. or 11:59 p.m ., this date i s conside red the actu al date of discha rge. There ar e three types of discharg es: two are OBRA required \u2014ret urn a nticipated and ret urn not an ticipated; the third is Medicare required \u2014Part A PPS Discharge . A Discha rge assess ment is r equired with all three t ypes of discharges. Section 2.6 provides det ailed instructions regarding return anticipated and return not anticipated ty pes, and Section 2.8 provides detailed instructions regarding the Part A PPS Discharge type . Any of the following situations w arrant a Dis charge as sessment, regardless of facility pol icies regarding opening and closing clinical records and bed holds : Resident i s discharged f rom the f acility to a p rivate resi dence ( as opposed t o going on a n LOA); Resident i s admitted to a hospit al or other c are setting (re gardless of whether the nursi ng home disch arges or f ormally c loses the record); Resident has a hospi tal observat ion s tay grea ter than 24 hours, r egard less of whether t he hospit al admits the res ident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 11 Resident is transferred from a Medicare- and/or Medicaid -certified bed to a non- certified bed. Resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remains in the facility. Discharge Assessmen t refers to an assess ment req uired on reside nt discharge from the facility, or when a resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remain s in the facility (unless it is an instance of an interrupted stay, as defined below) . This assessm ent includes clinical items for quality monito ring as w ell as disc harge tracking in formation. Entry is a t erm used f or both an a dmission and a ree ntry a nd requi res completion of an Entry tracking r ecord. Entry and Discha rge Reporting MDS a ssessm ents and tracking r ecords t hat include a selec t num ber of items from the M DS used to t rack resi dents and gath er important qual ity data at transition po ints, such as when they e nter a nursing home , leave a nursing home, or when a resident's Medicare Part A stay end s, but the resident r emain s in the facility . Entry /Discharge reporting include s Entry tracking record, OBRA Discharge as sessments, Part A PPS Discharge assessment, and Death in Fa cility tracki ng record. Interdisciplinary Team (IDT1) is a g roup of professional disciplines th at combine knowledge, ski lls, and res ources to pr ovide the greatest benefit to the res ident. Interrupted Stay is a Medicare Part A SNF stay in which a resident is discharged from SNF care (i.e., the resident is discharged from a Medicare Part A -covered stay ) and subsequently resumes SNF care in the same SNF for a Medicare Part A -covered stay during the interruption window. Interruption Window is a 3 -day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A -covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non- covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m . on the third consecutive non -covered day following a Part A -covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A - covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion . Examples of when there is an Interrupted Stay: If a resident is discharged from Part A, remains in the facility , and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , this is an interrupted stay and no Part A PPS 1 42 CFR 483.21(b)(2) A comprehensive care plan must be (ii) Prepared by an interdisciplinary team, that includes but is not limited to - the atte nding physician, a registered nurse with responsibility f or the resident, a nurse aide with responsibility for the resident, a member of food and nutrition services staff, and other appropriate staff or professionals in disciplines as determined by the resident's needs or as requested by the resident, and, to the extent practicab le, the participation of the resident and the resident's representative(s). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 12 Discharge or OBRA Discharge is completed, nor is a 5 -Day or Entry Tracking record required when Part A resumes. If a re sident is discharged from Part A, leaves the facility, and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , this is an interrupted stay and only an OBRA Discharge is required. An Entry Tracking record is required on reentry, but no 5- Day is required. Examples of when there is no Interrupted Stay: If a resident is discharged from Part A, remains in the facility, and does not resume Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , it is not an interrupted stay. Therefore, a Part A PPS Discharge and a 5 -Day as sessment are both required (as long as resumption of Part A occurs within the 30- day window allowed by Medicare). If a resident is discharged from Part A, leaves the facility, and does not resume Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , it is not an in terrupted stay and the Part A PPS Discharge and OBRA Discharge are both required and may be combined (see Part A PPS Discharge assessment in Section 2.5). Any return to the facility in this instance would be considered a new entry \u2014that means that an Entry Tracking record, OBRA admission and/or 5- Day assessment would be required. Item Set refers to t he MDS ite ms that a re active on a pa rticular as sessm ent type or t racking form. There are 9 di fferent item subsets f or nur sing ho mes and 5 for swing bed provi ders as follows: Nursing Home \u2014 Comprehensive (N C2) Item Set.

Observation (Look Back) Period is the ti me period over which t he resi dent's condi tion or status is captured by the MDS assess ment. When the re sident is first admitted to the nursing home, the RN ass essment coordinat or and t he IDT will set t he AR D. For subse quent assessments, the observa tion period f or a particular assessm ent for a par ticular resident wi ll be chosen based upon the reg ulatory requi rements conc erning equire an obser vation pe riod, such as 7 or 14 days, depending on t he ite m. Since a day begins at 12:00 a .m. and ends at 11:59 p.m ., the obser vation period must also c over t his time period. W hen co mpleting the MDS, only those occur rences during t he lo ok back pe riod will be captu red. In other words, if it did n ot occur dur ing the look back period, it is not cod ed on the MDS.

The y consist of : Admission Assessm ent Annual Assess ment Signi ficant Change in Status essment to Prior Co mprehensi ve Assessm ent Each of these assess ment types w ill be discus sed in det ail in this se ction. They are not requ ired for reside nts in swing be d facilities. Assessment Management Requirements and Tips for Comprehensive Assessments: The ARD ( item A2300) is the l ast day of the observa tion/look back pe riod, and day 1 f or purposes of counting ba ck to de termine the beg inning of observa tion/look back pe riods. For exa mple, if the ARD is set f or day 14 of a residen t's ad mission, then t he beginni ng of the obser vation pe obs ervat ion pe riod would be day 8 of admission (ARD + 6 previous c alend ar day s), while the beginning of the obser vation period f or M DS ite ms requiring a 14-day obser vation pe riod would be day 1 of admission (ARD + 13 previous c alendar day s). The nur sing hom e may not co mplete a Signi ficant Change in Status Assess ment until after an OBRA Admission assessm ent has been co mpleted. If a resi dent had an OB RA Adm ission assessm ent co mpleted and then goe s to the hospit al (discharge ret urn anti cipated and ret urns within 30 days) and re turns dur ing an assessm ent period and m ost of the assess ment was co mpleted prior to the hospi talization, then the nur sing hom e may wish to continue w ith the origi nal ass essment, provi ded the resident doe s not m eet the cr iteria for an SCSA . In this c ase, t he ARD r emains the s ame and the as sessment must be co mpleted by the com pletion dat es requ ired of the assess ment type based on the t ime frame in which the ass essment was st arted. Otherwi se, the assessment should be rei nitiated with a new ARD and c ompleted wi thin 14 days after re - entry f rom the hospi tal. The por tion of the res ident's asses sment that was previo usly completed should be st ored on the residen t's record with a not ation that the assess ment was rein itiated because t he resi dent was hospit alized. If a resi dent is disc harged prior to the co mpletion deadli ne for the a ssessment, c ompletion of the asses sment is not r equired. W hatev er port ions of the R AI that have b een co mpleted must be m aintained in the resi dent's medical rec ord.3 In closing the r ecord, the nur sing home should note why t he RAI was not co mpleted. 3 The RAI is considered part of the resident's clinical record and is treated as such by the RAI Utilization Guidelines, e.g., portions of the RAI that are \"started\" must be saved. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 20 If a resi dent dies p rior to the co mpletion deadli ne for the asses sment, c ompletion of the assessm ent is not requir ed. W hatever portions of the RAI that have been c ompleted m ust be m aintained in the resident's medical r ecord .4 In closing the record, the nursing hom e should note why the R AI was not c ompleted. If a signi ficant change in status is identified in the process of completing a ny OB RA assessm ent except Ad mission and S CSAs, code and com plete the as sessment as a comprehensive SCSA instead. The nursing hom e may combine a com prehensive assessm ent with a Disc harge assessm ent. In the pr ocess of completing any OBRA comprehensive a ssessment except an Ad mission and a n SCPA, if it is iden tified that an unc orrected s ignificant e rror curred in alr eady been subm itted and accep ted into t he QIES ASAP syste m, and has not a lready been corr ected in a subseque nt co mprehensive as sessment, code a nd complete the assess ment as a co mprehensive SCPA instead. A correction request f or the erroneous assessm ent should also be co mpleted and subm itted.

Assessm ent Managem ent Requirements and Tips for Admission Assess ments: Since a day begins a t 12:00 a.m . and ends at 1 1:59 p.m ., the actual date of admission, regar dless of whether a dmission occurs at 12:00 a .m. or 11:59 p.m ., is cons idered day \" 1\" of admission. The ARD ( item A2300) must be set no lat er than day 14, counting t he dat e of admission as day 1. Si nce a day begins at 1 2:00 a. m. and ends at 11:59 p.m ., the ARD must also cover t his tim e period. For exa mple, if a resi dent is ad mitted a t 8:30 a.m . on W ednesday (day 1), a completed RAI is r equired by the end of the day Tuesday (day 14). Federal s tatute and r egulations requi re that residents a re assessed prom ptly upon admission (but no l ater than day 14) and the r esults are used i n planning a nd providi ng appropr iate care to highe st pract icable well -being. This m eans it is imperative f or nursing ho mes to ass ess a re sident upon the i ndividua l's admission. T he IDT may choose to s tart and co mplete the Ad mission com prehensive a ssessment at any time prior to the end of day 14. Nurs ing homes may find early completion of the MDS and CAA(s) bene ficial to providing appropri ate care, p articularly f or individuals w ith short l engths of stay when the as sessment and care plan ning process is often acc elerated. The MDS com pletion date ( item Z0500B) must be no la ter than day 14. This date m ay be earlier than or the sa me as the CAA(s) co mpletion date, but not l ater than. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be no l ater than day 14. The care pl an completion date ( item V0200C2) m ust be no l ater than 7 c alend ar days after the C AA(s) co mpletion da te (item V0200B 2) (CAA(s) c ompletion date + 7 c alendar days). For a re sident who goes in and out of the facility on a rel atively frequent basis and return is expec ted within t he next 30 days, the res ident may be discharged with return anticipated. This st atus requires an Entry t racking record each time the reside nt returns to the f acility and a n OBRA Discharge as sessment each time the resident is disch arged. The nursing hom e may combine the Ad mission a ssess ment with a Dischar ge assessm ent when appli cable. 02. Annual Assessment (A0310A = 03) The Annual assess ment is a co mprehensive as sessment for a resident th at must be co mpleted on an annual ba sis (at least every 366 days) unl ess an SCSA or an SCPA has been co mpleted since the m ost recent comprehensive assess ment was co mpleted. Its completion dat es (MDS/CAA(s)/ca re plan) de pend on the m ost re cent c omprehensive and past a ssess ments' ARDs and co mpletion dates. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 22 Assessm ent Managem ent Requirements and Tips for Annual As sessments: The ARD ( item A2300) must be set within 366 days a fter the ARD of the previous OBRA comprehensi ve assessm ent (ARD of previous com prehensive assessment + 366 calend ar days) AND within 92 days since the ARD of the previous OBRA Quarterly or SCQA (A RD of previous OBRA Quarte rly assess ment + 92 calen dar days). The MDS com pletion date ( item Z0500B) must be no la ter than 14 days after the A RD (ARD + 14 calend ar days). This da te may be ear lier than or the sam e as the CAA(s) completion date, but not later than. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be no l ater than 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 calen dar days). Th is date m ay be the sa me as the MDS co mpletion dat e, but not e arlier than.

Significant Change in Status Assessment (SCSA) (A0310A = 04) The SCSA i s a co mprehensive a ssessment for a reside nt that must be co mpleted when the IDT has det ermined that a resident m eets the sig nificant change guidelines f or either major improve ment or decli ne. It can be per formed at any ti me after the co mpletion of an A dmission assessment, and its com pletion dates ( MDS/CAA(s)/care plan) de pend on the da te that the I DT's determination was m ade that the resi dent h ad a signi ficant change. Assessm ent Managem ent Requirements and Tips for Significant Change in S tatus Assessm ents: When a res ident's s tatus changes and it is n ot clear wheth er the res ident meets the SCSA guide lines, t he nursing h ome may take up to 14 days to de termine whet her the criteria are met. A \"signific ant change\" is a major de cline or improve ment in a residen t's status tha t: 1. Will not nor mally resol ve itself without int ervent ion by sta ff or by i mplementing standard di sease- related clinical interventions, the decline is not considered \"s elf- limiting\"; 2. Impacts more than one a rea of the re siden t's he alth status; and 3. Requires interdis ciplinary review and/or re vision of the care plan. A signif icant change di ffers f rom a s ignificant e rror because i t reflects an actual s ignificant change in the resident's health s tatus and NOT incorrect coding of the MDS. A signif icant change may r equire referral for a Preadmission Sc reening and Resident Review (PASRR) evaluat ion if a ment al illness, intellectu al disabil ity (ID), or related condi tion is present or is suspected to be pr esent. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 23 After the I DT has det ermined that a resident m eets t he sig nificant change guide lines, the nursing hom e should doc ument the i nitial identification of a significant c hange in t he resident's status in the clinical record . An SCSA is appropri ate when: \u2014 There is a deter mination that a signi ficant change (either improvement or decli ne) in a resident's condition f rom his/h er bas eline h as occurred as indicated by com parison of the res ident's curre nt status to the m ost re cent com prehensive assessm ent and any subsequent Quarter ly assessments; a nd \u2014 The resi dent's condi tion is not ex pected to r eturn to bas eline within two weeks. \u2014 For a re sident who goes in and out of the facility on a rel atively frequent basis and reentry is expected w ithin the next 30 days, the r eside nt may be disch arged with return anticipated. This status requ ires an Entry tracking r ecord each t ime the res ident retur ns to the facility and an OBRA Dischar ge assess ment each time the resi dent is disch arged. However, if the IDT det ermines that t he resi dent would bene fit from an SCSA during the i nterve ning period, t he sta ff must co mplete an SCSA . This is only allowed when the resi dent h as had an OBRA A dmission assessm ent co mpleted and subm itted prior to di scharge return an ticipated (and resident r eturns within 30 days) or when the OBRA A dmission assessm ent is co mbined w ith the discharge r eturn anticipated assessm ent (and reside nt returns within 30 da ys). An SC SA may not be com pleted p rior to an OBRA Adm ission assessm ent. An SC SA is required to be per formed when a ter minally ill resident enr olls in a -licensed h ospice provider) or changes hospice providers and remains a r esident at the nursing hom e. The ARD must be wi thin 14 days from the ef fective date of the hospice elec tion (w hich can be t he sam e or lat er than the date of the h ospice e lection sta tement, but not e arlier than). A n SCSA must be per formed regar dless of whether an assessm ent was recently conducted on the re sident. This is to ensure a co ordin ated pl an of care between the hospice and nursing hom e is in place. A Medicare -certified h ospice m ust conduct an a ssess ment at the i nitiation of its ser vices. This is an appropr iate time for the nursing hom e to ev aluate the MDS i nformation to deter mine if it reflects the cur rent condi tion of the res ident, since the n ursing ho me remains responsible f or providing necess ary care and s ervices to as sist the resi dent in achieving his/h er highest pr acticable well -being a t whatev er stage of the d isease pr ocess the resident is ex periencing. If a resi dent is ad mitted on the hospi ce benef it (i.e., the r esident is co ming into t he facility having a lready ele cted hospice), or elects hospice on or prior to the ARD of the Admission assessment, the facility sho uld co mplete the Ad mission assessm ent, checking the Hospice Care i tem, O0100K. C ompleting an A dmission assessm ent followed by an SCSA is not required. Where hospice election occurs after the Admission assessment ARD but prior to its completion, facilities may choose to adjust the ARD to the date of hospice election so that only the Admission assessment is required. In such situations, an SCSA is not required. An SC SA is required to be per formed when a resi dent is rece iving hospice services and then de cides to s ervices (know n as revoki ng of hospice car e). The ARD must be wi thin 14 days from one of the f ollowi ng: 1) t he effecti ve date of the hospice CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 24 election r evocation (which can be t he sam e or lat er than the date of the h ospice e lection revoc ation s tatement, but not e arlier than ); 2) t he expir ation date of the ce rtification of terminal il lness; or 3) t he date of the physic ian's or m edical direc tor's order st ating the resident i s no longer terminally ill. If a resident is admitted on the hospice benefit but decides to discontinue it prior to the ARD of the Admission assessment, the facility should complete the Admission assessment, checking the Hospice Care item, O0100K. Completing an Admission assessment f ollowed by an SCSA is not required. Where hospice revocation occurs after the Admission assessment ARD but prior to its completion, facilities may choose to adjust the ARD to the date of hospice revocation so that only the Admission assessment is required. In such situations, an SCSA is not required. The ARD must be less than or equal to 14 days after the IDT's determination that the criteria for an SCSA are met (determination date + 14 calendar days). The MDS com pletion date ( item Z0500B) must be no la ter than 14 days from the A RD (ARD + 14 calend ar days) and no l ater than 14 days a fter the deter mination that the criteria for an SCSA were m et. This date m ay be ear lier than or the sam e as the CAA(s) completion date, but not later than. When an SCSA is co mpleted, the nur sing home must re view al l triggered ca re areas compared to the re sident's pre vious s tatus. If the CAA process indi cates no change in a care a rea, then the p rior docum entation f or the pa rticular care area m ay be car ried forward, and the nur sing home should speci fy where t he sup porting doc umentation can be loc ated in the m edical record. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be no l ater than 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 calen dar days) and no lat er than 14 days a fter the d etermination that the criteria for an SCSA were m et. This date m ay be the sam e as the MDS co mpletion dat e, but not e arlier than M DS completion. The care pl an completion date ( item V0200C2) m ust be no l ater than 7 c alend ar days after the C AA(s) co mpletion da te (item V0200B 2) (CAA(s) c ompletion date + 7 c alendar days). Guidel ines for Deter mining a S ignificant Change in a R esiden t's Status: Note: this is not an exhaustive li st The f inal d ecision regarding what c onstit utes a signi ficant c hange in s tatus m ust be based upon the judg ment of the IDT. MDS asses sments are not req uired fo r minor or t emporary va riations in resident s tatus - in these cases, t he residen t's co ndition is ex pected to return to bas eline within 2 weeks. Ho wever, s taff must note these tran sient changes in t he resi dent's status in the resident's record and imple ment necess ary as sessment, ca re planning, and cli nical interventions, even though an M DS assessm ent is n ot required. Some Gui delines to Assist in Decidin g If a Change I s Significa nt or Not: A condition is de fined as \"self-limiting\" when the condi tion will nor mally resolve itself without f urther intervent ion or by s taff implementing s tanda rd diseas e-related c linical interventions. If the co ndition has not res olved within 2 w eeks, sta ff should begin an SCSA . This time frame may vary depending on clinical judg ment and resident ne eds. For CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 25 exam ple, a 5% weight loss for a re sident with the flu would not nor mally meet the requi rements f or an SCSA . In gener al, a 5% wei ght loss m ay be an expect ed outcom e for a resident wi th the f lu who exper ienced nausea and diarr hea f or a week. In this s ituation, staff should m onitor the reside nt's status and a ttempt various interventions to re ctify the immediate weight loss. If the res ident did not be come dehy drated and st arted to reg ain weight a fter the sy mptom s subsided, a com prehensive as sessment woul d not be re quired. An SC SA is appropri ate if there are e ither two or more areas of decline or two or more areas of improve ment. In this e xample, a res ident with a 5% w eight loss in 30 days would not gene rally requi re an SCSA unless a second a rea of decline acco mpanies it. Note that this a ssumes that the car e plan has already been modified to acti vely t reat the weig ht loss as opposed t o continuing with the or iginal probl em, \"potenti al for weight loss.\" This situation should be doc umented in the resi dent's clinical record along w ith the plan fo r subsequent monitoring and, if the p roblem persi sts or worse ns, an SCSA may be warranted. If there is only one change , staff may still decide that the r esident would bene fit from an SCSA . It is important to remember that each resident's s ituation is unique , and the IDT must make the deci sion as to wheth er or not the r eside nt will bene fit from an SCSA . Nursing hom es must docum ent a rat ionale, in the resi dent's medical rec ord, f or completing an SCSA that does not m eet the cr iteria for co mpletion. An SC SA is also appropr iate if there is a consi stent pattern of changes, with eith er two or more areas of decline or two or more areas of improve ment. This m ay include two changes wi thin a pa rticular do main (e.g., two ar eas of ADL decli ne or i mprove ment). An SC SA would not be a ppropri ate in situ ations where the r esident has s tabilized but is expected to be disch arged in the immedia te future.

Examples (SC SA): 1. Mr. T no longer responds to verbal requests to alter his screaming behavior. It now occurs daily and has neither lessened on its own nor responded to treatment. He is also starting to resist his daily care, pu shing staff away from him as they attempt to assist with his ADLs. This is a significant change, and an SCSA is required, since there has been deterioration in the behavioral symptoms to the point where it is occurring daily and new approaches are needed t o alter the behavior. Mr. T's behavioral symptoms could have many causes, and a n SCSA will provide an opportunity for staff to consider illness, medication reactions, environmental stress, and other possible sources of Mr. T's disruptive behavior. 2. Mrs. T r equired minimal assi stance w ith ADLs. She f ractu red her hip and upon return to the facility req uires ex tensive assi stance with a ll ADLs. Rehab has st arted and staff is hope ful she will ret urn to her pr ior lev el of function in 4- 6 weeks. 3. Mrs. G has been in t he nursing hom e for 5 weeks following an 8- week a cute hos pitalization. On a dmission she was v ery frail, had troubl e thinking, was c onfused, and had m any behavior al complica tions. The cour se of treat ment led to st eady i mprove ment and she is now stable. She i s no longer conf used or exhibi ting inappropr iate behaviors. T he resi dent, her family, and sta ff agree t hat she has made r emarkable prog ress. A n SCSA is req uired at this time.

Guidel ines for Deter mining the N eed for an SCSA for Residents with Ter minal Conditi ons: Note: this is not an exhaustive li st The key in deter mining i f an SCSA is requi red for individuals with a t erminal condi tion is whether or not t he change in con dition is an e xpected, wel l-defined pa rt of the d isease cour se and is consequentl y being add ressed as p art of the over all plan of care for the in dividua l. If a ter minally ill resident exper ience s a new ons et of symptom s or a co ndition that is not part of the e xpected co urse of deterioration and t he cr iteria are met for an SC SA, an SCSA is requ ired. If a resi dent elects the Medica re Ho spice pro gram, it is im porta nt that the two separ ate entities (nursing hom e and hospice program staff) coordi nate the ir respo nsibi lities and develop a re plan reflecting the i nterven tions r equired by both ent ities. The nursing home and hospice plans of care sh ould be re flective of the c urrent status of the resi dent. Examples (SC SA): 1. Mr. M has been in t his n ursing hom e for two and one -half years. He has been a f avorite of staff and other re sidents, and his daug hter has be en an act ive volunte er on t he unit. M r.

W hatev er por tions of the RAI that ha ve been co mpleted m ust be maintained in the res ident's medical r ecord.6 When cl osing the record, the nur sing home should document why the RAI was not co mpleted. If a signi ficant change in status is identified in the process of completing a ny assess ment except Ad mission and S CSAs, code and com plete the as sessment as a co mprehensive SCSA instead. In the pr ocess of completing any a ssessment except an Ad mission and a n SCPA, if it is identified that a s ignificant err or occurred in a previous com prehensive assessment that has al ready been subm itted and a ccepted i nto the QIES ASAP syst em and has not a lready been corr ected in a subseque nt co mprehensive as sessment, code a nd co mplete the assessm ent as a co mprehensive SCPA instead.

The ARD of an assess ment dri ves the due date of the next assessment. The next non- comprehensive assess ment is due w ithin 92 days after the A RD of the most re cent OBRA assessm ent (ARD of previous OB RA assess ment - Admission, Annual, Quarterly, Signi ficant Change in Status, or Si gnificant Co rrection as sessment - + 92 calend ar days). While th e CAA process is not r equired with a n on-comprehensive as sessment (Quarterly, SCQA), nursing h omes are s till requ ired to review t he information f rom these assessm ents, and review and revise the resident's care plan. The MDS must be t ransmitted (su bmitted and accepted into the QIES ASAP system ) electronically no lat er than 14 calen dar days a fter the MDS co mpletion dat e (Z0500B + 14 calend ar days). Non-comprehensive a ssessments may be co mbined with a 5- Day assessment or SNF Part A PPS Discharge Assess ment (see Sect ions 2.10 and 2.11 f or deta ils). 6 The RAI is considered part of the resident's clinical reco rd and is treated as such by the RAI Utilizatio n Guidelines, e.g., portions of the RAI t hat are \"started\" must be saved.

T he assess ment in formation is used to develop, r eview, and re vise t he resident's pl ans of care t hat wi ll be used to provi de serv ices to attain or m aintain the resident's highest pra cticable phy sical, m ental, and psychos ocial w ell-being. The RAI process, which include s the Federal ly mandated M DS, is the ba sis for an accurate assessm ent of nursing ho me residents. The MDS inf ormation and the C AA process provide the foundation upon which t he care plan is formulated. There ar e 20 proble m-oriented CAAs, each of which includes MDS -based \"t rigger\" con ditions that s ignal the n eed for addi tional assessm ent and rev iew of the trig gered ca re area. Detai led information r egarding e ach care area a nd the CAA process, including definitio ns and trig gers, appear in Chapter 4 of this m anual. Chapter 4 also contains det ailed information on care plan ning develo pment utili zing the RAI and CAA process. CAA (s) Completion Is req uired f or OBRA -required com prehensi ve as sessm ents. They are n ot required f or non-comprehensive sessments, P PS assessm ents, Disch or Tr acking records. After co mpleting the M DS portion of the co mprehensive assessment, the next s tep is to further i dentify and eval uate t he resi dent's s trengths, proble ms, and ne eds through use of the CAA process (d escribed in de tail in Chapt er 3, Section V , and Chapt er 4 of this manual) and through f urther inve stigation of any resident -specific issues not the RAI/CAA process. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be e ither later than or the sam e date as the MDS completion date ( item Z0500B). In no event should eith er date be lat er than the established time frames as descr ibed i n Section 2.6. It is important to not e that for an Adm ission assessm ent, the r esident ent ers the nur sing home with a set of phys ician-based t reatment or ders. Nursing hom e staf f should re view these or ders and begin to assess the r esident and t o ident ify potent ial care issues/ proble ms. Within 48 hours of admission to the facility, the facility must develop and implement a Baseline Care Plan for the resident that includes the instructions needed to provide effective and person- centered care of the resident that meets professional standards of care (42 CFR \u00a7483.21(a)). In many cases, interventions to meet the resident's needs will a lready have been implemented to addre ss prio rity issues pri or to completion of the f inal c are plan. At this tim e, many of the resident's pr oblems in the 20 care ar eas will have been identifi ed, causes w ill have been conside red, and a baseline c are plan in itiated. However, a f inal CAA(s) rev iew and associ ated docu mentation are s till required no la ter than the 14th calen dar day of adm ission ( admission da te plus 13 c alendar days). Detai led in formation r egarding e ach CAA and t he CAA pr ocess app ears in Chapter 4 of this m anual. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 42 Care Plan Completion Care plan com pletion ba sed on the C AA process is req uired f or OBRA -required comprehensive assess ments. It is not requi red for non- comprehensive as (Quarterly, SCQA), P PS assessm ents, Discharge assessm ents, or Trac king records. However, t he resident's care plan must be reviewed after each assessment , as required by \u00a7483.20, except discharge assessments, and revised based on changing goals, preferences and needs of the resident and in response to current interventions. After co mpleting the M DS and C AA portions of the co mprehensive a ssessment, the next step is to evaluat e the i nformation gained t hrough both asse ssment processes in order to identify proble ms, causes, cont ributing f actors, a nd risk f actors re lated to the proble ms. Subsequent ly, the IDT m ust evalu ate the in formation g ained to develop a care plan t hat address es those f indings in the co ntext of the resi dent's goals, preferences, strengths, proble ms, and ne eds (descr ibed in deta il in C hapter 4 of this m anual). The care pl an completion date ( item V0200C2) m ust be eit her later than or the sa me date as the CAA co mpletion date ( item V0200B2), but no l ater than 7 calend ar days a fter the CAA c ompletion da te. The MDS co mpletion dat e (item Z0500B) must be ear lier than or the sam e date as the care plan co mpletion da te. In no event should eit her d ate be l ater than the es tablished ti me frames as des cribed in Sect ion 2.6. For Annual assess ments, SCSAs, and SCPAs, the process is basically the same as that descri bed w ith an Adm ission ass essment. In these cases, h owever, the c are p lan will already be i n place. Re view of the CAA(s) when the MDS is complete f or these assessm ent types should raise q uestions about t he need to m odify or conti nue serv ices and resu lt in either the continuanc e or rev ision of the exis ting care plan. A new care plan does not ne ed to be deve loped a fter each Annual assessm ent, SCSA, or S CPA. Residents' preferences and goals may change throughout their stay, so facilities should have ongoing discussions with the resident and resident representative, if applicable, so that changes can be reflected in the comprehensive care plan . Detai led in formation regarding the care planni ng process appears in Cha pter 4 of this manual. 2.8 Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System Assessment Schedule SNFs m ust assess the c linical con dition of bene ficiaries by c ompleting the MDS as sessment for each Medic are res ident receiving Pa rt A SNF -level ca re for rei mburse ment under the SNF PPS. In addi tion t o the PPS assess ments, the SNF m ust also c omplete the requi rements f or ments ap ply to the PPS assessm ents, such as c ompletion a nd subm ission tim e frames. Asses smen t Window The PPS 5- Day assessment has de fined days within whi ch the Assessm ent Ref erence Date (ARD) m ust be set. The ARD must be a day within the prescribed window of Days 1 through 8 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 43 of the Part A stay and must be set on the MDS form itself or in the facility software before this window has passed. The f irst day of Medicare Part A cov erage f or the curre nt stay is co nsidered day 1 f or PPS assessm ent scheduling purposes and for purposes of the variable per diem adjustment, as discussed in Chapter 6, Section 6.7. In most cases, the first day of Medicare Part A cover age is the date of admission. However, the re are situations in which the M edica re ben eficiary may quali fy for Part A s ervices at a l ater date. See Chapter 6, Section 6.7, f or more de tailed information. Scheduled PPS Asses smen t The PPS- required s tandard ass essment is the 5 -Day assessment, which has a p redetermined ti me period f or set ting the ARD. The SNF provider m ust set the ARD on days 1 -8 to assure complian ce with t he SNF PPS PDPM requi PPS Assessme nts There ar e situations whe n a SNF provider may complete an a ssessm ent after the 5-Day assessment. This asse ssment is an unsche duled assess ment called the Interim Payment Assessment (IPA). When deemed appropriate by the provider, t his assessment may be completed to capture changes in the resident 's status and condition. Tracki ng Records and Discharge Assessm ents Reporting Tracking records and Di scharge a ssessments reporting are re quired on all residents in the SNF and swing bed f acilities. Tracking records and st andalone D ischarge ass essments do not i mpact payment. Part A PPS Discharge Assessment (A0310H) The Part A PPS Discharge assessment contains data elements used to calculate current and future SNF QRP quality measures under the IMPACT Act . The IMPACT Act directs the Secretary to specify quality measures on which Post -Acut e Care ( PAC ) providers (which includes SNFs) are required to submit standardized resident asse ssment data. Section 1899B(2)(b)(1)(A)(B) of the Act delineates that resident assessment data must be submitted with respect to a resident's admission into and di scharge from a SNF setting. Per current requirements, the OBRA Discharge assessment is used when the resident is physically discharged from the facility. The Part A PPS Discharge assessment is completed when a resident 's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remains in the facility (unless it is an instance of an interrupted stay) . Item A0310H, \"Is this a Part A PPS Discharge Assessment?\" identifies whether or not the discharge is a Part A PPS Discharge assessment for the purposes of the SNF QRP ( see Chapter 3, Section A for further details and coding instructions). The Part A PPS Discharge assessment can also be combined with the OBRA Discharge assessment when a resident receiving services under SNF Part A PPS has a Discharge Date (A2000) that occurs on the day of or one day after the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C), because in this instance, both the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments would be required. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 44 Part A PPS Discharge Assessment (A0310H = 1): For the Part A PPS Dischar ge ass essment, the A RD (item A2300) is not set prospe ctively as with other assess ments. The ARD (A2300) for a standalone Part A PPS Disch arge assessment is alwa ys equal to the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C). The ARD m ay be coded on the ass essment any ti me during the a ssessm ent com pletion period ( i.e., End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) + 14 calend ar days) . If the resident's Medicare Part A st ay ends and the resident is physically discharged from the facility, an OBRA Discharge assessment is required. If the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the day of or one day before the Discharge Date (A2000), the OBRA Discharge assessment and Part A PPS Discharge assessment are both required and may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000). The Part A PPS Discharge assessment may be co mbined with most OBRA -required a ssessm ents when requ irements f or all assess ments are m et (please see Section 2.1 0 Combining PPS Assessments and OBRA Assessments). Must be c ompleted ( item Z0500B) within 14 da ys after the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C + 14 calend ar days). Must be su bmitted with in 14 days a fter the MDS co mpletion date (Z0500B + 14 calendar days). Consists of demographic, ad ministr ative, and c linical items. If the resident's Medicare Part A s tay ends and the resident subsequently returns to a skilled level of care and Medicare Part A benefits do not resume within 3 days, the PPS schedule starts again with a 5 -Day assessment. If the Medicare Part A stay does resume within the 3 -day interruption window, the n this is an interrupted stay (see below). If the resident leaves the facility for an interrupted stay, no P art A P PS Discharge Assessment is required when the resident leaves the building at the outset of the interrupted stay; however, an OBR A Discharge r ecord is required if the discharge criteria are met ( see Section 2.5) . If the resident returns to the facility within the interruption window, as defined above , an Entry tracking form is required; however, no new 5 -Day assessment is required.

If the assess ment is b eing used for reimbursement under the SNF PPS, the PPS Reason f or Assessm ent m ust be co ded in item A0310B. T he OBRA Reason f or Assessm ent is descri bed ea rlier in th is section whi le the PPS assessme nts are des cribed below. A SNF pro vider m ay co mbine asses sments to m eet both OBRA and PPS req uirements. W hen co mbining assess ments, a ll completion deadli nes and other requirements f or both types of assessm ents m ust be met. If all require ments cannot be m et, the assessments must be co mpleted separ ately. The rel ationship betwe assessm ents is discu ssed below a nd in ctions 2.10 and 2.11 . PPS Assessm ents for a Medicare Part A Stay 01. 5-Day Assessment ARD ( item A2300) must be s et for D ays 1 throug h 8 of the Part A SNF covered s tay. Must be c ompleted ( item Z0500B) within 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 days). Authorizes payment for entire PPS stay (except in cases when an IPA is completed). Must be su bmitted ele ctronica lly and accep ted in to the QIES ASAP system within 14 days a fter completion ( item Z0500 B) (co mpletion + 14 days). If combined with the OBRA A dmission assessm ent, the a ssessment must be co mpleted by the end of day 14 of admission ( admission da te plus 13 c alendar day s). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 46 Is the f irst PPS- required a ssessment to be co mpleted when the resident is first admitted for a SNF Part A stay. Is the f irst PPS- required a ssessment to be co mpleted when the resident is re-admitted to the facility for a Part A stay f ollowing a di scharge ass essment - re turn not a nticipated or if the resident returns m ore than 30 days a fter a disch arge assess ment-return an ticipated. A 5-Day assessment is not required at the time when a resident returns to a Part A - covered stay following an interrupted stay , regardless of the reason for the interruption (facility discharge, resident no longer skilled, payer change, etc.) . If a resident changes payers from Medica re Advantage to Medica re Part A, the SNF must complete a 5- Day assessment with the ARD set for one of days 1 through 8 of the Medica re Part A stay , with the resident 's first day covered by Medicare Part A serving as Day 1, unless it is a case of an interrupted stay. 02. Interim Payment Assessment Optional assessment . ARD ( item A2300) may be set for any day of the SNF PPS stay, beyond the ARD of the 5-Day assessment. Must be c ompleted ( item Z0500B) within 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 days). Authorizes payment for remainder of the PPS stay, beginning on the ARD. Must be su bmitted ele ctronica lly and accep ted in to the QIES ASAP system within 14 days a fter completion ( item Z0500 B) (co mpletion + 14 days). The ARD for an IPA may not precede that of the 5- Day assessment. May not be combined w ith any other assessments (PPS or OBRA). 03. Part A PPS Discharge Assessment See definition provided in Section 2.8, Part A PPS Discharge Assessment (A0310H = 1). 2.10 Combining PPS Assessments and OBRA Assessments7 SNF providers a re req uired to m eet two assessm ent standar ds in a Me dicare ce rtified nursing facility: The OBRA standards are designated by the reason selected in item A0310A, Federal OBRA Reason for Assessment , and item A0130F, Entry/Discharge Reporting and are required for all residents. The P PS standards are designated by the reason selected in item A0310B, PPS Assessment and item A0310H, Is this a SNF Part A PPS Discharge Assessment? When the OBRA and PPS assessment time frames coincide (except the IPA) , one assessment may be used to satisfy both requirements. PPS and OBRA assessments (except 7 OBRA assessments do not apply to Swing Bed providers; however, Swing Bed providers are required to complete the Entry Tracking record, Swing Bed PPS (SP), Swing Bed Discharge (SD) assessment, and Death in Facility Tracking record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 47 the IPA) may be combined when the ARD windows overlap allowing for a common assessment reference date. When combining the OBRA and PPS assessments, the most stringent requirements for ARD, item se t, and CAA completion requirements must be met. For example, the skilled nursing facility staff must be very careful in selecting the ARD for an OBRA Admission assessment combined with a 5- Day assessment. For the OBRA Admission, the ARD must be set between days 1 and 14 counting the date of admission as day 1. For the 5 -Day, the ARD must be set for days 1 through 8. However, when combining a 5- Day assessment with the OBRA Admission assessment, the use of the latter end of the OBRA Admission ARD window would cause the 5 -Day assessment to be considered late. To assure the assessment meets both standards, an ARD of a day between Day 1 and 8 would have to be chosen in this situation. In addition, the completion standards must be met. While a PPS assessment can b e completed within 14 days after the ARD when it is not combined with an OBRA assessment, the CAA completion date for the OBRA Admission assessment ( item V0200B2) must be day 14 or earlier. With the combined OBRA Admission/ 5- Day assessment, completion by day 14 would be required. Finally, when combining a PPS assessment with an OBRA assessment, the SNF staff must ensure that all required items are completed. Some states requi re pro viders to co mplete addi tional s tate-specific items (Section S) f or sel ected assessm ents. States m ay also add c omprehensive items to the Quarter ly and/or PPS i tem sets. Providers m ust ensur e that they f ollow their s tate requi rements in addi tion to any OB RA and/or PPS re quire ments. The f ollowing tabl es provide the item set f or each type of assessm ent or trac king r ecord.

If there is not a PPS assessment in the QIES ASA P syste m, the provider must bil l the def ault r ate for any Medicare days. The pro vider m ust al so complete a Death in F acility T racking Record ( see Section 2.6 f or grea ter det ail). Resident Transfers or Is Discharged Before or On the Eighth Day of SNF Stay If the benefi ciary is discharged f rom the SNF or the Medicare Part A stay ends (e.g., trans ferred to another payer source) before or on the eighth day of the covered SNF stay, the pro vider should prepar e a 5-Day assessment as co mplete ly as possible and subm it the ass essment as r equired. If there i s not a PPS assessment in the QIES AS AP syste m, the provider must bil l the def ault r ate for any Medica re days. When the Medicare Part A stay ends on or before the eighth day of the covered SNF stay, and the beneficiary remains in the facility, a Part A PPS Discharge assessment is required. When the benefi ciary is disch arged f rom the SNF, the provider must also co mplete an OBRA Discharge assess ment, but if the Medicare Part A stay ends on or before the eighth day of the covered SNF stay and the beneficiary is physical ly discharged from the facility the day of or the day after the Part A stay ends, the Part A PPS and OBRA Discharge assessments may be combined. (S ee Sections 2.10 and 2.11 for deta ils on combining a PPS assessm ent with a Discharge as sessment.) Resident Is Admitte d to an Acute Care Facility and Returns If a Medicar e Part A re sident is ad mitted to an ac ute ca re facility and la ter retur ns to the SNF to resume Part A coverage, the resident requires a new 5 -Day assessment , unless it is an instance of an interrupted stay. If it is a case of an interrupted stay (i.e., the resident returns to the SNF and resumes Part A services in the same SNF within the 3 -day interruption window), then no PPS assessment is required upon reentry, only an Entry tracking form. An IPA may be completed, if deemed appropriate. Resident I s Sent to Acute Ca re Facilit y, Not in SNF over Midnight, and I s Not Admitted to Acute Care Facili ty If a resi dent is out of the f acility over a midnight, but f or less than 24 hours, and is not ad mitted to an acute c are facility, a new 5 -Day PPS assessment is not required , though an IPA may be completed, if deemed appropriate. However, there a re pay ment im plications: the day pre ceding the midnight on whi ch the r esident was absent f rom the nursing hom e is not a covered Par t A day. This is known as the \"midnight rule.\" For e xample, if the resi dent g oes to t he em ergency room at 10 p.m. W ednes day, day 22 of his Part A stay, and returns at 3 a.m. the next day, Wednesday is not bill able to Par t A. As a re sult, the day of his return to the SNF, Thursday, 8 These requirements/ polici es also a pply to swing bed providers. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 51 beco mes day 22 of his Part A stay. This means that this day is skipped for purposes of the variable per diem adju stment, described in Chapter 6. Resident Takes a Lea ve of Absence from the SNF If a resi dent is out of the facility for a Leave of Absence (L OA) as def ined on page 2- 13 in this chapt er, there may be payment implications . For exa mple, if a resident l eaves a SNF at 6:00 p.m. on W ednesday, which is Day 27 of the res ident's s tay a nd retur ns to the SNF on Thursday at 9:00 a .m., then W ednesday beco mes a non -billable day and Thursday be comes Day 27 of the resident's stay. If the beneficiary experiences a leave of absence during part of the assessment observation period, the facility may include services furnished during the beneficiary's temporary absence (when permitted under MDS coding guidelines; see Chapter 3) . Resident Discharg ed from Part A Ski lled Services and from the Facility and Returns to SNF Part A Skilled Level Services In the s ituation when a bene ficiary is discharged from Medicare Par t A and is physically discharged from the facility, but returns to resume SNF Part A skilled services after the interruption window has closed, the OBRA Discharge and Part A PPS Discharge must be completed and can be combined (see Part A PPS Discharge in Section 2.5). On return to the facility, this is conside red a new Part A stay (as long as resumption of Part A occurs within the 30- day window allowed by Medicare), and a new 5- Day and Entry Tracking record must be completed. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no OBRA assessment is required. How ever, if the resident was discharged return not anticipated, the facility must complete a new OBRA Admission assessment. See Chapter 6, Section 6 .7 for great er detai l to d etermine whether or not the resi dent is eligible f or Part A SNF coverage. However, in the case of an interrupted stay, that is, if a resident leaves the facility and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , only an OBRA Discharge is required. An Entry Tracking record is required on reentry, but no 5- Day is required. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no OBRA assessment is required. However, if the resident was discharged return not anticipated, the facility must complete a new OBRA Admission assessment. The be neficiary should be ass essed to deter mine if there was a signi ficant c hange in s tatus. Resident Discharg ed from Part A Ski lled Services Is Not Physically Discharged from the Skilled Nursing Facility In the situation when a resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident is not physically discharged from the facility, remaining i n a Medi care and/or Me dicaid certified bed with another payer source, t he facility must continue with the OB RA schedule from the beneficiary's original date of admission (item A1 900) and must also complete a Part A PPS Discharge assessment. If Part A benefits resume, there is no reason to change the OB RA schedule; the PPS schedu le would start ag ain with a 5 -Day assessment, MDS item A 0310B = 01, unless it is a case of an CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 52 interrupte d stay \u2014that is, if the resident is discharged from Part A, remains in the facility , and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , no Part A PPS Discharge is completed, nor is a 5- Day required when Part A resumes. Delay in Requiring and Receiving Skilled Services There ar e instances wh en the bene ficiary d oes not req uire S NF level of care s ervices when initially ad mitted to t he SNF. See Ch apter 6, Se ction 6.7. Non-Com pliance w ith the PPS Assessmen t Schedule According t o Part 42 Code of Feder al Regula tion (CFR) Sect ion 413.343, an assess ment th at does not ha ve its ARD within the p rescribed A RD window will be p aid at the de fault rate for the number of days the ARD is out of compliance. Frequent l ate assessment scheduling prac tices or missed assessments m ay resu lt in additional review. The default r ate takes the place of the otherwise ap plicable Federal rate. It is equal to the r ate paid for the Health Insurance Prospective Payment System ( HIPPS) code ref lecting the l owest acu ity level for each PDPM component and would gene rally be lower than the M edica re rate payable if the SNF had su bmitted an assessm ent in accordan ce with the pr escri bed as sessment schedule. Late PPS Asse ssment If the SNF fails to set the ARD within the defined ARD window for a 5 -Day assessment, and the resident is still on Part A, the SNF must complete a late assessment. The ARD can be no earlier than the day the error was identified. The SNF will bill the default rate for the number of days that the ass essment is out of compliance. This is equal to the number of days between the day following the last day of the available ARD window and the late ARD (including the late ARD). The SNF would then bill the HIPPS code established by the late assessment for th e remainder of the SNF stay, unless the SNF chooses to complete an IPA. For example, a 5 -Day assessment with an ARD of Day 11 is out of compliance for 3 days and therefore would be paid at the default rate for Days 1 through 3 of the Part A stay and the HI PPS code from the late 5 -Day assessment for the remainder of the Part A stay, unless an IPA is completed. Missed P PS Asse ssment If the SNF fails to set the ARD of a 5-Day assess ment pri or to the end of the last day of the ARD window, and the resident was already dis charged f rom Medica re Part A when this e rror is discove red, the provide r cannot co mplete an ass essment for SNF PPS purposes a nd the days cannot be bi lled to Pa rt A. Errors on a PPS As sessment To corre ct an error on an MDS that has been su bmitted to the QIES AS AP syste m, the SNF must follow the nor mal MDS correction procedur es (see Chapter 5). 2.13 Expected Order of MDS Records The MDS records f or a n ursing hom e resident a re expected to occur in a specific order.

The goal of this chapter is to facilitate the accurate coding of the MDS resident assessment and to provide assessors with the rationale and resources to optimize resident care and outcomes. 3.1 Using this Chapter Throughout this chapter, MDS assessment sections are presented using a standard format for ease of review and instruction. In addition, screenshots of each section are available for illustration purposes. Note: There are images imbedded in this manual and if you are using a screen reader to acc ess the content contained in the manual you should refer to the MDS 3.0 item set to review the referenced information. The order of the sections is as follows: Intent. The reason(s) for including this set of assessment items in the MDS. Item Display. To facilitate accurate resident assessment using the MDS, each assessment section is accompanied by screen shots, which display the item from the MDS 3.0 item set. Item Rationale. The purpose of assessing this aspect of a resident's clinical or functional sta tus. Health- related Quality of Life. How the condition, impairment, improvement, or decline being assessed can affect a resident's quality of life, along with the importance of staff understanding the relationship of the clinical or functional issue relat ed to quality of life. Planning for Care. How assessment of the condition, impairment, improvement, or decline being assessed can contribute to appropriate care planning. Steps for Assessment. Sources of information and methods for determining the correct response for coding each MDS item. Coding Instructions. The proper method of recording each response, with explanations of individual response categories. Coding Tips and Special Populations. Clarifications, issues of note, and conditions to be considered when coding individual MDS items. Examples. Case examples of appropriate coding for most, if not all, MDS sections/items. Additional layout issues to note include (1) the symbol is displayed in all MDS 3.0 sections/items that require a resident interv iew, and (2) important definitions are highlighted in the columns, and these and other definitions of interest may be found in the glossary. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: Overview of Guide to MDS Items October 2019 Page 3-4 directed (e.g., item B0100, Comatose , directs the assesso r to skip to item G0110, Activities of Daily Living Assistance , if B0100 is answered code 1, yes. The intervening items from B0200-F0800 would not be coded (i.e. left blank). If B0100 was recorded as code 0, no, then the assessor would continue to code the MDS at the next item, B0200). Use a check mark for boxes where the instructions state to \"check all that apply,\" if specified condition is met; otherwise these boxes remain blank (e.g., F0800, Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences , boxes A- Z). Use a numeric response (a number or pre-assigned value) for blank boxes (e.g., M1030, Number of Venous and Arterial Ulcers ). When completing hard copy forms to be used for data entry, capital letters may be easiest to read. Print legibly. When recording month, day, and year for dates, enter two digits for the month and the day and four digits for the year. For example, the third day of January in the year 2011 is recorded as: Almost all MDS 3.0 items allow a dash ( -) value to be entered and submitted to the MDS QIES ASAP system. \u2014 A dash value indicates that an item was not assessed. This most often occurs when a resident is discharged before the item could be assessed. \u2014 Dash values allow a partial assessment to be submitted when an assessment is required for payment purposes. \u2014 There are four date items (A2400C, O0400A6, O0400B6, and O0400C6) that use a dash-filled value to indicate that the event has not yet occurred. For example, if there is an ongoing Medicare stay, then the end date for that Medicare stay (A2400C) has not occurred, therefore, this item would be dash- filled. \u2014 The few items that do not allow dash values include identification items in Section A [e.g., Legal Name of Resident (Item A0500), Assessment Reference Date (Item A2300), Type of Assessment (Item A0310), and Gender (Item A0800)] and ICD diagnosis codes (Item I8000). All items for which a dash is not an acceptable value can be found on the CMS MDS 3.0 Technical Information web page at the following link: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient-Assessment - Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/NHQIMDS30TechnicalInformation.html . When the term \"phys ician\" is used in this manual, it should be interpreted as including nurse practitioners, physician assistant s, or clinical nurse specialist s, if allowable under state licensure laws and Medicare. Residents should be the primary source of information for r esident assessment items. Should the resident not be able to participate in the assessment, the resident's family, significant other, and guardian or legally authorized representative should be consulted. Several times throughout the manual the word \"signi ficant\" is used. The term may have different connotations depending on the circumstance in which it is used.

A0050: Type of Record Coding Instructions for A0050, Type of Record Code 1, Add new record: if this is a new record that has not been previously submitted and accepted in the QIES ASAP system. If this item is coded as 1 , continue to A0100 Facility Provider Numbers. If there is an existing database record for the same resident, the same facility, the same reasons for assessment/tracking, and the same date (assessment reference date, entry date, or discharge date), then the current record is a duplicate and not a new record. In this case, the submitted record will be rejected and not accepted in the QI ES ASAP system and a \"fatal\" error will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. Code 2, Modify existing record: if this is a request to modify the MDS items for a record that already has been submitted and accepted in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System ( QIES ) Assessment Submission and Processing ( ASAP ) system. If this item is coded as 2 , continue to A0100, Facility Provider Numbers. When a modification reque st is submitted, the QIES ASAP system will take the following steps: 1. The system will attempt to locate the existing record in the QIES ASAP system for this facility with the resident, reasons for assessment/tracking, and date ( Assessment Reference D ate (ARD) , entry date, or discharge date) indicated in subsequent Section X items. 2. If the existing record is not found, the submitted modification record will be rejected and not accepted in the QIES ASAP system. A \"fatal\" error will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. 3. If the existing record is found, then the items in all sections of the submitted modification record will be edited. If there are any fatal errors, the modification record will be rejected and not accepted in the QIES ASAP system. The \"fatal\" error(s) will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. 4. If the modification record passes all the edits, it will replace the prior record being modified in the QIES ASAP system . The prior rec ord will be moved to a history file in the QIES ASAP system .

If the existing record is not found in the QIES ASAP system , the submitted inactivation request will be rejected and a \"fatal\" error will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. 3. All items in Section X of the submitted record will be edited. If there are any fatal errors, the current inactivati on request will be rejected and no record will be inactivated in the QIES ASAP system. 4. If the existing record is found, it will be removed from the active records in the QIES ASAP system and moved to a history file. Identification of Record to be Modifie d/Inactivated The Section X items from X0200 through X0700 identify the existing QIES ASAP system assessment or tracking record that is in error. In this section, reproduce the information EXACTLY as it appeared on the existing erroneous record, even if the information is incorrect. This information is necessary to locate the existing record in the database. Example: A MDS assessment for Joan L. Smith is submitted and accepted by the QIES ASAP system. A data entry error is then identified on the previously submitted and accepted record : The encoder mistakenly entered \"John\" instead of \"Joan\" when entering a prior assessment for Joan L. Smith. To correct this data entry error, the facility will modify the erroneous record and complete the items in Section X including items under Identification of Record to be Modified/Inactivated. When completing X0200A, the Resident First Name, \"John\" will be entered in this item. This will permit the MDS system to locate the previously submitted assessment that is being cor rected. If the correct name \"Joan\" were entered, the QIES ASAP system would not locate the prior assessment. The correction to the name from \"John\" to \"Joan\" will be made by recording \"Joan\" in the \"normal\" A0500A, Resident First Name in the modification r ecord. The modification record must include all items appropriate for that assessment, not just the corrected name. This modification record will then be submitted and accepted into the QIES ASAP system, which causes the desired correction to be made.

DEFINITION Part A PPS Discharge Assessment A discharge assessment developed to inform current and future Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program ( SNF QRP ) measures and the calculation of the se measures. The Part A PPS Discharge assessment is completed when a resident's Medicare Part A stay ends , but the resident remains in the facility; or may be combined with an OBRA Discharge if the Part A stay ends on the same day or the day before the resident's Discharge Date (A2000). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -9 A0310: Type of Assessment (cont.) Codi ng Instructions for A0310G1, Is this a SNF Part A Interrupted Stay? Code 0, no: if the resident was discharged from SNF care (i.e., from a Medicare Part A-covered stay) but did not resume SNF care in the same SNF within the interruption window. Code 1, yes: if the resident was discharged from SNF care (i.e., from a Medicare Part A- covered stay) but did resume SNF care in the same SNF within the interruption window. Coding Tips Item A0310G1 indicates whether or not an interrupted stay occurred. The interrupted stay policy applies to residents who either leave the SNF, then return to the same SNF within the interruption window, or to residents who are discharged from Part A- covered services and remain in the SNF, but then resume a Part A- covered stay within the interruption window. DEFINITION S Interrupted Stay Is a Medicare Part A SNF stay in which a resident is discharged from SNF care (i.e., the resident is discharged from a Medicare Part A -covered stay) and subsequently resumes SNF care in the same SNF for a Medicare Part A -covered stay during the interruption window. Interruption Window Is a 3 -day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A -covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non-covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A-covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A-covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -10 A0310: Type of Assessment (cont.) The following is a list of examples of an interrupted stay when the resident leaves the SNF and then returns to the same SNF to resume Part A- covered services within the interruption window. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: o Resident transfers to an acute care setting for evaluation or treatment due to a change in condition and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window . o Resident transfers to a psychiatric facility for evaluation or treatment and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. o Resident transfers to an outpatient facility for a procedure or treatment and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window . o Resident transfers to an assisted living facility or a private residence with home health services and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. o Resident leaves against medical advice and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. The following is a list of examples of an interrupted stay when the resident under a Part A-covered stay remains in the facility but the stay stops being covered under the Part A PPS benefit, and then resumes Part A-covered services in the SNF within the interruption window. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: o Resid ent elects the hospice benefit, thereby declining the SNF benefit, and then revokes the hospice benefit and resumes SNF -level care within the interruption window. o Resident refuses to participate in rehabilitation and has no other daily skilled need; this ends the Part A coverage. Within the interruption window, the resident decides to engage in the planned rehabilitation regime and Part A coverage resumes. o Resident changes payer sources from Medicare Part A to an alternate payer source (i.e. , hospice, private pay or private insurance) and then wishes to resume their Medicare Part A stay, at the same SNF, within the interruption window. If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF, and resumes a Part A-covered stay in the SNF w ithin the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. No discharge assessment (OBRA or Part A PPS) is required, nor is an Entry Tracking Record or 5-Day required on resumption. If a resident leaves the SNF and returns to resume Part A- covered service s in the same SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. Although this situation does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay, the resident left the SNF, and therefore an OBRA Discharge assessment is required. On return to the SNF, no 5-Day would be required. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -11 A0310: Type of Assessment (cont.) When an interrupted stay occurs, a 5-Day PPS assessment is not required upon reentry or resumption of SNF care in the same SNF, because an interrupted stay does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay. If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF and does not resume Part A-covered services within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, a Part A PPS Discharge is required. If the resident qualifies and there is a resumption of Part A services within the 30-day window allowed by Medicare, a 5- Day would be required as this would be considered a new Part A stay. The OBRA schedule would continue from the resident's original date of admission (item A1900). If a resident leaves the SNF and does not return to resume Part A-c overed services in the same SNF within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, both the Part A PPS and OBRA Discharge assessments are required (and may be combined). If the resident returns to the same SNF, this would be considered a new Part A stay. An Entry Tracking record and 5-Day would be required on re turn. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. The OBRA assessment schedule is unaffected by the interrupted stay policy. Please refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on OBRA assessment scheduling requirements. Coding Instructions for A0310H, Is this a Part A PPS Discharge Assessment? Code 0, no: if this is not a Part A PPS Discharge assessment . Code 1, yes: if this is a Part A PPS Discharge assessment . A Part A PPS Discharge assessment (NPE Item Set) is required under the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program (SNF QRP) when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends (as documented in A2400C, End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay) but the resident remains in the facility . If the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the day of or one day before the Discharge Date (A2000) , the OBRA Discharge assessment and Part A PPS Discharge assessment are both required and may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000) . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -12 A0410: Unit Certification or Licensure Designation Item Rationale In coding this item, the facility must consider its Medicare and/or Medicaid status as well as the state's authority to collect MDS records. State regulations may require submission of MDS data to the QIES ASAP system or directly to the state for residents residing in licensed -only beds. Nursing homes must be certain they are submitting MDS assessments to the QIES ASAP system for those residents who are on a Medicare and/or Medicaid certified unit. Swing bed facilities must be certain that they are submitting MDS assessments only for those residents whose stay is covered by Medicare Part A benefits. For those residents who are in licensed -only beds, nursing homes must be certain they are submitting MDS assessments either to QIES ASAP or directly to the state in accordance with state requirements. Payer source is not the determinant by which this item is coded. This item is coded solely according to the authority CMS has to collect MDS data for residents who are on a Medicare and/or Med icaid certified unit and the authority that the state may have to collect MDS data under licensure. Consult Chapter 5, page 5-1 of this Manual for a discussion of what types of records should be submitted to the QIES ASAP system . Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the nursing home administrator or representative which units in the nursing home are Medicare certified, Medicaid certified or dually certified (Medicare/Medicaid) . 2. If some or all of the units in the nursing home are neither Medica re nor Medicaid certified, ask the nursing home administrator or representative if there are units that are state licensed and if the state requires MDS submission for residents on that unit. 3. Identify all units in the nursing home that are not certified or licensed by the state, if any. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -13 A0410: Unit Certification or Licensure Designation (cont.) Coding Instructions Code 1, Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified and MDS data is not required by the State: if the MDS record is for a resident on a un it that is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified, and neither CMS nor the state has authority to collect MDS information for residents on this unit , the facility may not submit MDS records to QIES ASAP. If any record s are submitted under this certification designation , they will be rejected by the QIES ASAP system . Code 2, Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State: if the nursing home resident is on a unit that is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified, but the s tate has authority under s tate licensure to collect MDS information for residents on such units, the facility should submit the resident's MDS reco rds per the state's requirement to QIES ASAP or directly to the state . Note that this certification designation does not apply to swing -bed facilities. Assessments for swing -bed residents on which A0410 is coded \"2\" will be rejected by the QIES ASAP syste m. Code 3, Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified: if the resident is on a Medicare and/or Medicaid certified unit , regardless of payer source (i.e., even if the resident is private pay or has his/her stay covered under Medicare Advantage, Medicare HMO, private insurance, etc.), the facility is required to submit MDS records (OBRA and SNF PPS only) to QIES ASAP for these residents . Consult Chapter 5, page 5-1 of this Manual for a discussion of what types of records should be submitted to the QIES ASAP system. A0500: Legal Name of Resident Item Rationale Allows identification of resident. Also used for matching each of the resident's records . Steps for Assessment 1. Ask resident, family, significant other, guardian, or legally authorized representative. DEFINITION LEGAL NAME Resident's name as it appears on the Medicare card. If the resident is not enrolled in the Medicare program, use the resident's name as it appears on a Medicaid card or other government -issued document. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -14 A0500: Legal Name of Resident (cont.) 2. Check the resident's name on his or her Medicare card, or if not in the program, check a Medicaid card or other government -issued document. Coding Instructions Use printed letters. Enter in the following order: A. First Name B. Middle Initial (if the resident has no middle initial, leave Item A0500B blank; if the resident has two or more middle names, use the initial of the first middle name) C. Last Name D. Suffix (e.g., Jr./ Sr.) A0600: Social Security and Medicare Numbers Item Rationale Allows identification of the resident. Allows records for resident to be matched in system. Coding Instructions Enter the Social Security Number (SSN) in A0600A, one number per space starting with the leftmost space. If no SSN is available for the resident (e.g., if the resident is a recent immigrant or a child) the item may be left blank. Note: A valid SSN should be submitted in A0600A whenever it is available so that resident matching can be performed as accurately as possible. Enter Medicare number in A0600B exactly as it appears on the resident's documents. For PPS assessments (A0310B = 01 or 08), the Medicare nu mber (A0600B) must be present (i.e., may not be left blank). A0600B must be a Medicare number . DEFINITIONS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER A tracking number assigned to an individual by the U.S. Federal government for taxation, benefits, and identification purposes. MEDI CARE NUMBER An identifier assigned to an individual for participation in national health insurance program. The Medicare Health Insurance identifier is different from the resident's Social Security Number (SSN) and may con tain both letters and numbers. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -15 A0700: Medicaid Number Item Rationale Assists in correct resident identificatio n. Coding Instructions Record this number if the resident is a Medicaid recipient . Enter one number or letter per box beginning in the leftmost box. Recheck the number to make sure you have entered the digits correctly . Enter a \"+\" in the leftmost box if the number is pending. If you are notified later that the resident does have a Medicaid number, just include it on the next assessment. If not applicable because the resident is not a Medicaid recipient, enter \"N\" in the leftmost box. Coding Tips and Special Populations To obtain the Medicaid number, check the resident's Medicaid card, admission or transfer records, or medical record. Confirm that the resident's name on the MDS matches the resident's name on the Medicaid card. It is not necessary to process an MDS correction to add the Medicaid number on a prior assessment . However, a correction may be a State -specific requirement. A0800: Gender I tem Rationale Assists in correct identification . Provides demographic gender specific health trend information. Coding Instructions Code 1: if resident is male. Code 2: if resident is female. Coding Tips and Special Populations Resident gender on the MDS must match what is in the Social Security system. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -16 A0900: Birth Date Item Rationale Assists in correct identification. Allows determination of age. Coding Instructions Fill in the boxes with the appropriate birth date. If the complete birth date is known, do not leave any boxes blank. If the month or day contains only a single digit, fill the first box in with a \"0.\" For example: January 2, 1918, should be entered as 01- 02-1918. Sometimes, only the birth year or the birth year and birth month will be known. These situations are handled as follows: \u2014 If only the birth year is known (e.g., 1918), then enter the year in the \"year\" portion of A0900, and leave the \"month\" and \"day\" portions blank. If the birth year and birth month are known, but the day of the month is not known, then enter the year in the \"year\" portion of A0900, enter the month in the \"month\" portion of A0900, and leave the \"day\" portion blank. A1000: Race/Ethnicity I tem Rationale This item uses the common uniform language approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to report racial and ethnic categories . The categories in this classification are social -political constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. Provides demographic race/ethnicity specific health trend information. These categories are NOT used to determine eligibility for participation in any Federal program. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -17 A1000: Race/Ethnicity (cont.) Steps for Assessment: Interview Instructions 1. Ask the resident to select the category or categories that most closely c orrespond to his or her race/ethnicity from the list in A1000. Individuals may be more comfortable if this and the preceding question are introduced by saying, \"We want to make sure that all our residents get the best care possible, regardless of their race or ethnic background. We would like you to tell us your ethnic and racial background so that we can review the treatment that all residents receive and make sure that everyone gets the highest quality of care\" (Baker et al., 2005). 2. If the resident is unable to respond, ask a family member or significant ot her. 3. Category definitions are provided to resident or family only if requested by them in order to answer the item. 4. Respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations. 5. Only if the resident is unable to respond and no fami ly member or significant other is available, observer identification or medical record documentation may be used. Coding Instructions Check all that apply. Enter the race or ethnic category or categories the resident , family or significant other uses to identify him or her. DEFINITIONS RACE/ETHNICITY AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NATIVE A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -18 A1100: Language Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Inability to make needs known and to engage in social interaction because of a language barrier can be very frustrating and can resu lt in isolation, depression, and unmet needs. Language barriers can interfere with accurate assessment. Planning for Care When a resident needs or wants an interpreter, the nursing home should ensure that an interpreter is available. An alternate method of communication also should be made available to help to ensure that basic needs can be expressed at all times, such as a communication board with pictures on it for the resident to point to (if able). Identifies residents who need interpreter services in order to answer interview items or participate in consent process. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident if he or she needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with a doctor or health care staff . 2. If the resident is unable to respond, a family member or significant other should be asked. 3. If neither source is available, review record for evidence of a need for an interpreter. 4. If an interpreter is wanted or needed, ask for preferred language. 5. It is acceptable for a family member or significant o ther to be the interpreter if the resident is comfortable with it and if the family member or significant other will translate exactly what the resident says without providing his or her interpretation.

Divorced CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -20 A1300: Optional Resident Items Item Rationale Some facilities prefer to include the nursing home medical record number on the MDS to facilitate tracking. Some facilities conduct unit reviews of MDS items in addition to resident and nursing home level reviews. The unit may be indicated by the room number. Preferred name and lifetime occupation help nursing home staff members personalize their inter actions with the resident. Many people are called by a nickname or middle name throughout their life . It is important to call residents by the name they prefer in order to establish comfort and respect between staff and resident . Also, some cognitively imp aired or hearing impaired residents might have difficulty responding when called by their legal name, if it is not the name most familiar to them. Others may prefer a more formal and less familiar address . For example, a physician might appreciate being re ferred to as \"Doctor.\" Knowing a person's lifetime occupation is also helpful for care planning and conversation purposes. For example, a carpenter might enjoy pursuing hobby shop activities. These are optional items because they are not needed for CMS program function .

When two occupations are identified, place a slash (/) between each oc cupation. The lifetime occupation of a person whose primary work was in the home should be recorded as \"homemaker.\" For a resident who is a child or an intellectually disabled /developmentally disabled adult resident who has never had an occupation, record as \"none.\" A1500: Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life All individuals who are admitted to a Medicaid certified nursing facility , regardless of the individual's payment source, must have a Level I PASRR completed to screen for possible mental illness (MI), intellectual disability (ID), developmental disability (DD) , or related conditions (please contact your local State Medicaid Agency for details regarding PASRR requirements and exemptions). Individuals who have or are suspected to have MI or ID/DD or related conditions may not be admitted to a Medicaid -certified nursing facility unless approved through Level II PASRR determination. Those residents covered by Level II PASRR process may require certain care and services provided by the nursing home, and/or specialized services provided by the State. A resident with MI or ID /DD must have a Resident Review (RR) conducted when there is a significant change in the resident's physical or me ntal condition. Therefore, when an SCSA is completed for a resident with MI or ID /DD, the nursing home is required to notify the State mental health authority, intellectual disability or developmental disability authority (depending on which operates in their State ) in order to notify them of the resident's change in status. Section 1919(e)(7)(B)(iii) of the Social Security Act requires the notification or referral for a significant change. 1 1 The statute may also be referenced as 42 USC 1396r(e)(7)(B)(iii). Note that as of this revision date the statute supersedes Federal regulations at 42 CFR 483.114(c), which still reads as requiring annual resident review. The regulation has not yet been updated to reflect the statutory change to resident review upon significant change in condition. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -22 A1500: Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) (cont.) Each State Medicaid A gency might have specific processes and guidelines for referral, and which types of significant changes should be referred. Therefore, facilities should become acquainted with their own State requirements. Please see https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/ltss/institutional/pasrr/index.html for CMS information on PASRR. Planning for Care The Level II PASRR determination and the evaluation report specify services to be provided by the nursing home and/or speci alized services defined by the State. The State is responsible for providing specialized services to individuals with MI or ID/DD. In some States specialized services are provided to residents in Medicaid - certified facilities (in other States specialized services are only provided in other facility types such as a psychiatric hospital). The nursing home is required to provide all other care and services appropriate to the resident's condition. The services to be provided by the nursing home and/or specialized services provided by the State that are specified in t he Level II PASRR determination and the evaluation report should be addressed in the plan of care. Identifies individuals who are subject to Resident Review upon change in condition. Steps for Assessment 1. Complete if A0310A = 01, 03, 04 or 05 (Admission assessment, Annual assessment, SCSA , Significant Correction to P rior Comprehensive A ssessment). 2.

A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) Item Rationale To document the date this episode of care in this facility began. Coding Instructions Enter the date this episode of care in this facility began . Use the format : Month- Day- Year : XX -XX-XXXX. For example, October 12, 2010, would be entered as 10-12-2010. The Admission Date may be the same as the Entry Date (A1600) f or the entire stay (i.e., if the resident is never discharged). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -29 A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) (cont.) Examples 1. Mrs. H was admitted to the facility from an acute care hospital on 09/14/2013 for rehabilitation after a hip replacement. In completing her Admission assessment , the facility entered 09/1 4/2013 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 1, Admission; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800, Entered From; and entered 09/1 4/2013 in item A1900, Admission Date. 2. The facility received communication from an acute care hospital discharge planner stating that Mrs. H, a former resident of the facility who was discharged home return not anticipated on 11/02/2013 after a successful recovery and rehabilitation, was admitted to their hospital on 2/8/2014 and wished to return to the facility for rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Mrs. H returned to the facility on 2/15/2014. Although Mrs. H was a resident of the facility in September of 2013, she was discharged home return not anticipated ; therefore, the facility rightly considered Mrs. H as a new admission. In completing her Admission assessment, the facility entered 02/15/2014 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 1, Admission; c hose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800, Entered From ; and entered 02/15/2014 in item A1900, Admission Date. 3. Mr. K was admitted to the facility on 10/05/2013 and was discharged to the hospit al, return anticipated, on 10/20/2013. He returned to the facility on 10/26/2013. Since Mr. K was a resident of the facility , was discharged return anticipated , and returned within 30 days of discharge, Mr. K was considered as continuing in his current sta y. Therefore, when the facility completed his Entry Tracking Record on return from the hospital, they entered 1 0/26/2013 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 2, Reentry; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800; and entered 1 0/05/2013 in item A1900, Admi ssion Date. Approximately a month after his return, Mr. K was again sent to the hospital, return anticipated on 11/05/2013. He returned to the facility on 11/22/2013. Again, since Mr. K was a resident of the facility , was discharged return anticipated , and returned within 30 days of discharge, Mr. K was considered as continuing in his current stay. Therefore, when the facility completed his Entry Tracking Record, they entered 11/22/2013 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 2, Reentry; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800; and entered 10/05/2013 in item A1900, Admission Date. 4. Ms. S was admitted to the facility on 8/26/2014 for rehabilitation after a total knee replacement. Three days after admission, Ms. S spiked a fever and her surgical site was observed to have increased drainage, was reddened , swollen and extremely painful. The facility sent Ms. S to the emergency room and completed her OBRA D ischarge assessment as return anticipated . The hospital called the facility to inform t hem Ms. S was admitted . A week into her hospitalization, Ms. S developed a blood clot in her affected leg, further complicating her recovery. The facility was contacted to readmit Ms. S for rehabilitative services following discharge from the hospital on 10/10/2014. Even though Ms. S was a former patient in the facility's rehabilitation unit and was discharged CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -30 A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) (cont.) return anticipated, she did not return within 30 days of discharge to the hospital. Therefore, Ms. S is considered a new admission to the facility. On her return, when the facility completed Ms. S's Admission assessment, they entered 10/10/2014 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 1, Admission; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800, Entered From; and entered 10/10/2014 in item A1900, Admission Date. Coding Tips and Special Populations Both s wing bed facilities and nursing homes must apply the above instructions for coding items A1600 through A1900 to determin e whether a patient or resident is an admission/entry or reentry. In determining if a patient or resident returns to the facility within 30 days, the day of discharge from the facility is not counted in the 30 days. For example, a resident discharged return anticipated on December 1 would need to return to the facility by December 31 to meet the \"within 30 days \" requirement. If the Type of Entry for this assessment is an Admission (A1700 = 1), the Admission Date (A1900) and the Entry Date (A1600) must be the same. If the Type of Entry for this assessment is a Reentry (A1700 = 2), the Admission Date (A1900) will remain the same, and the Entry Date (A1600) must be later than the date in A1900. Item A1 900 (Admission Date) is tied to items A1600 (Entry Date), A1700 (Type of Entry) , and A1800 (Entered From). It is also tied to the concepts of a \"stay\" and an \"episode.\" A stay is a set of contiguous days in the facility and an episode is a series of one or more stays that may be separated by brief interruptions in the resident's time in the facility. An episode continues across stays until one of three events occurs: the resident is discharged with return not anticipated, the resident is discharged with ret urn anticipated but is out of the facility for more than 30 days, or the resident dies in the facility. A1900 (Admission Date) should remain the same on all assessments for a given episode even if it is interrupted by temporary discharges from the facility . If the resident is discharged and reenters within the course of an episode, that will start a new stay. The date in item A1600 (E ntry Date) will change, but the date in item A1900 (Admission Date) will remain the same. If the resident returns after a dis charge return not anticipated or after a gap of more than 30 days outside of the facility, a new episode would begin and a new admission would be required. When a resident is first admitted to a facility, item A1600 (Entry Date) should be coded with the date the person first entered the facility, and A1700 (Type of Entry) should be coded as 1, Admission. The place where the resident was admitted from should be documented in A1800 (Entered From), and the date in item A1900 (Admission Date) should match the date in A1600 (Entry Date). These items would be coded the same way for all subsequent assessments within the first stay of an episode. If the resident is briefly discharged (e.g., brief hospitalization) and then reenters the facility, a new (second) stay CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -31 A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) (cont.) would start, but the current episode would continue. On the Entry Tracking Record and on subsequent assessments for the second stay, the date in A1600 (Entry Date) would chang e depending on the date of reentry, and item A1700 (Type of Entry) would be coded as 2, Reentry. Item A1800 (Entered From) would reflect where the resident was prior to this reentry, and item A1900 (Admission Date) would continue to show the original admis sion date (the date that began his or her first stay in the episode). A2000: OBRA Discharge Date Item Rationale Closes the episode in the QIES ASAP system. Coding Instructions Enter the date the resident was discharged (whether or not return is anticipated). This is the date the resident leaves the facility. For OBRA Discharge assessments, the Discharge D ate (A2000) and ARD (A2300) must be the same date. Do not include leave of absence or hospital observational stay s less than 24 hours unless admitted to the hospital. Obtain data from the medical, admissions or transfer records. Coding Tips and Special Populations A Part A P PS Discharge assessment (NPE Item Set) is required under the SNF QRP when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident does not leave the facility. If a resident receiving services under SNF Part A PPS has a Discharge Date (A2000) that occurs on the day of or one day after the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C), then both an OBRA Discharge assessment and a Part A PPS Discharge assessment are required; but these two assessments may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -32 A2100: OBRA Discharge Status Item Rationale Demographic and outcome information. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record including the discharge plan and discharge orders for documentation of discharge location. Coding Instructions Select the 2 -digit code that corresponds to the resident's discharge status.

Includes community- based (e.g., home) or inpatient hospice programs. Code 08, deceased: if resident is deceased. Code 09, long term care hospital (LTCH): if discharge location is an ins titution that is certified under Medicare as a short -term, acute -care hospital which has been excluded from the Inpatient Acute Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (IPPS) under \u00a71886(d)(1)(B)(iv) of the Social Security Act. For the purpose of Medicare payment, LTCHs are defined as having an average inpatient length of stay (as determ ined by the Secretary) of greater than 25 days. Code 99, other: if discharge location is none of the above. A2200: Previous Assessment Reference Date for Significant Correction Item Rationale To identify the ARD of a previous comprehensive (A0310 = 01, 03, or 04) or Quarterly assessment (A03 10A = 02) in which a significant error is discovered. Coding Instructions Complete only if A0310A = 05 (Significant Correction to P rior Comprehensive Assessment) or A0310A = 06 (Significant Correction to P rior Q uarterly A ssessment). Enter the ARD of the prior comprehensive or Q uarterly assessment in which a significant error has been identified and a correction is required. A2300: Assessment Reference Date CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -34 A2300: Assessment Reference Date (cont.) Item Rationale Designates the end of the look- back period so that all assessment items refer to the resident's status during the same period of time. As the last day of the look- back period, the ARD serves as the reference point for determining the care and services captured on the MDS assessment . Anything that happens after the ARD will not be captured on that MDS . For example, for a MDS item with a 7 -day look-back period, assessment information is collected for a 7 -day period ending on and including the ARD which is the 7th day of this look-back period. For an item with a 14 -day look- back period, the infor mation is collected for a 14 -day period ending on and including the ARD. The look-back period includes observations and events through the end of the day (midnight) of the ARD. Steps for Assessment 1. Interdisciplinary team members should select the ARD based on the reason for the assessment and compliance with all timing and scheduling requirements outlined in Chapter 2. Coding Instructions Enter the appropriate date on the lines provided. Do not leave any spaces blank. If the month or day contains only a single dig it, enter a \"0\" in the first space. Use four digits for the year. For example, October 2 , 2010, should be entered as: 10-02-2010. For detailed information on the timing of the assessments, see Chapter 2 on a ssessment s chedules . For discharge assessments, t he discharge date item (A2000) and the ARD item (A2300) must contain the same date. Coding Tips and Special Populations When the resident dies or is discharged prior to the end of the look-back period for a required assessment, the ARD must be adjusted to equal the discharge date. The look-back period may not be extended simply because a resident was out of the nursing home during part of the look-back period (e.g., a home visit, therapeutic leave, or hospital observation stay less than 24 hours when reside nt is not admitted ). For example, if the ARD is set at day 1 3 and there is a 2 -day temporary leave during the look- back period, the 2 leave days are still considered part of the look-back period. When collecting assessment information, data from the time period of the leave of absence is captured as long as the particular MDS item permits . For example, if the family takes the resident to the physician during the leave, the visit would be counted in Item O 0600, Physician Examination (if criteria are otherwi se met) . DEFINITION ASSESSMENT REFERENCE DATE (ARD) The specific end -point for the look-back periods in the MDS assessment process. Almost all MDS items refer to the resident's status over a designated time period referring back in time from the Assessment Reference Date (ARD). Most frequently, this look -back period, also called the observation or assessment period, is a 7- day period ending on the ARD. Look -back periods may cover the 7 days ending on this date, 14 days ending on this date, etc. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -35 A2300: Assessment Reference Date (cont.) This requirement applies to all assessments, regardless of whether they are being completed for clinical or payment purposes. A2400: Medicare Stay It em Rationale Identifies when a resident is receiving services under the scheduled PPS. Identifies when a resident 's Medicare Part A stay begins and ends. The end date is used to determine if the resident 's stay qualifies for the short stay assessment. Coding Instructions for A2400A , Has the Resident Had a Medicare -covered Stay since the Most Recent Entry? Code 0, no: if the resident has not had a Medicare Part A covered stay since the most recent admissio n/entry or reentry. Skip to B0100, Comatose. Code 1, yes: if the resident has had a Medicare Part A covered stay since the most recent admission/ entry or reentry. Continue to A2400B.

Coding Instructions for A2400C, End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay Code the date of last day of this Medicare stay if A2400A is coded 1, yes . DEFINITIONS MOST RECENT MEDICARE STAY This is a Medicare Part A covered stay that has started on or after the most recent admission/entry or reentry to the nursing facility. MEDICARE -COVERED STAY Skilled Nursing Facility stays billable to Medicare Part A. Does not include stays billable to Medicare Advantage HMO plans. CURRENT MEDICARE STAY NEW ADMISSION: Day 1 of Medicare Part A stay. READMISSION: Day 1 of Medicare Part A coverage after readmission following a discharge. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2019 Page A -36 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) If the Medicare Part A stay is ongoing , there will be no end date to report . Enter dashes to indicate that the stay is ongoing. The end of Medicare date is coded as follows, whichever occurs first: \u2014 Date SNF benefit exhausts (i.e., the 100th day of the benefit ); or \u2014 Date of last day covered as recorded on the effective date from the Notice of Medicare Non -Coverage (NOMNC) ; or \u2014 The last paid day of Medicare A when payer source changes to another payer (regardless if the resident was moved to another bed or not); or \u2014 Date the resident was discharged from the facility (see Item A2000, Discharge D ate). Coding Tips and Special Populations When a resident on Medicare Part A returns following a therapeutic leave of absence or a hospital observation stay of less than 24 hours (without hospital admission) , this is a continuation of the Medicare Part A stay, not a new Medicare Part A stay. When a resident on Medicare Part A has an interrupted stay (i.e., is discharged from SNF care and subsequently readmitted to the same SNF within the interruption window after the discharge), this is a continuation of the Medicare Part A stay, not a new Medicare Part A stay. The E nd D ate of the Most Recent Medicare S tay (A2400C) may be earlier than the actual Discharge D ate (A2000) from the facility . If this occurs, the Part A PPS Discharge assessment is required. If the resident subsequently physically leaves the facility, the OBRA Discharge assessment would be required. If the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the day of or one day before the Discharge Date (A2000), the OBRA Discharge assessment and Part A PPS Discharge assessment are both required and may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000) . If the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the same day that the resident dies, a Death in Facility Tracking Record is completed, with the Discharge Date (A2000) equal to the date the resident died. In this case, a Part A PPS Discharge assessment is not required. For a standalone Part A PPS Discharge ass essment, the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) must be equal to the A RD (Item A2300). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -37 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) Examples 1. Mrs. G. began receiving services under Medicare Part A on October 14, 2016. Due to her stable condition and ability to manage her medications and dressing changes, the facility determined that she no longer qualified for Part A SNF coverage and began planning her discharge. An Advanced Beneficiary Notice (ABN) and an NOMNC with the last day of coverage as November 23, 2016 w ere issued. Mrs. G. was discharged home from the facility on November 24, 2016. Code the following on her combined OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessment : A0310F = 10 A0310G = 1 A0310H = 1 11-24-2016 11-23-2016 Rationale: Because Mrs. G's last day covered under Medicare was one day before her physical disc harge from the facility, a combined OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge was completed. 2. Mr. N began receiving services under Medicare Part A on December 11, 2019. He was unexpectedly sent to the emergency department on December 19, 2019 at 8:30 p.m . and was not admitted to the hospital. He returned to t he facility on December 20, 2019, at 11:00 a .m. Upon Mr. N's return, his physician's orders included significant changes in his treatment regime. The facility staff determined that an Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) was indicated as the PDPM nursing component was impacted. They completed the IPA with an ARD of December 24, 2019. Code the following on the IPA: A2400A = 1 A2400B = 12-11- 2019 A2400C = ---------- Rationale: Mr. N was out of the facility at midnight but returned in less than 24 hours and was not admitted to the hospital, so was considered LOA. Therefore, no Discharge assessment was required. His Medicare Part A Stay is considered ongoing; therefore, the date in A2400C is dashed. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -38 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) 3. Mr. R. began receiving services under Medicare Part A on October 15, 2016. Due to complications from his recent surgery, he was unexpectedly discharged to the hospital for emergency surgery on October 20, 2016, but is expected to return within 30 days. Code the following on his OBRA Discharge assessment: A0310F = 11 A0310G = = 10-20-2016 Rationale: Mr. R's physical discharge to the hospital was unplanned, yet it is anticipated that he will return to the facility within 30 days. Therefore, only an OBRA Discharge was required. Even though only an OBRA Discharge was required, when the Date of the End of the Medicare Stay is on the day of or one day before the Date of Discharge, MDS specifications require that A0310H be coded as 1. 4. Mrs. K began receiving services under Medicare Part A on October 4, 2016 . She was discharged from Medicare Part A services on December 17, 2016. She and her family had already decided that Mrs. K would remain in the facility for long -term care services, and she was moved into a private room (which was dually certified) on December 18, 2016. Code the following on her Part A PPS Discharge assessment: A0310F = 99 A0310G = ^ A0310H = 1 = ^ A2100 = ^ 10-04-2016 A2400C = 12-17-2016 Rationale: Because Mrs. K's Medicare Part A stay ended, and she remained in the facility for long -term care services, a standalone Part A PPS Di scharge was required. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -39 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) 5. Mr. W began receiving services under Medicare Part A on November 15, 2016. His Medicare Part A stay ended on November 25, 2016, and he was unexpectedly discharged to the hospital on November 26, 2016. Ho wever, he is expected to return to the facility within 30 days. Code the following on his OBRA Discharge assessment: A0310F = 11 A0310G = = 11-25-2016 Rationale: Mr. W's Medicare stay ended the day before discharge and he is expected to return to the facility within 30 days. Because his discharge to the hospital was unplanned, only an OBRA Discharge assessment was required. Even though only an OBRA Discharge was required, when the Date of the End of the Medicare Stay is on the day of or one day before the Date of Discharge, MDS specifications require that A0310H be coded as 1 .

(cont.) Code 1, y es: if the interview should be conducted because the resident is at least sometimes understood verbally, in writing , or using another method, and if an interpreter is needed, one is ava ilable . Proceed to C 0200, Repetition of Three Words. Coding Tips Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL residents. This interview is conducted during the look-back period of the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) and is not contingent upon item B0700, Makes Self Understood. If the resident needs an interpreter, every effort should be made to have an interprete r present for the BIMS. If it is not possible for a needed interpreter to participate on the day of the interview, code C 0100 = 0 to indicate interview not attempted and complete C0700-C1000, Staff Assessment of Mental Status , instead of C0200-C0500, Brief Interview for Mental Status . Includes residents who use American Sign Language (ASL). If the resident interview was not conducted within the look-back period (preferably the day before or the day of) the ARD, item C0100 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code (a dash \"- \") entered in the resident interview items. Do not complete the Staff Assessment for Mental Status items (C0700 -C1000) if the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done. Because a PDPM cognitive level is utilized in the speech language pathology (SLP) payment component of PDPM, only in the case of PPS assessments, staff may complete the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for an interviewable resident when the resident is unexpectedly discharged from a Part A stay prior to the completion of the BIMS. In this case, the assessor should enter 0, No in C0100: Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? and proceed to the Staff Assessment for Mental Status . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items October 2019 Page C-16 C0500: BIMS Summary Score (cont.) Abrupt changes in cognitive status (as indicative of a delirium) often signal an underlying potentially life threatening illness and a change in cognition may be the only indication of an underlying problem. Care plans can be more individualized based upon reliable knowledge of resident function. Steps for Assessment After completing C0200-C0400: 1. Add up the values for all questions from C0200 through C0400. 2. Do not add up the score while you are interviewing the resident. Instead, focus your f ull attention on the interview. Coding Instructions Enter the total score as a two-digit number. The total possible BIMS score ranges from 00 to 15. If the resident chooses not to answer a specific question(s), that question is coded as incorrect and the item(s) counts in the total score. If, however, the resident chooses not to answer four or more items, then the interview is coded as incomplete and a staff assessment is comple ted. To be considered a completed interview, the resident had to attempt and provide relevant answers to at least four of the questions included in C0200-C0400. To be relevant, a response only has to be r elated to the question (logical); it does not have t o be correct . See general coding tips below for residents who choose not to participate at all. Code 99, unable to complete interview: if (a) the resident chooses not to participate in the BIMS, (b) if four or more items were coded 0 because the resident chose not to answer or gave a nonsensical response, or (c) if any of the BIMS items is coded with a dash. \u2014 Note: a zero score does not mean the BIMS was incomplete. To be incomplete, a resident had to choose not to answer or give completely unrelated, nonsensical responses to four or more items. Coding Tips Occasionally, a resident can communicate but chooses not to participate in the BIMS and therefore does not attempt any of the items in the section . This would be considered an incomplete interview ; enter 99 for C0500, BIMS Summary Score, and complete the staff assessment of mental status. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-1 SECTION D: MOOD Intent: The ite ms in this section address m ood distress, a serious condition that is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the nursing hom e and is associated with significant morbidity. It is particularly important to identify signs and sympto ms of mood distress among nursing home resi dents because these signs and sympto ms can be treata ble. It is important to note that coding the presence of indicators in Section D does not auto matically mean that the resident has a diagnosis of depr ession or other mood disorder. Assessors do not make or assign a diagnosis in Section D; they s imply record the presence or absence of specific clinical mood indicators. Facility staff should re cogniz e thes e indicator s and consider them when developing the resident's individu alized care plan. Depression can be associated with: \u2014 psychological and physical distress (e.g., poor adjustment to the nursing home, loss of independence, chronic illness, inc reased sensiti vity to pain ), \u2014 decreased participation in therapy and activities (e.g., caused by isolation), \u2014 decreased functional status (e.g., resistance to daily care, decreased desire to particip ate in acti vities of daily livin g [ADLs]), and \u2014 poorer outcom es (e.g., decreased appet ite, decreased cognitive status). Findings suggesting mood distress should lead to: \u2014 identifying causes and contributing factors for symptom s, \u2014 identifying interventions (treatm ent, personal support, or environm ental modifications) that cou ld addres s symptom s, and \u2014 ensuring residen t safety. D0100: Should Resident Mood Interview Be Conducted? Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Most residents who are capable of com municating can answer questions about how they feel. O btaining info rmation about mood directly from the resident, som etimes called \"hearing the re siden t's voice,\" is more reliable and accu rate than o bservation alone for identifying a mood disorder.

If a resident cannot co mmunicate, then Staff M ood Interview (D0500 A-J) should be conducted. Steps for Assessment 1. Interact with the resident using his or her preferred language. Be sure he or she can hear you and/or has access to his or her preferred method for communication. If the resident appears unable to communicate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing, sign language, or cue cards. 2. Determine whether the resident is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing, or using another method. If rarely/never understood, skip to D0500, Staff Assessment of Resident Mood (PHQ-9- OV\u00a9). 3. Review Language item (A1100) to determine if the resident needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with doctors or health care staff (A1100 = 1). If the resident needs or wants an interpreter, complete the interview with an interpreter. Coding In structions Code 0, no: if the interview should not be conducted because the resident is rarely/never understood or cannot respond verbally, in writing, or using another method, or an interpreter is needed but not available.

DEFINITION 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ -9\u00a9) A validated interview that screens for symptoms of depression. It provides a standardized severity score and a rating for evidence of a depressive disorder. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-4 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) Mood disorders are common in nursing homes and are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Planni ng for Care Findings suggesting mood di stress could lead to: \u2014 identifying causes and contributing factors for symptoms and \u2014 identifying interventions (treatment, personal support, or environmental modifications) that could address symptoms. Steps for Assessment Look-back period for this item is 14 days. 1. Conduct the interview preferably the day before or day of the ARD. 2. Interview any resident when D0100 = 1. 3. Conduct the interview in a private setting. 4. If an interpreter is used during resident interviews, the interpreter should not attempt to deter mine the intent behind what is being tra nslated , the outco me of the int erview, or the meaning or significance of the resident's respons es. Interpreters are p eople who translate oral or writte n languag e from one language to another. 5. Sit so that th e resi dent can see your face. Mi nimize glare by directing light sources away from the re sident's face. 6. Be sure the resident can hear you. Residents w ith a hearing i mpairment should be tested using their usual communication devices/techniques, as applicab le. Try an external assistive device (headphones or hearing amplifier) if you have any doubt about hearin g ability. Minimize background noise. 7. If you are ad ministering the PHQ -9\u00a9 in paper form, be sure that the resident can see the print. Provide larg e print or assistive de vice (e.g., page magnifier) if necessary. 8. Explain the reason for the in terview before beginning. Suggested language : \"I am going to ask you some questions about your mood and feelings over the past 2 weeks. I will also ask about so me common problems that are known to go along with feeling down. Som e of the qu estions m ight seem personal, but everyone is asked to answer t hem. This will help us provide you with better care.\" 9. E xplain and /or show the interview response choices. A cue card with the response choices clearly written in la rge print m ight h elp the resident comprehend the response choices. Suggested language : \"I am going to ask you how often you have been bothered by a particular problem over the last 2 weeks. I will give you the choices that you see on this card.\" (Say while pointing to cue car d): \"0-1 days \u2014never or 1 day, 2-6 days\u2014several days, 7-11 days\u2014half or more of the days, or 12-14 days \u2014nearl y ever y day.\" 10. Inter view t he resi dent. Suggested language: \"Over the last 2 weeks, have you been bothered by any of the following problems?\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-5 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) Then, for each question in Resident Mood Interview (D0200): Read the it em as it is w ritten. Do not provide definitio ns because the m eaning must be based on the resident's interpretation. For example, the resident defines for him self what \"tired\" means; the item should be scored based on the resident's i nterpretation. Each questio n must be asked in sequence to assess presence (colu mn 1) and frequency (colu mn 2) before proceeding to the next question. Enter code 9 for any response that is unrelated, inco mprehensible, or incoherent or if the resident's response is not informative with respect to the item being rated; this is considered a nonsensica l response (e.g., when asked the question about \"poor appetite or overeating,\" the resident answer s, \"I always win at poker.\"). For a yes response, as k the residen t to tel l you how ofte n he or sh e was bothered by the symptom over the last 14 days. Use the response choice s in D0200 Colum n 2, Symptom Frequenc y. Start by asking the resident the num ber of days that he or she was bothered by the symptom and read and show cue card w ith frequency categories /descri ptions (0 -1 days\u2014never or 1 day, 2-6 days\u2014several days, 7 -11 days\u2014half or more of the days, or 12-14 days \u2014nearl y ever y day). Coding Instructions for Column 1. Symptom Presence Code 0, no: if resident indicat es symptom s listed are not p resent enter 0. Enter 0 in Column 2 as well. Code 1, y es: if resident indicates sympto ms listed are present enter 1. Enter 0, 1, 2, or 3 in Column 2, Symptom Frequency. Code 9, no response: if the resident was unable or chose not to complete the assessm ent, responded nonsensically and/or the facility was unable to complete the assessm ent. Leave Column 2, Symptom Frequency, blank. Coding Instructions for Column 2. Symptom Frequency Record the resident's responses as they are stated, regardless of whether the resident or the assessor attributes the symptom to something other than mood. Further evaluation of the clinical relevance of reported symptoms should be explored by the responsibl e clinician. Code 0, n ever or 1 day: if the resident indic ates that he or she has never or has only experienced the sy mptom on 1 day. Code 1, 2-6 days (several days): if the resident indicat es that he or she has experienced the sy mptom for 2-6 days. Code 2, 7-11 days (half or mo re of the days): if the resident indicates that he or she has experienced the sy mptom for 7 -11 days. Code 3, 12-14 d ays (nearly every day): if the resident indicat es that he or she has experienced the sy mptom for 12-14 days. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-6 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) Coding Tips and Special Populations For question D0200I, Thoughts Tha t You Woul d Be B etter Off Dead or of Hurting Yourself in Some Way: \u2014 Beginning inter viewers may feel uncomfor table asking th is item because they m ay fear upsetting the resident or m ay feel that the question is too personal. Others may worry that it will giv e the resi dent inappropriate ideas. However, Experienced interviewer s hav e found that most residents who are having this feeling appreciate the opportunity to expres s it. Asking about thoughts of self- harm does not give the person the idea. It does let the provider better understand what the resident is already feeling. The best interviewing approach is to ask the question openly and without hesitation. If the resident uses his or her own words to describ e a sy mptom , this should be briefly explored. If you deter mine that the resident is reporting the intended sy mptom but using his or her own words, ask him to tell you how often he or she was bothered by that symptom. Select only one frequ ency response per item. If the resident has difficulty selecting b etween tw o freq uenc y responses , code fo r the higher frequency. Some items (e.g., item F) contain more than one phrase. If a res ident gives different frequencies for the different parts of a singl e item, select the highest frequency as the score for t hat item. R esidents may respond to questions: \u2014 verbally, \u2014 by pointing to their answers on the cue card, OR \u2014 by writing o ut their answers. Interviewing Tips and Techniques Repeat a question if you think that it has been misund erstood or m isinterpreted. Some residents may be eager to talk with you a nd will stray f rom the topic at hand. When a person strays, you should gently guide the conversation back to the topic. \u2014 Example: S ay, \"That's interesting, now I need to know...\"; \"Let's get back to...\"; \"I understand, can you tell me about....\" Validate your understanding of what the residen t is sayin g by ask ing fo r clarification. \u2014 Example: Say, \"I thin k I hear you sayin g that ...\"; \"Let's see if I understood you correctly.\"; \"You said.... Is that right ?\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-7 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ -9\u00a9) (cont.) If the resident has difficulty selecting a frequency respon se, star t by offerin g a single frequency response and follow with a sequence of more speci fic questions. This is known as unfolding. \u2014 Example: S ay, \" Would you say [na me symptom] bothered you more than half the days in the past 2 weeks?\" If the resident says \"yes,\" show the cue card and ask whether it bothered him or her nearly every day (12-14 days) or on half or m ore of the days (7 -11 days). If the resident says \"no,\" show t he cue card and ask whether it bothered him or her several days (2 -6 days) or never or 1 day (0- 1 mittal respo be expl ored. Residents m ay be reluctant to report sy mptoms and should be gently encouraged to tell you if the symptom bothered him or her, even if it was only some of the ti me. This is known as probing. Probe by asking neutral or nondi rectiv e questions such as: \u2014 \"What do you m ean?\" \u2014 \"Tell me what you have in mind.\" \u2014 \"Tell m e more about that.\" \u2014 \"Please b e more specific.\" \u2014 \"Give m e an exam ple.\" Sometimes respondents give a long answer to interview items. To narrow the answer to the response choices available, it can be usefu l to summari ze their longer answer and then ask them which response option best applies . This is know n as echoing. \u2014 Example: Item D0200E, Poor App etite or Overeating . The resident responds \"the food is always cold and it just doesn't taste like it does at hom e. The doctor won't let me have any salt.\" Possible interviewer response: \"You're telling m e the food isn't what you eat at home and you can't add salt. Ho w often woul d you say that you were bothered by poor appetite or ove r-eating during the last 2 weeks?\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200A, Little Interest or Pleasure in Doing Thing s. The resident, when asked how often he or she has been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things, responds, \"There's nothing to do here, all you do is eat, bathe, and sleep. They don't do anything I like to do.\" Possible interview resp onse: \"You' re saying there isn't m uch to do here and I want to co me back later to talk about some things you like to do. Thinking about how you've been feel ing over the past 2 weeks , how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasur e in doing things.\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200B, Feeling Down, Depressed, or Ho peless . The resident , when asked how often he or she has been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, responds: \"How would you feel if you were here?\" Possible interview resp onse: \"You asked how I would feel, but it is important that I understand your feelings right now. How often would you say that you have been bothered by feeling down, depress ed, or hopeless during the last 2 weeks ?\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-8 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) If the resident has difficulty with longer ite ms, separate the item into shorter parts, and provide a chance to respond af ter each part. This method, known as disentangling, is helpful if a residen t has moderate cognitive im pairment but can respond to simple, direct questions. \u2014 Example: Item D0200E, Poo r App etite or Overeating . You can simplify this item by asking: \"In the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite?\" (pause for a response) \"Or overeating ?\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200C, Trouble Falling or Sta ying Aslee p, or Sleeping Too Much. You can break the item down as follows: \"How often are you having problems falling asleep?\" (pause for response) \"Ho w often are you having problem s staying asleep?\" (pause for response) \"How often do you feel you are sleeping too much?\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200H, Moving or Speaking S o Slowly That Other People Could Have Noticed. Or the Opposite\u2014Be ing So Fidg ety or Restles s Tha t You Hav e Bee n Movin g Aroun d a Lo t Mor e tha n Usua l. You can simplify this item by asking: \"How ofte n are you having problem s with moving or speaking so slowly that other people coul d have noticed ?\" (pause for response) \"How often have you felt so fidgety or restless that you move around a lot more than usual?\" D0300: Total Severity Score Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The score does not diagnose a mood disorder or depression but provides a standard score which can be communicated to the resident's physician, other clinicians and m ental hea lth sp ecialists for appropriate follow up. The Total Severity Sco re is a su mmary of the frequency scores on the PHQ-9 \u00a9 that indica tes the extent of potential depression sympto ms and can be useful for knowing when to reques t additio nal assessment by providers or me ntal health specialists. DEFINITION TOTAL SEVERITY SCORE A summary of the frequency scores that indicates the extent of potential depression symptoms. The score does not diagnose a mood disorder, but provides a standard of communication with clinicians and mental health specialists. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page for Care The PHQ-9\u00a9 Total Seve rity Score also provides a way for health care providers and clinician s to easily identif y and track sy mptom s and how t hey are changin g over time. Steps for Assessment After completing D0200 A- I: 1. Add the num eric scores across all frequency item s in Resident Mood Interview (D0200) Column 2. 2. Do not add up the score while you are inter viewing the resident. Instead, focus your full attention on the in terview. 3. The maximum residen t score is 27 (3 x 9). Coding Instructions The interview is succes sfully co mpleted if the resident an swered the freq uency respo nses of at least 7 of the 9 ite ms on the PHQ-9\u00a9. If symptom frequency is blank for 3 or more it ems, the inte rview is de emed NOT complete. Total Severity Score should be code d as \"99 \" and the Staff Assessment o f Mood should be conducted. Enter t he total sco re as a two -digit number. The Total Severity Score will be between 00 and 27 (or \" 99\" if sy mpto m frequency is blank for 3 or more ite ms).

Coding Tips and Special Populations Responses to PHQ-9\u00a9 can indicate possible depression. Response s can be interpreted as follows: \u2014 Major Depressive Syndro me is suggested if\u2014of the 9 items\u20145 or more items are identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look- back period and at least one of these, (1) little interes t or pleasu re in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless is identified at a fre quency of half or more of the days (7 -11 days) during the look- back period. \u2014 M inor Depressive Syndrom e is suggested if, of the 9 ite ms, (1) feeling down, depressed or hopeless, (2) trou ble falling or staying asle ep, or sleepin g too much , or (3) feeling tired or having little energy are id entified at a frequency of half or m ore of the days (7-11 days) during the look- back period and at least one of these, (1) little interest or pleasure in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depre ssed, or hopeless is identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7 -11 days). \u2014 In addition, PHQ-9\u00a9 Total Severity Score can be used to track changes in severity over tim e. Total Severity Score can be inte rpreted as follows: 1-4: minim al depression 5-9: m depression 10-14: moderate depression 15-19: moderately severe depression 20-27: severe depression CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-10 D0500: Staff Assessment of Resident Mood (PHQ-9-OV\u00a9) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life PHQ-9\u00a9 Resident Mo od Interview is preferred as it improves the detection of a possible mood disorder. However, a sm all percentage of p atien ts are unable or un willing to complete the PHQ -9\u00a9 Resident Mo od Interview . Therefore, staff should complete the PHQ-9\u00a9 Observational Version ( PHQ-9-OV\u00a9) Staff Assessment of Mood in thes e instance s so that an y behaviors, signs, or sy mptoms of mood di stress are identified . Persons unable to complete the PHQ -9\u00a9 Resident Mood Interview may still have a mood disorder. Even if a resident was unable to complete the Resident Mo od Interview , important insights m ay be gained from the responses that wer e obtained during th e interview , as well as observations of the resident's behaviors and affect during the interview. The identification of symptom presence and frequency as well as staf f observations are important in the detection of mood distress, as they m ay info rm need for and type of treatment. It is important to note that coding the presence of indi cators in Section D does not automatically mean that the resident has a diagnosis of depr essio n or othe r mood disorder. Assessors do not m ake or assign a d iagnosis in Section D; they si mply record the presence or abs ence of specific clin ical mood indicators. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-11 D0500: Staff Assessment of Resident Mood (PHQ -9-OV\u00a9) (cont.) Alternate means of assessing mood must be used for residents who cannot communi cate or refuse or are unable to particip ate in the PHQ-9\u00a9 Resident Mood Interview . This ensures that inform ation about their mood is not overlooked. Planni ng for Care When the resident is not able to complete the PHQ -9\u00a9, scripted interviews with staff who know the resident well should provide cri tical infor mation for understanding mood and making care planning decisions. Steps for Assessment Look-back period for this item is 14 days. 1. Interview staff from all shifts who know the resident best. Conduct interview in a location that protects resident privacy. 2. The same administration techniq ues outlin ed abo ve fo r the PHQ -9\u00a9 Resident Mood Interview (pages D -4-D-6) and Interviewing Tips & Techniques (pages D-6-D-8) should also be follo wed when staff are interviewed. 3. Encourage staff to report symptom frequency, even i f the staff believes the symptom to be unrelated to depression. 4. Explore unclear responses, focusing the discussion on the sp ecific sy mptom listed on the assessm ent rather than expanding into a lengthy clinical evaluation. 5. If frequency cannot be coded because the residen t has been in the facility for less than 14 days, talk to family or significant other and review trans fer reco rds to inform the selection of a frequency code. Examples of Staff Responses That Indicate Need for Follow -up Questioning with the Staff Member 1. D0500A, Little Interest or Pleasure in Doing Things The resident doesn 't really do m uch here. The resident spends most of the time in his or her room. 2. D0500B, Feeling or Appearing Down, Depressed, or Hopeless She's 95\u2014what can you expect? How would you feel if you were here? 3.

It includes items focused on prior function, admission performance, discharge goals, and discharge performance. Functional status is assessed based on the need for assistance when performing self -care and mobility activities. GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities Item Rationale Knowledge of the resident's functioning prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury may inform treatment goals. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident or his or her family about, or review the resident's medical records describing, the resident's prior functioning with everyday activities. Coding Instructions Code 3, Independent: if the resident completed the activities by himself or herself, with or without an assistive device, with no assistance from a helper. Code 2, Needed Some Help: if the resident needed partial assistance from another person to complete the activities. Code 1, Dependent: if the helper completed the activities for the resident, or the assistance of two or more helpers was required for the resident to complete the activities. Code 8, Unknown: if the resident's usual ability prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury is unknown. Code 9, Not Applicable: if the activities were not applicable to the resident prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-2 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) Coding Tips Record the resident's usual ability to perform self-care, indoor mobility (ambulation), stairs, and functional cognition prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. If no information about the resident's ability is available after attempts to interview the resident or his or her family and after reviewing the resident's m edical record, code as 8 , Unknown. Examples for Coding Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities 1. Self-Care: Ms. R was admitted to an acute care facility after sustaining a right hip fracture and subsequently admitted to the SNF for rehabilitation. Prior to the hip fracture, Ms. R was independent in eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet. Ms. R used a raised toilet seat because of arthritis in both knee joints. Both she and her family indicated that there were no safety concerns when she performed these everyday activities in her home. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 3, Independent. Rationale: Prior to her hip fracture, the resident completed the self- care tasks of eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet safely without any assistance from a helper. The resident may use an assistive device, such as a raised toilet seat, and still be coded as independent. 2. Self-Care: Mr. T was admitted to an acute care facility after sustaining a stroke and subsequently admitted to the SNF for rehabilitation. Prior to the stroke, Mr. T was independent in eating and using the toilet; however, Mr. T required assistance for bathing and putting on and taking off his shoes and socks. The assistance needed was due to severe arthritic lumbar pain upon bending, which limited his ability to access his feet. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: Mr. T needed partial assistance from a helper to complete the activities of bathing and dressing. While Mr. T did not need help for all self- care activities, he did need some help. Code 2 is used to indicate that Mr. T needed some help for self- care. 3. Self-Care: Mr. R was diagnosed with a progressive neurologic condition five years ago. He lives in a long-term nursing facility and was recently hospitalized for surgery and has now been admitted to the SNF for skilled services. According to Mr. R's wife, prior to the surgery, Mr. R required complete assistance with self- care activities, including eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 1, Dependent. Rationale: Mr. R's wife has reported that Mr. R was completely depen dent in self -care activities that included eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet. Code 1, Dependent, is appropriate based upon this information. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-3 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) 4. Self-Care: Mr. F was admitted with a diagnos is of stroke and a severe communication disorder and is unable to communicate with staff using alternative communication devices. Mr. F had been living alone prior to admission. The staff has not been successful in contacting either Mr. F's family or his friends. Mr. F's prior self- care abilities are unknown. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 8, Unknown. Rationale: Attempts to seek information regarding Mr. F's prior functioning were made; however, no information was available. This item is coded 8, Unknown. 5. Indoor Mobility (Ambulation): Mr. C was admitted to an acute care hospital after experiencing a stroke. Prior to admission, he used a cane to walk from room to room. In the morning, Mr. C' s wife would provide steadying assistance to Mr. C when he walked from room to room because of joint stiffness and severe arthritis pain. Occasionally, Mr. C required steadying assistance during the day when walking from room to room. Coding: GG01 00B would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: The resident needed some assistance (steadying assistance) from his wife to complete the activity of walking in the home. 6. Indoor Mobility (Ambulation): Approximately three months ago, Mr. K had a cardiac event that resulted in anoxia, and subsequently a swallowing disorder. Mr. K has been living at home with his wife and developed aspiration pneumonia. After this most recent hospitalization, he was admitted to the SNF for a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and severe deconditioning. Prior to the most rece nt acute care hospitalization, Mr. K needed some assistance when walking. Coding: GG0100B would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: While the resident experienced a cardiac event three months ago, he recently had an exacerbation of a prior condition that required care in an acute care hospital and skilled nursing facility. The resident's prior functioning is based on the time immediate ly before his most recent condition exacerbation that required acute care. 7. Indoor Mobility (Ambulation): Mrs. L had a stroke one year ago that resulted in her using a wheelchair to self -mobilize, as she was unable to walk. Mrs. L subsequently had a second stroke and was transferred from an acute care unit to the SNF for skilled services. Coding: GG0100B would be coded 9, Not Applicable. Rationale: The resident did not ambulate immediately prior to the current illness, injury, or exacerbation (the second stroke). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-4 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) 8. Stairs : Prior to admission to the hospital for bilateral knee surgery, followed by his recent admission to the SNF for rehabilitation, Mr. V experienced severe knee pain upon ascending and par ticularly descending his internal and external stairs at home. Mr. V required assistance from his wife when using the stairs to steady him in the event his left knee would buckle. Mr. V's wife was interviewed about her husband's functioning prior to admiss ion, and the therapist noted Mr. V's prior functional level information in his medical record. Coding: GG0100C would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: Prior to admission, Mr. V required some help in order to manage internal and external stairs. 9. Stairs: Mrs. E lived alone prior to her hospitalization for sepsis and has early stage multiple sclerosis. She has now been admitted to a SNF for rehabilitation as a result of deconditioning. Mrs. E reports that she used a straight cane to ascend and descend her indoor stairs at home and small staircases within her community. Mrs. E reports that she did not require any human assistance with the activity of using stairs prior to her admission. Coding: GG0100C would be coded 3, Independent. Rationale: Mrs. E reported that prior to admission, she was independent in using her internal stairs and the use of small staircases in her community. 10. Stairs: Mr. P has expressive aphasia and difficulty communicating . SNF staff have not received any response to thei r phone messages to Mr. P's family members requesting a return call. Mr. P has not received any visitors since his admission. The medical record from his prior facility does not indicate Mr. P's prior functioning. There is no information to code item GG010 0C, but there have been attempts at seeking this information. Coding: GG0100C would be coded 8, Unknown. Rationale: Attempts were made to seek information regarding Mr. P's prior functioning; however, no information was available. 11. Functional Cognition: Mr. K has mild dementia and recently sustained a fall resulting in complex multiple fractures requiring multiple surgeries. Mr. K has been admitted to the SNF for rehabilitation. Mr. K's caregiver reports that when living at home, Mr. K needed reminders to ta ke his medications on time, manage his money, and plan tasks, especially when he was fatigued. Coding: GG0100D would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: Mr. K required some help to recall, perform, and plan regular daily activities as a result of cognitive impairment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-5 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) 12. Functional Cognition: Ms. L recently sustained a brain injury from a fall at home. Prior to her recent hospitalization, she had been living in an apartment by herself. Ms. L's cognition is currently impaired. Ms. L's cousin, who had visited her frequently prior to her recent hospitalization, indicated that Ms. L did not require any help with taking her prescribed medications, planning her daily activities, and managing money when shopping. Coding: GG0100D would be coded 3, Independent. Rationale: Ms. L's cousin, who frequently visited Ms. L prior to her sustaining a brain injury, reported that Ms. L was independent in taking her prescribed medications, planning her daily activities, and managing money when shopping, indicating her independence in using memory and problem-solving skills. 13. Functional Cognition: Mrs. R had a stroke , resulting in a severe communication disorder. Her family members have not returned phone calls requesting information about Mrs. R's prior functional status, and her medical records do not include information about her functional cognition prior to the stroke. Coding: GG0100D would be coded 8, Unknown. Rationale: Attempts to seek information regarding Mrs. R's prior functioning were made; however, no information was available. GG0110. Prior Device Use Item Rationale Knowledge of the resident's routine use of devices and aids immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury may inform treatment goals. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident or his or her family or review the resident's medical records to determine the resident's use of prior devices and aids. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-6 GG0110. Prior Device Use (cont.) Coding Instructions Check all devices that apply. Check Z, None of the above: if the resident did not use any of the listed devices or aids immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Coding Tips For GG0110D, Prior Device Use - Walker: \"Walker\" refers to all types of walkers (for example, pickup walkers, hemi-walkers, rolling walkers, and platform walkers). GG0110C, Mechanical lift, includes sit- to-stand, stand assist, stair lift, and full-body- style lifts. Example for Coding Prior Device Use 1. Mrs. M is a bilateral lower extremity amputee and has multiple diagnoses, including diabetes, obesity, and peripheral vascular disease. She is unable to walk and did not walk prior to the current episode of care, which started because of a pressure ulcer and respiratory infection. She uses a motorized wheelchair to mobilize. Coding: GG0110B would be checked. Rationale: Mrs. M used a motorized wheelchair prior to the current illness/injury. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-7 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission (Start of Medicare Part A Stay) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-8 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Interim Performance (Interim Payment Assessment - Optional) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-9 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Discharge (End of Medicare Part A Stay) Item Rationale During a Medicare Part A SNF stay, residents may have self -care limitations on admission. In addition, residents may be at risk of further functional decline during their stay in the SNF . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 10 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Assess the resident's self -care performance based on direct observation, incorporating resident self -report s and reports from qualified clinicians, care staff , or family documented in the resident's medical record during the three -day assessment period . CMS anticipates that an interdisciplinary team of qualified clinicians is involved in assessing the resident during the three- day assessment period. For Section GG, the admission assessment period is the first three days of the Part A s tay starting with the date in A2400B, the Start of Most Recent Medicare S tay. On admission, these items are completed only when A0310B = 01 (5- Day PPS assessment). For the Interim Payment Assessment (A0310B=08), the assessment period for Section GG is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and two days prior). 2. Resident s should be allowed to perform activities as independently as possible, as long as they are safe. 3. For the purposes of completing Section GG, a \" helper \" is defined as facility staff who are direct employees and facility -contracted employees (e.g. , rehabilitation staff, nursing agency staff). Thus, \"helper\" does not include individuals hired, compensated or not, by individuals outside of the facility' s management and administration such as hospice staff, nursing/ certified nu rsing assistant students, etc. Therefore, when helper assistance is required because a resident's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, consider only facility staff when scoring according to the amount of assistance provided. 4. Activities may be completed with or without assistive device(s ). Use of assistive device(s) to complete an activity should not affect coding of the activity. 5. The admission functional assessment, when possible, should be conducted prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to reflect the resident's true admission baseline functional status. If treatment has started, for example, on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatmen t should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. 6. Refer to facility, Federal , and State policies and procedures to determine which staff members may complete an assessment. Resident assessments are to be done in compliance with facility, Federal , and State requirements. DEFINITION USUAL PERFORMANCE A resident's functional status can be impacted by the environment or situations encountered at the facility. Observing the resident's interactions with others in different locations and circumstances is important for a comprehensive understanding of the resident's functional status. If the resident's functional status varies, record the resident's usual ability to perform each activity. Do not record the resident's best performance and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance. QUALIFIED CLINICIAN Healthcare professionals practicing within their scope of practice and consistent with Federal, State, and local law and regulations. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 11 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding I nstruct ions When coding the resident's usual performance and discharge goal(s), use the six-point scale, or use one of the four \"activity was not attempted\" codes to specify the reason why an activity was not attempted. Code 06, Independent : if the resident completes the activity by him/herself with no assist ance from a helper. Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance: if the helper sets up or cleans up ; resident completes activ ity. Helper assists only prior to or following the activity, but not during the activity. For example, the resident requires assistance cutting up food or opening container, or requires se tup of hygiene item(s) or assisti ve device(s). Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance: if the helper provides verbal cues or touching/ steadying /contact guard assistance as resident completes activity. Assistance may be provided throughout the activity or intermittently. For example, the resident requires verbal cueing, coaxing, or general supervision for safety to complete activity; or resident may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steadying assist during the activity. Code 03, Part ial/mode rate assistance: if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, holds, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. Code 02, Subs tantial/maxi mal assistance: if the helpe r does MORE THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. Code 01, Dependent : if the helper does ALL of the ef fort. Resident does none of the effort to complete the activity ; or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the resident to complete the activity. Code 07, Resident refused: if the resident refused to complete t he act ivity. Code 09, Not applicable: if the activity was not attempted and the resident did not perform this activ ity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations: if the resident did not attempt this activity due to environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment and weather constraints. Code 88, Not attempted due to med ical condi tion or safety concerns : if the activity was not atte mpted due to medical condition or safety concer ns.

Decision Tree Use this decision tree to code the resident's performance on the assessment instrument. If helper assistance is required because the resident's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, score according to the amount of assistance provided. Only use the \"activity not attempted codes\" if the activity did not occur; that is, the resident did not perform the activity and a helper did not perform that activity for the resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 13 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Assessment Period Admission: The 5 -Day PPS assessment (A0310B = 01) is the first Medicare-required assessment to be completed when the resident is admitted for a SNF Part A stay. o For the 5- Day PPS assessment, code the resident's functional status based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs soon after the resident's admission. This functional assessment must be completed within the first three days (3 calendar days) of the Medicare Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Mos t Recent Medicare Stay , and the following two days, ending at 11:59 PM on day 3. The admission function scores are to reflect the resident's admission baseline status and are to be based on an assessment. The scores should reflect the resident's status prior to any benefit from interventions. The assessment should occur, when possible, prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to determine the resident's true admission baseline status. Even if treatment started on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. Interim Performance (Optional): The Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) is an optional assessment that may be completed by providers in order to report a change in the resident 's PDPM classification. For Section GG on the IPA, providers will use the same 6-point scale and activity not attempted codes to complete the column \"Interim Performance,\" which will capture the interim functional performance of the resident. The ARD for the IPA is determined by the provider, and the assessment period is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and the 2 calendar days prior). It is important to note that the IPA changes payment beginning on the ARD and continues until the end of the Medicare Part A stay or until another IPA is completed. The IPA does not affect the variable per diem schedule. Discharge: The Part A PPS Discharge assessment is required to be completed when the resident's Medicare Part A Stay ends (as documented in A2400C, End of Most Recent Medicare Stay), either as a standalone assessment when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resi dent remains in the facility; or may be combined with an OBRA Discharge if the Medicare Part A stay ends on the day of, or one day before the resident's Discharge Date (A2000). Please see Chapter 2 and Section A of the RAI Manual for additional details reg arding the Part A PPS Discharge assessment. o For the Discharge assessment (i.e., standalone Part A PPS or combined OBRA/Part A PPS), code the resident's discharge functional status, based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs as close to the time of the r esident 's discharge from Medicare Part A as possible. This functional assessment must be completed within the last three calendar days of the resident 's Medicare Part A stay, which includes the day of discharge from Medicare Part A and the two days prior to the day of discharge from Medicare Part A . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 14 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Coding Tips: Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance General Coding Tips When reviewing the medical record, interviewing staff , and observing the resident , be familiar with the definition for each activity (e.g., eating , oral hygiene) . For example, when assessing Eating (item GG0130A) , determine the type and amount of assistance required to bring food and/or liquid to the mouth and swallow food and/or liquid once the meal is placed before the resident. Residents with cognitive impairments/limitations may need physical and/or verbal assistance when completing an activity. Code based on the resident's need for assistance to perform the activity safely (for example, choking risk due to rate of eating, amount of food placed into mouth, risk of falling). If the resident does not at tempt the activity and a helper does not complete the activity for the resident during the entire assessment period , code the reason the activity was not attempted. For example, code as 07 if the resident refused to attempt the activity ; code as 09 if the activity is not applicable for the resident (the activity did not occur at the time of the assessment and prior to the current illness, injury, or exacerbation); code as 10 if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to environmental limitatio ns; or code as 88 if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to medical condition or safety concerns. An activity can be completed independently with or without devices. If the resident uses adaptive equipment and uses the device independently when performing an activity, enter code 06, Independent. If two or more helpers are required to assist the resident to complete the activity, code as 01, Dependent. To clarify your own understanding of the resident's performance of an activity, ask probing questions to the care staff about the resident, beginning with the general and proceeding to the more specific. See examples of probing questions at the end of this section. A dash (\"- \") indicates \"No information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Documentation in the medical record is used to support assessment coding of Section GG. Data entered should be consistent with the clinical assessment documentation in the resident's medical record. This assessment can be conducted by appropriate healthcare personnel as defined by facility policy and in accordance with State and Federal regulations. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 15 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Tips for Coding the Resident's Usual Performance When coding the resident's usual performance, \"effort\" refers to the type and amount of assistance a helper provides in order for the activity to be completed. The six-point rating scale definitions include the following types of assistance: setup/cleanup, touching assistance, verbal cueing, and lifting assistance. Do not record the resident's best performance, and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance during the asses sment period. Code based on the resident's performance. Do not record the staff's assessment of the resident's potential capability to perform the activity. If the resident performs the activity more than once during the assessment period and the resident' s performance varies, coding in Section GG should be based on the resident's \"usual performance,\" which is identified as the resident's usual activity/performance for any of the Self -Care or Mobility activities, not the most independent or dependent performance over the assessment period. Therefore, if the resident's Self -Care performance varies during the assessment period, report the resident's usual performance, not the resident's most independent performance and not the resident's most dependent perform ance. A provider may need to use the entire three -day assessment period to obtain the resident's usual performance. Coding Tips for GG0130A, Eating GG0130A, Eating involves bringing food and liquids to the mouth and swallowing food. The administration of tube feedings and parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding this activity. The following is guidance for some situations in which a resident receives tube feedings or parenteral nutrition: o If the resident does not eat or drink by mouth and relies solely on nutrition and liquids through tube feedings or total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) because of a new (recent - onset) medical condition, code GG0130A as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Assistance with tube feedings or TPN is not considered when coding Eating. o If the resident does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of the assessment, and the resident did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illne ss, injury, or exacerbation, code GG0130A as 09, Not applicable - Not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Assistance with tube feedings or parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding Eating . o If the resident eats and drinks by mouth, and relies partially on obtaining nutrition and liquids via tube feedings or parenteral nutrition, code Eating based on the amount of assistance the resident requires to eat and drink by mouth. A ssistance with tube feedings or parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding Eating . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 16 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) If the resident eats finger foods using his or her hands, then code Eating based upon the amount of assistance provided. If the resident eats finger foods with his or her hands independently, for example, the resident would be coded as 06, Independent. Examples for Coding Admission , Interi m, or Discharge Performance Note: The following are coding examples for each S elf-Care item. Some examples describe a single observation of the person completing the activity; other examples describe a summary of several observations of the resident completing an activity across different times of the day and different days. Examples for GG0130A, Eating 1. Eating: Ms. S has m ultiple s clerosis , affecting her endurance and strength. Ms. S prefers to feed herself as much as she is capable. During all meals, a fter eating three -fourths of t he meal by herself , Ms. S usually becomes extremely fatigued and requests assistance from the certified nursing assistant to feed her the remainder of the meal. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The certified nursing assistant provides less than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of eating for all meals . 2. Eating: Mr. M has upper extremity weakness and fine motor impairments. The occupational therapist places an ad aptive device onto Mr. M's hand that supports the eating utensil within his hand. At the start of each meal Mr. M can bring food and liquids to his mouth. Mr. M then tires and the certified nursing assistant feeds him more than half of each meal. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provides more than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of eating at each meal . 3. Eating: Mr. A eats all meals without any physical assistance or supervision from a helper. He has a gastrostomy tube (G-tube), but it is no longer used , and it will be removed later today. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 06, Independent. Rationale: The resident can independently complete the activity without any assistance from a helper for this a ctivity. In this scenario, the presence of a G-tube does not affect the eating score. 4. Eating: The dietary aide opens all of Mr. S's cartons and containers on his food tray before leaving the room. There are no safety concerns regarding Mr. S's ability to eat. Mr. S eats the food himself, bringing the food to his mouth using appropriate utensils and swallowing the food safely. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 05, Setup or clean -up assistance. Rationale: The helper provided setup assistance prior to the eating activity. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 17 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 5. Eating: Mrs. H does not have any food consistency restrictions, but often needs to swallow 2 or 3 times so that the food clears her throat due to difficulty with pharyngeal peristalsis. She requires verbal cues from the certified nursing assistant to use the compensator y strategy of extra swallows to clear the food. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: Mrs. H swallows all types of food consistencies and requires verbal cueing (supervision) from the helper. 6. Eating: Mrs. V has had difficulty seeing on her left side since her stroke. During meals, the certified nursing assistant has to remind her to scan her entire meal tray to ensure she has seen all the food. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance . Rationale: The helper provides verbal cue ing assistance during meals as Mrs. V completes the activity of eating . Supervision, such as reminders, may be provided throughout the activity or intermittently. 7. Eating: Mrs. N is impulsive. While she eats, the certified nursing assistant provides verbal and tactile cueing so that Mrs. N does not lift her fork to her mouth until she has swallowed the food in her mouth. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance . Rationale: The resident requires supervision and touching assistance in order to eat safely. 8. Eating: Mr. R is unable to eat by mouth since he had a stroke one week ago. He receives nutrition through a gastrostomy tube (G-tube), which is administered by nurses. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns . Rationale: The resident does not eat or drink by mouth at this time due to his recent - onset stroke. This item includes eating and drinking by mouth only. Since eating and drinking did not occur due to his recent-onset medical condition, the activity is coded as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition and safety concerns. Assistance with G -tube feedings is not considered when coding this item. 9. Eating: Mr. F is fed all meals by the certified nursing assistant, because Mr. F has severe arm weakness and he is unable to assist. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The helper does all of the effort for each meal. The resident does not contribute any effort t o complete the eating activity. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 18 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 10. Eating : Mr. J had a stroke that affects his left side. He is left- handed and feed s himself more than half of his meal s, but tires easily. Mr. J requests assistance from the certified nursing assistant with the remainder of his meal s. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The certified nursing assistant provides less than half the effort for the resident to co mplete the activity of eating. 11. Eating: Mrs. M has osteoporosis, which contributed to the fracture of her right wrist and hip during a recent fall. She is right-handed. Mrs. M starts eating on her own, but she does not have the coordination in her left hand to manage the eating utensils to feed herself without great effort. Mrs. M tires easily and cannot complete eating the meal. The certified nursing assistant feeds her more than half of the meal. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provides more than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of eating. Coding Tip for GG0130B, Oral hygiene If a resident does not perform oral hygiene during therapy, determine the resident's abilities based on performance on the nursing care unit. Examples for GG0130B , Oral hygiene 1. Oral hygiene: In the morning and at night, Mrs. F brushes her teeth while sitting on the side of the bed. Each time, the certified nursing assistant gather s her toothbrush, toothpaste, water, and an empty cup and puts them on the bedside table for her before leaving the room. Once Mrs. F is finished brushing her teeth, which she does without any help, the certified nursing assistant returns to gather her items and dispose of the waste. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 05, Setup or c lean-up a ssistance . Rationale: The helper provides setup and clean- up assistance. The resident brushes her teeth without any help. 2. Oral hygiene: Before bedtime, the nurse provides steadying assistance to Mr. S as he walks to the bathroom. The nurse applies toothpaste onto Mr. S's toothbrush. Mr. S then brushes his teeth at the sink in the bathroom without physical assistance or supervision. Once Mr. S is done brushing his teeth and washing his hands and face, the nurse returns and provides steadying assistance as the resident walks back to his bed. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 05, Setup or c lean-up a ssistance . Rationale : The helper provides setup assistance (putting toothpaste on the toothbrush) every evening before Mr. S brushes his teeth. Do not consider assistance provided to get to or from the bathroom to score Oral hygiene. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 19 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 3. Oral hygiene: At night, t he certified nursing assistant provides Mrs. K water and toothpaste to clean her dentures. Mrs. K cleans her upper denture plate . Mrs. K then cleans half of her lower denture plate, but states she is tired and unable to finish cleaning her lower denture plate. The certified nursing ass istant finishes cleaning the lower denture plate and Mrs. K replaces the dentures in her mouth. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provided less than half the effort to complete oral hygiene . 4. Oral h ygiene: Mr. W is edentulous (without teeth) and his dentures no longer fit his gums. In the morning and evening, Mr. W begins to brush his upper gums after the helper applies toothpaste onto his toothbrush. He brushes his upper gums , but cannot finish due to fatigue. The certified nursing assistant completes the activity of oral hygiene by brushing his back upper gums and his lower gums. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 02, Substantial/m aximal a ssistance . Rationale : The resident begins the activity. The helper completes the activity by performing more than half the effort. 5. Oral h ygiene: Mr. G has Parkinson's disease, resulting in tremors and incoordination. The certified nursing assistant retrieves all oral hygiene items for Mr. G and applies toothpaste to his toothbrush. Mr. G requires assistance to guide the toothbrush into his mouth and to steady his elbow while he brushes his teeth. Mr. G usually starts by brushing his upper and lower front teeth and the certified nursing assistant c ompletes the activity by brushing the rest of his teeth . Coding: GG0130B would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provided more than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of oral hygiene. 6. Oral hygiene: Ms. T has Lewy body dementia and multiple bone fractures. She does not understand how to use oral hygiene items nor does she understand the process of completing oral hygiene. The certified nursing assistant brushes her teeth and explains each step of the activity to engage cooperation from Ms. T; however, she requires full assistance for the activity of oral hygiene. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The helper provides all th e effort for the activity to be complete d. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 20 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 7. Oral h ygiene: Mr. D has experienced a stroke. He can brush his teeth while sitting on the side of the bed, but when the certified nursing assistant hands him the toothbrush and toothpaste, he looks up at her puzzled what to do next. The certified nursing assistant cues Mr. D to put the toothpaste on the toothbrush and instructs him to brush his teeth. Mr. D then completes the task of brushing his teeth. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 04, Supervision or touching a ssistance . Rationale: The helper provides verbal cues to assist the resident in completing the activity of brushing his teeth. 8. Oral h ygiene: Ms. K suffered a stroke a few months ago that resulted in cognitive limitations. She brushes her teeth at the sink, but is unable to initiate the task on her own. The occupational therapist cues Ms. K to put the toothpaste onto the toothbrush, brush all areas of her teeth, and rinse her mouth after brushing. The occupational therapist remains with Ms. K providing verbal cues until she has completed the task of brushing her teeth. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides verbal cues to assist the resident in completing the activity of brushing h er teeth. 9. Oral hygiene: Mrs. N has early stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. She starts brushing her teeth and completes cleaning her upper teeth and part of her lower teeth when she becomes fatigued and asks the certified nursing assistant to help her finish the rest of the brushing. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provided less than half the effort to complete oral hygiene . Coding Tips for GG0130C, Toileting hygiene Toileting hygiene includes managing undergarments, clothing, and incontinence products and performing perineal cleansing before and after voiding or having a bowel movement. If the resident does not usually use undergarments, then assess the resident's need for assistance to manage lower body clothing and perineal hygiene. Toileting hygiene takes place before and after use of the toilet, commode, bedpan, or urinal. If the resident completes a bowel toileting program in bed, code Toileting hygiene based on the resident's need for assistance in managing clothing and perineal cleansing. If the resident has an indwelling urinary catheter and has bowel movements, code the Toilet hygiene item based on the amount of assistance needed by the resident before and after moving his or her bowels. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 21 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) for GG0130C , Toileting hygiene 1. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. J uses a bedside commode. The certified nursing assistant provides steadying (touching) assistance as Mrs. J pulls down her pants and underwear before sitting down on the commode . When Mrs. J is finished voiding or having a bowel movement, the certified nursing assistant provides steadying assistance as Mrs. J wipes her perineal area and pulls up her pants and underwear without assistance . Coding: GG0130C would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides steadying (touching) assistance to the resident to complete toileting hygiene . 2. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. L uses the toilet to void and have bowel movements. Mrs. L is unsteady, so t he certif ied nursing assistant walks into the bathroom with her in case she needs help. During the assessment period , a staff member has been present in the bathroom, but has not needed to provide any physical assistance with managing clothes or cleansing. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 04, Supervision or touching a ssistance . Rationale: The helper provides supervision as the resident performs the toilet hygiene activity . The resident is unsteady and the staff provide supervision for safety reasons. 3. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. P has urinary urgency. As soon as she gets in the bathroom, she asks the certified nursing assistant to lift her gown and pull down her underwear due to her balance problems . After voiding, Mrs. P wipes herself , pulls her underwear back up, and adjusts her gown. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 03, Partial/m oderate assistance . Rationale : The helper provides more than touching assistance. The resident performs more than half the effort; the helper does less than half the effort. The resident completes two of the three toileting hygiene tasks . 4. Toileting hygiene: Mr. J is morbidly obese and has a diagnosis of debility . He requests the use of a bedpan when voiding or having bowel movements and requires two certified nursing assistants to pull down his pants and underwear and mobilize him onto and off the bedpan. Mr. J is unable to complete any of his perineal /perianal hygiene. Both certified nursing assistants help Mr. J pull up his underwear and pants. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The assistance of two helpers was needed to complete the activity of toileting hygiene. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 22 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 5. Toileting hygiene: M r. C has Parkinson's disease and significant tremors that cause intermittent difficulty for him to perform perineal hygiene after having a bowel movement in the toilet. He wa lks to the bathroom with close supervision and lowers his pants, but asks the certified nursing assistant to help him with perineal hygiene after moving his bowels. He then pulls up his pants without assistance. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 03, Partial/m oderate assistance . Rationale: The helper provides less than half the effort. The resident performs two of the three toileting hygiene tasks by himself . Walking to the bathroom is not considered when scoring toileting hygiene. 6. Toileting hygiene: Ms. Q has a progressive neurological disease that affects her fine and gross motor coordination, balance, and activity tolerance. She wears a hospital gown and underwear during the day. Ms. Q uses a bedside commode as she steadies herself in standing with one hand and initiates pulling down her underwear with the other hand but needs assistance to complete this activity due to her coordination impairment. After voiding, Ms. Q wipes her perineal area without assistance while sitting on the commode. When Ms. Q has a bowel movement, a certified nursing assistant performs perineal hygiene as Ms. Q needs to steady herself with both hands to stand for this activity. Ms. Q is usually too fatigued at this point and requires full assistance to pull up her underwear. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provided more than half the effort needed for the resident to complete the activity of toileting hygiene. Coding Tips for GG0130E, Shower/bathe self Shower/bathe self includes the ability to wash, rinse, and dry the face, upper and lower body, perineal area, and feet. Do not include washing, rinsing, and drying the resident's back or hair. Shower/bathe self does not include transferring in/out of a tub/shower. Assessment of Shower/bathe self can take place in a shower or bath or at a sink (i.e., full body sponge bath). If the resident bathes himself or herself and a h elper sets up materials for bathing/showering, then code as 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. If the resident cannot bathe his or her entire body because of a medical condition, then code Shower/bathe self based on the amount of assistance needed to comple te the activity. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 23 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Examples for GG0130E, Shower/bathe self 1. Shower/bathe self: Mr. J sits on a tub bench as he washes, rinses, and dries himself. A certified nursing assistant stays with him to ensure his safety, as Mr. J has had instances of losing his sitting balance. The certified nursing assistant also provides lifting assistance as Mr. J gets onto and off of the tub bench. Coding: GG0130E would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides supervision as Mr. J washes, rinses, and dries himself. The transfer onto or off of the tub bench is not considered when coding the Shower/bathe self activity. 2. Shower/bathe self: Mrs. E has a severe and progressive neurological condition that has affected her endurance as well as her fine and gross motor skills. She is transferred to the shower bench with parti al/moderate assistance. Mrs. E showers while sitting on a shower bench and washes her arms and chest using a wash mitt. A certified nursing assistant then must help wash the remaining parts of her body, as a result of Mrs. E's fatigue, to complete the acti vity. Mrs. E uses a hand-held showerhead to rinse herself but tires halfway through the task. The certified nursing assistant dries Mrs. E's entire body. Coding: GG0130E would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper assists Mrs. E with more than half of the task of showering, which includes bathing, rinsing, and drying her body. The transfer onto the shower bench is not considered in coding this activity. 3. Shower/bathe self: Mr. Y has limited mobility resulting from his multiple and complex medical conditions. He prefers to wash his body while sitting in front of the sink in his bathroom. A helper assists with washing, rinsing, and drying Mr. Y's arms/hands, upper legs, lower legs, buttocks, and back. Coding: GG0130E wo uld be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper completed more than half the activity. Bathing may occur at the sink. When coding this activity, do not include assistance provided with washing, rinsing, or drying the resident's back. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 24 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Coding Tips for GG0130F, Upper body dressing, GG0130G, Lower body dressing, and GG0130H, Putting on/taking off footwear For upper body dressing, lower body dressing, and putting on/taking off footwear, if the resident dresses himself or herself and a helper retrieves or puts away the resident's clothing, then code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. When coding upper body dressing and lower body dressing, helper assistance with buttons and/or fasteners is considered touching assistance. If donning and doffing an elastic bandage, elastic stockings, or an orthosis or prosthesis occurs while the resident is dressing/undressing, then count the elastic bandage/elastic stocking/orthotic/prosthesis as a piece of clothing when determining the amount of assistance the resident needs when coding the dressing item. The following items are considered a piece of clothing when coding the dressing items: o Upper body dressing examples: thoracic-lumbar- sacrum orthosis (TLSO), abdominal binder, back brace, stump sock/shrinker, upper body support device, neck support, hand or arm prosthetic/orthotic. o Lower body dressing examples: knee brace, elastic bandage, bandages, foot orthotics, orthopedic walking boots, compression stockings (considered footwear because of dressing don/doff over foot). Upper body dressing items used for coding include bra, undershirt, T-shirt, button-down shirt, pullover shirt, dresses, sweatshirt, sweater, nightgown (not hospital gown), and pajama top. Upper body dressing cannot be assessed based solely on donning/doffing a hospital gown. Lower body dressing items used for coding include underwear, incontinence brief, slacks, shorts, capri pants, pajama bottoms, and skirts. Footwear dressing items used for coding include socks, shoes, boots, and running shoes. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 25 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim /Discharge (Start/Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) For residents with bilateral lower extremity amputations with or without use of prosthe ses, the activity of putting on/taking off footwear may not occur. For example, the socks and shoes may be attached to the prosthe sis associated with the upper or lower leg. o If the resident performed the activity of putting on/taking off footwear immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury, code as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. o If the resident did not perform the activity of putting on/taking off foot wear immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury because the resident had bilateral lower -extremity amputations and the activity of putting on/taking off footwear was not performed during the assessment period, code as 09, Not applicable - Not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. For residents with a single lower extremity amputation with or without use of a prosthe sis, the activity of putting on/taking off footwear could apply to the intact limb or both the limb with the prosthe sis and the intact limb. o If the resident performed the activity of putting on/taking off footwear for the intact limb only, then code based upon the amount of assistance needed to compl ete the activity. o If the resident performed the activity of putting on/taking off footwear for both the intact limb and the prosthetic limb, then code based upon the amount of assistance needed to complete the activity. Examples for GG0130F, Upper body dre ssing 1. Upper body dressing: Mrs. Y has right- side upper extremity weakness as a result of a stroke and has worked in therapy to relearn how to dress her upper body. During the day, she requires a certified nursing assistant only to place her clothing next to her bedside. Mrs. Y can now use compensatory strategies to put on her bra and top without any assistance. At night she removes her top and bra independently and puts the clothes on the nightstand, and the certified nursing assistant puts them away in her dresser . Coding: GG0130F would be coded 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Rationale: Mrs. Y dresses and undresses her upper body and requires a helper only to retrieve and put away her clothing, that is, setting up the clothing for her use. The description refers to Mrs. Y as \"independent\" (when removing clothes), but she needs setup assistance, so she is not independent with regard to the entire activity of upper body dressing. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 26 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Upper body dressing: Mrs. Z wears a bra and a sweatshirt most days while in the SNF. She requires assistance from a certified nursing assistant to initiate the threading of her arms into her bra. Mrs. Z completes the placement of the bra over her chest. The helper hooks the bra clasps. Mrs. Z pulls the sweatshirt over her arms, head, and trunk. When undressing, Mrs. Z removes the sweatshirt , with the helper assisting her with one sleeve. Mrs. Z slid es the bra off, once it has been unclasped by the helper. Coding: GG0130F would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provides assistance with threading Mrs. Z's arms into her bra and hooking and unhooking her bra clasps and assistance with removing one sleeve of the sweatshirt. Mrs. Z performs more than half of the effort. 3. Upper body dressing: Mr. K sustained a spinal cord injury that has affected both movement and strength in both upper extremities. He places his left hand into one- third of his left sleeve of his shirt with much time and effort and is unable to continue with the activity. A certified nursing assistant then completes the remaining upper body dressing for Mr. K. Coding: GG0130F would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: Mr. K can perform a small portion of the activity of upper body dressing but requires assistance by a helper for more than half of the effort of upper body dressing. Examples for GG0130G, Lower body dressing 1. Lower body dressing: Mr. D is required to follow hip precautions as a result of recent hip surgery. The occupational therapist in the acute care hospital instructed him in the use of adaptive equipment to facilitate lower body dressing. He requires a helper to retrieve his clothing from the closet. Mr. D uses his adaptive equipment to assist in threading his legs into his pants. Because of balance issues, Mr. D needs the helper to steady him when standing to manage pulling on or pulling down his pants/undergarments. Mr. D also needs some assistance to put on and take off his socks and shoes. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: A helper steadies Mr. D when he is standing and performing the activity of lower body dressing, which is supervision or touching assistance. Putting on and taking off socks and shoes is not considered when coding lower body dressing. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 27 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Lower body dressing: Mrs. M has severe rheumatoid arthritis and multiple fractures and sprains due to a fall. She has been issued a knee brace, to be worn during the day. Mrs. M threads her legs into her garments, and pulls up and down her clothing to and from just below her hips. Only a little assistance from a helper is needed to pull up her garments over her hips. Mrs. M requires the helper to fasten her knee brace because of grasp and fine motor weakness. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: A helper provides only a little assistance when Mrs. M is putting on her lower extremity garments and fastenin g the knee brace. The helper provides less than half of the effort. Assistance putting on and removing the knee brace she wears is considered when determining the help needed when coding lower body dressing. 3. Lower body dressing: Mrs. R has peripheral neuropathy in her upper and lower extremities. Each morning, Mrs. R needs assistance from a helper to place her lower limb into, or to take it out of (don/doff), her lower limb prosthesis. She needs no assistance to put on and remove her underwear or slacks. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: A helper performs less than half the effort of lower body dressing (with a prosthesis considered a piece of clothing). The helper lifts, holds, or supports Mrs. R's trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort for the task of lower body dressing. Examples for GG0130H, Putting on/taking off footwear 1. Putting on/taking off footwear: Mr. M is undergoing rehabilitation for right-side upper and lower body weakness following a stroke. He has made significant progress toward his independence and will be discharged to home tomorrow. Mr. M wears an ankle-foot orthosis that he puts on his foot and ankle after he puts on his socks but before he puts on his shoes. He always places his AFO, socks, and shoes within easy reach of his bed. While sitting on the bed, he needs to bend over to put on and take off his AFO, socks, and shoes, and he occas ionally loses his sitting balance, requiring staff to place their hands on him to maintain his balance while performing this task. Coding: GG0130H would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: Mr. M puts on and takes off his AFO, socks, and shoes by himself; however, because of occasional loss of balance, he needs a helper to provide touching assistance when he is bending over. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 28 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Putting on/taking off footwear: Mrs. F was admitted to the SNF for a neurologic condition and experiences visual impairment and fine motor coordination and endurance issues. She requires setup for retrieving her socks and shoes, which she prefers to keep in the closet. Mrs. F often drops her shoes and socks as she attempts to put them onto her feet or as she takes them off. Often a certified nursing assistant must first thread her socks or shoes over her toes, and then Mrs. F can compl ete the task. Mrs. F needs the certified nursing assistant to initiate taking off her socks and unstrapping the Velcro used for fastening her shoes. Coding: GG0130H would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: A helper provides Mrs. F with assistance in initiating putting on and taking off her footwear because of her limitations regarding fine motor coordination when putting on/taking off footwear. The helper completes more than half of the effort with this activity. Examples of Probing Conversations with Staff 1. Eating: Example of a probing conversation between a nurse and a certified nursing assistant regarding the resident's eating abilities : Nurse: \"Please d escribe to me how Mr. S eats his meals. Once the food and liquid are presented to him, does he use utensils to bring food to his mouth and swallow ?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"No, I have to feed him.\" Nurse: \"Do you always have to physically feed him or can he sometimes do some aspect of the eating activity with encouragem ent or cues to feed himself?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"No , he can't do anything by himself. I scoop up each portion of the food and bring the fork or spoon to his mouth. I try to encourage him to feed himself or to help guide the spoon to his mouth but he can't hold the fork. I even tried encouraging him to eat food he could pick up with his fingers, but he will not eat unless he is completely assisted for food and liquid.\" In this example, the nurse inquired specifically how Mr. S requires assistance to eat his meals . The nurse as ked about instructions and physical assist ance. If this nurse had not asked probing questions, he/she may not have received enough information to make an accurate assessment of the assis tance Mr. S received. Accurate coding is important for reporting on the type and amount of care provided. B e sure to consider each activity definition fully. Coding: GG01 30A would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The resident requires complete assistance from the certified nursing assistant to eat his meals. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 29 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Oral hygiene: Example of a probing conversation between a nurse deter mining a resident's oral hygiene score and a certified nursing assistant regarding the resident's oral hygiene routine: Nurse: \"Does Mr s. K help with brushing her teeth ?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"She can help clean her teeth .\" Nurse: \"How much help does she need to brush her teeth?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"She usually gets tired after starting to brush her upper teeth. I have to brush most of her teeth.\" In this example, the nurse inquired specifically how Mr s. K manages her oral hygiene. The nurse as ked about physical assist ance and how the resident performed the activity. If this nurse had not ask ed probing questions, he/she would not have received enough information to make an accurate assessment of the actual assist ance Mr s. K received. Coding: GG01 30B would be coded 02, Substantial/ maximal assistance. Rationale: The certified nursing assistant provides more than half the effort to complete Mrs. K's oral hygiene. Discharge Goal s: Coding Tips Discharge goals are coded with each Admission (Start of SNF PPS Stay) assessment. For the SNF Quality Reporting Program (QRP), a minimum of one self -care or mobility discharge goal must be coded. However, facilities may choose to complete more than one self-care or mobility discharge goal. C ode the resident's discharge goal(s) using the six- point scale. Use of the \"activity was not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88) is permissible to code discharge goal(s). Use of a dash is permissible for any remaining self-care or mobility goals that were not coded . Of note, at least one Discharge Goal must be indicated for either Self -Care or Mobility. Using the dash in this allowed instance after the coding of at least one goal does not affect Annua l Payment Update ( APU) determination. Licensed , qualified clinicians can establish a resident's Discharge Goal(s) at the time of admission based on the resident's prior medical condition, admission assessment self- care and mobility status , discussions with the resident and family, professional judgment, the professional's standard of practice, expected treatments, the resident's motivation to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the resident's discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the resident's care plan. If the admission performance of an activity was coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern during the admission assessment, a D ischarge G oal may be entered using the 6 -point scale if the resident is expected to be able to perform the activity by discharge. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 30 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Discharge Goal: Coding Examples 1. Discharge Goal Code Is Higher than 5- Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code If the qualified clinician determines that the resident is expected to make gains in function by discharge, the code reported for D ischa rge G oal will be higher than the admission performance code. 2. Discharge Goal Code Is the Same as 5- Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code The qualified clinician determines that a medically complex resident is not expected to progress to a higher level of functioning during the SNF Medicare Part A stay; however, the qualified clinician determines that the resident would be able to maintain her admission functional performance level. The qualified clinician discusses functional status goals with the resident and her family and they agree that maintaining functioning is a reasonable goal. In this example, the Discharge Goal is coded at the same level as the resident's admission performance code. Oral Hygiene 5 -Day PPS Assessment Admission Perf ormance: In this example, the qualified clinician anticipates that the resident will have the same level of function for oral hygiene at admission and discharge. The resident's 5-Day PPS admission performance code is coded and the Discharge Goal is coded at the same level. Mrs. E has stated her preference for participation twice daily in her oral hygiene activity. Mrs. E has severe arthritis, Parkinson's disease, diabetic neuropathy, and renal failure. These conditions result in multiple impairments (e.g., limited endurance, weak grasp, slow movements, and tremors). The qualified clinician observes Mrs. E's 5- Day PPS admission performance and discusses her usual performance with qualified clinicians, caregivers, and family to determine the necessary interven tions for skilled therapy (e.g., positioning of an adaptive toothbrush cuff, verbal cues, lifting, and supporting Mrs. E's limb). The qualified clinician codes Mrs. E's 5 -Day PPS assessment admission performance as 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. The h elper performs more than half the effort when lifting or holding her limb. Oral Hygiene 5 -Day PPS Assessment Discharge Goal : The qualified clinician anticipates Mrs. E's discharge performance will remain 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Due to Mrs. E's progressive and degenerative condition, the qualified clinician and resident feel that, while Mrs. E is not expected to make gains in oral hygiene performance, maintaining her function at this same level is desirable and achievable as a Discharge Goal. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 31 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 3. Discharge Goal Code I s Lower than 5- Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code The qualified clinician determines that a resident with a progressive neurologic condition is expected to rapidly decline and that skilled therapy services may slow the decline of function. In this scenario, the D ischarge Goal code is lower than the resident's 5- Day PP S assessment admission performance code. Toileting Hygiene: Mrs. T's participation in skilled therapy is expected to slow down the pace of her anticipated functional deterioration. The resident's D ischarge G oal code will be lower than the 5- Day PPS Admission P erformance code. Toileting Hygiene 5 -Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance: Mrs. T has a progressive neurological illness that affects her strength, coordination, and endurance. Mrs. T prefers to use a bedside commode rather than incontinence undergarments for as long as possible. The certified nursing assistant currently supports Mrs. T while she is standing so that Mrs. T can release her hand from the grab bar (next to her bedside commode) and pull down her underwear before sitting onto the bedside commode. When Mrs. T has finished voiding, she wipes her perineal area. Mrs. T then requires the helper to support her trunk while Mrs. T pulls up her underwear. The qualified clinician codes the 5 -Day PPS assessment admission performance as 03, Partial/m oderate assistance. The certified nursing assistant provides less than half the effort for Mrs. T's toileting hygiene. Toileting Hygiene Discharge Goal: By discharge, it is expected that Mrs. T will need assistance with toileting hygiene and that the helper will perform mor e than half the effort. The qualified clinician codes her D ischarge G oal as 02 , Substantial/maximal assistance.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 37 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Item Rationale During a Medicare Part A SNF stay, residents may have mobility limitations on admission. In addition, residents may be at risk of further functional decline during their stay in the SNF . Steps for Assessment 1. Assess the resident's mobility performance based on direct observation, incorporating resident self-report s and reports from qualified clinicians, care staff, or family documented in the resident's medical record during the three- day assessment period. CMS anticipates that a multidisciplinary team of qualified clinicians is involved in assessing the resident during the three-day assessment period. For Section GG, the assessment period is the first three days of the Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare S tay. On admission, these items are completed only when A0310B = 01 (5- Day PPS assessment). For the Interim Payment Assessment (A0310B=08), the assessment period for Section GG is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and two days prior). 2. Resident s should be allowed t o perform activities as independently as possible, as long as they are safe. 3. For the purposes of completing Section GG, a \" helper \" is defined as facility staff who are direct employees and facility - contracted employees (e.g., rehabilitation staff, nursing agency staff). Thus, does not include individuals hired, compensated or not, by individuals outside of the facility's management and administration , such as hospice staff, nursing/certified nursing assistant students, etc. Therefore, when helper assistance is required because a resident's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, only consider facility staff when scor ing according to amount of assistance provided. 4. Activities may be completed with or without assistive device(s). Use of assistive device(s) to complete an activity should not affect coding of the activity. 5. The admission functional assessment, when possible, should be conducted prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to reflect the resident's true admission baseline functional status. If treatment has started, for example, on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. 6. Refer to facility, Federal, and State policies and procedures to determine which SNF staff members may complete an assessment. Resident assessments are to be done in compliance with facility, F ederal, and State requirements. DEFINITION USUAL PERFORMANCE A resident's functional status can be impacted by the environment or situations encountered at the facility. Observing the resid ent's interactions with others in different locations and circumstances is important for a comprehensive understanding of the resident' s functional status. If the resident's functional status varies, record the resident 's usual ability to perform each activity. Do not record the resident 's best performance and do not record the resident 's worst performance, but rather record the resident 's usual performance . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 38 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding I nstruct ions When coding the resident's usual performance and the resident's discharge goal(s), use the six -point scale, or one of the four \"activity was not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88), to specify the reason why an activity was not attempted. Code 06, Independent : if the resident completes the activity by him/herself with no assist ance from a helper. Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance: if the helper sets up or cleans up ; resident completes activ ity. Helper assists only prior to or following the activity, but not during the activity. For exa mple, the resident requires placement of a bed rail to facilitate rolling, or requires set up of a leg lifter or other assisti ve devices. Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance: if the helper provides verbal cues or touching/ steadying /contact guard assista nce as resident completes activ ity. Assista nce may be provided throughout the act ivity or intermittently. For example, the resident requires ver bal c ueing, coax ing, or gener al supervision for safe ty to complete the activity; or resident may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steady ing assistance during the activity. Code 03, Part ial/mode rate assistance: if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, hold s, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. For example, the resident requires assista nce s uch as partial weigh t-bearing assista nce, b ut HELPER does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Code 02, Subs tantial/maxi mal assistance: if the helper does MORE THAN HALF the e ffort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. Code 01, Dependent : if the helper does ALL of the ef fort. Resident does none of the effort to complete the activity . Or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the resident to complete the activity. Code 07, Resident refused: if the resident refused to complete t he act ivity. Code 09, Not applicable: if the activity was not attempted and the resident did not perform this activ ity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations: if the resident did not attempt this activity due to environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment and weather constraints. Code 88, Not attempted due to med ical condi tion or safety concerns : if the activity was not atte mpted due to medical co ndition or safety concer ns. For additional information on coding the resident's performance on the assessment instrument, refer to the Decision Tree on page GG -12. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 39 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding Tips Admission: The 5 -Day PPS assessment (A0310B = 01) is the first Medicare -required assessment to be completed when the resident is admitted for a SNF Part A stay. o For the 5- Day PPS assessment, code the resident's functional status based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs soon after the resident's admission. This functional assessment must be completed within the first three days (three calendar days) o f the Medicare Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare Stay , and the following two days, ending at 11:59 PM on day 3. The admission function scores are to reflect the resident's admission baseline status and are to be b ased on an assessment. The scores should reflect the resident's status prior to any benefit from interventions. The assessment should occur prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to determine the resident's true admission baseline status. Even if treatment started on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. Interim Performance (Optional): The Interim P ayment Assessment (IPA) is an optional assessment that may be completed by providers in order to report a change in the resident 's PDPM classification. For Section GG on the IPA, providers will use the same 6-point scale and activity not attempted codes to complete the column \"Interim Performance,\" which will capture the interim functional performance of the resident. The ARD for the IPA is determined by the provider, and the assessment period is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and the 2 calendar days prior). It is important to note that the IPA changes payment beginning on the ARD and continues until the end of the Medicare Part A stay or until another IPA is completed. The IPA does not affect the variable per diem schedule. Discharge: The Part A PPS Dischar ge assessment is required to be completed when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends as documented in A2400C, End of Most Recent Medicare Stay, either as a standalone assessment when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remains in the facility; or may be combined with an OBRA Discharge if the Medicare Part A stay ends on the day of , or one day before , the resident's Discharge Date (A2000). Please see Chapter 2 and Section A of the RAI Manual for additional details regarding the Part A PPS Discharge assessment. o For the Discharge assessment, (i.e., standalone Part A PPS or combined OBRA/Part A PPS), code the resident's discharge functional status, based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs as close to the time of the resident's discharge from Medicare Part A as possible. This functional assessment must be completed within the last three calendar days of the resident 's Medicare Part A stay, which includes the day of discharge from Medicare Part A and the two days prior to the day of discharge from Medicare Part A . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 40 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Admission , Interim, and Discharge Performance Coding Tips General Coding Tips When reviewing the medical record, interviewing staff, and observing the resident , be familiar with the definition for each activity . For example, when assessing GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, determine the type and amount of assistance required as the resident walks 50 feet and negotiates two turns . If the resident does not attempt the activity and a helper does not complete the activity for the resident during the entire assessment period , code the reason the activity was not attempted. For example, code as 07, if the resident refused to attempt the activity ; code as 09, if the activity is not applicable for the resident (the activity did not occur at the time of the assessment , and prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury ); code as 10, if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to environmental limitations; or code as 88, if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to a medical condition or safety concerns. An activity can be completed independently with or without devices. If the resident has adaptive equipment, retrieves the equipment without assistance, and performs the activity independently using the device, enter code 06, Independent. If two or more helpers are required to assist the resident to complete the activity, code as 01, Dependent. To clarify your own understanding and observations about a resident's performance of an activity, ask probing questions, beginning with the general and proceeding to the more specific. See examples of using probes when talking with staff at the end of this section. A dash (\"- \") indicates \"No information.\" CMS expects das h use to be a rare occurrence. Documentation in the medical record is used to support assessment coding of Section GG. Data entered should be consistent with the clinical assessment documentation in the resident's medical record. This assessment can be conducted by appropriate healthcare personnel as defined by facility policy and in accordance with local, State, and Federal regulations. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 41 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Tips for Coding the Resident's Usual Performance When coding the resident's usual performance, \"effort\" refers to the type and amount of assistance a helper provides in order for the activity to be completed. The six-point rating scale definitions include the following types of assistance: setup/cleanup, touching assistance, verbal cueing, and lifting assistance. Do not record the resident's best performance, and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance during the assessment period. Code based on the resident's performance. Do not record the staff's assessment of the resident's potential capability to perform the activity. If the resident performs the activity more than once during the assessment period and the resident's performance varies, coding in Section GG is based on the resident's \"usual performance,\" which is identified as the resident's usual activity/performance for any of the Self -Care or Mobility activities, not the mos t independent or dependent performance over the assessment period. A provider may need to use the entire three- day assessment period to obtain the resident's usual performance. Examples and Coding Tips for Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Note: The following are coding examples and coding tips for mobility item s. Some examples describe a single observation of the person completing the activity; other examples describe a summary of several observations of the resident completing an activity across different times of the day and different days. Examples for GG0170A, Roll left and right 1. Roll left and right: Mrs. R has a history of skin breakdown. A nurse instructs her to turn onto her right side, providing step- by-step instructions to use the bedrail, bend her left leg, and then roll onto her right side. Mrs. R attempts to roll with the use of the bedrail, but indicates she cannot perform the task. The nurse then rolls her onto her right side. Next, Mrs. R is instructed to return to lying on her back, which she successfully completes. Mrs. R then requires physical assistance from the nurse to roll onto her left side and to return to lying on her back to complete the activity. Coding: GG0170A would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale : The nurse provides more than half of the effort needed for the resident to complete the activity of rolling left and right. This is because the nurse provides physical assistance to move Mrs. R's body weight to turn onto her right side. The nurse provides the same assistance when Mrs. R turn s to her left side and when she returns to her back. Mrs. R is able to return to lying on her back from her right side by herself. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 42 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Roll left and right: A physical therapist helps Mr. K turn onto his right side b y instructing him to bend his left leg and roll onto his right side. He then instructs him on how to position his limbs to return to lying on his back and then to repeat a similar process for rolling onto his left side and then return to lying on his back. Mr. K completes t he activity without physical assistance from the physical therapist. Coding: GG0170A would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assist ance. Rationale: The physical therapist provides verbal cues (i.e., instructions) to Mr. K as he rolls f rom his back to his right side and returns to lying on his back, and then again as he performs the same activities with respect to his left side. The physical therapist does not provide any physical assistance. 3. Roll left and right: Mr. Z had a stroke that resulted in paralysis on his right side and is recovering from cardiac surgery. He requires the assistance of two certified nursing assistants when rolling onto his right side and returning to lying on his back and also when rolling onto his left side and returning to lying on his back. Coding: GG0170A would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: Two certified nursing assistants are needed to help Mr. Z roll onto his left and right side and back while in bed. 4. Roll left and right: Mr. M fell and sustained left shoulder contusions and a fractured left hip and underwent an open reduction internal fixation of the left hip. A physician's order allows him to roll onto his left hip as tolerated. A certified nursing assistant assists Mr. M in rolling onto his right side by instructing him to bend his left leg while rolling to his right side. Mr. M needs physical assistance from the certif ied nursing assistant to initiate his rolling right because of his left arm weakness when grasping the right bedrail to assist in rolling. Mr. M returns to lying on his back without assistance and uses his right arm to grasp the left bedrail to slowly roll onto his left hip and then return to lying on his back. Coding: GG0170A would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provides less than half the effort needed for the resident to complete the activity of rolling left and right. Examples for GG01 70B, Sit to lying 1. Sit to lying: Mrs. H requires assistance from a nurse to transfer from sitting at the edge of the bed to lying flat on the bed because of paralysis on her right side. The helper lifts and positions Mrs. H 's right leg. Mrs. H uses her arms to position her upper body and lowers herself to a lying position flat on her back. Coding: GG0170B would be coded 03, Partial/m oderate assistance. Rationale: A helper lifts Mrs. H 's right leg and helps her position it as she moves from a seated to a lying position; the helper performs less than half of the effort . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 43 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Sit to lying: Mrs. F requires assistance from a certified nursing assistant to get from a sitting position to lying flat on the bed because of postsurgical open reduction internal fixation healing fractures of her right hip and left and right wrists. The certified nursi ng assistant cradles and supports her trunk and right leg to transition Mrs. F from sitting at the side of the bed to lying flat on the bed. Mrs. F assists herself a small amount by bending her elbows and left leg while pushing her elbows and left foot into the mattress only to straighten her trunk while transitioning into a lying position. Coding: GG0170B would be coded 02, S ubstantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provided more than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of sit to lying. 3. Sit to lying : Mrs. H requires assistance from two certified nursing assistants to transfer from sitting at the edge of the bed to lying flat on the bed due to paralysis on her right side, obesity, and cognitive limitations . One of t he certified nursing assistants explain s to Mrs. H each step of the sitting to lying activity. Mrs. H is then fully assist ed to get from sitting to a lying position on the bed. Mrs. H makes no attempt to assist when asked to perform the incremental steps of the activity. Coding: GG0170B would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The assistance of two certified nursing assistants was needed to complete the activity of sit to lying . If two or more helper s are required to assist the resident to complete an activity, code as 01, Dependent. 4. Sit to lying: Mr. F had a stroke about 2 weeks ago and is unable to sequence the necessary movements to complete an activity (apraxia). He can maneuver himself when transitioning from sitting on the side of the bed to lying flat on the bed if the certified nursing assistant provides verbal instructions as to the steps needed to complete this task. Coding: GG0170B would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: A helper provides verbal cues in order for the resident to complete the activity of sit to lying flat on the bed. 5. Sit to lying: Mrs. G suffered a traumatic brain injury three months prior to admission. She requires the certified nursing assistan t to steady her movements from sitting on the side of the bed to lying flat on the bed. Mrs. G requires steadying (touching) assistance throughout the completion of this activity. Coding: GG0170B would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance.

Coding Tips for GG0170I -G0170L Walking Items Walking activities do not need to occur during one session. Allowing a resident to rest between activities or completing activities at different time s during the day or on different days may facilitate completion of the activities. When coding GG0170 walking items, do not consider the resident's mobility performance when using parallel bars. Parallel bars are not a portable assistive device. If safe, assess and code walking u sing a portable walking device. The turns included in item GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, are 90-degree turns. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to the right or two 90- degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90-degree turn to the left and one 90-degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person's ability level and can include use of an assistive device (for example, cane). Examples for GG0170I, Walk 10 feet 1. Walk 10 feet : Mrs. C has resolving sepsis and has not walked in three weeks because of her medical condition. A physical therapist determines that it is unsafe for Mrs. C to use a walker, and the resident only walks using the parallel bars. On day 3 of the Admission assessment period, Mrs. C walks 10 feet using the parallel bars while the therapist provides substantial weight-bearing support throughout the activity. Coding: GG0170I would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Rationale : When assessing a resident for GG0170 walking items, do not consider walking in parallel bars, as parallel bars are not a portable assistive device. If the resident is unable to walk without the use of parallel bars because of his or her medical condition or safety concerns, use code 88, Activity not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. 2. Walk 10 feet: Mr. L had bilateral amputations three years ago, and prior to the current admission he used a wheelchair and did not walk. Currently Mr. L does not use prosthetic devices and uses only a wheelchair for mobility. Mr. L's care plan includes fitting and use of bilateral lower extremity prostheses. Coding: GG0170I would be coded 09, Not applicable, not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury . Rationale: When assessing a resident for GG0170I, Walk 10 feet, consider the resident's status prior to the current episode of care and current three- day assessment status. Use code 09, Not applicable, because Mr. L did not walk prior to the current episode of care and did not walk during the three-day assessment period. Mr. L's care plan includes fitting and use of bilateral prostheses and walking as a goal. A discharge goal for any admission performance item skipped may be entered if a discharge goal is determined as part of the resident's care plan.

Example for GG0170M, 1 step (curb) 1. 1 step (curb): Mrs. Z has had a stroke; she must be able to step up and down one step to enter and exit her home. A physical therapist provides standby assistance as she uses her quad cane to support her balance in stepping up one step. The physical therapist provides steadying assistance as Mrs. Z uses her cane for balance and steps down one step. Coding: GG0170M would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: A helper provides touching assistance as Mrs. Z completes the activity of stepping up and down one step. Example for GG0170N, 4 steps 1. 4 steps: Mr. J has lower body weakness, and a physical therapist provides steadying assistance when he ascends 4 steps. While descending 4 steps, the physical therapist provides trunk support (more than touching assistance) as Mr. J holds the stair railing. Coding: GG0170N would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: A helper provides touching assistance as Mr. J ascends 4 steps. The helper provides trunk support (more than touching assistance) when he descends the 4 steps. Example for GG0170O, 12 st eps 1. 12 steps: Ms. Y is recovering from a stroke resulting in motor issues and poor endurance. Ms. Y's home has 12 stairs, with a railing, and she needs to use these stairs to enter and exit her home. Her physical therapist uses a gait belt around her trunk and supports less than half of the effort as Ms. Y ascends and then descends 12 stairs. Coding: GG0170O would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provides less than half the required effort in providing the necessary support for Ms. Y as she ascends and descends 12 stairs. Examples for GG0170P, Picking up object 1. Picking up object: Mr. P has a neurologic condition that has resulted in balance problems. He wants to be as independent as possible. Mr. P lives with his wife and will soon be discharged from the SNF. He tends to drop objects and has been practicing bending or stooping from a standing position to pick up small objects, such as a spoon, from the floor. An occupational therapist needs to remind Mr. P of safety strategies when he bends to pick up objects from the floor, and she needs to steady him to prevent him from falling. Coding: GG0170P would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: A helper is needed to provide verbal cues and touching or steadying assistance when Mr. P picks up an object because of his coordination issues. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 57 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Picking up object: Ms. C has recently undergone a hip replacement. When she drops items she uses a long -handled reacher that she had been using at home prior to admission. She is ready for discharge and can now ambulate with a walker without assistance. When she drops objects from her walker basket she requires a certified nursing assistant to locate her long - handled reacher and bring it to her in order for her to use it. She does not need assistance to pick up the objec t after the helper brings her the reacher. Coding: GG0170P would be coded 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Rationale: The helper provides set-up assistance so that Ms. C can use her long- handled reacher. Coding Tips for GG0170R and GG0170S, Wheelchair Items The intent of the wheelchair mobility items is to assess the ability of residents who are learning how to self- mobilize using a wheelchair or who used a wheelchair prior to admission. Use clinical judgment to determine whether a resident's use of a wheelchair is for self-mobilization as a result of the resident's medical condition or safety. Do not code wheelchair mobility if the resident uses a wheelchair only when transported between locations within the facility or for staff convenience (e.g., because the resident walks slowly). Only code wheelchair mobility based on an assessment of the resident's ability to mobilize in the wheelchair. If the resident walks and is not learning how to mobilize in a wheelchair, and only uses a wheelchair for transport between locations within the facility or for staff convenience (e.g., because the resident walks slowly) , code the wheelchair gateway items at admission and/or discharge\u2014GG0170Q1 and/or GG0170Q3, Does the resident use a wheelchair/scooter? \u2014as 0, No, and skip all remaining wheelchair questions. Admission assessment for wheelchair items should be coded for residents who used a wheelchair prior to admission. o The responses for gateway admission and discharge wheelchair items (GG0170Q1 and GG0170Q3) do not have to be the same on the Admission and Discharge assessments. If a wheelchair is used for transport purposes only, then GG0170Q1 and/or GG0170Q3, Does the resident use a wheelchair or scooter? is coded as 0, No; then follow the skip pattern to continue coding the assessment. o Example of using a wheelchair for transport convenience: A resident is transported in a wheelchair by staff between her room and the therapy gym or by family to the facility cafeteria, but the resident is not expected to use a wheelchair after discharge. The turns included in item GG0170R (wheeling 50 feet with two turns) are 90- degree turns. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to the right or two 90-degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90-degree turn to the left and one 90-degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person's abilit y level.

Discharge Goals: Coding Tips Discharge goals are coded with each Admission (Start of SNF PPS Stay) assessment. For the SNF QRP, a minimum of one self-care or mobility goal must be coded. However, facilitie s may choose to complete more than one self- care or mobility discharge goal. Code the resident's discharge goal(s) using the six -point scale. Use of \"activity not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88) is permissible to code discharge goal(s). The use of a dash is permissible for any remaining self -care or mobility goals that were not coded. Using the dash in this allowed instance after the coding of at least one goal does not affect APU determination . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-67 GG0170: Mobility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Licensed qualified clinicians can establish a resident's discharge goal(s) at the time of admission based on the resident's prior medical condition, Admission assessment self - care and mobility status, discussions with the resident and family, professional judgment, the profe ssion's practice standards, expected treatments, resident motivation to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the resident's discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the resident's care plan. If the performance of an activity was coded 88 , Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns, during the Admission assessment, a discharge goal may be coded using the six -point scale if the resident is expected to be able to perform the activ ity by discharge. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-1 SECTION I: ACTIVE DIAGNOSES Intent: The items in this section are intended to code diseases that have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional status, cognitive status, mood or behavior status, medical treatments, nursing monitoring , or risk of death.

An example i s unspecified disorders of joint. \u2014 Code 12, Debility, Cardiorespiratory Conditions , if the resident's primary medical condition category is debility or a cardiorespiratory condition. Exa mples include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and other malaise and fatigue. \u2014 Code 13, Medically Complex Conditions, if the resident's primary medical condition category is a medically complex condition. Examples include diabetes, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease, open wounds, pressure ulcer/injury, infection, and disorders of fluid, electrolyte, and acid- base balance. Examples of Primary Med ical Condition 1. Ms. K is a 67 -year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes who is admitted after a stroke. The diagnosis of stroke, as well as the history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes, is documented in Ms. K's history and physical by the admitting physician. Coding: I0020 would be coded 01, Stroke. I0020B would be coded as I69.051 The physician's history and physical documents the diagnosis stroke as the reason for Ms. K's admission. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. 2. Mrs. E is an 82- year-old female who was hospitalized for a hip fracture wit h subsequent total hip replacement and is admitted for rehabilitation. The admitting physician documents Mrs. E's primary medical condition as total hip replacement (THR) in her medical record. The hip fracture resulting in the total hip replacement is als o documented in the medical record in the discharge summary from the acute care hospital. Coding: I0020 would be coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. I0020B would be code d as S72.062D (Displaced articular fracture of the head of the left femur). Rationale: Medical record documentation demonstrates that Mrs. E had a total hip replacement due to a hip fracture and required rehabilitation. Because she was admitted for rehabilitation as a result of the hip fracture and total hip replacement, Mrs. E's primary medical condition category is 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-4 I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category (cont.) 3. Mrs. H is a 78- year-old female with a history of hypertension and a hip replacement 2 years ago. She was admitted to an extended hospitalization for idiopathic pancreatitis. She had a central line placed during the hospitalization so she could receive TPN (total parenteral nutrition). She also received regular blood glucose monitoring and treatment with insulin when she became hyperglycemic. During her SNF stay, she is being transitioned from being NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving her nutrit ion parenterally to being able to tolerate oral nutrition. The hospital discharge diagnoses of idiopathic pancreatitis, hypertension, and malnutrition were incorporated into Mrs. H's SNF medical record. Coding: I0020 would be coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. I0020B would be coded as K85.00 (Idiopathic acute pancreatitis without necrosis or infection) . Rationale: Mrs. H had hospital care for pancreatitis immediately prior to her SNF stay. Her principal diagnosis of pancreatitis was included in the summary from the hospital. The surgical placement of her central line does not change her care to a surgical category because it is not considered to be a major surgery. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-5 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Day s CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-6 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-7 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont. ) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Disease processes can have a significant adverse effect on an individual's health status and quality of life. Planning for Care This section identifies active diseases and infections that drive the current plan of care . Steps for Assessment There are two look -back periods for this section: Diagnosis identification (Step 1) is a 60- day look- back period. Diagnosis status: Active or Inactive (Step 2) is a 7 -day look- back period (except for Item I2300 UTI, which does not use the active 7 -day look- back period) . 1. Identify diagnoses: The disease conditions in this section require a physician -documented diagnosis (or by a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 60 days . Medical record sources for physician diagnoses include progress notes, the most rec ent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, diagnosis/ problem list, and other resources as available. If a diagnosis/problem list is used, only diagnoses confirmed by the physician should be entered. Although open communication rega rding diagnostic information between the physician and other members of the interdisciplinary team is important, it is also essential that diagnoses communicated verbally be documented in the medical record by the physician to en sure follow -up. Diagnostic information , including past history obtained from family members and close contacts , must also be documented in the medical record by the physician to en sure validity and follow -up. 2. Determine whether diagnoses are active: Once a diagnosis is identified, it must be determined if the diagnosis is active . Active diagnoses are diagnoses that have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional, cognitive, or mood or behavior status, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death during the 7- day look- back period. Do not include conditions that have been resolved, do not affect the resident's current status, or do not drive the resident's plan of care during the 7- day look- back period, as these would be considered inactive diagnoses . DEFINITIONS ACTIVE DIAGNOSES Physician -documented diagnoses in the last 60 days that have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional status, cognitive status, mood or behavior, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death during the 7-day look-back period. FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS Loss of range of motion, contractures, muscle weakness, fatigue, decreased ability to perform ADLs, paresis, or paralysis. NURSING MONITORING Nursing Monitoring includes clinical monitoring by a licensed nurse (e.g., serial blood pressure evaluations, medication management, etc.). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-8 I: Act ive Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont. ) Item I2300 UTI, has specific coding criteria and does not use the active 7 -day look- back. Please refer to Page I -12 for specific coding instructions for Item I2300 UTI. Check the following information sources in the medical record for th e last 7 days to identify \"active\" diagnoses: transfer documents, physician progress notes, recent history and physical, recent discharge summaries, nursing assessments, nursing care plans, medication sheets, doctor's orders, consults and official diagnostic reports, and other sources as available. Coding Instructions Code diseases that have a documented diagnosis in the last 60 days and have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional status, cognitive status, mood or behavior status, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death during the 7- day look -back period (except Item I2300 UTI, which does not use the active diagnosis 7- day look -back. Please refer to Item I2300 UTI, Page I -12 for specific coding instr uctions). Document active diagnoses on the MDS as follows: \u2014 Diagnoses are listed and Vision. \u2014 Examples of diseases are included for some disease categories. Diseases to be coded in these categories are not meant to be limited to only those listed in the examples. For example, I0200, Anemia , includes anemia of any etiolog y, including those listed (e.g., aplastic , iron deficiency, pernicious, sickle cell). Check off each active disease. Check all that apply. If a disease or condition is not specifically listed, enter the diagnosis and ICD code in item I8000, Additional active diagnosis. Computer specifications are written such that the ICD code should be automatically justified. The important element is to ensure that the ICD code's decimal point is in its own box and should be right justified (ali gned with the right margin so that any unused boxes and on the left.) If an individual is receiving aftercare following a hospitalization , a Z code may be assigned. Z codes cover situations where a patient requires continued care for healing, recovery, or long -term consequences of a disease when initial treatment for that disease has already been performed. When Z codes are used , another diagnosis for the related primary medical condition should be checked in items I0100- I7900 or entered in I8000.

There may be specific documentation in the medical record by a physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist of active diagnosis. \u2014 The physician may specifically indicate that a condition is active. Specific documentation may be found in progress notes, most recent history and physical, transfer notes, hospital discharge summary, etc. \u2014 For example, the physician documents that the resi dent has inadequately controlled hypertension and will modify medications. This would be sufficient documentation of active disease and would require no additional confirmation. In the absence of specific documentation that a disease is active, the following indicators may be used to confirm active disease: \u2014 Recent onset or acute exacerbation of the disease or condition indicated by a positive study, test or procedure, hospitalization for acute symptoms and/or recent change in therapy in the last 7 days . Examples of a recent onset or acute exacerbation include the following : new diagnosis of pneumonia indicated by chest X -ray; hospitalization for fractured hip; or a blood transfusion for a hematocrit of 24 . Sources may include radiological reports, hospital discharge summaries, doctor's orders, etc. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-12 I: Active Di agnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) \u2014 Symptoms and abnormal signs indicating ongoing or decompensated disease in the last 7 days. For example, intermittent claudication (lower extremity pain on exertion) in conjunction with a diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease would indicate active disease. Sometimes signs and symptoms can be nonspecific and could be caused by several disease pro cesses. Therefore, a symptom must be specifically attributed to the disease. For example, a productive cough would confirm a diagnosis of pneumonia if specifically noted as such by a physician. Sources may include radiological reports, nursing assessments and care plans, progress notes, etc. \u2014 Listing a disease/diagnosis (e.g., arthritis) on the resident's medical record problem list is not sufficient for determining active or inactive status. To determine if arthritis, for example, is an \"active\" diagnosis, the reviewer would check progress notes (including the history and physical) during the 7- day look- back period for notation of treatment of symptoms of arthritis, doctor's orders for medications for arthritis , and documentation of physical or other therapy for functional limitations caused by arthritis. \u2014 Ongoing therapy with medications or other interventions to manage a condition that requires monitoring for therapeutic efficacy or to monitor potentially severe side effects in the last 7 days . A medication indicates active disease if that medication is prescribed to manage an ongoing condition that requires monitoring or is prescribed to decrease active symptoms associated with a condition. This includes medications used to limit disease progression and complications. If a medication is prescribed for a condition that requires regular staff monitoring of the drug's effect on that condition (therapeutic efficacy), then the prescription of the medication would indicate active disease. It is expected that nurses monitor all medications for adverse effects as part of usual nursing practice. For coding purposes, this monitoring relates to management of pharmacotherapy and not to management or monitoring of the underlying disease. Item I2300 Urinary tract infection (UTI): \u2014 The UTI has a look- back period of 30 days for ac tive disease instead of 7 days. \u2014 Code only if both of the following are met in the last 30 days : 1. It was determined that the resident ha d a UTI using evidence -based criteria such as McGeer , NHSN, or Loeb in the last 30 days , AND 2. A physician documented UTI diagnosis (or by a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 30 days . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I -13 I: Active Di agnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) \u2014 In accordance with requirements at \u00a7483.80(a) Infection Prevention and Control Program, the facility must establish routine, ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of surveillance data to identify infections. The facility's surveillance system must include a data collection tool and the use of nationally recognized surveillance criteria. Facilities are expected to use the s ame nationally recognized criteria chosen for use in their Infection Prevention and Control Program to determine the presence of a UTI in a resident. \u2014 Example: if a facility chooses to use the Surveillance Definitions of Infections (updated McGeer criteria) as part of the facility's Infection Prevention and Control Program, then the facility should also use the same criteria to determine whether or not a resident has a UTI. \u2014 If the diagnosis of UTI was made prior to the resident's admission, entry, or reentry into the facility, it is not necessary to obtain or evaluate the evidence -based criteria used to make the diagnosis in the prior setting. A documented physician diagnosis of UTI prior to admission is acceptable. This information may be included in the hospital transfer summary or other paperwork. \u2014 When the resident is transferred, but not admitted, to a hospital (e.g., emergency room visit, observation stay) the facility must use evidence -based criteria to evaluate the resident and determine if th e criteria for UTI are met AND verify that there is a physician -documented UTI diagnosis when completing I2300 Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). \u2014 Resources for evidence- based UTI criteria: Loeb criteria: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12098745_Development_of_Minimum_ Criteria_for_the_Initiation_of_Antibiotics_in_Residents_of_Long- Term - Infections in LTC (updated McGeer criteria): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538836/ National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN): https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ltc/uti/index.html In response to questions regarding the resident with colonized MRSA, we consulte d with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) who provided the following information: A physician often prescribes empiric antimicrobial therapy for a suspected infection after a culture is obtained, but prior to receiving the culture results . The confirmed diagnosis of UTI will depend on the culture results and other clinical assessment to determine appropriateness and continuation of antimicrobial therapy. This should not be any different, even if the resident is known to be colonized with an antibiotic re sistant organism . An appropriate culture will help to ensure the diagnosis of infection is correct, and the appropriate antimicrobial is prescribed to treat the infection. The CDC does not CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I -14 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) recommend routine antimicrobial treatment for the purposes of attempting to eradicate colonization of MRSA or any other antimicrobial resistant organism. The CDC's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has released infection prevention and cont rol guidelines that contain recommendations that should be applied in all healthcare settings. At this site you will find information related to UTIs and many other issues related to infections in LTC. http://www.cdc.gov/hai/ Item I5100 Quadriplegia : \u2014 Quadriplegia primarily refers to the paralysis of all four limbs, arms and legs, caused by spinal cord injury. \u2014 Coding I5100 Quadriplegia is limited to spinal cord injuries and must be a primary diagnosis and not the result of another condition. \u2014 Functional quadriplegia refers to complete immobility due to severe physical disability or frailty. Conditions such as cerebral palsy, stroke, contractures, brain disease, advanced dementia, etc. can also cause functional paralysis that may extend to all limbs hence, the dia gnosis functional quadriplegia. For individuals with these types of severe physical disabilities, where there is minimal ability for purposeful movement, their primary physician -documented dia gnosis should be coded on the MDS and not the resulting paralysis or paresis from that condition. For example, an individual with cerebral palsy with spastic quadriplegia should be coded in I4400 Cerebral Palsy, and not in I5100, Quadriplegia. Examples of Active Disease 1. A resident is prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. The resident requires regular blood pressure monitoring to determine whether blood pressure goals are achieved by the current regimen. Physician progress note documents hypertens ion. Coding: Hypertension item ( I0700 ), would be checked . Rationale: This would be considered an active diagnosis because of the need for ongoing monitoring to en sure treatment efficacy. 2. Warfarin is prescribed for a resident with atrial fibrillation to dec rease the risk of embolic stroke. The resident requires monitoring for change in heart rhythm, for bleeding , and for anticoagulation. Coding: Atrial would be checked . Rationale: This would be considered an active diagnosis because of the need for ongoing monitoring to en sure treatment efficacy as well as to monitor for side effects related to the medication. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I -15 I: Active Di agnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) 3. A resident with a past history of healed peptic ulcer is prescribed a non- steroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID) medication for arthritis. The physician also prescribes a proton- pump inhibitor to decrease the risk of peptic ulcer NSAID treatment. I3700) , would be checked . Rationale : Arthritis would be considered an active diagnosis because of the need for medical therapy. Given that the resident has a history of a healed peptic ulcer without current symptoms, the proton- pump inhibitor prescribed is preventive and therefore PUD would not be coded as an active disease. 4. The resident had a stroke 4 months ago and continues to have left -sided weakness, visual problems , and inappropriate behavior. The resident is on aspirin a nd has physical therapy and occupational therapy three times a week. The physician's note 25 days ago lists stroke. Coding: Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or Stroke item ( I4500) , would be checked . Rationale : The physician note within t he last 30 days indicates stroke, and the resident is receiving medication and therapies to manage continued symptoms from stroke. Examples of Inactive Diagnoses (do not code) 1. The admission history states that the resident had pneumonia 2 months prior to this admission . The resident has recovered completely , with no residual effects and no continued treatment during the 7 -day look back period. Coding: Pneumonia item ( I2000 ), wou ld not be checked . Rationale : The pneumonia diagnosis would not be considered active because of the resident's complete recovery and the discontinuation of any treatment during the look-back period. 2. The problem list includes a diagnosis of c oronary artery disease (CAD). The resident had an angioplasty 3 years ago, is not symptomatic, and is not taking any medication for CAD. Coding: CAD item ( I0400), would not be checked . Rationale : The resident has had no symptoms and no treatment during the 7- day look- back period; thus , the CAD would be considered inactive. 3. Mr. J fell and fractured his hip 2 years ago. At the time of the injury, the fracture was surgically repaired. Following the surgery, the resident received sev eral weeks of physical therapy in an attempt to restore him to his previous ambulation status, which had been independent without any devices. Although he received therapy serv ices at that time, he now requires assistance to stand from the chair and uses a walker. He also needs help with lower body dressing because of difficulties standing and leaning over. Coding: Hip Fracture item ( I3900 ), would not be checked . Rationale : Although the resident has mobility and self -care limitations in ambulation and ADLs due to the hip fracture, he has not received therapy services during the 7- day look- back period; thus , Hip Fracture would be considered inactive. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 1 SECTION J: HEALTH CONDITIONS Intent: The inte nt of the ite ms in t his se ction is to docum ent a nu mber of health conditions that impact the resident's functional status and qual ity of life. The ite ms incl ude an assessm ent of pain which uses an i nterview with the resi dent or staff if the r esident is u nable to participate. The pain ite ms assess the presence of pain, pain frequency, effect on function, intensity, m anage ment and control. Ot her ite ms in the section assess dyspnea, tobacco use, prognosis, problem conditions, falls , prior surgery, and surgery requiring active SNF care . J0100: Pain Management (5 -Day Look Back) Item Rationale Heal th-related Quality of Life Pain can cause suffering and is ass ociated with inacti vity, social withdrawal, depression, and functional decline. Pain can interfere with par ticipation in rehabilitation. Effective pain m anag ement interventions can help to avoid these adverse outcom es. Planni ng for Care Goals for pain m anag ement for m ost residents should be to achieve a consistent l evel of com fort while maintai ning as m uch function as possible. Identification of pain m anage ment interventions facilitates r eview of the e ffectiveness of pain manage ment and revision of the plan if goals are not met. Residents m ay have m ore than one source of pain and will need a c omprehensive, indi vidualized m anagem ent regimen. Most residents with m oderate to severe pain will require regularly d osed pain m edication, and som e will require additional P RN (as -needed) pain m edications for breakthrough pain. Some resid ents with inte rmittent or m ild pain may have orders for P RN dosing only. DEFINITION PAIN MEDICATION REGIMEN Pharmacological agent(s) prescribed to relieve or prevent the recurrence of pain. Include all medications used for pain management by any route and any frequency during the look - back period. Include oral, transcutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, rectal , intravenous injections or intraspinal delivery. This item does not include medications that primarily target treatment of the underlying condition, such as chemotherapy or steroids, although such treatments may lead to pain reduction. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 5 J0200: Should Pain Assess ment Interview Be Conducted? (cont.) 2. Determine whether or not the resident is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing, or using another method. If the resident is rarely/never understood, skip to item J0800, Indicators of Pain or Possible Pain. 3. Review Language item (A1100) to determine whether or not the resident needs or wants an interpreter. If the resident needs or wants an interpreter, complete the interview with an interpreter. Coding Instructions Attempt to complete the interview if the resident is at lea st sometimes understood and an interpreter is pre sent or not required. Code 0, no: if the resident is rarely/never unders tood or an interpreter is required but not available. Skip to I ndicators of Pain or Possible Pain item (J0800). Code 1, yes: if the resident is at least so metimes understood and an interpreter is present or not required. Cont inue to Pain Presen ce item (J0300). Coding Tips and Special Populations Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL residents. This interview is conducted during the look- back period of the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) and is not contingent upon item B0700, Makes Self Understood. If the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done within the look-back period of the ARD (except when an interpreter is needed/requested and unavailable), item J0200 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code (a dash \" -\") entered in the resident interview items J0300- J0600. Item J0700, Should the Staff Assessment for Pain be Conducted, is coded 0, No. Do not complete the Staff Assessment for Pain items (J0800- J0850) if the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done. If it is not possible for an interpreter to be present during the look-back period, code J0200 = 0 to indicate intervi ew not atte mpted and com plete Staff Assessment of Pain item (J0800), instead of the Pain Int erview items (J0300- J0600). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 30 J1700: Fall History on Admission (cont.) 2. On ad mission interview a resid ent denies a history of fall ing. However, her daughter says that she found her m other on the floor near her toilet twice about 3 -4 months ago. Coding: J1700B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: If the individual is found on the floor, a fall is assu med to have occurred. 3. On ad mission int erview, Mr. M. and his f amily deny any hi story of falling. However, nursing notes in the transferring hos pital record docu ment that Mr. M. re peatedly t ried to get out of bed unassisted at night to go to the bat hroom and was found on a m at placed at his bedside to prevent inj ury the week prior to nursing hom e transfer. Coding: J1700A would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Medical records from an outside facility d ocument that Mr. M. was found on a m at on the floor. This is defined as a fall. 4. Medical records note that Miss K. had hip surgery 5 m onths prior to admission to the nursing home. Miss K.'s daughter says the surgery was needed to fix a broken hip due to a fall. Coding: Both J1700B and J1700C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Miss K. had a fall related fracture 1 -6 months prior to nursing hom e entry. 5. Mr. O.'s hospital transfer rec ord includes a history of ost eoporosis and vertebral com pression fractures. The record does not m ention falls, and Mr. O. denies any history of falling. Coding: J1700C would be coded 0, no. Rationale: The fractures were not related to a fall. 6. Ms. P. has a history of a \"Colles' fracture\" of her left wrist about 3 weeks before nursing home admission. Her son recalls t hat the fracture occurred when Ms. P. tripped on a rug and fell forward on her outstretched hands. Coding: Both J1700A and J1700C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Ms. P. had a f all-related fracture less than 1 m onth prior to e ntry. J1800: Any Falls Since Admission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Falls a re a l eading cau se of morbidity and m ortality among nursing hom e residents. Falls result in serious inju ry, especially hip fractures. Fear of falling can lim it an individual's activity and negatively impact quality of life. DEFINITION PRIOR ASSESSMENT Most recent MDS assessment that reported on falls. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 31 J1800: Any Falls Since Admission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent (cont.) Planni ng for Care Identification of residents w ho are at high risk of falling is a top priority f or care planning. A pre vious fall is the m ost important predictor of risk for future falls. Falls m ay be an indicator of functional decline and developm ent of other serious conditions such as delirium , adverse drug reactions, dehydration, and infections. External risk factors in clude m edication side e ffects, use of applianc es and restraints, and environm ental conditions. A fall should sti mulate evaluation of the resident's need for rehabilitation, a mbulation aids, m odification of the physical environm ent, or additional monitoring (e.g., toileting, to avoid incontinence). Steps for Assessment 1. If this is the first assessme nt/entry or reentry (A0310E = 1), review the m edical record for the time period from the ad mission date to the ARD. 2. If this is n ot the f irst assessment/entry or reentry (A0310E = 0) , the review period is from the day after the ARD of the last MDS assessm ent to the ARD of the current assess ment. 3. Review all available so urces for any fall sin ce the last assessm ent, no m atter wheth er it occur red while o ut in the commu nity, in an ac ute hospit al, or in t he nursing hom e. Include medical records generated in any health care setting since last assess ment. 4. Review nursing hom e incident reports, fall logs and the m edical record (physician, nursing, therapy, and nursing assistant notes). 5. Ask the resident and fa mily about falls during the look- back period. Resident and fa mily reports of falls should be captured here whethe r or not these incidents are docum ented in the medical record. Coding Instructions Code 0, no: if the resident has not had any fall since the l ast asse ssment. Skip to Swallowing Disorder item (K0100 ) if the assessment being completed is an OBRA assessment. If the assessment being completed is a Scheduled PPS assessment, skip to Prior Surgery item (J2000 ). Code 1, yes: if the resident has fallen since t he last assess ment. Continue to Number of Falls S ince Admission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS) item (J1900), whichever is m ore recent. Example 1. An incident report describes an event in which Mr. S. was walking down the hall and appeared to slip on a wet spot on the floor. He lost his balance and bum ped into the wall, but was able to grab onto the hand rail and steady hi mself. Coding: J1800 would be coded 1, yes .

Code 2, two or more: if the resident had t wo or more major inju rious f alls si nce admission/entry or reentry or prior assessm ent (OBRA or Scheduled PPS). Coding Tip If the level of injury directly related to a fall that occurred during the look- back period is identified after the ARD and is at a different injury level than what was originally coded on an assessment that was submitted to the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES ) Assessment Submission and Processing ( ASAP ) system , the assessment must be modified to update the level of injury that occurred with that fall. Examples 1. A nursing note states that Mrs. K. slipped out of her wheelchair onto the floor while at the dining room table. Before being assisted back into her chair, a range of motion assessm ent was co mpleted that indic ated no injury. A skin assessment conducted shortly after the fall also revealed no injury . Coding: J1900A would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Slipping to the floor is a fall. No injury was noted. 2. Nurse's notes describe a situation in which Ms. Z. went out with her fa mily for dinner. When they returned, her son stated t hat while at the restaurant, she f ell in the bathro om. No injury was noted when she returned from dinner. Coding: J1900A would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Falls during the nursing hom e stay, e ven if on outings, are captured here. 3. A nurse's note describes a resident w ho, while being treated for pneum onia, cli mbed over his bedrails and fell to the f loor. He had a cut over his left eye and som e swelling on his arm. He was sent to the em ergency room , where X -rays revealed no injury and neurological checks revealed no chan ges in m ental status. Coding: J1900B would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Lacerations and swelli ng without fractu re are classified as injury (ex cept major). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 35 J1900: Number of Falls Since Adm ission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent (cont.) 4. A resident fell, lacerated his head, and h ead CT scan indicated a subdural he matoma. Coding: J1900C would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Subdural he matoma is a m ajor injury. T he injury occurred as a result of a fall. 5. Mr. R. fell on his right hip in the facility on the ARD of his Quarterly MDS and complained of mild right hip pain. The initial x -ray of the hip did not show any injury. The nurse completed Mr. R's Quarterly assessment and coded the assessment to reflect this information. The assessm ent was submitted to QIES AS AP. Three days later, Mr. R. compl ained of increasing pain and had difficulty ambulating, so a follow -up x-ray was done. The follow -up x-ray showed a hairline fracture of the right hip. This injury is noted by the physician to be attributed to the recent f all that occurred during the look- back period of the Quarterly assessment. Original Coding: J1900B, Injury (except major) is coded 1, one and J1900C , Major Injury is coded 0, none . Rationale: Mr. R. had a fall -related injury that caused him to complain of pain. Modification of Quarterly assessment: J1900B, Injury (except major) is coded 0, none and J1900C, Major Injury, is coded 1, one . Rationale: The extent of the injury did not pres ent itse lf right after the fall; however, it was directly related to the fall that occurred during the look- back period of the Quarterly assessment. Since the assessment had been submitted to QIES ASAP and the level of injury documented on the submitted Quarterly was now found to be different based on a repeat x -ray of the resident's hip, the Quarterly assessment needed to be modified to accurately reflect the injury sustained during that fall. J2000: Prior Surgery Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A recent history of major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission can affect a resident's recovery. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 36 J2000: Prior Surgery (cont.) Planning for Care This item identifies whether the resident has had major surgery during the 100 days prior to the start of the Medicare Part A stay . A recent history of major surgery can affect a resident's recovery. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident and his or her family or significant other about any surgical procedures in the 100 days prior to admission. 2. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the resident had major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Medical record sources include medical records received from facilities where the resident received health care during the previous 100 da ys, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, progress notes, and other resources as available. Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if the resident did not have major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Code 1, Yes: if the resident had major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Code 8, Unknown: if it is unknown or cannot be determined whether the resident had major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Coding Tips Generally, major surgery f or item J2000 refers to a procedure that meets the following criteria: 1. the resident was an inpatient in an acute care hospital for at least one day in the 100 days prior to admission to the skilled nursing facility (SNF), and 2. the surgery carried some degr ee of risk to the resident's life or the potential for severe disability. Examples 1. Mrs. T reports that she required surgical removal of a skin tag from her neck a month and a half ago. She had the procedure as an outpatient. Mrs. T reports no other surger ies in the last 100 days. Coding: J2000 would be coded 0, No . Rationale: Mrs. T's skin tag removal surgery did not require an acute care inpatient stay; therefore, the skin tag removal does not meet the required criteria to be coded as major surgery. Mrs. T did not have any other surgeries in the last 100 days. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 37 J2000: Prior Surgery (cont.) 2. Mr. A's wife informs his nurse that six months ago he was admitted to the hospital for five days following a bowel resection (partial colectomy) for diverticulitis. Mr. A's wife reports Mr. A has had no other surgeries since the time of his bowel resection. Coding: J2000 would be coded 0, No . Rationale: Bowel resection is a major surgery that has some degree of risk for death or severe disability, and Mr. A required a five -day hospitalization. However, the bowel resection did not occur in the last 100 days; it happened six months ago, and Mr. A has not undergone any surgery since that time . 3. Mrs. G. was admitted to the facility for wound care related to dehiscence of a s urgical wound subsequent to a complicated cholecystectomy . The attending physician also noted diagnoses of anxiety, diabetes, and morbid obesity in her medical record. She was transferred to the facility immediately following a four-day acute care hospital stay. Coding: J2000 would be coded 1, Yes . Rationale: In the last 100 days, Mrs. G underwent a complicated cholecystectomy, which required a four -day hospitalization. She additionally had comorbid diagnoses of diabetes, morbid obesity, and anxiety contributing some additional degree of risk for death or severe disability . J2100: Recent Surgery Requiring Active SNF Care Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A recent history of major surgery during the inpatient stay that preceded the resident 's Part A admission can affect a resident's recovery.

Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident and his or her family or significant other about any surgical procedures that occurred during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. 2. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately precede d the resident 's Part A admission. Medical record sources include medical records received from facilities where the resident received health care during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, progress notes, and other resources as available.

Code 8, Unknown: if it is unknown or cannot be determined whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. Coding Tips Generally, major surgery for item J2100 refers to a procedure that meets the following criteria: 1. the resident was an inpatient in an acute care hospital for at least one day in the 30 days prior to admission to the skilled nursing facility (SNF), and 2. the surgery carried some degree of risk to the resident's life or the potential for severe disability. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 39 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A recent history of major surgery during the inpatient stay that preceded the resident 's Part A admission can affect a resident's recovery. Planning for Care This item identifies whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. A recent history of major surgery can affect a resident's recovery. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 40 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Identify recent surgeries: The surgeries in this section must have been documented by a physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 30 days and must have occurred during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission. Medical record sources for recent surgeries include progress notes, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, diagnosis/problem list, and other resources as available. Although open communication regarding resident information between the physician and other members of the interdisciplinary team is important, it is also essential that resident information communicated verbally be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure follow -up. Surgery informat ion, including past history obtained from family members and close contacts, must also be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure validity and follow -up. 2. Determine whether the surgeries require active care during the SNF stay: Once a recent surgery is identified, it must be determined if the surgery requires active care during the SNF stay. Surgeries requiring active care during the SNF stay are surgeries that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF diagnosis, as coded in I0020B. Do not include conditions that have been resolved, do not affect the resident's current status, or do not drive the resident's plan of care during the 7- day look -back period, as these would be considered surgeries that do not require active care during the SNF stay . Check the following information sources in the medical record for the last 30 days to identify \"active\" surgeries: transfer documents, physician progress notes, recent history and physical, recent discharge summaries, nursing assessments, nursing care plans, medication sheets, doctor's orders, consults and official diagnostic reports, and other sources as available. Coding Instructions Code surgeries that are documented to have occurred in the last 30 days, and during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission, that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF diagnosis, as coded in I0020B . Check off each surgery requiring active SNF care as defined above, as follows: \u2014 Surgeries are listed by major surgical category: Major Joint Replacement, Spinal Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery, Neurologic Surgery, Cardiopulmonary Surgery, Genitourinary Surgery, Other Major Surgery .

There may be specific documentation in the medical record by a physician, nurse practitioner, physician assis tant, or clinical nurse specialist. \u2014 The physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) may specifically indicate that the SNF stay is for treatment related to the surgical intervent ion. Specific documentation may be found in progress notes, most recent history and physical, transfer notes, hospital discharge summary, etc. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 43 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) In the rare circumstance of the absence of specific documentation that a surgery requires active SNF care, the following indicators may be used to confirm that the surgery requires active SNF care: The inherent complexity of the services prescribed for a resident is such that they can be perfor med safely and/or effectively only by or under the general supervision of skilled nursing. For example: \u2014 The management of a surgical wound that requires skilled care (e.g., managing potential infection or drainage). \u2014 Daily skilled therapy to restore functional loss after surgical procedure s. \u2014 Administration of medication and monitoring that requires skilled nursing. Examples of surgeries requiring active SNF care and related to the primary SNF diagnosis 1. Mrs. V was hospitalized for gram -negative pneumonia. Since this was her second episode of pneumonia in the past six months, a diagnostic bronchoscopy was pe rformed while in the hospital. She also has Parkinson's dis ease and rheumatoid arthritis. She was discharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment for her pneumonia and requires daily skilled care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions, and the I0020B SNF ICD-10 code is J15.6, Pneumonia due to other aerobic Gram -negative bacteria. There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. V did not receive any major surgery during the prior inpatient stay , and she was admitted to the SNF for continued care due to pneumonia. 2. Mrs. O, a diabetic, was hospitalized for sepsis from an infection due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus that developed after outpatient bunion surgery . A central line was placed to administer antibiotics. She was discharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is A41.01 (Sepsis due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ). There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Neither the placement of a central line nor the outpatient bunion surgery is considered to be a major surger y, but the resident was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 44 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) 3. Mrs. H was hospitalized for severe back pain from a compression fracture of a lumbar vertebral body, which was caused by her age -related osteoporosis. She was treated with a kyph oplasty that relie ved her pain. She was transferred to a SNF after discharge because of her mild dementia and need to regulate her anticoagulant treatment for atrial fibrillation. Coding: I0020 is coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The I0020B SNF ICD-10 code is M80.08XD (Age-related osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, vertebra(e), subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing). There was no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. H was treated with a kyphoplasty during the inpatient stay prior to SNF admission. Although kyphoplasty is a minor surgery and does not require SNF care in and of itself, the resident has other conditions requiring skilled care that are unrelated to the kyphoplasty surgery. 4. Mrs. J had a craniotomy to drain a subdural hematoma after suffering a fall at home. She has COPD and uses oxygen at night. In addition, she has moderate congestive heart failure, is moderately overweight , and has hypothyroidism. After a six -day hospital stay, she was discharged to a SNF for continuing care. The hospital discharge summary indicated that the patient had a loss of consciousness of 45 minutes. Coding: I0020 is coded 07, Other Neurological Conditions. T he I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is S06.5X2D (Traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes, subsequent encounter). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2600, Neuro surgery - brain, surrounding tissue or blood vessels , would be che cked. Rationale: The craniotomy surgery during the inpatient stay immediately preceding the SNF stay requires continued skilled care and skilled monitoring for wound care, as well as therapies to address any deficits that led to her fall or any functional deficits resulting from her fall. 5. Mr. D was admitted to an acute care hospital for cytoreductive surgery for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic renal cell carcinoma and post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is C 79.01 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of the right kidney and renal pelvis ). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2810, Genitourinary surgery - the kidneys, ureter, adrenals , and bladder - open, laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. D was treated with a surgical procedure, genitourinary surgery of the kidney, and admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic kidney cancer and post-surgical care . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 45 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) 6. Mr. G was admitted to an acute care hospital for severe abdominal pain. He was found to have diverticulitis of the small intestine with perforation and abscess without bleeding. He had surgery to repair the perforation. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is K5 7.00 (Diverticulitis of intestine with perforation and absc ess without bleeding ), and J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2910, Major surgery - the GI tract and abdominal contents from the esophagus to the anus, the biliary tree, gall bladder, liver, pancreas, spleen - open or laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. G was treated with a surgical procedure, repair of the small intestine perforation, which is a major surgical procedure. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care. 7. Mr. W underwent surgical repair for a left fractured hip (i.e., subtrochanteric fracture) during an inpatient hospitalization. He was admitted to the SNF for post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded as Code 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is S72.22XD (Displaced subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, subsequent encounter for closed fracture with routine healing) and J2100 is coded as 1, Yes. J2510, Ortho surgery - repair fractures of pelvis, hip, leg, knee, or ankle , would be checked. Rationale: This i s major surgery requiring skilled nursing care to provide wound care and to monitor for early signs of infection or blood clots , for which Mr. W was admitted to the SNF .

K0300: Weight Los s Item Rationale Health-related Quality of Life Weight loss can result in debility and adversely affect health, safety, and quality of life. For persons with morbid obesity, controlled and careful weight loss can improve mobility and health status. For persons with a large volume (fluid) overload, contr olled and careful diuresis can improve health status. Planning for Care Weight loss may be an i mportant i ndicat or of a change in the resi dent's health status or environm ent. If signi ficant weight loss is noted, the int erdisciplinary team should re view f or possible causes of changed intake, changed c aloric need, change in m edica tion (e.g., diur etics), or changed f luid volum e status.

At a point closest to 180- days preceding the current weight. DEFINITIONS 5% WEIGHT GAIN IN 30 DAYS Start with the resident's weight closest to 30 days ago and multiply it by 1.05 (or 105%). The resulting figure represents a 5% gain from the weight 30 days ago. If the resident's current weight is equal to or more than the resulting figure, the resident has gained more than 5% body weight. 10% WEIGHT GAIN IN 180 DAYS Start with the resident's weight closest to 180 days ago and multiply it by 1.10 (or 110%). The resulting figure represents a 10% gain from the weight 180 days ago.

Examples include soft solids, pur\u00e9ed foods, ground meat, and thickened liquids. A mechanically altered diet should not automatically be considered a therapeutic diet. THERAPEUTIC DIET A therapeutic diet is a diet intervention ordered by a health care practitioner as part of the treatment for a disease or clinical condition manifesting an altered nutritional status, to eliminate, decrease, or increase certain substances in the diet (e.g. sodium, potassium) (ADA, 2011).

Coding: K0710B2 would be coded 2, 501 cc/day or more, and K0710B3 would be coded 1, 500 cc/day or less. Rationale: The total fluid intake within the last 7 days while Mr. K. was a resident of the nursing home was 1,520 cc (510 cc + 520 cc + 490 cc = 1,520 cc). Average fluid intake while a resident totaled 507 cc (1,520 cc divided by 3 days). 507 cc is greater than 500 cc, therefore code 2, 501 cc/day or more is correct for K0710B2, While a Resident . The total fluid intake during the entire 7 days (includes fluid intake while Mr. K. was in the hospital AND while Mr. K. was a resident of the nursing home) was 3,420 cc (1,900 cc + 1,520 cc). Average fluid intake during the entire 7 days was 489 cc (3,420 cc divided by 7 days). 489 cc is less than 500 cc, therefore code 1, 500 cc/day or less is correct for K0710B3, During Entire 7 Days . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -14 M0300C : Stag e 3 Pr essure Ul cers Item Rationale Health-related Quality of Life Pressure ul cers affect q uality of life for residents because th ey may limit activity, m ay be pain ful, and may require ti me-consu ming treatm ents and dre ssing changes. Planning for Care Pressure ul cers at m ore advanced st ages ty pically requi re more aggres sive interventions, includ ing frequent repos itioning, a ttention to nut ritional status, and c are that m ay be m ore ti me or staf f intensive. An existing pressu re ulcer may put reside nts at risk for further co mplicat ions or skin injury. If a pressu re ulcer f ails to show s ome eviden ce toward hea ling within 14 days, the pressu re ulcer (including potent ial complica tions) and t's erall clinical condi tion s hould be r eassessed. Tissue characteristics of pressure ulcers should be considered when determining treatment options and choices. Changes in tissue characteristics over time are indicative of wound healing or degeneration. Step s for Asses smen t 1. Perform head-to-toe as sessment. Conduct a f ull body skin as sessment focusing on bony prominences and press ure-bearing ar eas (s acrum, buttocks, heels, an kles, e tc.). 2. For the pur poses of coding, deter mine that the l esion being as sessed i s primarily rel ated to pressu re and that other c onditions have been r uled out. If pressure is n ot the pri mary cause, do not code here. 3. Identify all Stage 3 pres sure ul cers curren tly present. 4. Identify the num ber of these press ure ulce rs that were present on adm ission/en try or re entry. DEFINITION STAGE 3 PRESSURE ULCER Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscle is not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining or tunneling (see definition of underm ining and tunneling on page M -19).

Scenari os for Pr essure Ulcer Codi ng Exam ple M0100 -M1200 1. Mrs. P was a dmitted to the nursing hom e on 10/23/2019 f or a Medic are stay. In com pleting the PPS 5 -day assessm ent (ARD of 10/28/2019) , it was noted t hat the resident had a he ad-to- toe skin assessm ent and her skin was intact, but u pon assess ment using the Braden scal e, was found to be at risk for skin breakdown. T he reside nt was noted to ha ve a Stage 2 pres sure ulcer that was ident ified on her c occyx on 11/1/2019. Th is Stage 2 p ressure ulcer was n oted to ha ve pink ti ssue with so me epith elialization present in the wound bed. D imensions of the ulcer were len gth 01.1 c m, width 00.5 c m, and no m easurable d epth. Mrs. P does not have any a rterial or venous ulce rs, wounds, or ski n proble ms. She is re ceiving ulcer care w ith application of a dres sing appl ied to the coccy geal u lcer. M rs. P. also ha s pressu re reducing devices on b oth her bed a nd chair and has been placed on a 1\u00bd hour turning and repos itioning schedule per t issue tolerance. In order to stay closer to her family, Mrs. P was discharged to another nursing home on 11/5/2019. This was a planned discharge (A0310G = 2), and her OBRA Discharge assessment was coded at A0310F as 10, Discharge assessment - return not anticipated. 5-Day PPS: Coding: M0100 B (Formal assess ment inst rument), Check box. M0100 C (Clinic al assessment), Check box. M0150 (Risk of Pressure Ulce rs/Injuries ), Code cers/injuries and Art erial Ulcers), Code 0. M1040 (Other ulcers, wounds and skin proble ms), Check Z (None of the above). M1200 (Skin and Ulc er Treat ments), Check Z (None of the above were provided). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -40 Scenarios for Pressure Ulcer Coding (cont.) Rationale: The resi dent had a f ormal ass essment using t he Braden scal e and also had a head -to-toe skin ass essment com pleted. Pres sure was via ormal assessm ent. Upon asses sment the res ident's skin was noted to be int act, theref ore, M0210 was coded 0 . M1030 was coded 0 due to the resident not ha ving any of these condi tions. M1040 Z was checked since none of these pro blems were noted. M1200 Z was checked because no ne of these tr eatments were provi ded.

M0300 G1 (Unstagea ble - Deep t issue injury), Code 0 and skip to M1030 (Number of Venous and Arterial Ulcers). Rationale: The res ident has a pressure ulcer. On the 5- day PPS assessm ent, the resident's skin was noted to be int act; however, on the Discharge assessment , it was noted that the resi dent h ad a new Stage 2 pressu re ulcer. Since the resident has had both a 5-day PPS and Discharge assessment completed, t he Discharge assessment would be coded 0 at A0310E . This is beca use the Discharge assessment is not t he first as sessment si nce the most recent admission/ entry or reent ry. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -1 SECTION O : SPECIAL TREATMENTS, PROCEDURES, AND PROGRAMS Intent: The intent of the items in this section is to identify any special treatments, procedures, and programs that the r esident received during the specified time periods. O0100: Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs Facilities may code treatments, programs and procedures that the resident performed themselves independently or after set- up by facility staff. Do not code ser vices that were provided solely in conjunction with a surgical procedure or diagnostic procedure, such as IV medications or ventilators. Surgical procedures include routine pre- and post-operative procedures. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The treatments , procedures, and programs listed in Item O0100, Special Treatments , Procedures, and Programs , can have a profound effect on an individual's health status, self-image, dignity, and quality of life. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -5 P rocedures, and Programs (cont.) O0100K , Hospice care Code residents identified as being in a hospice program for terminally ill persons where an array of services is provided for the palliation and management of terminal illness and related conditions. The hospice must be licensed by the state as a hospice provider and/or certified under the Medicare program as a hospice provider. O0100M , Isolation for active infectious disease (does not include standard precautions) Code only when the resident requires transmission- based precautions and single room isolation (alone in a separate room ) because of active infection (i.e., symptomatic and/or have a positive test and are in the contagious stage) with highly transmissible or epidemiologically significant pathogens that have been acquired by physical contact or ai rborne or droplet transmission. Do not code this item if the resident only has a history of infectious disease (e.g., s/p MRSA or s/p C-Diff - no active symptoms). Do not code this item if the precautions are standard precautions, because these types of precautions apply to everyone. Standard precautions include hand hygiene compliance, glove use, and additionally may include masks, eye protection, and gowns. Examples of when the isolation criterion would not apply include urinary tract infections, encapsulat ed pneumonia, and wound infections. Code for \" single room isolation\" only when all of the following conditions are met: 1. The resident has active infection with highly transmissible or epidemiologically significant pathogens that have been acquired by physic al contact or airborne or droplet transmission. 2. Precautions are over and above standard precautions. That is, transmission- based precautions (contact, droplet, and/or airborne) must be in effect. 3. The resident is in a room alone because of active infection and cannot have a roommate. This means that the resident must be in the room alone and not cohorted with a roommate regardless of whether the roommate has a similar active infection that requires isolation. 4. The resident must remain in his/her room. This re quires that all services be brought to the resident (e.g. rehabilitation, activities, dining, etc.). The following resources are being provided to help the facility interdisciplinary team determine the best method to contain and/or prevent the spread of infectious disease based on the type of infection and clinical presentation of the resident related to the specific communicable disease. The CDC guideline s also outline isolation precautions and go into detail regarding the different types of Transmission- Based Precautions (Contact, Droplet, and Airborne). 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html SHEA/APIC Guideline: Infection Prevention and Control in the Long Term Care Facility http://www.apic.org/Resource_/TinyMceFileManager/Practice_Guidance/id_APIC - SHEA_GuidelineforICinLTCFs.pdf CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -6 O0100: Special Treatments, P rocedures, and Programs (cont.) As the CDC guideli ne notes , there are psychosocial risks associated with such restriction, and it has been recommended that psychosocial needs be balanced with infection control needs in the long-term care setting. If a facility transports a resident who meets the criteria for single room isolation to another healthcare setting to receive medically needed services (e.g. dialysis, chemotherapy, blood transfusions, etc.) which the facility does not or cannot provide, they should follow CDC guidelines for transport of patients with communicable disease, and may still code O0100M for single room isolation since it is still being maintained while the resident is in the facility. Finally, when coding for isolation, the facility should review the resident's status and determine if the criteria for a Significant Change of Status Assessment (SCSA) is met based on the effect the infection has on the resident's function and plan of care. The definition and criteria of \"significant change of status\" is found in Chapter 2, Section 2.6, 03. Significant Change i n Status Assessment (SCSA) (A0310A = 04). Regardless of whether the resident meets the criteria for an SCSA, a modification of the resident's plan of care will likely need to be completed. O0100Z, None of the above Code if none of the above treatments, procedures, or programs were received or performed by the resident . O0250: Influenza Vaccine Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life When infected with influenza, older adults and persons with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications and are more likely than the general population to require hospitalization. An institutional I nfluenza A outbreak can result in up to 60 percent of the population becoming ill, with 25 percent of those affected developing complications severe enough to result in hospitalization or death. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -15 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Item Ratio nale Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining as much independence as possible in activities of daily living , mobility , and communication is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, breathing problems , and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries , which contribute to diminished quality of life. The qualified therapist, in conjunction with the physician and nursing administration, is responsible for determining the necessity for, and the frequency and duration of, the therapy services provided to residents. Rehabilitation ( i.e., via Speech -Language Pathology Services and Occupational and Physical T herap ies) and respiratory, psychological, and recreational therapy can help residents to attain or maintain their highest level of well- being and improve their quality of life. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -16 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Planning for Care Code only medically necessary therapies that occurred after admission/readmission to the nursing home that were (1) ordered by a physician (physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and/or clinical nurse specialist) based on a qualified therapist's assessment (i.e., one who meets Medicare requirements or , in some instances, under such a person's direct supervision) and treatment plan, (2) documented in the resident's med ical record, and (3) care planned and periodically evaluated to ensure that the resident receives needed therapies and that current treatment plans are effective. Therapy treatment may occur either inside or outside of the facility. For definitions of the types of therapies listed in this section, please refer to th e Glossary in Appendix A. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record (e.g., rehabilitation therapy evaluation and treatment records, recreation therapy notes, mental health professional progress notes) , and consult with each of the qualified care providers to collect the information required for this item. Coding Instructions for Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services and Occupational and Physical Therapies Individual minutes \u2014Enter the total nu mber of minutes of therapy that were provided on an individual basis in the last 7 days. Enter 0 if none were provided. Individual services are provided by one therapist or assistant to one resident at a time. Concurrent minutes \u2014Enter the total number of m inutes of therapy that were provided on a concurrent basis in the last 7 days. Enter 0 if none were provided. Concurrent therapy is defined as the treatment of 2 residents at the same time, when the residents are not performing the same or similar activities, regardless of payer source, both of whom must be in line -of-sight of the treating therapist or assistant for Medicare Part A. When a Part A resident receives therapy that meets this definition, it is defined as concurrent therapy for the Part A residen t regardless of the payer source for the second resident . For Part B, residents may not be treated concurrently: a therapist may treat one resident at a time, and the minutes during the day when the resident is treated individually are added, even if the t herapist provides that treatment intermittently (first to one resident and then to another). For all other payers, follow Medicare Part A instructions. Group minutes \u2014Enter the total number of minutes of therapy that were provided in a group in the last 7 d ays. Enter 0 if none were provided. Group therapy is defined for Part A as the treatment of two to six residents, regardless of payer source, who are performing the same or similar activities, and are supervised by a therapist or an assistant who is not supervising any other individuals. For Medicare Part B, treatment of two patients (or more), regardless of payer source, at the same time is documented as group treatment . For all other payers, follow Medicare Part A instructions.

Coding Tips and Special Populations Therapy Start D ate: 1. Look at the date at A1600. 2. Determine whether the resident has had skilled rehabilitation therapy at any time from that date to the present date. 3. If so, enter the date that the therapy regimen started; if there was more than one therapy regimen since the A1600 date, enter the start date of the most recent therapy regimen. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -21 O0400: Therapies (cont.) In sit uations where the ongoing performance of a safe and effective maintenance program does not require any skilled services, o nce the qualified therapist has designed the maintenance program and discharged the resident from a rehabilitation (i.e., skille d) therapy program, the services performed by the therapist and the assistant are not to be reported in item O0400A, B, or C Therapies . The services may be reported on the MDS assessment in i tem O0500 Restorative Nursing Care , provided the requirements for restorative nursing program are met. Services provided by therapy aides are not skilled services (see therapy aide section below). When a resident refuses to participate in therapy, it is important for care planning purposes to identify why the resident is refusing therapy. However, the time spent investigating the refusal or trying to persuade the resident to participate in treatment is not a skilled service and shall not be included in the therapy minutes. Co-treatment For Part A: When t wo clinicians (therapists or therapy assistants), each from a different discipline, treat one resident at the same time with different treatments, both disciplines may code the treatment session in full. All policies regarding mode, modalities and student supervision must be followed as well as all other federal, state, practice and facility policies. For example, if two therapists (from different disciplines) were conducting a group treatment session, the group must be comprised of two to six participants who were doing the same or similar activities in each discipline. The decision to co- treat should be made on a case by case basis and the need for co - treatment should be well documented for each patient . Because co -treatment is appropriate for specific cli nical circumstances and would not be suitable for all residents, its use should be limited. For Part B: Therapists, or therapy assistants, working together as a \"team\" to treat one or more patients cannot each bill separately for the same or different service provided at the same time to the same patient. CPT codes are used for billing the services of one therapist or therapy assistant. The therapist cannot bill for his/her services and those of another therapist or a therapy assistant, when both provide the same or different services, at the same time, to the same patient(s). Where a physical and occupational therapist both provide services to one patient at the same time, only one therapist can bill for the entire service or the PT and OT can divide the service units. For example, a PT and an OT work together for 30 minutes with one patient on transfer activities. The PT and OT could each bill one unit of 97530. Alternatively, the 2 units of 97530 could be billed by either the PT or the OT, but not both. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -23 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Modes of Therapy A resident may receive therapy via different modes during the same day or even treatment session. When developing the plan of care, the therapist and assistant must determine which mode(s) of therapy and the amount of time the resident receives for each mode and code the MDS appropriately. The therapist and assistant should document the reason a specific mode of therapy was chosen as well as anticipated goals for that mode of therapy. For any therapy that does not meet one of the therapy mode definitions below, those minutes may not be counted on the MDS. The therapy mode definitions must always be followed and apply regardless of when the therapy is provided in relationship to all assessment windows (i.e., applies whether or not the resident is in a look back period for an MDS assessment). Individual Therapy The treatment of one resident at a time. The resident is recei ving the therapist's or the assistant's full attention. Treatment of a resident individually at intermittent times during the day is individual treatment, and the minutes of individual treatment are added for the daily count. For example, the speech -langua ge pathologist treats the resident individually during breakfast for 8 minutes and again at lunch for 13 minutes. The total of individual time for this day would be 21 minutes. When a therapy student is involved with the treatment of a resident, the minute s may be coded as individual therapy when only one resident is being treated by the therapy student and supervising therapist/assistant (Medicare A and Medicare B). The supervising therapist/assistant shall not be engaged in any other activity or treatment when the resident is receiving therapy under Medicare B. However, for those residents whose stay is covered under Medicare A, the supervising therapist/assistant shall not be treating or supervising other individuals and he/she is able to immediately intervene/assist the student as needed. Example: A speech therapy graduate student treats Mr. A for 30 minutes. Mr. A.'s therapy is covered under the Medicare Part A benefit. The supervising speech -language pathologist is not treating any patients at this time but is not in the room with the student or Mr. A. Mr. A.'s therapy may be coded as 30 minutes of individual therapy on the MDS. Concurrent Therapy Medicare Part A The treatment of 2 residents, who are not performing the same or similar activities, at the same time, regardless of payer source , both of whom must be in line-of- sight of the treating therapist or assistant. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -25 O0400: Therapies (cont.) An Occupational Therapist provides therapy to Mr. K. for 60 minutes. An occupational therapy graduate student who is supervised by the occupational therapist, is treating Mr. R. at the same time for the same 60 minutes but Mr. K. and Mr. R. are not doing t he same or similar activities. Both Mr. K. and Mr. R's stays are covered under the Medicare Part A benefit. Based on the information above, the therapist would code each individual's MDS for this day of treatment as follows: \u2014 Mr. K. received concurrent ther apy for 60 minutes. \u2014 Mr. R. received concurrent therapy for 60 minutes. Group Therapy Medicare Part A The treatment of two to six residents, regardless of payer source, who are performing the same or similar activities, and are supervised by a therapist or assistant who is not supervising any other individuals. When a therapy student is involved with group therapy treatment, and one of the following occurs, the minutes may be coded as group therapy: The therapy student is providing the group treatment and the supervising therapist/assistant is not treating any residents and is not supervising other individuals (students or residents); or The supervising therapist/assistant is providing the group treatment and the therapy student is not providing treatment to any resident. In this case, the student is simply assisting the supervising therapist. Medicare Part B The treatment of 2 or more individuals simultaneously, regardless of payer source, who may or may not be performing the same activity. When a therapy student is involved with group therapy treatment, and one of the following occurs, the minutes may be coded as group therapy: The therapy student is providing group treatment and the supervising therapist/assistant is not engaged in any other activity or t reatment; or The supervising therapist/assistant is providing group treatment and the therapy student is not providing treatment to any resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -27 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Therapy Modalities Only skilled therapy time (i.e., require the skills, knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist and all the requirements for skilled therapy are met) shall be recorded on the MDS. In some instances, the time a resident receives certain modalities is partly skilled and partly u nskilled time; only the time that is skilled may be recorded on the MDS. For example, a resident is receiving TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) for pain management. The portion of the treatment that is skilled, such as proper electrode pla cement, establishing proper pulse frequency and duration, and determining appropriate stimulation mode, shall be recorded on the MDS. In other instances, some modalities only meet the requirements of skilled therapy in certain situations. For example, the application of a hot pack is often not a skilled intervention. However, when the resident's condition is complicated and the skills, knowledge, and judgment of the therapist are required for treatment, then those minutes associated with skilled therapy time may be recorded on the MDS. The use and rationale for all therapy modalities, whether skilled or unskilled should always be documented as part of the resid ent's plan of care. Dates of Therapy A resident may have more than one regimen of therapy treatment during an episode of a stay. When this situation occurs the Therapy Start Date for the most recent episode of treatment for the particular therapy (SLP, PT, or OT) should be coded. When a resident's episode of treatment for a given type of therapy extends beyond the ARD (i.e., therapy is ongoing), enter dashes in the appropriate Therapy End Date. Therapy is considered to be ongoing if: The resident was discharged and therapy was planned to continue had the resident remained in the facility, or The resident's SNF benefit exhausted and therapy continued to be provided, or The resident's payer source changed and therapy continued to be provided. For example, Mr. N. was admitted to the nursing home following a fall that resulted in a hip fracture i n November 2019. Occupational and Physical therapy started December 3, 2019. His physical therapy ended January 27, 2020 and occupational therapy ended January 29, 2020. Later on during his stay at the nursing home, due to the progressive nature of his Par kinson's disease, he was referred to SLP and OT February 10, 2020 (he remained in the facility the entire time). The speech -language pathologist evaluated him on that day and the occupational therapist evaluated him the next day. The ARD for Mr. N.'s MDS assessment is February 28, 2020. Coding values for his MDS are: O0400A5 (SLP start date) is 02102020, O0400A6 (SLP end date) is dash filled, O0400B5 (OT start date) is 02112020, O0400B6 (OT end date) is dash filled, O0400C5 (PT start date) is 12032019, and O0400C6 (PT end date) is 01272020. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -28 O0400: Therapies (cont.) General Coding Example: Following a stroke, Mrs. F. was admitted to the skilled nursing facility in stable condition for rehabilitation therapy on 10/06/ 19 under P art A skilled nursing facility coverage. She had slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, severe weakness in both her right upper and lower extremities, and a Stage 3 pressure ulcer on her left lateral malleolus. She was referred to SLP, OT, and PT with the long -term goal of returning home with her daughter and son- in-law. Her initial SLP evaluation was performed on 10/06/ 19, the PT initial evaluation on 10/07/ 19, and the OT initial evaluation on 10/09/ 19. She was also referred to recreational therapy and respiratory therapy. The interdisciplinary team determined that 10/13/1 9 was an appropriate ARD for her 5 -Day assessment . During the look- back period she received the following: Speech -language pathology services that were provided over the 7 -day look -back period: Individual dysphagia treatments; Monday -Friday for 30 minute sessions each day. Cognitive training; Monday and Thursday for 35 minute concurrent therapy sess ions and Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 25 minute group sessions . Individual speech techniques; Tuesday and Thursday for 20- minute sessions each day . Coding: O0400A 1 would be coded 190 ; O0400A2 would be coded 70 ; O0400A3 would be coded 75 ; O0400A4 would be coded 5 ; O0400A5 would be coded 10062019 ; and O0400A6 would be coded with dashes . Rationale: Individual minutes totaled 190 over the 7- day look- back period [(30 \u00d7 5) + (20 \u00d7 2) = 190]; concurrent minutes totaled 70 over the 7 -day look- back period (35 \u00d7 2 = 70); and group minutes totaled 75 over the 7- day look- back period (25 \u00d7 3 = 75). Therapy was provided 5 out of the 7 days of the look- back period. Date speech -language pathology services began was 10- 06-2019, and dashes were used as the therapy end date value because the therapy was ongoing. Occupational therapy services that were provided over the 7- day look- back period: Individual sitting balance activities; Monday and Wednesday for 30- minute co -treatment sessions with PT each day (OT and PT each code the session as 30 minutes for each discipline). Individual wheelchair seating and positioning; Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the following times: 23 minutes, 18 minutes, and 12 minutes. Balance/coordination activities; Tuesday -Friday for 20 minutes each day in group sessions. Coding: O0400B1 would be coded 113, O0400B2 would be coded 0 , O0400B3 would be coded 80 , O0400B3A would be coded 60, O0400B4 would be coded 5 , O0400B5 would be coded 1009201 9, and O0400B6 would be coded with dashes . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items October 2019 Page O -29 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Rationale: Individual minutes (including 60 co -treatment minutes) totaled 113 over the 7 -day look- back period [(30 \u00d7 2) + 23 + 18 + 12 = 113]; concurrent minutes totaled 0 over the 7- day look- back period (0 \u00d7 0 = 0); and group minutes totaled 80 over the 7 -day look- back period (20 \u00d7 4 = 80). Therapy was provided 5 out of the 7 days of the look- back period. Date occupational therapy services began was 10 -09-2019 and dashes were used as the therapy end date value because the therapy was ongoing. Physical therapy services that were provided over the 7 -day look- back period: Individual wound debridement followed by application of routine wound dressing; Monday the session lasted 22 minutes, 5 minutes of which were for the application of the dressing. On Thursday the session lasted 27 minutes, 6 minutes of which were for the application of the dressing. For each session the therapy aide spent 7 minutes preparing the debridement area (set -up time) for needed therapy supplies and equipment for the therapist to conduct wound debridement. Individual sitting balance activities; on Monday and Wednesday for 30- minute co - treatment sessions with OT (OT and PT each code the session as 30 minutes for each discipline). Individual bed positioning and bed mobility training; Monday -Friday for 35 minutes each day. Concurrent therapeutic exercises; Monday -Friday for 20 minutes each day. Coding: O0400C1 would be coded 28 7, O0400C2 would be coded 100 , O0400C3 would be coded 0 , O0400C3A would be coded 60 , O0400C4 would be coded 5 , O0400C5 would be coded 1007201 9, and O0400C6 would be coded with dashes . Rationale: Individual minutes (including 60 co -treatment minutes) totaled 287 over the 7 -day look- back period [(30 \u00d7 2) + (35 \u00d7 5) + (22 - 5) + 7 + (27 - 6) + 7 = 287]; concurrent minutes totaled 100 over the 7- day look- back period (20 \u00d7 5 = 100); and group minutes totaled 0 over the 7- day look- back period (0 \u00d7 0 = 0). Therapy was provided 5 out of the 7 days of the look- back period. Date physical therapy services began was 10- 07-2019 , and dashes were used as the therapy end date value because the therapy was ongoing. Respiratory therapy services that were provided over the 7 -day look- back period: Respiratory therapy services; Sunday -Thursday for 10 minutes each day. Coding: O0400D1 would be coded 50 , O0400D2 would be coded 0 . Rationale: Total minutes were 50 over the 7- day look- back period (10 \u00d7 5 = 50). Although a total of 50 minutes of respiratory therapy service s were provided over the 7- day look -back period, there were not any days that respiratory therapy was provided for 15 minutes or more. Therefore, O0400D equals zero days . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -30 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Psychological therapy services that were provided over th e 7-day look- back period: Psychological therapy services were not provided at all over the 7- day look -back period. Coding: O0400E1 would be coded 0, O0400E2 would be left blank . Rationale: There were no minutes or days of psychological therapy services provided over the 7- day look- back period. Recreational therapy services that were provided over the 7 -day look- back period: Recreational therapy services; Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday for 3 0-minute sessions each day. Coding: O0400F1 would be coded 90 , O0400F2 would be coded 3 . Rationale: Total minutes were 90 over the 7- day look- back period (30 \u00d7 3 = 90). Sessions provided were longer than 15 minutes each day, therefore each day recreation al therapy was performed can be counted. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -31 O0400: Therapies (cont.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH MDS Items October 2019 Page O -32 O0400: Therapies (cont.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -33 O0420: Distinct Calendar Days of Therap y Item Rationale To record the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes in the past 7 days. Coding Instructions: Enter the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Thera py, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes in the past 7 days. If a resident receives more than one therapy discipline on a given calendar day, this may only count for one calendar day for purposes of coding Item O0420. Consider the following examples : Example 1: Mrs. T. received 60 minutes of physical therapy on Monday, Wednesday and Friday within the 7 -day look- back period. Mrs. T also received 45 minutes of occupational therapy on Monday, Tuesday and Friday during the 7 -day look- back period. Given t he therapy services received by Mrs. T during the 7 -day look- back period, item O0420 would be coded as 4 because therapy services were provided for at least 15 minutes on 4 distinct calendar days during the 7 -day look- back period (i.e., Monday, Tuesday, We dnesday, and Friday). Example 2: Mr. F. received 120 minutes of physical therapy on Monday, Wednesday and Friday within the 7 -day look- back period. Mr. F also received 90 minutes of occupational therapy on Monday, Wednesday and Friday during the 7- day look- back period. Finally, Mr. F received 60 minutes of speech -language pathology services on Monday and Friday during the 7 -day look- back period. Given the therapy services received by Mr. F during the 7 -day look- back period, item O0420 would be coded as 3 because therapy services were provided for at least 15 minutes on 3 distinct calendar days during the 7- day look- back period (i.e., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -34 O0425: Part A Therapies Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining as much independence as possible in activities of daily living, mobility, and communication is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, breathing problems, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries , which contribute to diminished quality of life. The qualified therapist, in conjunction with the physician and nursing administration, is responsible for determining the necessity for, and the frequency and dur ation of, the therapy services provided to residents. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -35 O0425: Part A Therapies (cont.) Rehabilitation (i.e., via Speech- Language Pathology Services and Occupational and Physical Therapies) and respiratory, psychological, and recreational therapy can help residents to attain or maintain their highest level of well -being and improve their qual ity of life. Planning for Care Code only medically necessary therapies that occurred after admission/readmission to the nursing home that were (1) ordered by a physician (physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and/or clinical nurse specialist as allow able under state licensure laws ) based on a qualified therapist's assessment (i.e., one who meets Medicare requirements or, in some instances, under such a person's direct supervision) and treatment plan, (2) documented in the resident's medical record, and (3) care planned and periodically evaluated to ensure that the resident receives needed therapies and that current treatment plans are effective. Therapy treatment may occur either inside or outside of the facility. For definitions of the types of therapies listed in this section, please refer to the Glossary in Appendix A. Steps for Assessment 1. Complete only if A0310H (Is this a SNF Part A PPS Discharge Assessment?) = 1, Yes. 2. Review the resident's medical record (e.g., rehabilitation therapy evaluation and treatment records, recreation therapy notes, mental health professional progress notes), and consult with each of the qualified care providers to collect the information required for this item. NOTE: The look back for these items is the entire SNF Part A stay, starting at Day 1 of the Part A stay and finishing on the last day of the Part A stay. Once reported on the MDS, CMS grouping software will calculate the percentage of g roup and concurrent therapy, combined, provided to each resident as a percentage of all therapies provided to that resident, by discipline. If the combined amount of group and concurrent therapy provided, by discipline, exceeds 25 percent, then this would be deemed as non-compliance and a warning message would be received on the Final Validation Report. Providers should follow the steps outlined below for calculating compliance with the concurrent/group therapy limit : Step 1: Total Therapy Minutes, by disci pline (O0425X1 + O0425X2 + O0425X3) Step 2: Total Concurrent and Group Therapy Minutes, by discipline (O0425X2+O0425X3) Step 3: Concurrent/Group Ratio (Step 2 result/Step 1 result) Step 4: If Step 3 result is greater than 0.25, then the provider is non- compliant.

Enter 0 if none were provided. Concurrent therapy is defined as the treatment of 2 residents at the same time, when the residents are not performing the same or similar activities, regardless of payer source, both of whom must be in line -of-sight of the treating therapist or assistant for Medicare Part A. When a Part A resident receives therapy that meets this definition, it is defined as concurrent therapy for the Part A resident regardless of the payer source for the second resident . (For detailed definitions and examples of concurrent therapy , refer to i tem O0400 above. ) Group minutes \u2014Enter the total number of minutes of therapy that were provided in a group during the entire Part A stay (i.e., from the date in A2400B through the date in A2400C). Enter 0 if none were provided. Group therapy is defined for Part A as the treatment of two to six residents, regardless of payer source, who are performing the same or similar activities, and are supervised by a therapist or an assistant who is not supervising any other individuals. (For detailed definitions and examples of group therapy , refer to i tem O0400 above .) Co-treatment minutes \u2014Enter the total number of minut es each discipline of therapy was administered to the resident in co- treatment sessions during the entire Part A stay (i.e., from the date in A2400B through the date in A2400C).

Speech -Language Pathology Days \u2014Enter the number of days speech -language pathology therapy services were provided over the entire Part A stay (i.e., from the date in A2400B through the date in A2400C). A day of therapy is defined as skilled treatment for 15 minutes or more during the day. Use total minutes of therapy provided (individual plus c oncurrent plus group), without any adjustment, to determine if the day is counted. For example, if the resident received 20 minutes of concurrent therapy, the day requirement is considered met. Enter 0 if therapy was provided but for less than 15 minutes e very day during the stay. If the total number of minutes (individual plus concurrent plus group) during the stay is 0, skip this item and leave blank . Occupational Therapy Days \u2014Enter the number of days occupational therapy services were provided over the e ntire Part A stay (i.e., from the date in A2400B through the date in A2400C). A day of therapy is defined as skilled treatment for 15 minutes or more during the day. Use total minutes of therapy provided (individual plus concurrent plus group), without any adjustment, to determine if the day is counted. For example, if the resident received 20 minutes of concurrent therapy, the day requirement is considered met. Enter 0 if therapy was provided but for less than 15 minutes every day during the stay. If the t otal number of minutes (individual plus concurrent plus group) during the stay is 0, skip this item and leave blank .

Physical Therapy Days \u2014Enter the number of days physical therapy services were provided over the entire Part A stay (i.e., from the date in A2400B through the date in A2400C). A day of therapy is defined as skilled treatment for 15 minutes or more during the day. Use total minutes of therapy provided (individual plus concurrent plus group), without any adjustment, to determine if the day is counted. For example, if the resident received 20 minutes of concurrent therapy, the day requirement is considered met. Enter 0 if therapy w as provided but for less than 15 minutes every day during the stay. If the total number of minutes (individual plus concurrent plus group) during the stay is 0, skip this item and leave blank. Coding Tips and Special Populations For detailed descriptions of how to code minutes of therapy and explanation of skilled versus nonskilled therapy services, co -treatment, therapy aides and students, please refer to these topic headings in the discussion of item O0400 above. Modes of Therapy A resident may receive th erapy via different modes during the same day or even treatment session. These modes are individual, concurrent and group therapy. When developing the plan of care, the therapist and assistant must determine which mode(s) of therapy and the amount of time the resident receives for each mode and code the MDS appropriately . The therapist and assistant should document the reason a specific mode of therapy was chosen as well as anticipated goals for that mode of therapy. For any therapy that does not meet one of the therapy mode definitions below, those minutes may not be counted on the MDS. The therapy mode definitions must always be followed and apply regardless of when the therapy is provided in relationship to all assessment windows (i.e., applies whether or not the resident is in a look -back period for an MDS assessment).

General Coding Example: Following a bilateral knee replacement, Mrs. G. was admitted to the skilled nursing facility in stable condition for rehabilitation therapy on Sunday 10/06/19 under Part A skilled nursing facility coverage. While in the hos pital, she exhibited some short -term memory difficulties specifically affecting orientation. She was non- weig ht bearing, had reduced range of motion, and had difficulty with ADLs. She was referred to SLP, OT, and PT with the long- term goal of returning home with her husband. Her initial SLP evaluation was performed on 10/06/19, and the OT and PT initial evaluatio ns were done on 10/07/19. She was also referred to recreational therapy. She was in the SNF for 14 days and was discharged home on 10/19/2019. Mrs. G received the following rehabilitation services during her stay in the SNF. Speech -language pathology services that w ere provided over the SNF stay: Individual cognitive training; six sessions f or 45 minute s each day . Discharged from SLP services on 10/14/2019. Coding: O0425A1 would be coded 270 ; O0425A2 would be coded 0 ; O0425A3 would be coded 0 ; O0425A4 would be coded 0 ; O0425A5 would be coded 6 . Rationale: Individual minutes totaled 270 over the stay (45 minutes \u00d7 6 days) ; concurrent minutes totaled 0 over the stay (0 \u00d7 0 = 0); and group minutes totaled 0 over the stay (0 \u00d7 0 = 0). Therapy was provided 6 days of the stay . Occupational therapy services that were provided over the SNF stay: Individual ADL activities daily for 30 minutes each starting 10/ 08/19. Co-treatment: seating and transferring with PT; three sessions for the following times: 23 minut es, 18 minutes, and 12 minutes. Balance/coordination activities : 10 sessi ons for 20 minutes each session in a group. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -39 O0425: Part A Therapies (cont.) Discharged from OT services 10/19/19. Coding: O0425B1 would be coded 413 , O0425B2 would 0 , O0425B3 would be coded 200 , O0425B4 would be coded 53 , O0425B5 would be coded 12 . Rationale: Individual minutes (including 53 co- treatment minutes) totaled 413 over the stay [(30 \u00d7 12) + 53 = 413]; concurrent minutes totaled 0 over the stay (0 \u00d7 0 = 0); and group minutes totaled 200 over the stay (20 \u00d7 10 = 200). Therapy was provided 12 days of the stay. Physical therapy services that were provided over the stay: Individual mobility training daily for 45 minutes per session starting 10/ 07/19. Group mobility training for 30 minutes T uesdays, Wednesday s, and Fridays. Co-treatment seating and transferring for three sessions with OT for 7 minutes, 22 minutes , and 18 minutes. Concurre nt therapeutic exercises Monday -Friday for 20 minutes each day. Discharged from PT services on 10/19/19. Coding: O0425C1 would be coded 632 , O0425C2 would be coded 200 , O0425C3 would be coded 180 , O0425C4 would be coded 47 , O0425C5 would be coded 13 . Rationale: Individual minutes (including 47 co- treatment minutes) totaled 632 over stay [(45 \u00d7 13) + (7 + 22 + 18) = 632]; concurrent minutes totaled 200 over the stay (20 \u00d7 10 = 200); and group minutes totaled 180 over the stay (30 \u00d7 6 = 180). Therapy was provided 13 days of the stay. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -40 O0430: Distinct Calendar Days of Part A T herapy Item Rationale To record the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech- Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes during the Part A SNF stay. Coding Instructions: Enter the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech- Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes during the SNF Part A stay (i.e., from the date in A2400B through the date in A 2400C). If a resident receives more than one therapy discipline on a given calendar day, this may only count for one calendar day for purposes of coding i tem O0430. Consider the following example: Example: Mrs. T was admitted to the SNF on Sunday 10/ 06/18 and discharged on Saturday 10/26/18. She received 60 minutes of physical therapy every Monday, Wednesday , and Friday during the SNF stay. Mrs. T also received 45 minutes of occupational the rapy every Monday, Tuesday , and Friday during the stay. Given the t herapy services received by Mrs. T during the stay, item O0430 would be coded as 12 because therapy services were provided for at least 15 minutes on 12 distinct calendar days during the stay (i.e., every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -41 O0450: Resumption of Therapy CMS does not require completion of this item; however, some States continue to require its completion. It is important to know your State's requirements for completing this item. Item Rationale In cases where therapy resumes after the EOT OMRA is performed and the resumption of therapy date is no more than 5 consecutive calendar days after the last day of therapy provided, and the therapy services have resumed at the same RUG -IV classification level that had been in effect pr ior to the EOT OMRA, an End of Therapy OMRA with Resumption (EOT -R) may be completed. The EOT -R reduces the number of assessments that need to be completed and reduces the number of interview items residents must answer. Coding Instructions: When an EOT OM RA has been performed, determine whether therapy will resume. If it will, determine whether therapy will resume no more than five consecutive calendar days after the last day of therapy was provided AND whether the therapy services will resume at the same level for each discipline. If No, skip to O0500, Restorative Nursing Programs. If Yes, code item O0450A as 1. For example: Mrs. A. who was in RVL did not receive therapy on Saturday and Sunday because the facility did not provide weekend services and she m issed therapy on Monday because of a doctor's appointment. She resumed therapy on Tuesday, November 13, 2011. The IDT determined that her RUG -IV therapy classification level did not change as she had not had any significant clinical changes during the laps ed therapy days. When the EOT was filled out, item O0450 A was coded as 1 because therapy was resuming within 5 days from the last day of therapy and it was resuming at the same RUG -IV classification level. NOTE: If the EOT OMRA has not been accepted in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System ( QIES ) Assessment Submission and Processing ( ASAP ) system when therapy resumes, code the EOT -R item (O0450A) on the assessment and submit the record. If the EOT OM RA without the EOT -R item ha s been accepted into the QIES ASAP system, then submit a modification request for that EOT OMRA with the only changes being the completion of the Resumption of Therapy item (O0450A) and check X0900Z and indicate that the reason for modification is the addition of the Resumption of Therapy item . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -42 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining independence in activities of daily living and mobility is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries . Planning for Care Restorative nursing program refers to nursing interventions that promote the resident's ability to adapt and adjust to living as independently and safely as possible. This concept actively focuses on achieving and maintaining optimal physical, mental, and psychosocial functioning. A resident may be started on a restorative nur sing program when he or she is admitted to the facility with restorative needs, but is not a candidate for formalized rehabilitation therapy, or when restorative needs arise during the course of a longer -term stay, or in conjunction with formalized rehabil itation therapy. Generally, restorative nursing programs are initiated when a resident is discharged from formalized physical, occupational, or speech rehabilitation therapy. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -43 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the restorative nursing program notes and/or flow sheets in the medical record. 2. For the 7- day look- back period, enter the number of days on which the technique, training or skill practice was performed for a total of at least 15 minutes during the 24 -hour period. 3. The following criteria for restorative nursing programs must be met in order to code O0500: Measureable objective and interventions must be documented in the care plan and in the medical record. If a restorative nursing program is in place when a care plan is being revised, it is appropriate to reassess progress, goals, and duration/frequency as part of the care planning process. Good clinical practice would indicate that the results of this reassessment should be documented in the resident' s medical record. Evidence of periodic evaluation by the licensed nurse must be present in the resident's medical record. When not contraindicated by state practice act provisions, a progress note written by the restorative aide and countersigned by a lice nsed nurse is sufficient to document the restorative nursing program once the purpose and objectives of treatment have been established. Nursing assistants/aides must be trained in the techniques that promote resident involvement in the activity. A regist ered nurse or a licensed practical (vocational) nurse must supervise the activities in a restorative nursing program. Sometimes, under licensed nurse supervision, other staff and volunteers will be assigned to work with specific residents. Restorative nurs ing does not require a physician's order. Nursing homes may elect to have licensed rehabilitation professionals perform repetitive exercises and other maintenance treatments or to supervise aides performing these maintenance services. In situations where s uch services do not actually require the involvement of a qualified therapist, the services may not be coded as therapy in item O0400, Therapies or O0425, Part A Therapies , because the specific interventions are considered restorative nursing services (see item O0400, Therapies and O0425, Part A Therapies ). The therapist's time actually providing the maintenance service can be included when counting restorative nursing minutes. Although therapists may participate, members of the nursing staff are still resp onsible for overall coordination and supervision of restorative nursing programs. This category does not include groups with more than four residents per supervising helper or caregiver. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -44 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Coding Instructions This item does not include procedures or techniques carried out by or under the direction of qualified therapists , as identified in Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services i tem O0400A or O0425A , Occupational Therapy item O0400B or and Physical Therapy item O0400C or . The time provided for i tems O0500A -J must be coded separately, in time blocks of 15 minutes or more . For example, to check Technique \u2014Range of Motion [Passive] item O0500A, 15 or more minutes of passive range of motio n (PROM) must have been provided during a 24- hour period in the last 7 days. The 15 minutes of time in a day may be totaled across 24 hours (e.g., 10 minutes on the day shift plus 5 minutes on the evening shift). However, 15- minute time increments cannot b e obtained by combining 5 minutes of Technique \u2014Range of Motion [Passive] item O0500A, 5 minutes of Technique \u2014 Range of Motion [Active] item O0500B, and 5 minutes of Splint or Brace Assistance item O0500C , over 2 days in the last 7 days. Review for each activity throughout the 24- hour period. Enter 0 , if none. Technique Activities provide d by restorative nursing staff. O0500A, Range of Motion (Passive) Code provision of passive movements in order to maintain flexibility and useful motion in the joints of the body. These exercises must be individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500B, Range of Motion (Active) Code exercises performed by the resident, with cu eing, supervision, or physical assist by staff that are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. Include active ROM and active- assisted ROM. O0500C, Splint or Brace Assistance Code provision of ( 1) verbal and physical guidance and direction that teaches the resident how to apply, manipulate , and care for a brace or splint ; or (2) a scheduled program of applying and removing a splint or brace. These sessions are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -45 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Training and Skill Practice Activities including repetition, physical or verbal cueing, an d/or task segmentation provided by any staff member under the supervision of a licensed nurse . O0500D, Bed Mobility Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in moving to and from a lying position, turning side to side and positioning him self or herself in bed. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500E, Transfer Code activities provided to improve or maintain the re sident's self -performance in moving between surfaces or planes either with or without assistive devices. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500F, Walking Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in walking , with or without assistive devices . These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500G, Dressing and/or Grooming Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in dressing and undressing, bathing and washing, and performing other personal hygiene tasks. These activities are individu alized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500H, Eating and/or Swallowing Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in feeding oneself food and fluids, or activities used to improve or maintain the resident's ability to ingest nutrition and hydration by mouth. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500I, Amputation/ Prosthesis Care Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in putting on and removing a prosthesis, caring for the prosthesis , and providing appropriate hygiene at the site where the prosthesis attaches to the body (e.g., leg stump or eye socket). Dentures are not considered to be prostheses for coding this item. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -46 O0500: Res torative Nursing Programs (cont.) O0500J, Communication Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in functional communication skills or assisting the resident in using residual communication skills and adaptive devices. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. Coding Tips and Special Populations For range of m otion (passive): the careg iver moves the body part around a fixed point or joint through the resident's available range of motion. The resident provides no assistance. For r ange of m otion ( active): a ny participation by the resident in the ROM activity should be coded here. For both a ctive and passive r ange of motion: movement by a resident that is incidental to dressing, bathing, etc., does not count as part of a formal restorative nursing program. For inclusion in this section, active or passive range of motion must be a component of an individualized program that is planned, monitored evaluat ed, and documented in the resident's medical record. Range of motion should be delivered by staff who are trained in the procedures. For splint or brace a ssistance: a ssess the resident' s skin and circulation under the device, and reposition the limb in correct alignment. The use of c ontinuous passive m otion (CPM) devices in a restorative nursing program is coded when the following criteria are met: ( 1) ordered by a physician, ( 2) nursing staff have been trained in technique (e.g., properly aligning resident's limb in device, adjusting available range of motion), and ( 3) monitoring of the device. Nursing staff should document the application of the device and the effects on the resident. D o not include the time the resident is receiving treatment in the device. Include only the actual time staff were engaged in apply ing and monitoring the device. Remember that persons with dementia learn skills best through repetition that occurs multiple times per day. Grooming programs, including programs to help residents learn to apply make -up, may be considered restorative nursing programs when conducted by a member of the activity staff. These grooming programs would need to be individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -47 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Examples 1. Mr. V. has lost range of motion in his right arm, wrist, and hand due to a cerebrovascular accident (CVA ) experienced several years ago. He has moderate to severe loss of cognitive decision -making skills and memory. To avoid further ROM loss and contractures to his right arm, the occupational therapist fabricated a right resting hand splint and instructions for its application and removal. The nursing coordinator developed instructions for providing passive range of motion exercises to his right arm, wrist, and hand three times per day. The nurse's aides and Mr. V.'s wife have been instructed in how and when to apply and remove the hand splint and how to do the passive ROM exercises. These plans are documented in Mr. V.'s care plan. The total amount of time involved each day in removing and applying the hand splint and completing the ROM exercises is 30 minute s (15 minutes to perform ROM exercises and 15 minutes to apply/remove the splint). The nurs e's aides report that there is less resistance in Mr. V.'s affected extremity when bathing and dressing him. Coding: Both Splint or Brace Assistance item ( O0500C ), and Range of Motion (Passive) item ( O0500A ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days these re storative nursing techniques were provided. 2. Mrs. R.'s right shoulder ROM has decreased slightly over the past week. Upon examination and X -ray, her physician diagnosed her with right shoulder impingement syndrome. Mrs. R . was given exercises to perform on a daily basis to help improve her right shoulder ROM. After initial training in these exercises by the physical therapist, Mrs. R . and the nursing staff were provided with instructions on how to cue and sometimes actively assist Mrs. R . when she cannot make the full ROM required by the exercises on her own. Her exercises are to be performed for 15 minutes , two times per day at change of shift in the morning and afternoon. This information is documented in Mrs. R .'s medical record. The nursing staff cued and sometimes actively assisted Mrs. R . two times daily over the past 7 days. Coding: Range of motion (active ) item ( O0500B ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days restorative nursing t raining and skill practice for a ctive ROM were provided. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -48 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) 3. Mrs. K . was admitted to the nursing facility 7 days ago following repair to a fractured hip. Physical therapy was delayed due to complications and a weakened condition. Upon admission, she had difficulty moving herself in bed and required total assistance for transfers. To prevent further deterioration and increase her independence, the nursing staff implemented a plan on the second day following admission to teach her how to move herself in bed and transfer from bed to chair using a trapeze, the bed rails, and a transfer board. The plan was documented in Mrs. K .'s medical record and communicated to all staff at the change of shift. The charge nurse documented in the nurse 's notes that in the 5 days Mrs. K . has been receiving training and skill practice for bed mobility for 20 minutes a day and transferr ing for 25 minutes a day , her endurance and strength have improved , and she requires only extensive assistance for t ransferring. Each day the amount of time to provide this nursing re storative intervention has been decreasing , so that for the past 5 days, the average time is 45 minutes. Coding: Both Bed Mobility item ( O0500D ), Transfer O0500E ), would 5 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days that restorative nursing training and skill practice for bed mobility and transfer w ere provided. 4. Mrs. D. is receiving training and skill practice in walking using a quad cane. Together, Mrs. D. and the nursing staff have set progressive walking distance goals. The nursing staff has received instruction on how to provide Mrs. D . with the ins truction and guidance she needs to achieve the goals. She has three scheduled times each day where she learns how to walk with her quad cane. Each teaching and practice episode for walking, supervised by a nursing assistant, takes approximately 15 minutes. Coding: Walking item ( O0500F ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days that restorative nursing skill a nd practice training for walking was provided. 5. Mrs. J . had a CV A less than a year ago resulting in left -sided hemiplegia. Mrs. J . has a strong desire to participate in her own care. Although she cannot dress herself independently, she is capable of participating in this activity of daily living. Mrs. J .'s ove rall care plan goal is to maximize her independence in ADLs. A plan, documented on the care plan, has been developed to assist Mrs. J . in how to maintain the ability to put on and take off her blouse with no physical assistance from the staff. All of her b louses have been adapted for front closure with hook and loop fasteners . The nursing assistants have been instructed in how to verbally guide Mrs. J . as she puts on and takes off her blouse to enhance her efficiency and maintain her level of function . It takes approximately 20 minutes per day for Mrs. J . to complete this task (dressing and undressing). Coding: Dressing or G rooming item ( O0500G ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days that restorative nursing training and skill practice for dressing and grooming w ere provided. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -49 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) 6. Mr. W .'s cognitive status has been deteriorating progressively over the past several months. Despite deliberate nursing restoration attempts to promote his independence in feeding himself, he will not eat unless he is fed. Coding: Eating and/or Swallowing item ( O0500H ), would be coded 0 . Rationale: Because restorative nursing skill and practice training for eating and/or swallowing were not provided over the last 7 days. 7. Mrs. E. has A myotrophic Lateral S clerosis. She no longer has the ability to speak or even to nod her head \"yes\" or \"no.\" Her cognitive skills remain intact, she can spell, and she can move her eyes in all directions. The speech -language pathol ogist taught both Mrs. E . and the nursing staff to use a communication board so that Mrs. E . could communicate with staff. The communication board has been in use over the past 2 weeks and has proven very successful. The nursing staff, volunteers , and fami ly members are reminded by a sign over Mrs. E .'s bed that they are to provide her with the board to enable her to communicate with them. This is also documented in Mrs. E .'s care plan. Because the teaching and practice using the communication board had bee n completed 2 weeks ago and Mrs. E . is able to use the board to communicate successfully, she no longer receives skill and practice training in communication. Coding: Communication item ( O0500J ), would be coded 0 . Rationale: Because the resident has mastered the skill of communication , restorative nursing skill and practice training for communication was no longer needed or provided over the last 7 days. O0600: Physician Examinations CMS does not require completion of this item; however, some States continue to require its completion. It is important to know your State's requirements for completing this item. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Health status that requires frequent physician examinations can adversely af fect an individual's sense of well -being and functional status and can limit social activities. Planning for Care Frequency of physician examinations can be an indication of medical complexity and stability of the resident's health status. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -50 O0600: Physician Examinations (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the physician progress notes for evidence of examinations of the resident by the physician o r other authorized practitioners. Coding Instructions Record the number of days that physician progress notes reflect that a physician examined the resident (or since admis sion if less than 14 days ago). If the State does not require the completion of this item, use the standard \"no information\" code (a dash, \" -\"). Coding Tips and Special Populations Includes medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, podiatrists, dentists , and authorized physician assistants, nurse practitioners , or clinical nurse specialists working in collaboration with the physician as allowable by state law . Examin ation (partial or full) can occur in the facility or in the physician's office. Included in this item are telehealth visits as long as the requirements are met for physician/practitioner type as defined above and whether it qualifies as a telehealth billab le visit. For eligibility requirements and additional information about Medicare telehealth services refer to: \u2014 Chapter 15 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (Pub. 100- 2) and Chapter 12 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual (Pub. 100- 4) may be access ed at: http://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet -Only - Manuals -IOMs.html . Do not include physician examinations that occurred prior to admission or readmission to the facility (e.g., during the resident's acute care stay ). Do not include physician examinations that occurred during an emergency room visit or hospital observation stay. If a resident is evaluated by a physician off -site (e.g., while undergoing dialysis or radiation therapy), it can be coded as a physician examination as long as documentation of the physician's evaluation is included in the medical record. The physic ian's evaluation can include partial or complete examination of the resident, monitoring the resident for response to the treatment, or adjusting the treatment as a result of the examination. Psychological therapy visits by a licensed psychologist (PhD) should be recorded in O0400E, Psychological Therapy, and should not be included as a physician visit in this section. Does not include visits made by Medicine Men. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -51 O0700: Physician Orders CMS does not require completion of this item; however, some States continue to require its completion. It is important to know your State's requirements for completing this item. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Health status that requires frequent physician order changes can adversely affect an individual's sense of well -being and functional status and can limit social activities. Planning for Care Frequency of physician order changes can be an indication of medical complexity and stabilit y of the resident's health status. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the physician or der sheets in the medical record. 2. Determine the number of days during the 14 -day look -back period that a physici an or other authorized practitioner allowable by State law change d the resident's orders. Coding Instructions Enter the number of days during 14- day look- back period (or since admission, if less than 14 days ago) in which a physician changed the resident's orders. If the State does not require the completion of this ite m, use the standard \"no information\" code (a dash, \" -\"). Coding Tips and Special Populations Includes orders written by medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, podiatrists, dentists , and physician assistants, nurse practitioners , clinical nurse specialists , qualified dietitians, clinically qualified nutrition professionals or qualified therapists, working in collaboration with the physician as allowable by state law . Includes written, telephone, fax, or consultation orders for new or altered treatment. Does not include standard admission orders, return admission orders, renewal orders, or clarifying orders without changes. Orders written on the day of admission as a result for an unexpected change/deterioration in condition or injury are considered as new or altered treatment orders and should be counted as a day with order changes. The prohibition against counting standard admission or readmission orders applies regardless of whether or not the orders are given at one time or are received at different times on the date of admission or readmission. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -52 O0700: Physician Orders (cont.) Do not count orders prior to the date of admission or re -entry. A sliding scale dosage schedule that is written to cover different dosages depending on lab values, does not count as an order change simply because a different dose is administered based on the sliding scale guidelines. When a PRN (as needed) order was already on file, the potential need for the service had already been identified. Notification of the physician that the PRN order was activated does not constitute a new or changed order and may not be counted when coding this item. A Medicare Certification/Recertification is a renewal of an existing order and should not be included when coding this item. If a resident has multiple physicians (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, internal medicine), and they all visit and write orders on the same day, the MDS must be coded as 1 day during which a physician visited, and 1 day in which orders were changed. Orders requesting a consultation by another physician may be counted. However, the order must be reasonable (e.g., f or a new or altered treatment). An order written on the last day of the MDS observation period for a consultation planned 3- 6 months in the futur e should be carefully reviewed. Orders written to increase the resident's RUG classification and facility payment are not acceptable. Orders for transfer of care to another physician may not be counted. Do not count orders written by a pharmacist. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ V] October 2019 Page V-2 V0100: Items From the Most Recent Prior OBRA or PPS Assessment Item Rationale The items in V0100 are used to determine whether to trigger several of the CAAs that compare a resident's current status with their prior status. The values of these items are derived from a prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment that was performed since the most recent admission of any kind (i.e., since the most recent entry or reentry), if one is available. I tems V0100A, B, C, D, E and F are skipped on the first assessment (OBRA or PPS) following the m ost recent admission of any kind (i.e., when A0310E = 1, Yes ). Complete these items only if a prior assessment has been completed since the most recent admission of any kind to the facility (i.e., when A0310E = 0, No) and if the prior assessment is an OBRA or a scheduled PPS assessment . If such an assessment is available, the values of V0100A, B, C, D, E, and F should be copied from the corresponding items on that prior assessment. Coding Instructions for V0100A , Prior Assessment Federal OBRA Reason for Assessment (A0310A Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100A the value for A0310A (Federal OBRA Reason for Assessment) from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment , if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details). One of t he available values (01 through 06 or 99) must be selected. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ V] October 2019 Page V-3 V0100: Items From the Most Recent Prior OBRA or PPS Assessment (cont.) Coding Instructions for V0100B, Prior Assessment PPS Reason for Assessment (A0310B Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100B the value for A0310B (PPS Assessment) from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment, if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details). One of the available values (01 or 08 or 99) must be selected. Note: The val ues for V0100A and V0100B cannot both be 99, indicating that the prior assessment is neither an OBRA nor a PPS assessment. If the value of V0100A is 99 ( None of the above ), then the value for V0100B must be 01 or 0 8, indicating a PPS assessment. If the val ue of V0100B is 99 ( None of the above), then the value for V0100A must be 01 through 06, indicating a n OBRA assessment. Coding Instructions for V0100C, Prior Assessment Reference Date (A2300 Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100C the value of A2300 (Assessment Reference Date) from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment, if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details). Coding Instructions for V0100D , Prior Assessment Brief Interview fo r Mental Status (BIMS) Summary Score (C0500 Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100D, the value for C0500 Mental Status (BIMS ) Summary Score from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment, if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details). This item will be compared with the corresponding item on the current assessment to evaluate resident improvement or decline in the Delirium care area. Coding Instructions for V0100E, Prior Assessment Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) Total S everity Score (D0300 Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100E the value of D0300 (Resident Mood Interview [ PHQ- 9\u00a9] Total Severity Score) from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment, if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details). This item will be compared with the corresponding item on the current assessment to evaluate resident decline in the Mood State care area. Coding Instructions for V0100F, Prior Assessment Staff Assessment of Resident Mood (PHQ -9-OV\u00a9) Total Severity Score (D0600 Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100F the value for item D0600 (Staff Assessment of Resident Mood [ PHQ- 9-OV\u00a9] Total Severity Score) from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment, if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details). This item will be compared with the corresponding item on the current assessment to evaluate resident decline in the Mood State care area. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [X] October 2019 Page X -1 SECTION X : CORRECTION REQUEST Intent: The purpose of Section X is to identify an MDS record to be modified or inactivated. The following items identify the existing assessment record that is in error. Section X is only completed if Item A0050, Type of Record, is coded a 2 (Modify existing record) or a 3 (Inactivate existing record). In Section X, the facility must reproduce the information EXACTLY as it appeared on the existing erroneous record, even if the information is incorrect. This information is necessary to locate the existing record in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system. A modification request is used to correct a QIES ASAP record containing incorrect MDS item values due to: transcription errors, data entry errors, softwar e product errors, item coding errors, and/or other error requiring modification The modification request record contains correct values for all MDS items (not just the values previously in error), including the Section X items. The corrected record will re place the prior erroneous record in the QIES ASAP system . In some cases, an incorrect MDS record requires a completely new assessment of the resident in addition to a modification request for that incorrect record. Please refer to Chapter 5 of this manual, Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments, to determine if a new assessment is required in addition to a modification request. An inactivation request is used to move an existing record in the QIES ASAP system from the active file to an archive (hi story file) so that it will not be used for reporting purposes. Inactivations should be used when the event did not occur (e.g., a discharge was submitted when the resident was not discharged). The inactivation request only includes Item A0050 and the Section X items. All other MDS sections are skipped. The modification and inactivation processes are automated and neither completely removes the prior erroneous record from the QIES ASAP system . The erroneous record is archived in a history file. In certain c ases, it is necessary to delete a record and not retain any information about the record in the QIES ASAP system . This requires a request from the facility to the facility's state agency to manually delete all traces of a record from the QIES ASAP system . The policy and procedures for a Manual Correction/Deletion Request are provided in Chapter 5 of this M anual. A Manual Deletion Request is required only in the following three cases: 1. Item A0410 Submission Requirement is incorrect. Submission of MDS assessme nt records to the QIES ASAP system constitutes a release of private information and must conform to privacy laws. Only records required by the State and/or the Federal governments may be stored in the QIES ASAP system . If a record has been submitted with the incorrect Submission Requirement value in Item A0410, then that record must be manually deleted and, in some cases, a new record with a corrected A0410 value submitted. Item A0410 cannot be corrected by modification or inactivation. See Chapter 5 of thi s Manual for details. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [X] October 2019 Page X -2 2. Inappropriate submission of a test record as a production record. Removal of a test record from the QIES ASAP system requires manual deletion. Otherwise information for a \"bogus\" resident will be retained in the database and this resident will appear on some reports to the facility. 3. Record was submitted for the wrong facility. If a record was submitted to the QIES ASAP system for an incorrect facility, the record must be removed manually and then a new record for the correct facility must be submitted to the QIES ASAP system . Manual deletion of the record for the wrong facility is necessary to ensure that the resident i s not associated with that facility and does not appear on reports to that facility.

Z0400: Signatu res of Persons Completing the Assessment or Entry/Death Reporting Item Rationale To obtain the signature of all persons who com pleted any part of the MDS. Legally, it is an attestati on of accuracy with the p rimary responsibility for its accuracy with the person selecting the MDS item response. Each person completing a section or portion of a section of the MDS is required to sign the Atte station St atement. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH MDS Items [Z] October 2019 Page Z-5 Z0400: Signatu res of Persons Completing the Assessment (cont.) The importance of accurately completing and submitting the MDS cannot be over - emphasized . The MDS is the basis for: \u2014 the development of an indi vidualized care p lan; \u2014 the Med icare Prospecti ve Pay ment System \u2014 Medicaid reimburse ment progra ms \u2014 quality monitoring activities, such as the quality measure reports \u2014 the data- driven survey a nd certificatio n process \u2014 the quality measures used for public reporting \u2014 research and policy developm ent. Coding Instructions All staff who com pleted any part of the MDS m ust enter their signat ures, titles, sections or portion(s) of section(s) they completed, and the date co mpleted. If a staff m ember cannot sign Z0400 on the sa me day that he or she completed a section or portion of a section, when the staff m ember signs, use the date the item originally w as completed. Read the Attestation State ment carefully. You are certifying that the infor mation you entered on the MDS, to the best of your knowle dge, m ost accu rately reflects t he residen t's status. Penalties m ay be applied for s ubmitting fals e infor mation. Coding Tips and Special Populations Two or m ore staff m embers can co mplete items within the same secti on of the MDS. When filling in the infor mation for Z0400, any staff m ember who has completed a s ub- set of items within a section should identify which item(s) he/she completed within that section. Nursing hom es may use electronic signatures for medical record docu mentation, inclu ding the MDS, when permitted to do so by state and local law and when author ized by the nursing hom e's policy. Nursing hom es must have written poli cies in place that meet any and all s tate and federal privacy and security require ments to ensure proper security m easures to protect the use of an electronic signature by anyone other than the person to w hom the electronic signature belongs. Although the use of electronic signatures for the MDS does not require that the entire record be maint ained electronically, most facilities have th e option to m aintain a resident's record by comput er rather than hard copy. Whenever copies of the MDS are printed and dates are automatically encoded, be sure to note that it is a \"copy\" docu ment and not the original. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Z] October 2019 Page Z-6 Z0400: Signatu res of Persons Completing the Assessment (cont.) If an indivi dual who com pleted a portion of the MDS is not avai lable to sign it (e.g., in situations in which a s taff member is no longer e mployed by the facility and left MDS sections completed but not signed for), there are portions of the MDS that may be verified with the medical record and/or resident/staff/family inte rview as appropr iate. For these se ctions, the person sig ning the a ttestation m ust review t he information t o assure accuracy and sign for those portions on t he date the review was conduc ted. For sec tions requiring reside nt inter views, the person signing t he attestation for completion of that section should i nterview the r esident to ensure the accur acy of information and sign on the da te this verification occur red. Z0500: Signature of RN Ass essme nt Coor dinator Verifying Assessment Comp letion Item Rationale Federal regulation requ ires the RN assessm ent coordina tor to sign and thereby cer tify that the assessment is complete. Step s for Asses sment 1. Verify that a ll items on this ass essment are complete. 2. Verify that Item Z0400 ( Signature of Persons Completing the Assessm ent) cont ains attestation f or all MDS sec tions. Coding Instructions For Z0500B, use the actual date that the MDS was completed, reviewed, and signed as complete by the RN assessment coordinator. This date must be equal to the latest date at Z0400 or later than the date(s) at Z0400, which documents when portions of the assessment information were compl eted by assessment team members . If for some reason the MDS cannot be signed by the RN assessment coordinator on the date it is completed, the RN assessment coordinator should use the actual date that it is signed. Coding Tips The RN asses sment coo rdinat or is not certifying the accur acy of portions of the assessm ent that were c ompleted by other health professiona ls. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Z] October 2019 Page Z-7 Z0500: Signature of RN Ass essme nt Coor dinator Verifying Assessment Comp letion Nursing hom es may use elec or medical ding the MDS, when per mitted to do so by state and local law and when authori zed by the nur sing home's policy. Nur sing homes must have wr itten poli cies in place that meet any and al l state and f ederal priv acy and secur ity requi rements to ensure proper security measures t o prote ct the use of an electro nic signat ure by anyone othe r than the person to w hom the electr onic sig nature belongs. Although t he use of electronic sign atures for the MDS does not requ ire that the ent ire record be maintained electronically, most facilities have t he option to m aintain a resident's record by computer rather than hard copy. Whenever copies of the MDS are pr inted and dates are a utomatically encoded, be sure to note that it is a \"c opy\" docu ment and not the ori ginal.

When hese evidenc e-based resour pr oblem solving and deci sion m aking (of ten cal led \"critical t hinking \") sk ills is im perative. By statu te, the RAI must be co mpleted within 14 days of admission. As an integral part of the RAI, C AAs m ust be co mpleted and docu mented within t he same time frame. While a workup cannot a lways be co mpleted within 14 days, it is expected that nur sing hom es will a ssess r esident needs, plan care and implement int erventions in a ti mely m anner. CAAs a re not required for Medica re PPS assessments. They a re required only for OBRA comp rehensive ass essments (A dmission, Annual, Signi in Statu s, or Significa nt Cor rection of a Prior Comp rehens ive). How ever, when a Medica re PPS assessm ent is combined with an O BRA comp rehensive a ssessme nt, the CAAs must be comple ted in order to meet the requirements of the OBRA comp rehensive ass essment. 4.4 What Does the CAA Process Involve? Facilities use the f inding s from the c omprehens ive assess ment to deve lop an indi viduali zed car e plan to m eet each r esident's needs ( 42 CFR 483.20( d)). The CAA process discus sed in this manual ref ers to ide ntifying and cl arifying ar eas of concern t hat ar e triggered based on how speci fic MDS items are coded on the MDS. The process f ocuses on eval uating these t rigge red care a reas us ing the CAAs, but does not provi de exact d etail on how to se lect p ertinent interventions for care pl anning.

Care Area Trigge rs (CATs) iden tify condi tions t hat m ay require further evalu ation because they may have an impact on speci fic issues and/or conditions, or t he risk of issues and/or conditions for the re sident. Each t riggered i tem must be ass essed f urther through t he use of the CAA process to facilitate care plan d ecision m aking, but it m ay or may not repre sent a condi tion that should or will be ad dressed in the care plan. The signi ficance and cau ses of any given t rigger may vary f or different res idents or in different si tuations f or the sam e resident. Di fferent C ATs may have common causes, or va rious ite ms associ ated wi th sever al CATs may be connected. CATs provide a \" flag\" f or the IDT members, indicating that the triggered care a rea n eeds to be assessed m ore co mplete ly prior to m aking c are planning de cisions. Furt her ass essment of a triggered c are area may identi fy cau ses, risk f actors, and com plications associated wi th the c are area con dition. The plan of care then address es these f actors with the go al of promoting the resident 's highest pr acticable l evel of functioning : (1) i mprove ment where possibl e or (2) mainten ance and pre vention of avoidable decl ines. A risk f actor increases the chances of having a n egative o utcome or com plication. For exam ple, impaired bed mobility may increase the r isk of getting a pr essure u lcer/injury . In this e xample, impaired bed m obility is the risk f actor, unre lieved press ure is t he ef fect of the co mpromised bed mobilit y, and the pote ntial pressure ulce r is the complication. A care ar ea issue/con dition (e.g., f alls) may result f rom a single unde rlying cause ( e.g., administra tion of a new medication t hat cau ses dizzines s) or f rom a com bination of multiple factors ( e.g., new medication, r esident f orgot wa lker, bed too high or too l ow, etc.). There can also be a s ingle cau se of multiple triggers and i mpairments. For exa mple, hypothyroi dism is an exam ple of a co mmon, potent ially reversi ble m edical condi tion that c an have dive rse physic al, functional, a nd psychos ocial complications. Thus, if a resi dent has hypot hyroidis m, it is possi ble that the M DS might trigger any or s everal of the following CAAs depending on whe ther or not the hypoth yroidism B Symptoms (#10), #19). Even if the MDS does not t rigger a particular care area, the f acility can use the CAA process and resour ces at any ti me to f urther assess the r esident. Recognizing the conne ction among t hese sy mptom s and treat ing the unde rlying caus e(s) to the extent p ossible, can h elp address com plica tions and i mprove the re sident's outcom e.

Nutritional Status Undernutr ition is not a response to nor mal aging, but it can ar ise from many diverse causes, o ften acting toge ther. It may cause or r eflect acute or c hronic illne ss, and it represents a risk factor f or subsequent decli ne. The Nutri tional St atus CAA process re flects the need f or an i n-depth a nalysis of residents with impaired nut rition and t hose who are at nu tritional risk. T his CAA trigge rs when a res ident ha s or is at risk for a nut rition issue /condition. Som e residents w ho are t riggered for follow -up will already be s ignificantly underweight and thus undernour ished, while oth er residents w ill be at risk of unde rnutrition. This CAA may also t rigger based on los s of appeti te with li ttle or no accompanying weight l oss and despite the ab sence of obvious, outward s igns of impaired nutrition.

Feeding Tubes This CAA focuses on t he long -term (greater than 1 month) use of feeding tubes. It is important to balance the bene fits and risks of feeding tubes in individual re sidents in de ciding whe ther to make such an int ervention a part of the plan of care. In som e acute and longer t erm situations, feeding tube s may provide adequa te nutrition that cannot be obtained by other m eans. In other circu mstances, feeding t ubes m ay not enhance s urviva l or i mprove qua lity of life, e.g., in individuals with advanc ed de mentia. Also, f eeding tubes can be associ ated with div erse complications that m ay further i mpair qua lity of life or adv ersely i mpact surviv al. For exam ple, tube f eedin gs will not pr event as piration of gastric contents or oral s ecretions and f eeding tubes may irrita te or per forate the sto mach or in testines. When this CAA is trigg ered, nur sing hom e staff should f ollow their f acility's cho sen protoc ol or policy f or performing the CAA.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 1 CHAPTER 5: SUBMISSIO N AND CORRECTION OF THE MDS ASSESSMENTS Nursing homes are required to submit Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) required Minimum Data Set (MDS) records for all residents in Medicare - or Medicaid -certified beds regardless of the pay source. Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and hospitals with a swing bed agreement (swing beds) are required to transmit additional MDS assessments for all Medicare beneficiaries in a Part A stay reimbursable u nder the SNF Prospective Payment System (PPS). 5.1 Transmitting MDS Data All Medicare and/or Medicaid -certified nursing homes and swing beds, or agents of those facilities, must transmit required MDS data records to CMS' Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system. Required MDS records are those assessments and tracking records that are mandated under OBRA and SNF PPS. Providers will submit the Optional State Assessment (OSA) records to the QIES ASAP system just as they submit all other MDS assessments. The OSA is not a Federally required assessment. Each State will determine if the OSA is required and when this assessment must be completed. Assessments that are completed for purposes other than OBRA and SNF PPS reasons are not to be submitted, e.g., private insurance, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage Plans. After completion of the required assessment and/or tracking records, each provider must create electronic transmission files that mee t the requirements detailed in the current MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specifications a vailable on the CMS -Assessment The provider indicates the certification or licensure of the unit on which the resident resides in item A0410, Unit Certification or Licensure Designation. In addition to reflecting certification or licensure of the unit, this item indicates the sub mission authority for a record. Value = 1 Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified and MDS data is not required by the State. Value = 2 Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State . Value = 3 Unit is Med icare and/or Medicaid certified. See Chapter 3 for details concerning the coding of item A0410, Unit Certification or Licensure Designation. Note: CMS certified Swing Bed unit assessments are always Value 3, Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified. Providers must establish communication with the QIES ASAP system in order to submit a file. This is accomplished by using specialized communications software and hardware and the CMS wide area network. Details about these processes are available on the QIES Technical Support Office (QTSO) website at: https://qtso.cms.gov/ . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 2 Once communication is established with the QIES ASAP system, the provider can access the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page in the MDS system. This site allows providers to subm it MDS assessment data and access various information sources such as Bulletins and Questions and Answers. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 Provider User's Guide provides more detailed information about the MDS system. It is available on the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page and on the QTSO MDS 3.0 we bsite at https://qtso.cms.gov/providers/nur sing- home -mdsswing- bed-providers/reference- manuals . When the transmission file is received by the QIES ASAP system, the system performs a series of validation edits to evaluate whether or not the data submitted meet the required standards. MDS records are edited to verify that clinical responses are within valid ranges and are consistent, dates are reasonable, and records are in the proper order with regard to records that were previously accepted by the QIES ASAP system for the same resident. The provider is notified of the results of this evaluation by err or and warning messages on a Final Validation Report. All error and warning messages are detailed and explained in Section 5 of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 Provider User's Guide . 5.2 Timeliness Criteria In accordance with the requirements at 42 CFR \u00a7483.20(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3), long -term care facilities participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs must meet the following conditions: Completion Timing: \u2014 For all non- Admission OBRA and PPS assessments, the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B) must be no later than 14 days after the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) (A2300). \u2014 For the Admission assessment, the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B) must be no later than 13 days after the Entry Date (A1600). \u2014 For the Admission assessment, the Care Area Assessment (CAA ) Completion Date (V0200B2) must be no later more than 13 days after the Entry Date (A1600). For the Annual assessment, the CAA Completion Date (V0200B2) must be no later than 14 days after the ARD (A2300). \u2014 For the other comprehensive MDS assessments, Significant Change in Status Assessment and Significant Correction to Prior Comprehensive Assessment, the CAA Completion Date (V0200B2) must be no later than 14 days from the ARD (A2300) and no later than 14 days from the determination date of the significant change in status or the significant error, respectively. \u2014 For Entry and Death in Facility tracking records, the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B) must be no later than 7 days from the Event Date (A1600 for an entry record; A2000 for a Death i n Facility tracking record). State Requirements : Many states have established additional MDS requirements for Medicaid payment and/or quality monitoring purposes. For information on state requirements, contact your State RAI Coordinator. (See Appendix B for a list of State RAI Coordinators.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 3 Encoding Data: Within 7 days after completing a resident's MDS assessment or tracking record, the provider must encode the MDS data (i.e., enter the information into the facility MDS software). The encoding requirements are as follows: \u2014 For a comprehensive assessment (Admission, Annual, Significant Change in Status, and Significant Correction to Prior Comprehensive), encoding must occur within 7 days after the Care Plan Completion Date (V0200C2 + 7 days). \u2014 For a Quarterly, Significant Correc tion to Prior Quarterly, Discharge, or PPS assessment, encoding must occur within 7 days after the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B + 7 days). \u2014 For a tracking record, encoding should occur within 7 days of the Event Date (A1600 + 7 days for Entry records and A2000 + 7 days for Death in Facility records). Submission Format: For submission, the MDS data must be in record and file formats that conform to standard record layouts and data dictionaries, and pass standardized edits defined by CMS and the State . Each MDS record must be a separate file in a required XML format. The submission file is a compressed ZIP file that may contain multiple XML files. See the MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specifications on the CMS MDS 3.0 website for details concerning file and record formats, XML structure, and ZIP files. Transmitting Data: Submission files are transmitted to the QIES ASAP system using the CMS wide area network. Providers must transmit all sections of the MDS 3.0 required for their State -specific instrument, including the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Summary (Section V) and all tracking or correction information. Transmission requirements apply to all MDS 3.0 records used to meet both federal and state requirements. Care plans are not required to be transmitted. \u2014 Assessmen t Transmission: Comprehensive assessments must be transmitted electronically within 14 days of the Care Plan Completion Date (V0200C2 + 14 days). All other MDS assessments must be submitted within 14 days of the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B + 14 days). \u2014 Tracking Information Transmission: For Entry and Death in Facility tracking records, information must be transmitted within 14 days of the Event Date (A1600 + 14 days for Entry records and A2000 + 14 days for Death in Facility records).

Assessment Schedule: An OBRA assessment (comprehensive or Quarterly) is due every quarter unless the resident is no longer in the facility. There must be no more than 92 days between OBRA assessments. An OBRA comprehensive assessment is due every year unless the resident is no longer in the facility. There must be no more than 366 days between comprehensive assessments. PPS asses sments follow their own schedule. See Chapter 2 for details. 5.3 Validation Edits The QIES ASAP system has validation edits designed to monitor the timeliness and accuracy of MDS record submissions. If transmitted MDS records do not meet the edit requireme nts, the system will provide error and warning messages on the provider's Final Validation Report. Initial Submission Feedback. For each file submitted, the submitter will receive confirmation that the file was received for processing and editing by the QIES ASAP system. This CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 5 confirmation information includes the file submission identification number (ID), the date and time the file was received for processing as well as the file name. Validation and Editing Process. Each time a user accesses the QIES ASAP system and transmits an MDS file, the QIES ASAP system performs three types of validation: 1. Fatal File Errors. If the file structure is unacceptable (e.g., it is not a ZIP file), the records in the ZIP file cannot be extracted, or the file cannot be read, then the file will be rejected. The Submitter Final Validation Report will list the Fatal File Errors. Files that are rejected mu st be corrected and resubmitted. 2. Fatal Record Errors. If the file structure is acceptable, then each MDS record in the file is validated individually for Fatal Record Errors. These errors include, but are not limited to: Out of range responses (e.g., the v alid codes for the item are 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the submitted value is a 6). Inconsistent relationships between items. One example is a skip pattern violation. The resident is coded as comatose (B0100 = 1) but the Brief Interview for Mental Status is conduc ted (C0100 = 1). Another example is an inconsistent date pattern, such as the resident's Birth Date (Item A0900) is later than the Entry Date (Item A1600). Fatal Record Errors result in rejection of individual records by the QIES ASAP system. The provider is informed of Fatal Record Errors on the Final Validation Report. Rejected records must be corrected and resubmitted, unless the Fatal Error is due to submission of a duplicate assessment . 3. Non-Fatal Errors (Warnings). The record is also validated for Non -Fatal Errors. Non -Fatal Errors include, but are not limited to, missing or questionable data of a non -critical nature or item consistency errors of a non -critical nature. Examples are timing errors. Timing errors for a Quarterly assessment include (a) the submission date is more than 14 days after the MDS assessment completion date (Z0500B) or (b) the assessment completion is more than 14 days after the ARD (A2300). Another example is a record sequencing error, where an Entry record (A0310F = 01) is submitt ed after a Quarterly assessment record (A0310A = 02) with no intervening Discharge assessment (A0310F = 10 or 11). Any Non- Fatal Errors are reported to the provider in the Final Validation Report as warnings. The provider must evaluate each warning to identify necessary corrective actions . Storage to the QIES ASAP System. If there are any Fatal Record Errors, the record will be rejected and not stored in the QIES ASAP system. If there are no Fatal Record Errors, the record is loaded into the QIES ASAP system, even if the record has Non -Fatal Errors (Warnings). Detailed information on the validation edits and the error and warning messages is available in the MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specifications on the CMS MDS 3.0 website and in Section 5 of the Minimu m Data Set (MDS) 3.0 Provider User's Guide on the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page and on the QTSO MDS 3.0 w ebsite. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 6 5.4 Additional Medicare Submission Requirements that Impact Billing Under the SNF PPS As stated in CFR \u00a7413.343(a) and (b), providers reimbursed under the SNF PPS \"are required to submit the resident assessment data described at \u00a7483.20.... in the manner necessary to administer the payment rate methodology described in \u00a7413.337.\" This provision includes the frequency, scope, and number of assessments required in accordance with the methodology described in CFR \u00a7413.337(c) related to the adjustment of the Federal rates for case mix. SNFs must submit assessments according to a standard schedule. This schedule must include performance of resident assessments at specified windows during the Medicare Part A stay . HIPPS Codes: Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) codes are billing codes used when submitting Medicare Part A SNF payment claims to the Par t A/Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC). The HIPPS code consists of five positions. Under PDPM, t he first position represents the Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy (PT/OT) Payment Group, the second position represents the Speech Language Pathology (SLP) Payment Group, the third position represents the Nursing Payment Group, the fourth position represents the Non- therapy Ancillary (NTA) Payment Group, and the fifth position represents the Assessment Indicator (AI) code indicating which ty pe of assessment was completed. Standard \"grouper\" logic and software for PDPM and the AI code are provided by CMS on the MDS 3.0 website. The standard grouper uses MDS 3.0 items to determine both the PDPM group and the AI code. It is anticipated that MDS 3.0 software used by the provider will incorporate the standard grouper to automatically calculate the PDPM group and AI code. Detailed logic for determining the PDPM group and AI code is provided in Chapter 6. The Medicare Part A HIPPS code (Item Z0100A) is most often used on the claim. The PDPM version code in Item Z0100B documents which version of PDPM was used to determine the PDPM payment groups represented in the Medicare Part A HIPPS code. The HIPPS code (Z0100A) and PDPM version code (Z0100B ) must be submitted to the QIES ASAP system on all Medicare PPS assessment records (indicated by A0310B = 01 or 08 ). Both of these values are validated by the QIES ASAP system. The f inal validation r eport will indicate if any of these items is in error and the correct value for an incorrect item. Note that an error in one of these items is usually a non -fatal warning and the record will still be accepted in the QIES ASAP system . The Medicare Part A SNF claim cannot be submitted until th e corresponding MDS Medicare PPS assessment has been accepted in the QIES ASAP system. The claim must include the correct HIPPS code for the assessment. If the HIPPS code on the assessment was in error, then the correct HIPPS code from the Final Validation report must be used on the claim (warning error message - 3616a). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 7 5.5 MDS Correction Policy Once completed, edited, and accepted into the QIES ASAP system, providers may not change a previously completed MDS assessment as the resident's status changes du ring the course of the resident's stay \u2014the MDS must be accurate as of the ARD. Minor changes in the resident's status should be noted in the resident's record (e.g., in progress notes), in accordance with standards of clinical practice and documentation. S uch monitoring and documentation is a part of the provider's responsibility to provide necessary care and services. A significant change in the resident's status warrants a new comprehensive assessment (see Chapter 2 for details). It is important to rememb er that the electronic record submitted to and accepted into the QIES ASAP system is the legal assessment. Corrections made to the electronic record after QIES ASAP acceptance or to the paper copy maintained in the medical record are not recognized as proper corrections. It is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that any corrections made to a record are submitted to the QIES ASAP system in accordance with the MDS Correction Policy. Several processes have been put into place to assure that the MDS d ata are accurate both at the provider and in the QIES ASAP system: If an error is discovered within 7 days of the completion of an MDS and before submission to the QIES ASAP system, the response may be corrected using standard editing procedures on the hard copy (cross out, enter correct response, initial and date) and/or correction of the MDS record in the facility's database. The resident's care plan should also be reviewed for any needed changes. Software used by the provider to encode the MDS must run all standard edits as defined in the data specifications released by CMS. Enhanced record rejection standards have been implemented in the QIES ASAP system. If an MDS record contains responses that are out of range, e.g., a 4 is entered when only 0-3 are allowable responses for an item, or item responses are inconsistent (e.g., a skip pattern is not observed), the record is rejected. Rejected records are not stored in the QIES ASAP database. If an error is discovered in a record that has been accepted by the QIES ASAP system, Modification or Inactivation procedures must be implemented by the provider to assure that the QIES ASAP system information is corrected. Clinical corrections must also be undertaken as necessary to assure that the resident is accurat ely assessed, the care plan is accurate, and the resident is receiving the necessary care. A Significant Change in Status Assessment (SCSA), Significant Correction to Prior Quarterly (SCQA), or a Significant Correction to Prior Comprehensive (SCPA) may be needed as well as corrections to the information in the QIES ASAP system. An SCSA is required only if a change in the resident's clinical status occurred. An SCPA or SCQA is required when an uncorrected significant error is identified. See Chapter 2 for de tails. The remaining sections of this chapter present the decision processes necessary to identify the proper correction steps. A flow chart is provided at the end of these sections that summarizes these decisions and correction steps. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 8 5.6 Correcting Errors in MDS Records That Have Not Yet Been Accepted Into the QIES ASAP System If an MDS assessment is found to have errors that incorrectly reflect the resident's status, then that assessment must be corrected. The correction process depends upon the type of error. MDS assessments that have not yet been accepted in the QIES ASAP system include records that have been submitted and rejected, or records that have not been submitted at all. These records can generally be corrected and retransmitted without any special correction procedures, since they were never accepted by the QIES ASAP system. The paper copy should be corrected according to standard procedures detailed below. Errors Identified During the Encoding Period Facilities have up to 7 days to encode ( enter into the software) and edit an MDS assessment after the MDS has been completed. Changes may be made to the electronic record for any item during the encoding and editing period, provided the response refers to the same observation period. To make rev isions to the paper copy, enter the correct response, draw a line through the previous response without obliterating it, and initial and date the corrected entry. This procedure is similar to how an entry in the medical record is corrected. When the data are encoded into the provider's MDS system from paper, the provider is responsible for verifying that all responses in the computer file match the responses on the paper form. Any discrepancies must be corrected in the computer file during the 7- day encodin g period. In addition, the provider is responsible for running encoded MDS assessment data against CMS and State- specific edits that software vendors are responsible for building into MDS Version 3.0 computer systems. For each MDS item, the response must be within the required range and also be consistent with other item responses. During this 7- day encoding period that follows the completion of the MDS assessment, a provider may correct item responses to meet required edits. Only MDS assessments that meet all of the required edits are considered complete. For corrected items, the provider must use the same observation period as was used for the original item completion (i.e., the same ARD (A2300) and look- back period). Both the electronic and paper copies o f the MDS must be corrected. Errors Identified After the Encoding Period Errors identified after the encoding and editing period must be corrected within 14 days after identifying the errors. If the record in error is an Entry tracking record, Death in Fac ility tracking record, Discharge assessment, or PPS assessment record (i.e., MDS Item A0310A = 99), then the record should be corrected and submitted to the QIES ASAP system. The correction process may be more complex if the record in error is an OBRA comprehensive or Q uarterly assessment record (i.e., Item A0310A = 01 through 06). Significant versus Minor Errors in a Nursing Home OBRA Comprehensive or Quarterly Assessment Record. OBRA comprehensive and Quarterly assessment errors are classified as significant or minor errors. Errors that inaccurately reflect the resident's clinical status and/or CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 9 result in an inappropriate plan of care are considered significant errors . All other errors related to the coding of MDS items are considered minor errors . If the only errors in the OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment are minor errors, then the only requirement is for the record to be corrected and submitted to the QIES ASAP system. The correction process is more complicated for nursing home OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessments with any significant errors identified after the end of the 7- day encoding and editing period but before the records have been accepted into the QIES ASAP system. First, the nursing home must correct the original OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment to reflect the resident's actual status as of the AR D for that original assessment and submit the record. Second, to insure an up- to-date view of the resident's status and an appropriate care plan, the nursing home must perform an additional new assessment, either a Significant Change in Status Assessment o r Significant Correction to Prior Assessment with a current observation period and ARD. If correction of the error on the MDS revealed that the resident's status met the criteria for a Significant Change in Status Assessment, then a Significant Change in S tatus assessment is required. If the criteria for a Significant Change in Status Assessment are not met, then a Significant Correction to Prior Assessment is required. See Chapter 2 for details. In summary, the nursing home must take the following actions for an OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment that has not been submitted to the QIES ASAP system when it contains significant errors: Correct the errors in the original OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment. Submit the corrected assessment. Perfo rm a new assessment - a Significant Change in Status Assessment or a Significant Correction to Prior Assessment and update the care plan as necessary. If the assessment was performed for Medicare purposes only (A0310A = 99 and A0310B = 01 or 08) or for a d ischarge (A0310A = 99 and A0310F = 10 or 11), no Significant Change in Status Assessment or Significant Correction to Prior Assessment is required. The provider would determine if the Medicare- required or Discharge assessment should be modified or inactiva ted. Care Area Assessments (Section V) and updated care planning are not required with Medicare- only and Discharge assessments . 5.7 Correcting Errors in MDS Records That Have Been Accepted Into the QIES ASAP System Facilities should correct any errors nec essary to ensure that the information in the QIES ASAP system accurately reflects the resident's identification, location, overall clinical status, or payment status. A correction can be submitted for any accepted record within 2 years of the target date of the record for facilities that are still open. If a facility is terminated, then corrections must be submitted within 2 years of the facility termination date. A rec ord may be corrected even if subsequent records have been accepted for the resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 10 Errors identified in QIES ASAP system records must be corrected within 14 days after identifying the errors. Inaccuracies can occur for a variety of reasons, such as trans cription errors, data entry errors, software product errors, item coding errors or other errors. The following two processes have been established to correct MDS records (assessments, Entry tracking records or Death in Facility tracking records) that have been accepted into the QIES ASAP system: Modification Inactivation A Modification request moves the inaccurate record into history in the QIES ASAP system and replaces it with the corrected record as the active record. An Inactivation request also moves the inaccurate record into history in the QIES ASAP system, but does not replace it with a new record. Both the Modification and Inactivation processes require the MDS Correction Request items to be completed in Section X of the MDS 3.0. The MDS Correction R equest items in Section X contain the minimum amount of information necessary to enable location of the erroneous MDS record previously submitted and accepted into the QIES ASAP system. Section X items are defined in the MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specificati ons posted on the CMS MDS 3.0 website. When a facility maintains the MDS electronically without the use of electronic signatures, a hard copy of the Correction Request items in Section X must be kept with the corrected paper copy of the MDS record in the clinical file to track the changes made with the modification. In addition, the facility would keep a hard copy of the Correction Request items (Section X) with an inactivated record. For details on electronic records, see Chapter 2, Section 2.4. Modif ication Requests A Modification Request should be used when an MDS record (assessment, Entry tracking record or Death in Facility tracking record) is in the QIES ASAP system, but the information in the record contains clinical or demographic errors. The Mo dification Request is used to modify MDS items not specifically listed under inactivation. Some of the items include : Target Date \u2014 Entry Date (Item A1600) on an Entry tracking record (Item A0310F = 1) \u2014 Discharge Date (Item A2000) on a Discharge/Death in Facility record (Item A0310F = 10, 11, 12), \u2014 Assessment Reference Date (Item A2300) on an OBRA or PPS assessment.* Type of Assessment (Item A0310)** Clinical Items (Items B0100 -V0200C) *Note: The ARD (Item A2300) can be changed when the ARD on the assessment r epresents a data entry/typographical error. However, the ARD cannot be altered if it results in a change in CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 11 the look back period and alters the actual assessment timeframe. Consider the following examples: When entering the assessment into the facility's s oftware, the ARD, intended to be 02/12/2013, was inadvertently entered as 02/02/2013. The interdisciplinary team (IDT) completed the assessment based on the ARD of 2/12/2013 (that is, the seven day look back was 2/06/2012 through 2/12/2013) . This would be an acceptable use of the modification process to modify the ARD (A2300) to reflect 02/12/2013. An assessment was completed by the team and entered into the software based on the ARD of 1/10/2013 (and seven day look back of 1/04/2013 through 1/10/2013). Thr ee weeks later, the IDT determines that the date used represents a date that is not compliant with the PPS schedule and proposes changing the ARD to 1/07/2013. This would alter the look back period and result in a new assessment (rather than correcting a typographical error); this would not be an acceptable modification and shall not occur. **Note: The Type of Assessment items (Item A0310) can only be modified when the Item Set Code (ISC) of that assessment does not change. In other words, if the Item Subset (full list can be found in Chapter 2, Section 2.5) would change, the modification cannot be done. Consider the following exam ple: An Admission assessment (ISC = NC) was completed and accepted into the QIES ASAP system. The provider intended to code the assessment as an Admission and a 5 -day PPS assessment (ISC = NC). The modification process could be used in this case as the ISC would not change. There are a few items for which the modification process shall not be used. These items require the follo wing correction measures if an error is identified: An Inactivation of the existing record followed by submission of a new corrected record is required to correct an error of the Type of Provider (Item A0200) An MDS 3.0 Manual Assessment Correction/Deletion Request is required to correct: \u2014 Unit Certification or Licensure Designation (Item A0410), \u2014 State -assigned facility submission ID (FAC_ID), \u2014 Test record submitted as a production record. See Section 5.8 for details on the MDS 3.0 Manual Assessment Correction/Deletion Request. When an error is discovered (except for those items listed in the preceding paragraph and instances listed in Section 5.8) in an MDS 3.0 Entry tracking record, Death in Facility tracking record, Discharge assessment, or PPS assessment that is not an OBRA assessment (where Item A0310A = 99), the provider must take the following actions to correct the record: 1. Create a corrected record with all items included, not just the items in error. 2. Complete the required Correction Request Section X items and include with the corrected record. Item A0050 should have a value of 2, indicating a modification request. 3. Submit this modification request record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 12 If errors are discovered in a nursing home OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly asse ssment (Item A0310A = 01 through 06) in the QIES ASAP system, then the nursing home must determine if there are any significant errors. If the only errors are minor errors, the nursing home must take the following actions to correct the OBRA assessment: 1. Create a corrected record with all items included, not just the items in error. 2. Complete the required Correction Request Section X items and include with the corrected record. Item A0050 should have a value of 2, indicating a modification request. 3. Submit thi s modification request record. When any significant error is discovered in an OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment in the QIES ASAP system, the nursing home must take the following actions to correct the OBRA assessment: 1. Create a corrected record with all items included, not just the items in error. 2. Complete the required Correction Request Section X items and include with the corrected record. Item A0050 should have a value of 2, indicating a modification request. 3. Submit this modification request record. 4. Perform a new Significant Correction to Prior Assessment or Significant Change in Status Assessment and update the care plan as necessary. A Significant Change in Status Assessment would be required only if correction of the MDS item(s) revealed that the resident met the criteria for a Significant Change in Status Assessment. If criteria for Significant Change in Status Assessment were not met, then a Significant Correction to Prior Assessment is required. When errors in an OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment in the QIES ASAP system have been corrected in a more current OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment (Item A0310A = 01 through 06), the nursing home is not required to perform a new additional assessment (Sign ificant Change in Status or Significant Correction to Prior assessment). In this situation, the nursing home has already updated the resident's status and care plan. However, the nursing home must use the Modification process to assure that the erroneous a ssessment residing in the QIES ASAP system is corrected. The 10/01/2019 Cross -Over Rule A unique situation exists that will prevent providers from correcting the target date of any assessment crossing over October 1, 2019. That is, providers may not submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed prior to October 1, 2019 to a target date on or after October 1, 2019, nor can they submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed on or after October 1, 2019 to a target date prior to October 1, 2019. The item sets that are effective October 1, 2019 have had significant changes, including the omission and addition of many items. It is the target date of the assessment that identifies the required version of t he item set, and, because of the substantial changes in the item sets, they are not interchangeable. Therefore, providers may not change target dates on assessments crossing over October 1, 2019. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 13 Modification records that contain a target date crossing ove r October 1, 2019 will result in a FATAL error and be REJECTED from the QIES ASAP system. However, all corrections to target dates that align with policies in Section 5.7 of this chapter and do not violate this rule will be allowed. To correct the target d ate of the assessment that violates the cross -over rule, providers must inactivate the incorrect assessment and submit a replacement assessment. Examples of potential scenarios that will and will not be allowed are identified below: Original Assessment Ta rget Date Modified Assessment Target Date Allowed or Not Allowed 8/15/19 9/30/19 Allowed 10/1/19 11/1/19 Allowed 9/15/19 10/15/19 Not Allowed 10/15/19 9/15/19 Not Allowed Inactivation Requests An Inactivation should be used when a record has been accepted into the QIES ASAP system but the corresponding event did not occur. For example, a Discharge assessment was submitted for a resident but there was no actual discharge. An Inactivation (Item A0050 = 3) must be completed when any of the following items are inaccurate: Type of Provider (Item A0200) Type of Assessment (A0310) when the Item Subset would change had the MDS been modified Discharge Date (Item A2000) on a Discharge assessment record (It em A0310F = 10, 11) when the look- back period and/or clinical assessment would change had the MDS been modified Assessment Reference Date (Item A2300) on an OBRA or PPS assessment when the look-back period and/or clinical assessment would change had the MD S been modified When inactivating a record, the provider is required to submit an electronic Inactivation Request record. This record is an MDS record but only the Section X items and Item A0050 are completed. This is sufficient information to locate the r ecord in the QIES ASAP system, inactivate the record and document the reason for inactivation. For instances when the provider determines that the Type of Provider is incorrect, the provider must inactivate the record in the QIES ASAP system, then complete and submit a new MDS 3.0 record with the correct Type of Provider, ensuring that the clinical information is accurate. Inactivations should be rare and are appropriate only under the narrow set of circumstances that indicate a record is invalid. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 14 In such instances a new ARD date must be established based on MDS requirements, which is the date the error is determined or later, but not earlier. The new MDS 3.0 record being submitted to replace the inactivated record must include new signatures and dat es for all items based on the look- back period established by the new ARD and according to established MDS assessment completion requirements. 5.8 Special Manual Record Correction Request A few types of errors in a record in the QIES ASAP system cannot be corrected with an automated Modification or Inactivation request. These errors are: 1. The record is a test record inadvertently submitted as production. 2. The record has the wrong unit certification or licensure designation in Item A0410. 3. The record has the wr ong state code or facility ID in the control Items STATE_CD or FAC_ID. In all of these cases, the facility must contact the State Agency to have the problems fixed. The State Agency will send the facility the appropriate MDS 3.0 Manual Assessment Correction/Deletion Request form. The facility is responsible for completing the form. The facility must submit the completed form to the State Agency. Completed forms with privacy information must be sent via certified mail through the United States Postal Service (USPS). The State Agency will review the request for completion and accuracy. A fter approving the provider's request, the state must sign the form and send it to the QTSO Help Desk. Compl eted forms with privacy data must be sent via certified mail through the USPS. When a test record is in the QIES ASAP system, the problem must be evaluated and the QIES ASAP system appropriately corrected. A normal Inactivation request will not totally fix the problem, since it will leave the test record in a history file and may also leave information about a fictitious resident. Manual deletion is n ecessary to completely remove the test record and associated information. A QIES ASAP system record with an incorrect unit certification or licensure designation in Item A0410 is a very serious problem. Submission of MDS assessment records to the QIES ASAP system constitutes a release of private information and must conform to privacy laws. Item A0410 is intended to allow appropriate privacy safeguards, controlling who can access the record and whether the record can even be accepted into the QIES ASAP syst em. A normal Modification or Inactivation request cannot be used to correct the A0410 value, since a copy of the record in error will remain in the QIES ASAP system history file with the wrong access control. Consider a record in the QIES ASAP system with an A0410 value of 3 (Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified) when actually the unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified and MDS data is not required by the State (A0410 should have been 1). The record should not be in the QIES ASAP system at all and manual deletion is necessary to completely remove the record from the QIES ASAP system. Consider a record with an A0410 value of 3 indicating that the Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified but actually the unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State (A0410 should have been 2). In this case there is both federal and state access to the record, but access should be limited to the state. Manual CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 15 correction is necessary to correct A0410 and reset access control , without leaving a copy of the record with the wrong access in the QIES ASAP system history file. If a QIES ASAP system record has the wrong state code or facility ID (control item STATE_CD, FAC_ID), then the record must be removed without leaving any tra ce in the QIES ASAP system. The record also should be resubmitted with the correct STATE_CD and FAC_ID value. October 201 9 Page 5-16 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments 1 Manual deletion request is required if test record submitted as production record, if record contains incorrect FAC_ID, or if record was submitted with an incorrect Unit Certification or Licensure Designation (A0410), for example sent in as Unit is Medicar e and/or Medicaid certified (A0410 = 3) but should have been Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State (A0410 = 2). Otherwise, automated inactivation or modification required: (a) if event did not occur (see note #3 below), submit automated inactivation, (b) if event occurred, submit automated modification. 2 Record has not been data entered, has not been submitted, or has been submitted and rejected by ASAP. 3 The event occurred if the record reflects an actual entry or discharge or if an assessment was actually performed for the resident. If a record was created in error (e.g., a Discharge assessment was created for a resident who was not actually discharged), then the event did not occur . 4 OBRA comprehensive as sessments with A0310A = 01, 03, 04, 05 and Quarterly assessments with A0310 A = 02, 06. 5 The assessment contains a significant error which has not been corrected by a subsequent assessment. 6 Final completion date is item V0200C2 for a comprehensive and Z0500B for all other assessments. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medi care SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 1 CHAPTER 6: MEDICARE SKILLED NURSING FACI LITY PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM (SNF PPS) 6.1 Background The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included the implementation of a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and hospitals with a swing bed agreement, consolidated billing, and a number of related changes. The PPS system replaced the retrospective cost-based system for SNFs under Part A of the program ( Federal Register Vol. 63, No. 91, May 12, 1998, Final Rule). Effe ctive with cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2002, SNF -level services furnished in rural swing bed hospitals are paid based on the SNF PPS instead of the previous, cost -related method ( Federal Register Vol. 66, No. 147, July 31, 2001, Final Rule). However, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 included an exemption of critical access hospital swing beds from the SNF PPS. The SNF PPS is the culmination of substantial research efforts beginning as early as the 1970s that focus on the areas of nursing home payment and quality. In addition, it is based on a foundation of knowledge and work by a number of States that developed and implemented similar case -mix payment methodologies for their Medicaid n ursing home payment systems. The current focus in the development of the Federal payment system (i.e., PPS) for nursing home care is based on recognizing the differences among resident s, particularly in the utilization of resources. Some resident s require total assistance with their activities of daily living (ADLs) and have complex nursing care needs. Other resident s may require less assistance with ADLs but may require rehabilitation or restorative nursing services. The recognition of these differences is the premise of a case- mix system. Reimbursement levels differ based on the resource needs of the resident s. Resident s with heavy care needs require more staff resources and payment levels should be higher than for those resident s with less intensive care needs. In a case- mix adjusted payment system, the amount of reimbursement to the nursing home is based on the resource intensity of the resident as measured by items on the Minimum Data Set (MDS). Case -mix reimbursement has become a widely adopted method f or financing nursing home care. The case - mix approach serves as the basis for the PPS for skilled nursing facilities and swing bed hospitals and is increasingly being used by States for Medicaid reimbursement for nursing homes. 6.2 Using the MDS in the Medicare Prospective Payment System The MDS assessment data is used to calculate the resident 's Pa tient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) classification necessary for payment. The MDS contains extensive information on the resident 's nursing and therapy needs, ADL s tatus, cognitive status, behavioral problems, and medical diagnoses. This information is used to define PDPM case -mix adjusted groups, within CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medi care SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 2 which a hierarchy exists that assigns case -mix weights that capture differences in the relative resources used for treati ng different types of resident s. Over half of the State Medicaid programs also use the MDS for their case- mix payment systems. The Resource Utilization Group, Version IV (RUG -IV) system replaced the Resource Utilization Group, Version III (RUG -III) system for Medicare starting on October 1, 2010. Starting October 1, 2019, PDPM replaced the RUG -IV system. However, State Medicaid agencies have the option to use the RUG -III, RUG -IV, or PDPM classification systems. CMS also makes available for the States alternative RUG -IV classification systems with 66, 57, or 48 groups with varying numbers of Rehabilitation groups (similar to the RUG -III 53, 44, and 34 groups). States have the option of selecting the system (RUG -III or RUG -IV) with the number of Rehabilitation groups that better suits their Medicaid long -term care population. State Medicaid programs always have the option to develop nursing home reimbursement systems that meet their specific program goals. The decision to implement a certain c lassification system for Medicaid is a State decision. Please contact your State Medicaid agency if you have questions about your State Medicaid reimbursement system. 6.3 Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) PDPM adjusts payment for each major element of a resident 's SNF care, specifically for physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech -language pathology (SLP), nursing, and non - therapy ancillaries (NTA). In section 6.6 below, we provide a PDPM calculation worksheet. This calculation worksheet w as developed in order to provide clinical staff with a better understanding of how PDPM works. The worksheet translates the standard software code into plain language to assist staff in understanding the logic behind the classification system. 6.4 Relation ship between the Assessment and the Claim The SNF PPS establishes a schedule of PPS assessments. The 5 -Day assessment is the only required PPS assessment that is used to support PPS reimbursement. However, as described in Chapter 2, S ection 2.9, an optiona l assessment, the Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) , may be used to reclassify the resident into a new PDPM classification, and would also affect the associated payment rate. See Chapter 2 of this m anual for greater detail on assessment t ypes and requiremen ts. Numerous situations exist that impact the relationship between the assessment and the claim above and beyond the information provided in this chapter. It is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that claims submitted to Medicare are accurate and meet all Medicare requirements. For example, if a resident 's status does not meet the criteria for Medicare Part A SNF coverage, the provider is not to bill Medicare for any non- covered days. The assignment of a PDPM classification is not an indication th at the requirements for a SNF Part A stay have been met. Once the resident no longer requires skilled services, the provider must not bill Medicare for days that are not covered. Therefore, the following information is not to be considered all - inclusive a nd definitive. Refer to the Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Chapter 6 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medi care SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 3 (https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/clm104c 06.pdf ), for detailed claims processing requirements and policies. The SNF claim must include two data items derived from the MDS assessment: Assessment Reference Date (ARD) The ARD must be reported on the SNF claim. CMS has developed internal mechanisms to link the MDS assessment and the claims processing system. Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) Code Each SNF claim contains a five- position HIPPS code for the purpose of billing Part A covered days to the Medicare Administrativ e Contractor (MAC). The HIPPS code consists of a series of codes representing the resident 's PDPM classification and the Assessment Indicator (AI) as described below. CMS provides standard software and logic for HIPPS code calculation. PDPM Classification The first four positions of the HIPPS code contain the PDPM classification codes for each PDPM component to be billed for Medicare reimbursement. The PDPM classification is calculated from the MDS assessment clinical data. See Section 6.6 for calculation d etails on each PDPM group. CMS provides standard software, development tools, and logic for PDPM calculation. CMS software, or private software developed with the CMS data specifications , is used to encode and transmit the MDS assessment data and automatic ally calculates the resident 's PDPM classification. CMS edits and validates the PDPM classification code of transmitted MDS assessments. Skilled nursing facilities are not permitted to submit Medicare Part A claims until the assessments have been accepted into the CMS database, and they must use the PDPM classification code as validated by CMS when bills are filed, except in cases in which the facility must bill the default code (ZZZZZ ).

The HIPPS code included on the SNF claim depends on the specific type of assessment involved (as described below). The HIPPS code in i tem Z0100A is validated by CMS when the assessment is submitted. If the submitted code is incorrect, the validation report will include a warning giving the correct code; the facility must enter this correct code in the HIPPS code item on the bill. The provider must ensure that all PPS assessment require ments are met. When the provider fails to meet the PPS assessment requirements, such as when the assessment is late (as evidenced by a late ARD), the provider may be required to bill the default code. In these situations, the provider is responsible to ens ure that the default code and not the PDPM classification -based HIPPS code validated by CMS in i tem Z0100A is billed for the applicable number of days. See Section 6.8 of this chapter for greater detail. AI Code The last position of the HIPPS code represents the AI, identifying the assessment type. The AI coding system indicates the different types of assessments that define different PPS payment periods and is based on t he coding of i tem A0310B. CMS provides standard software, development tools, and logic for AI code calculation. CMS software, or private software developed with the CMS tools, automatically calculates the AI code. The AI code is validated by CMS when the assessment is submitted. If the submitted AI code is incorrect on the assessment, the validation report will include a warning and provide the correct code. The facility must enter this correct AI code in the HIPPS code item on the bill. The code consists of one digit, which is defined below. In situations when the provider is to bill the def ault code, the AI provided on the validation report is to be used along with the default code, ZZZZZ, on the SNF claim. Refer to the Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Chapter 6, for detailed claims processing requirements and policies. The AI code identif ies the assessment used to establish the per diem payment rate for the standard PPS payment periods. These assessments are the 5 -Day assessment and Interim Payment Assessment. Table 5 displays the AI code for each of the PPS assessment types and the standard payment period for each assessment type. Table 5.

These requirements are summarized in this section. Refer to the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual , Chapter 1 (Pub. 100- 1), and the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual , Chapter 8 (Pub. 100- 2), for detailed SNF coverage requirements and policies. Technical Eligibility Requirements The beneficiary must meet the following criteria: Beneficiary is enrolled in Medicare Part A and has days available to use. There has been a three- day prior qualifying hospital stay (i.e., three midnights). Admission for SNF -level services is within 30 days of discharge from an acute care stay or within 30 days of discharge from a SNF level of care. Clinical Eligibility Requirements A beneficiary is eligible for SNF extended care if all of the following requirements are met: The beneficiary has a need for and receives medically necessary skilled care on a daily basis, which is provided by or under the direct supervision of skilled nursing or rehabilitation professionals. As a practical matter, these skilled services can only be provided in an SNF. The services provided must be for a condition: \u2014 for which the resident was treated during the qualifying hospital stay, or \u2014 that arose while the resident was in the SNF for treatment of a condition for which he or she was previously treated in a hospital. Physician Certification The attending physician or a physician on the staff of the skilled nursing facility who has knowledge of the case \u2014or a nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), or clinical nurse specialist (CNS) who does not have a direct or indirect employment relationship with the facility but who is w orking in collaboration with the physician\u2014must certify and then periodically recertify the need for extended care services in the skilled nursing facility. Certifications are required at the time of admission or as soon thereafter as is reasonable and pra cticable (42 CFR 424.20). The initial certification \u2014 affirms, per the required content found in 42 CFR 424.20, that the resident meets the existing SNF level of care definition, or \u2014 validates via written statement that the resident 's assignment to one of the upper PDPM groups (defined below) is correct. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 11 o Those nursing groups encompassed by the Extensive Services, Special Care High, Special Care Low, and Clinically Complex nursing categories; o PT and OT groups TA, TB, TC, TD, TF, SLP SE, SF, SH, SI, SJ, SK, and SL; and o The NTA component's uppermost (12+) comorbidity group. Re-certifications are used to document the continued need for skilled extended care services. \u2014 The first re -certification is required no later than the 14t h day of the SNF stay. \u2014 Subsequent re -certifications are required at no later than 30 -day intervals after the date of the first re -certification. \u2014 The initial certification and first re -certification may be signed at the same time. 6.6 PDPM Calculation Works heet for SNFs In the PDPM, there are five case -mix adjusted components: PT, OT, SLP, NTA, and Nursing. Each resident is to be classified into one and only one group for each of the five case -mix adjusted components. In other words, each resident is classif ied into a PT group, an OT group, an SLP group, an NTA group, and a nursing group. For each of the case -mix adjusted components, there are a number of groups to which a resident may be assigned, based on the relevant MDS 3.0 data for that component. There are 16 PT groups, 16 OT groups, 12 SLP groups, 6 NTA groups, and 25 nursing groups. PDPM classifies resident s into a separate group for each of the case- mix adjusted components, each of which has its own associated case- mix indexes and base rates. Additionally, PDPM applies variable per diem payment adjustments to three components, PT, OT, and NTA, to account for changes in resource use over a stay. The adjusted PT, OT, and NTA per diem rates are then added together with the unadjusted SLP and nursing component rates and the non- case- mix component to determine the full per diem rate for a given resident . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 12 Calculation of PDPM Cognitive Level The PDPM cognitive level is utilized in the SLP payment component of PDPM. One of four PDPM cognitive performance levels is assigned based on the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) or the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for the PDPM cognitive leve l. If neither the BIMS nor the staff assessment for the PDPM cognitive level is complete, then the PDPM cognitive level cannot be assigned and the resident will be classified as if the resident is cognitively intact. STEP #1 Determine the resident 's BIMS S ummary Score on the MDS 3.0 based on the resident interview. Instructions for completing the BIMS are in Chapter 3, Section C. The BIMS involves the following items: C0200 Repetition of three words C0300 Temporal orientation C0400 Recall Item C0500 provides a BIMS Summary Score that ranges from 00 to 15. If the resident interview is not successful, then the BIMS Summary Score will equal 99. Calculate the resident 's PDPM cognitive level using the following mapping: Table 6: Calculation of PDPM Level from BIMS PDPM Level BIMS Score Cognitively Intact 13-15 Mildly Impaired 8-12 Moderately Impaired 0-7 Severely Impaired - PDPM Cognitive Level: __________ If the resident 's Summary Score is 99 ( resident interview not successful) or the Summary Score is blank ( resident interview not attempted and skipped) or the Summary Score has a dash value (not assessed), then proceed to Step #2 to use the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for the PDPM cognitive level . STEP #2 If the resident 's Summary Score is 99 or the Summary Score is blank or has a dash value, then determine the resident 's cognitive status based on the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for the PDPM cognitive level using the following steps: CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 13 A) The resident classifies as severely impaired if one of the following conditions exist s: a. Comatose (B0100 = 1) and completely dependent or activity did not occur at admission (GG0130A1, GG0130C1, GG0170B1, GG0170C1, GG0170D1, GG0170E1, and GG0170F1 all equal 01, 09, or 88). b. Severely impaired cognitive skills for dail y decision making (C1000 = 3). B) If the resident is not severely impaired based on Step A, then determine the resident 's Basic Impairment Count and Severe Impairment Count. For each of the conditions below that applies, add one to the Basic Impairment Count. a. In Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making, the resident has modified independence or is moderately impaired (C1000 = 1 or 2). b. In Makes Self Understood, the resident is usually understood, sometimes understood, or rarely/never understood (B0700 = 1, 2, or 3). c. Based on the Staff Assessment for Mental Status, the resident has a memory problem (C0700 = 1). Sum a., b., and c. to get the Basic Impairment Count: _____ For each of the conditions below that applies, add one to the Severe Impairment Count. a. In Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making, the resident is m oderately impaired (C1000 = 2). b. In Makes Self Understood, the resident is sometimes understood or rarely/never understood (B0700 = 2 or 3). Sum a. and b. to get the Severe Impairment Count: _____ C) The resident classifies as moderately impaired if the Severe Impairment Count is 1 or 2 and the Basic Impairment Count is 2 or 3. D) The resident classifies as mildly impaired if the Basic Impairment Count is 1 and the Severe Impairment Count is 0, 1, or 2, or if the Basic Impairment Count is 2 or 3 and the Severe Impairment Count is 0. E) The resident classifies as cognitively intact if both the Seve re Impairment Count and Basic Impairment Count are 0. PDPM Cognitive Level: __________ CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 14 PDPM Payment Component: PT STEP #1 Determine the resident 's primary diagnosis clinical category using the ICD -10-CM code recorded in MDS item I0020B. To do so, refer to the PDPM Clinical Categories to ICD -10 Diagnosis Codes mapping (available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service - Payment/SNFPPS/PD PM.html ), which maps a resident 's primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B to the 10 PDPM primary diagnosis clinical categories. I0020B diagnosis: ____________________ Default primary diagnosis clinical category: ____ ________________ Some ICD -10-CM codes can map to a different clinical category from the default depending on a resident 's prior inpatient procedure history. For these codes, a resident may be categorized into a surgical clinical category if the resident received a surgical procedure dur ing the prior inpatient stay that relates to the primary reason for the Part A SNF stay as indicated by item J2100. If the PDPM clinical category mapping indicates that the resident 's primary diagnosis code is eligible for one of the two orthopedic surgery categories (major joint replacement or spinal surgery, and orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery)) , then proceed to Step 1A; if eligible for the non -orthopedic surgery category, then proceed to Step 1C. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1A Determine whether the resident received a major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2300, J2310, J2320, J2330, J2400, J2410, or J2420 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the major joint replacement or spinal surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1B. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 15 STEP #1B Determine whether the resident received orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2500, J2510, J2520, or J2530 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) clinical category. If none of these procedures was perform ed, the resident did not receive orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spin al surgery) during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery)? (Yes/No) _____ If the resi dent received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery), then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery). Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosi s clinical category assignment. STEP #1C Determine whether the resident received a significant non -orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay usin g item J2100. If any of the during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the non- orthopedic surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive a significant non- orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical C linical Category and eceived S ignificant Non- Orthopedic Surgical Procedure? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received a significant Non -Orthopedic Surgical Procedure, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Non -Orthopedic Surgery. Otherwise, the res ident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosi s clinical category assignment. STEP #1D To finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment, if the resident is not eligible for a different clinical category from the default, then select the default clinical category assigned to the primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B in Step 1. If the resident is eligible for a different clinical category from the default, select the eligible surgical clinical category as determined in Steps 1A, 1B, or 1C. Primary diagnosis clinical category: Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 16 STEP #2 Next, determine the resident 's PT clinical category based on the mapping shown below. Table 7: PT Clinical Category Primary Diagnosis Clinical Category PT Clinical Category Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) Other Orthopedic Non-Orthopedic Surgery Non-Orthopedic Surgery Acute Infections Medical Management Cardiovascular and Coagulations Medical Management Pulmonary Medical Management Non-Surgical Orthopedic/Musculoskeletal Other Orthopedic Acute Neurologic Acute Neurologic Cancer Medical Management Medical Management Medical Management PT Clinical Category: ____________________ STEP #3 Calculate the resident 's Function Score for PT payment. Use the following table to determine the Function Score for Eating Admission Performance (GG0130A1), Oral Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130B1), Toileting Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130C1), Sit to Lying Admission Performance (GG0170B1), Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Admission Performa nce (GG0170C1), Sit to Stand Admission Performance (GG0170D1), Chair/Bed- to- Chair Transfer Admission Performance (GG0170E1), and Toilet Transfer Admission Perfo rmance (GG0170F1). It should be noted that, in the case of an IPA, the items used for calculation of the resident 's PDPM functional score are the Interim Performance items (GG0XXXX5), rather than the Admission Performance items (GG0XXXX1). For example, rather than GG0130B1, w hich is used on the 5- Day to assess the resident 's Oral Hygiene Admission Pe rformance, the IPA uses item GG0130B5 in order to measure the resident 's Oral Hygiene Interim Performance. Determine if the resident can walk using item GG0170I1. If the resident cannot walk 10 feet (GG0170I1 = 07, 09, 10, or 88), then the Function Score f or Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) is 0. If the resident can walk (GG0170I1 = 06, 05, 04, 03, 02, 01), then determine the Function Score for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) using the following table. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 17 Table 8: Function Score for PT Payment Admission or Interim Performance (Column 1 or 5) = Function Score = 05, 06 4 04 3 03 2 02 1 01, 07, 09, 10, 88, missing 0 Enter the Function Score for each item: Eating Eating Function Score: _____ Oral Hygiene Oral Hygiene Score: _____ Toileting Hygiene Toileting Hygiene Function Score: _____ Bed Mobility Sit to Lying Function Score: _____ Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Function Score: _____ Transfer Sit Score: _____ Walking Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns Function Score: _____ Walk 150 Feet Function Score: _____ The next step is to calculate the average function scores for the two bed mobility items, the three transfer items, and the two walking items as follows. For the Average Bed Mobility Function Score, calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Lying and Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed and divide this sum by 2. For the Average Transfer Function Score, calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Stand, Chair/Bed -to-Chair, and Toilet Transfer, and CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 18 divide this sum by 3. For the Average Walking Fu nction Score, calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns and Walk 150 Feet, and divide this sum by 2. Enter the Average Bed Mobility, Average Transfer Function, and Average Walking Function Scores below. Average Bed Mobility F unction Score: _____ Average Transfer Function Score: _____ Average Walking Function Score: _____ Calculate the sum of the following Function Scores: Eating Function Score, Oral Hygiene Function Score, Toileting Hygiene Function Score, Average Bed Mobility Function Score, Average Transfer Function Score, and Average Walking Function Score. Finally, round this sum to the nearest integer. This is the PDPM Function Score for PT Payment . The PDPM Function Score for PT Payment ranges from 0 through 24. PT FUNCTION SCORE : _____ STEP #4 Using the responses from Steps 2 and 3 above, determine the resident 's PT group using the table below. Table 9: PT Case -Mix Groups Clinical Category Section GG Function Score PT Case -Mix Group Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery 0-5 TA Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery 6-9 TB Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery 10-23 TC Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery 24 TD Other Orthopedic 0-5 TE Medical Management 0-5 TI Medical Management 6-9 TJ Medical Management 10-23 TK Medical Management 24 TL Non-Orthopedic Surgery and Neurologic 24 TP PDPM PT Classification : _____ CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 19 PDPM Payment Component: OT *Note : The steps for calculating the resident 's PDPM classification for the OT component follow the same logic used for calculating the resident 's PDPM classification for the PT component, described above. STEP #1 Determine the resident 's primary diagnosis clinical category using the ICD -10-CM code recorded in MDS item I0020B. To do so, refer to the PDPM Clinical Categories to ICD -10 Diagn osis Codes mapping (available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service - Payment/SNFPPS/PDPM.html ), which maps a resident 's primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B to the 10 PDPM primary diagnosis clinical categories. I0020B diagnosis: ____________________ Default primary diagnosis clinical category: ____________________ Some ICD -10-CM codes can map to a different clinical category from the default depending on a resident 's prior inpatient procedure history. For these codes, a resident may be categorized int o a surgical clinical category if the resident received a surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay that relates to the primary reason for the Part A SNF stay as indicated by item J2100. If the PDPM clinical category mapping indicates that the res ident 's primary diagnosis code is eligible for one of the two orthopedic surgery categories (major joint replacement or spinal surgery, and orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery)) , then proceed to Step 1A; if eligible for the non- orthopedic surgery category, then proceed to Step 1C. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1A Determine whether the resident received a major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2300, J2310, J2320, J2330, J2400, J2410, or J2420 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the major joint replacement or spina l surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery? (Yes/No ) _____ If the resident received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. Otherw ise, proceed to Step 1B. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 20 STEP #1B Determine whether the resident received orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2500, J2510, J2520, or J2530 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Majo r Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery)? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery), then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spi nal Surgery). Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1C Determine whether the resident received a significant non -orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the non- orthopedic surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive a significant non- orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and R eceived S ignificant Non- Orthopedic Surgical Procedure? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received a significant Non -Orthopedic Surgical Procedure, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Non -Orthopedic Surgery. Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize th e primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1D To finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment, if the resident is not eligible for a different clinical category from the default, then select the default clinical category assigned to the primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B in Step 1. If the resident is eligible for a different clinical category from the default, select the eligible surgical clinical category as determined in Steps 1A, 1B, or 1C. Primary diagnosis Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 21 STEP #2 Next, determine the resident 's OT clinical category based on the mapping shown below. Table 10: OT Clinical Category Primary Diagnosis Clinical Category OT Clinical Category Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) Other Orthopedic Non-Orthopedic Surgery Non-Orthopedic Surgery Acute Infections Medical Management Cardiovascular and Coagulations Medical Management Pulmonary Medical Management Non-Surgical Orthopedic/Musculoskeletal Other Orthopedic Acute Neurologic Acute Neurologic Cancer Medical Management Medical Management Medical Management OT Clinical Category: ____________________ STEP #3 Calculate the resident 's Function Score for OT payment. Use the following table to determine the Function Score for Eating Admission Performance (GG0130A1), Oral Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130B1), Toil eting Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130C1), Sit to Lying Admission Performance (GG0170B1), Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Admission Performance (GG0170C1), Sit to Stand Admission Performance (GG0170D1), Chair/Bed- to- Chair Transfer Admission Performanc e (GG0170E1), and Toilet Transfer Admission Performance (GG0170F1). It should be noted that, in the case of an IPA, the items used for calculation of the resident 's PDPM functional score are the Interim Performance items (GG0XXXX5), rather than the Admissi on Performance items (GG0XXXX1). For example, rather than GG 0130B1, which is used on the 5- Day to assess the resident 's Oral Hygiene Admission Performance, the IPA uses item GG0130B5 in order to measure the resident 's Oral Hygiene Interim Performance. Determine if the resident can walk using item GG0170I1. If the resident cannot walk 10 feet (GG0170I1 = 07, 09, 10, or 88), then the Function Score for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) is 0. If the resident can walk (GG0170I1 = 06, 05, 04, 03, 02, 01), then determine the Function Score for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) using the following table.

STEP #1 Determine the resident 's primary diagnosis clinical category using the ICD -10-CM code recorded in MDS item I0020B. To do so, refer to the PDPM Clinical Categories to ICD -10 Diagnosis Codes mapping (available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service - Payment/SNFPPS/PDPM.html ), which maps a resident 's primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B to the 10 PDPM primary diagnosis clinical categories. I0020B diagnosis: ____________________ Default primary diagnosis clinical category: ____________________ Some ICD -10-CM codes can map to a different clinical category from the default depending on a resident 's prior inpatient procedure history. For these codes, a resident may be categorized into a surgical clinical category if the resident received a surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay that relates to the primary reason for the Part A SNF stay as indicated by item J2100. If the PDPM clinical category mapping indicates that the resident 's primary diagnosis code is eligible for one of the two orthopedic surgery categories (major joint replacement or spinal surgery, and orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery)) , then proceed to Step 1A; if eligible for the non -orthopedic surgery category, then proceed to Step 1C. Otherwi se, proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1A Determine whether the resident received a major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures ndicated J2310, J2320, J2330, was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the major joint replacement or spinal surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was perfo rmed, the resident did not receive major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Major Joint Replacement or Spina l Surgery? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1B. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 25 STEP #1B Determine whether the resident received orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2500, J2510, J2520, or J2530 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spin al surgery) during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery)? (Yes/No) _____ If the resi dent received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery), then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery). Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1C Determine whether the resident received a significant non -orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay usin g item J2100. If any of the during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the non- orthopedic surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive a significant non- orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and R eceived S ignificant Non- Orthopedic Surgical Procedure? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received a significant Non -Orthopedic Surgical Procedure, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Non -Orthopedic Sur gery. Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1D To finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment, if the resident is not eligible for a different clinical category from the default, then select the default clinical category assigned to the primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B in Step 1. If the resident is eligible for a different clinical cat egory from the default, select the eligible surgical clinical category as determined in Steps 1A, 1B, or 1C. Primary diagnosis clinical category: Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 26 STEP #2 Next, determine the resident 's SLP clinical category based on the mapping shown below. Table 13: SLP Clinical Category Primary Diagnosis Clinical Category SLP Clinical Category Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Non-Neurologic Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) Non-Neurologic Non-Orthopedic Surgery Non-Neurologic Acute Clinical Category: ____________________ STEP #3 Determine whether the resident has one or more SLP -related comorbidities. To do so, examine the services and conditions in the table below. If any of these items is indicated as present, the resident has an SLP -related comorbidity. For conditions and services that are recorded in item I8000 of the MDS, check if the corresponding ICD -10-CM codes are coded in item I8000 using the mapping available at Language Deficits O0100E2 Tracheostomy Care While a Resident O0100F2 Ventilator or Respirator While a Resident Presence of one or more SLP -related comorbidities? (Yes/No) 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 27 STEP #4 Determine whether the resident has a cognitive impairment. Calculate the resident 's PDPM cognitive level, as described previously. If the PDPM cognitive level is cognitively intact, then the resident does not have a cognitive impairment. Otherwise, if the resident is assessed as mildly, moderately, or severely impaired, then the resident classifies as cognitively impaired. Presence of Cognitive Impairment? (Yes/No) _____ STEP #5 Determine how many of the following conditions are present: a. Based on Step 2, the resident is classified in the Acute Neurologic clinical category. b. Based on Step 3, the resident has one or more SLP -related comorbidities. c. Based on Step 4, the resident has a cognitive impairment. Number of conditions present: _____ STEP #6 Determine whether the resident has a swallowing disorder using item K0100. If any of the conditions indicated in items K0100A through K0100D is present, then the resident has swallowing disorder. If none of these conditions is present, the r esident does not have a swallowing disorder for purposes of this calculation. Presence of Swallowing Disorder? (Yes/No) _____ STEP #7 Determine whether the resident has a mechanically altered diet. If K0510C2 (mechanically altered diet while a resident ) is checked, then the resident has a mechanically altered diet. Presence of Mechanically Altered Diet? (Yes/No) _____ STEP #8 Determine how many of the following conditions are present based on Steps 6 and 7: a. The resident has neither a swallowing disorder nor a mechanically altered diet. b. The resident has either a swallowing disorder or a mechanically altered diet. c. The resident has both a swallowing disorder and a mechanically altered diet. Presence of Mechanically Altered Diet or Swallowing Disorder? (Neither/Either/Both): _____ CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 28 STEP #9 Determine the resident 's SLP group using the responses from Steps 1- 8 and the table below.

Determine whether the resident has HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is not reported on the MDS but is recorded on the SNF claim (ICD -10-CM code B20). Resident has HIV/AIDS? (Yes/No) _____ 2. Determine whether the resident meets the criteria for the comorbidity: \"Parenteral/IV Feeding - High Intensity\" or the comorbidity: \"Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity .\" To do so, first determine if the resident received parenteral/IV feeding during the last 7 days while a resident of the SNF using item K0510A2. If the resident did not receive parenteral/IV feedi ng during the last 7 days while a resident , then the resident does not meet the criteria for Parenteral/IV Feeding - High Intensity or Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity. If the resident did receive parenteral/IV feeding during the last 7 days while a r esident , then use item K0710A to determine if the proportion of total calories the resident received through parenteral or tube feeding was 51% or more while a resident (K0710A2 = 3). If K0710A2 = 3, then the resident meets the criteria for Parenteral/IV F eeding - High Intensity. If the proportion of total calories the resident received through parenteral or tube feeding was 26 - 50% (K0710A2 = 2) and average fluid intake per day by IV or tube feeding was 501 cc per day or more while a resident (K0710B2 = 2), then the resident qualifies for Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity. Presence of Parenteral/IV Feeding - High Intensity? (Yes/No) _____ Presence of Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity? (Yes/No) _____ 3.

Finally, round this sum to the nearest integer. This is the PDPM Function Score for nursing payment . The PDPM Function Score for nursing payment ranges from 0 through 16. PDPM NURSING F UNCTION SCORE : _____ STEP #2 Determine the resident 's nursing case -mix group using the hierarchical classification below. Nursing classification under PDPM employs the hierarchical classification method. Hierarchical classification is used in some payment systems, in staffing analysis, and in many research projects. In the hierarchical approach, start at the top and work down through the PDPM nursing classification model steps discussed below; the assigned classification is the first group for which the resident qualifies. In other words, start with the Ext ensive Services groups at the top of the PDPM nursing classification model. Then go down through the groups in hierarchical order: Extensive Services, Special Care High, Special Care Low, Clinically Complex, Behavioral Symptoms and Cognitive Performance, a nd Reduced Physical Function. When you find the first of the 25 individual PDPM nursing groups for which the resident qualifies, assign that group as the PDPM nursing classification. 1 Calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Lying and Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed. Divide this sum by 2. This is the Average Bed Mobility Function Score. 2 Calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Stand, Chair/Bed -to-Chair, and Toil et Transfer. Divide by 3. This is the Average Transfer Function Score. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 35 CATEGORY: EXTENSIVE SERVICES The classification groups in this category are based on various services provided. Use the following instructions to begin the calculation: STEP #1 Determine whether the resident is coded for one of the following treatments or services: O0100E2 Tracheostomy care while a resident O0100F2 Ventilato r or respirator while a resident O0100M2 Isolation or quarantine for active infectious disease while a resident If the resident does not receive one of these treatments or services, skip to the Special Care High Category now. STEP #2 If at least one of these treatments or services is coded and the resident has a total PDPM Nursing Function Score of 14 or less, he or she classifies in the Extensive Services category.

The following items comprise the PHQ -9\u00a9: CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 43 Resident Staff Description D0200A D0500A Little interest or pleasure in doing things D0200B D0500B Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless D0200C D0500C Trouble falling or staying asleep, sleeping too much D0200D D0500D Feeling tired or having little energy D0200E D0500E Poor appetite or overeating D0200F D0500F Feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or have let yourself down or your family down D0200G D0500G Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television D0200H D0500H Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed. Or the opposite - being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual D0200I D0500I Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way - D0500J Being short -tempered, easily annoyed These items are used to calculate a Total Severity Score for the resident interview at i tem D0300 and for the staff ass essment at i tem D0600. A higher Total Severity Score is associated with more symptoms of depression. For the resident interview, a Total Severity Score of 99 indicates that the interview was not successful. The resident qualifies as depressed for PDPM classification in either of the two following cases: The D0300 Total Severity Score is greater than or equal to 10 but not 99, or The D0600 Total Severity Score is greater than or equal to 10. Resident Qualifies as Depressed Yes _____ No _____ STEP #3 Select the Clinically Complex classification based on the PDPM Nursing Function Score and the presence or absence of depression according to this table: Nursing Function Score Depressed ? PDPM Nursing Classification 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 44 CATEGORY: BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE Classification in this category is based on the presence of certain behavioral symptoms or the resident 's cognitive performance. Use the following instructions: STEP #1 Determine the resident 's PDPM Nursing Function Score. If the resident 's PDP M Nursing Function Score i s 11 or greater, go to Step #2. If the PDPM Nursing Function Score is less than 11, skip to the Reduced P hysical Function Category now. STEP #2 If the resident interview using the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) was not conducted (i ndicated by a value of \"0\" for i tem C0100), skip the remainder of this step and proceed to Step #3 to check staff asses sment for cognitive impairment. Determine the resident 's cognitive status based on resident interview using the BIMS. Instructions for completing the BIMS are in Chapter 3, Section C. The BI MS items involve the following: C0200 Repetition of three words C0300 Temporal orientation C0400 Recall Item C0500 provides a BIMS Summary Score for these items and indicates the resident 's cognitive performance, with a score of 15 indicating the best cognitive performance and 0 indicating the worst performance. If the resident interview is not successful, then the BIMS Summ ary Score will equal 99. If the resident 's Summary Score is less than or equal to 9, he or she classifies in the Behavioral Symptoms and Cognitive Performance category. Skip to Step #5. If the resident 's Summary Score is greater than 9 but not 99, proceed to Step #4 to check behavioral symptoms . If the resident 's Summary Score is 99 ( resident interview not successful) or the Summary Score is blank ( resident interview not attempted and skipped) or the Summary Score has a dash value (not assessed), proceed to Step #3 to check staff assessment for cognitive impairment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 45 STEP #3 Determine the resident 's cognitive status based on the staff assessment rather than on resident interview.

To calculate the total case- mix adjusted per diem rate, add all component per diem rates calculated in prior steps together, along with the non- case- mix rate component, as shown in the following equa tion: Total Case -Mix Adjusted Per Diem Payment = (PT Component Per Diem Rate * PT Variable Per Diem Adjustment Factor) + (OT Component Per Diem Rate * OT Variable Per Diem Adjustment Factor) + SLP Component Per Diem Rate + (NTA Component Per Diem Rate * NT A Variable Per Diem Adjustment Factor) + Nursing Component Per Diem Rate + Non- Case -Mix Component Per Diem Rate CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 50 6.7 SNF PPS Policies Requirements and policies for SNF PPS are described in greater detail in Chapter 8 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual ( https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/bp102c08.pdf ). There are some situations that the SNF may encounter that may impac t Medicare Part A SNF coverage for a resident , affect the PPS assessment schedule, or impact the rei mbursement received by the SNF. Delay in Requiring and Receiving Skilled Services (30 -Day Transfer) There are instances in which the resident does not require SNF level of care services when initially admitted to the SNF. When the resident requires and receives SNF level of care services within 30 days from the hospital discharge, Day 1 for the PPS asses sment schedule is the day on which SNF level of care services begin. For example, if a resident is discharged from the hospital on August 1 and the SNF determines on August 30 that the resident requires skilled service for a condition that was treated duri ng the qualifying hospital stay, then the SNF would start the PPS assessment schedule with a 5 -Day PPS assessment, with August 30 as Day 1 for scheduling purposes. However, if the resident requires and receives a SNF level of care 31 or more days after the hospital discharge, the resident does not qualify for a SNF Part A stay (see Medical Appropriateness Exception below). Medical Appropriateness Exception (Deferred Treatment) An elapsed period of more than 30 days is permitted for starting SNF Part A servi ces when a resident 's condition makes it inappropriate to begin an active course of treatment in a SNF immediately after a qualifying hospital stay discharge. It is applicable only where, under accepted medical practice, the established pattern of treatmen t for a particular condition indicates that a covered level of SNF care will be required within a predeterminable time frame, and it is medically predictable at the time of hospital discharge that the resident will require SNF level of care within a predet ermined time period (for more detailed information see Chapter 8 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual ). For example, a resident is admitted to the SNF after a qualifying hospital stay for an open reduction and internal fixation of a hip. It is determined upon hospital discharge that the resident is not ready for weight -bearing activity but will most likely be ready in 4 -6 weeks. The physician writes an order to start therapy when the resident is able to tolerate weight bearing. Once the resident is able to start therapy, the Medicare Part A stay begins, and the 5- Day assessment will be performed. Day 1 of the stay will be the first day on which the resident starts therapy services. Interrupted Stay An \"interrupted\" SNF stay is defined as one in which a resi dent is discharged from SNF care and subsequently readmitted to the same SNF (not a different SNF) within 3 days or less after the discharge (the \"interruption window\"). The interruption window is a 3- day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days, ending at midnight. In other words, the resident must return to the same SNF by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day. The CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 51 interruption window begins on the first non- covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A-covered stay. If both conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and the assessment schedule. The variable per diem schedule continues from the day of the previous discharge. For example, if the resident was discharged on Day 7, payment rates resume at Day 7 upon readmission. The assessment schedule also continues from the day of the previous discharge. Thus, no new 5- Day assessment is required upon the subsequent readmission, although the optional IPA may be completed at clinician's discretion. If a resident is readmitted to the same SNF more than 3 consecutive calendar days after discharge, OR in any instance when the resident is admitted to a different SNF (regardless of the length of time between stays), then the Interrupted Stay Policy does not apply , and the subsequent stay i s considered a new stay. In such cases, the variable per diem schedule resets to Day 1 payment rates, and the assessment schedule also resets to Day 1, necessitating the completion of a new 5 -Day assessment. Example 1: Mrs. A is admitted to the SNF on 11/07/19. She is admitted to a hospital on 11/20/19. She returns to the same SNF on 11/25/19. Because Mrs. A is readmitted to the same SNF more than three calendar days after discharge, this would be considered a new stay. The assessment schedule would be reset to Day 1, beginning with a new 5- Day assessment, and the variable per diem schedule would begin from Day 1. Example 2: Mr. B is admitted to the SNF on 11/07/19. He is admitted to the hospital on 11/20/19. H e is admitted to a different SNF on 11/22/19. Be cause Mr. B is admitted to a different SNF, this would be considered a new stay. The assessment schedule would be reset, beginning with a new 5 -Day assessment, and the variable per diem schedule would begin from Day 1. Example 3: Mrs. C is admitted to the SNF on 11/07/19. She is admitted to a hospital on 11/20/19. She returns to the same SNF on 11/22/19. Because Mrs. C is admitted to the same SNF within three days from the point of discharge, this would be considered a continuation of the previous stay. No 5- Day assessment would be required upon readmission, though the IPA would be an option. Additionally, the variable per diem would continue from Day 14 (Day of Discharge). Resident Discharged from Part A Skilled Services and Returns to SNF Part A Skilled Level Services In the situation in which a resident is discharged from SNF Medicare Part A services and later requires SNF Part A skilled level of care services, and it is not an instance of an interrupted stay (as described above), the resident may be eligible for Medicare Part A SNF coverage if the following criteria are met: 1. Less than 30 days have elapsed since the last day on which SNF level of care services were required and rec eived, CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 52 2. SNF-level services required by the resident are for a condition that was treated during the qualifying hospital stay or for a condition that arose while receiving care in the SNF for a condition for which the beneficiary was previously treated in t he hospital, 3. Services must be reasonable and necessary, 4. Services can only be provided on an inpatient basis, 5. Resident must require and receive the services on a daily basis, and 6. Resident has remaining days in the SNF benefit period. For greater detail, ref er to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual , Chapter 8. 6.8 Non-compliance with the SNF PPS Assessment Schedule To receive payment under the SNF PPS, the SNF must complete scheduled and unscheduled assessments as described in Chapter 2. According to 42 CFR 41 3.343, an assessment that does not have an ARD within the prescribed ARD window will be paid at the default rate for the number of days the ARD is out of compliance. Frequent late assessment scheduling practices or missing assessments may result in additio nal review. The default rate (ZZZZZ) takes the place of the otherwise applicable Federal rate. It is equal to the sum of the rate paid for the case- mix group reflecting the lowest acuity level under each PDPM component, and would generally be lower than the Medicare rate payable if the SNF had submitted an assessment in accordance with the prescribed assessment schedule. Late Assessment If the SNF fails to set the ARD within the defined ARD window for a PPS assessment, and the resident is still on Part A, the SNF must complete a late assessment. The ARD can be no earlier than the day the error was identified. The SNF will bill the default rate for the number of days that the assessment is out of compliance. This is equal to the number of days between the day following the last day of the available ARD window and the late ARD (including the late ARD). The SNF would then bill the Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) code established by the late assessment for the remaining period of time that the assessment would have controlled payment. For example, a 5 -Day assessment with an ARD of Day 11 is out of compliance for 3 days and t herefore would be paid at the default rate for Days 1 through 3 and the HIPPS code from the late 5 -Day assessment for the remainder of the Part A stay, unless an IPA is completed. In the case of a late assessment, the variable per diem schedule still begin s on Day 1 of the stay and not with the late assessment ARD and default billing will be assessed prior to billing based on the late 5 -Day assessment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 53 Missed Assessment If the SNF fails to set the ARD of a PPS assessment prior to the end of the last day of the ARD window, and the resident is no longer a SNF Part A resident , and as a result a PPS assessment does not exist in the QIES ASAP system for the payment period, the provider may not usually bill for days when an assessment does not exist in the QIES AS AP system . When a PPS assessment does not exist in the QIES ASAP system , there is not a HIPPS code the provider may bill. In order to bill for Medicare SNF Part A services, the provider must submit a valid PPS assessment that is accepted into the QIES ASAP system . The provider must bill the HIPPS code that is verified by the system. If the resident was already discharged from Medicare Part A when this is discovered, a PPS assessment may not be performed. However, there are instances when the SNF may bill the default code when a PPS assessment does not exist in the QIES ASAP system. These exceptions are: 1. The stay is less than 8 days within a spell of illness, 2. The SNF is notified on an untimely basis of or is unaware of a Medicare Secondary Payer denial, 3. The S NF is notified on an untimely basis of a beneficiary's enrollment in Medicare Part A, 4. The SNF is notified on an untimely basis of the revocation of a payment ban, 5. The beneficiary requests a demand bill, or 6. The SNF is notified on an untimely basis or is una ware of a beneficiary's disenrollment from a Medicare Advantage plan. ARD Outside the Medicare Part A SNF Benefit A SNF may not use a date outside the SNF Part A Medicare Benefit (i.e., 100 days) as the ARD for a PPS assessment. For example, the resident returns to the SNF on December 11 following a hospital stay, requires and receives SNF skilled services (and meets all other required coverage criteria), and has 3 days left in his or her SNF benefit period. The SNF must set the ARD for the PPS assessment o n December 11, 12, or 13 to bill for the HIPPS code associated with the assessment.

CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix A: Glossary and Common Acronyms October 2019 Appendix A -10 Term Abbreviation Definition Interrupted Sta y Interrupted Stay is a Medicare Part A SNF stay in which a resident is discharged from SNF care (i.e., the resident is discharged from a Medicare Part A -covered stay) and subsequently resumes SNF care in the same SNF for a Medicare Part A -covered stay during the interruption window. Interrupt ion Window The interruption window is a 3- day period, starting with the calendar day of discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or ret urn to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A- covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non -covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A -covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A -covered stay for the purposes of both the v ariable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion. Invalid Record As defined by the MDS Correction Policy, a record that was accepted into QIES ASAP that should not have been submitted.

Interruption Window Is a 3 -day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A -covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non -covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A -covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A - covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completi on.

Examples include, but are not limited to, th e following: o Resident elects the hospice benefit , thereby declining the SNF benefit , and then revokes the hospice benefit and resumes SNF -level care within the interruption window . o Resident refuses to participate in rehabilitation and has no other daily skilled need; this ends the Part A coverage. Within the interruption window , the resident decides to engage in the planned rehabilitation regime and Part A coverage resumes. o Resident changes payer sources from Medicare Part A to an alternate payer source (i.e. , hospice, private pay or private insurance) and then wishes to resume their Medicare Part A stay, at the same SNF, within the interruption window . 3 A0310 A-10 If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF, and resumes a Part A -covered stay in the SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. No discharge assessment (OBRA or Part A PPS) is required, nor is an Entry Tracking Record or 5- Day requi red on resumption. If a resident leaves the SNF and returns to resume Part A - covered services in the same SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. Although this situation does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay, the resident lef t the SNF, and therefore an OBRA Discharge assessment is required. On return to the SNF, no 5 -Day would be required. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated.

If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF and does not resume Part A -covered services within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, a Part A PPS Discharge is required. If the resident qualif ies and there is a resumption of Part A services within the 30- day window allowed by Medicare, a 5 -Day would be required as this would be considered a new Part A stay. The OBRA schedule would continue from the resident's original date of admission ( item A1 900). If a resident leaves the SNF and does not return to resume Part A -covered services in the same SNF within the interruption window , an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, both the Part A PPS and OBRA Discharge assessments are required (and may be combined). If the resident returns to the same SNF, this would be considered a new Part A stay. An Entry Tracking record and 5 -Day would be required on r eturn. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. The OBRA assessment schedule is unaffected by the interrupted stay policy. Please refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on OBRA assessment scheduling requirements. 3 A0410 A-12 Nursing homes and swing -bed facilities must be certain they are submitting MDS assessments to the QIES ASAP system for those residents who are on a Medicare and/or Medicaid certified unit.

Assistance with tube feedings or TPN parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding Eating. o If the resident eats and drinks by mouth, and relies partially on obtaining nutrition and liquids via tube feedings or TPN parenteral nutrition , code E ating based on the amount of assistance the resident requires to eat and drink by mouth. Assistance with tube feedings or TPN parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding Eating. 3 GG0130 GG-16 Examples for Coding Admission, Interim, Performance or Discharge Performance Track Changes from Chapter 3 Section GG v1.16 to Chapter 3 Section GG v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 7 Chapter Section Page Change 3 GG0130 GG-21 1. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. J uses a bedside commode . The certified nursing assistant provides steadying (touching) assistance as Mrs. J pulls down her pants and underwear before sitting down on the toiletcommode . When Mrs. J is finished voiding or having a bowel movement , the certified nursing assistant provides steadying assistance as Mrs. J wipes her perineal area and pulls up her pants and underwear without ass istance. 3 GG0130 GG-21 3. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. P has urinary urgency. As soon as she gets in the bathroom, she asks the certified nursing assistant to lift her gown and pull down her underwear due to her balance problems . After voiding, Mrs. P wipes hers elf and, pulls her underwear back up, and adjusts her gown. 3 GG0130 GG-23 2. Shower/bathe self: Mrs. E has a severe and progressive neurological condition that has affected her endurance as well as her fine and gross motor skills. She is transferred to the shower bench with partial/moderate assistance. Mrs. E showers while sitting on a tubshower bench and washes her arms and chest using a wash mitt. A certified nursing assistant then must help wash the remaining parts of her body, as a result of Mrs. E's fatigue, to complete the activity. Mrs. E uses a long -handled shower hand -held showerhead to rinse herself but tires halfway through the task. The certified nursing assistant dries Mrs. E's entire body. 3 GG0130 GG-25 Rationale: Mrs. Y dresses and undresses her upper body and requires a helper only to retrieve and put away her clothing, that is, setting up the clothing for her use. The description refers to Mrs. Y as \"independent\" (when removing clothes), but she needs setup assistance, so she is not independent with regard to the entire activity of upper body dressing. Track Changes from Chapter 3 Section GG v1.16 to Chapter 3 Section GG v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 8 Chapter Section Page Change 3 GG0130 GG-26 1. Lower body dressing: Mr. D is required to follow hip precautions as a result of recent hip surgery. The occupational therapist in the acute care hospital instructed him in the use of adaptive equipment to facilitate lower body dressing. He requires a helper to retrieve his clothing from the closet. Mr. D uses his adaptive equipment to assist in threading his legs into his pants. Because of balance issues, Mr. D needs the helper to steady him when standing to manage pulling on or pulling down his pants/ undergarments. Mr. D also needs some assistance to put on and take off his socks and shoes. 3 GG0130 GG-27 3. Lower body dressing: Mrs. R has peripheral neuropathy in her upper and lower extremities. Each morning, Mrs. R needs assistance from a helper to place her lower limb into, or to take it out of (don/doff), her lower limb prosthesis. She needs no assistance to put on and remove her underwear or slacks. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: A helper performs less than half the effort of lower body dressing (with a prosthesis considered a piece of clothing). The helper lifts, holds, or supports Mrs. R's trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort for the task of lower body dressing. In contrast, coding le vel 04, Supervision or touching assistance, is used if the helper provides either verbal cues and/or only touching/steadying assistance as the resident completes the activity. Track Changes from Chapter 3 Section GG v1.16 to Chapter 3 Section GG v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 9 Chapter Section Page Change 3 GG0130 GG-28 2. Putting on/taking off footwear: Mrs. F was admitted to the SNF f or a neurologic condition and experiences visual impairment and fine motor coordination and endurance issues. She requires setup for retrieving her socks and shoes, which she prefers to keep in the closet. Mrs. F often drops her shoes and socks as she attempts to put them onto her feet or as she takes them off. Often a certified nursing assistant must first thread her socks or shoes over her toes, and then Mrs. F can complete the task. Mrs. F needs the certified nursing assistant to initiate taking off her socks and unstrapping the Velcro used for fastening her shoes. Coding: GG0130H GG0170 GG-34 GG0170: Mobility (3 -day assessment period) Interim Performance (Interim Payment Assessment - Optional) Track Changes from Chapter 3 Section GG v1.16 to Chapter 3 Section GG v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 10 Chapter Section Page Change 3 GG0170 GG-37 1. Assess the resident's mobility performance based on direct observation, as well as the resident's incorporating resident self-report and the report s ofand reports from qualified clinicians, direct care staff, or family documented in the resident's medical record during the three -day assessment period. CMS anticipates that a multidisciplinary team of qualified clinicians is involv ed in assessing the resident during the three -day assessment period. For Section GG, the assessment period is the first three days of the Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare Stay. On admission, these items are compl eted only when A0310B = 01 (5 -Day PPS assessment). For the Interim Payment Assessment (A0310B=08), the assessment period for Section GG is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and two days prior). 3 GG0170 GG-37 5. The admission functional assessment, when possible, should be conducted prior to the personresident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to determine a reflect the resident's true admission baseline functional status on admission . If treatment has started, for example, on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. 3 GG0170 GG-38 Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance : if the helper provides verbal cues or touching /steadying /contact guard assista nce as resident completes activ ity. Assista nce may be provided throughout the ac tivity or intermittently. For example, the resident requires ve rbal c ueing, coax ing, or gene ral supervision for safe ty to complete the act ivity; or resident may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steady ing assistance during the activity. 3 GG0170 GG-37- GG-67 Continued page title revised.

For Section GG on the IPA, providers will use the same 6- point scale and activi ty not attempted codes to complete the column \"Interim Performance,\" which will capture the interim functional performance of the resident. The ARD for the IPA is determined by the provider, and the assessment period is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and t he 2 calendar days prior). It is important to note that the IPA changes payment beginning on the ARD and continues until the end of the Medicare Part A stay or until another IPA is completed. The IPA does not affect the variable per diem schedule. 3 GG017 0 GG-40 Admission, Interim, and Discharge Performance Coding Tips 3 GG0170 GG-40 General Coding Tips When reviewing the medical record, interviewing staff, and observing the resident, be familiar with the definition for each activity.

Chair/bed -to-chair transfer: M r. U had his left lower leg amputated due to gangrene associated with his diabetes mellitus and he has reduced sensation and strength in his right leg. He has not yet received his below -the-knee prosthesis. Mr. U uses a transfer board for chair/bed- to-chair transfers. The therapist places the transfer board u nder his buttock. Mr. U then attempts to scoot from the bed onto the transfer board. Mr. U has reduced sensation in his hands and limited upper bod y strength, but assists with the transfer. Th e physical therapist assists him in side scooting by lifting his buttocks/ trunk in a rocking motion across the transfer board and into the wheelchair. 3 GG0170 GG-51 Coding Tips for GG0170G, Car transfer For item GG0170G, Car transfer, use of an indoor car can be used to simulate outdoor car transfers. These half or full cars would need to have similar physical features of a real car for the purpose of simulating a car transfer, that is, a car seat within a car cabin. The Car transfer item does not include transfers into the driver's seat, opening/closing the car door , fastening/unfastening the seat belt. The Car transfer item includes the resident's ability to transfer in and out of the passenger seat of a car or car simulator. In the event of inclement weather or if an indoor car simulator or outdoor car is not available during the entire 3-day assessment period , then use code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations. If at the time of the assessment the resident is unable to attempt car transfers, and could not perform the car transfers prior to the cu rrent illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable. 3 GG0170 GG-53 4. Walk 10 feet : Mr. O has bilateral upper extremity tremors, lower extremity weakness, and Parkinson's disease. A therapy physical therapist assistant guides and steadies the shaking, rolling walker forward while cueing Mr. O to take larger steps. Mr. O requires steadying at the beginning of the walk and progressively requires some of his weight to be supported for the last two feet of the 10 -foot walk.

Walk 50 feet with two turns: Mr. T walks 50 feet with the therapist providing trunk support and the therapy assistant providing supervision. He also requires a second helper, the rehabilitation aide, who provides supervision and follows closely behind with a wheelchair for safety. Mr. T walks the 50 feet with two turns with the assistance of two helpers . 3 GG0170 GG-57 If the resident walks and is not learning how to mobilize in a wheelchair, and only uses a wheelchair for transport between locations within the facility or for staff convenience (e.g., because the resident walks slowly) , code the wheelchair gateway items at admission and/or discharge\u2014GG0170Q1 and/or GG0170Q3, Does the resident use a wheelchair/scooter? \u2014as 0, No, and skip all remai ning wheelchair questions. 3 GG0170 GG-58 3. Wheel 50 feet with two turns : Mr. R is very motivated to use his motorized wheelchair with an adaptive throttle for speed and steering. Mr. R has a myotrophic l ateral s clerosis , and moving his upper and lower extremities is very difficult. The therapy physical therapist assistant is required to walk next to Mr. R for frequent readjustments of his hand position to better control the steering and speed throttle. Mr. R often drives too close to corners, becoming stuck near doorways upon turning, preventing him from continui ng to mobilize/wheel himself. The therapy physical therapist assistant backs up Mr. R's wheelchair for him so that he may continue mobilizing/wheeling himself. 3 GG0170 GG-59 5. Wheel 50 feet with two turns: Mr. V had a spinal tumor resulting in paralysis of his lower extremities. The therapy physical therapist assistant provides verbal instruction for Mr. V to navigate his manual wheelchair in his room and into the hallway while making two turns. 3 GG0170 GG-61 9. Wheel 150 feet : Mr. A has a cardiac condition with medical precautions that do not allow him to participate in propel his own wheelchair mobilization . Mr. A is completely dependent on a helper to wheel him 150 feet using a manual wheelchair.

Ms. K is a 67 -year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes who is admitted after a stroke. The diagnosis of stroke, as well as the history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes, is documented in Ms. K's history and physical by the adm itting physician. Coding: I0020 would be coded 01, Stroke. I0020B would be coded as I69.051 The physician's history and physical documents the diagnosis stroke as the reason for Ms. K's admission. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. 3 I0020 I-3 2. Mrs. E is an 82 -year-old female who was hospitalized for a hip fracture with subsequent total hip replacement and is admitted for rehabilitation. The admitting physician documents Mrs. E's primary medical condition as total hip replacement (THR) in her medical record. The hip fracture resulting in the total hip replacement is also documented in the medical record in the discharge summary from the acute care hospital. Coding: I0020 would be coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. I0020B would be coded as S72.062D (Displaced ar ticular fracture of the head of the left femur). Rationale: Medical record documentation demonstrates that Mrs. E had a total hip replacement due to a hip fracture and required rehabilitation. Because she was admitted for rehabilitation as a result of the hip fracture and total hip replacement, Mrs. E's primary medical condition category is 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The ICD-10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category.

Mrs. H is a 93 -year-old female with a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease who is admitted to the facility, where she will complete her course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics after an acute episode of urosepsis. The discharge diagnoses of urosepsis, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension are documented in the physician's discharge summary from the acute care hospital and are incorporated into Mrs. H's medical record. Coding: I0020 would be coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. Rationale: The physician's discharge summary from the acute care hospital documents the need for IV antibiotics due to urosepsis as the reason for Mrs. H's admission to the facility. 3 I0020 I-4 3. Mrs. H is a 78 -year-old female with a history of hypertension and a hip replacement 2 years ago. She was admitted to an extended hospitalization for idiopathic pancreatitis. She had a central line placed during the hospitalization so she could receive TPN (total parenteral nutrition). She also received r egular blood glucose monitoring and treatment with insulin when she became hyperglycemic. During her SNF stay, she is being transitioned from being NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving her nutrition parenterally to being able to tolerate oral nutrition. Th e hospital discharge diagnoses of idiopathic pancreatitis, hypertension, and malnutrition were incorporated into Mrs. H's SNF medical record. Coding: I0020 would be coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. I0020B would be coded as K85.00 (Idiopathic acute pancreatitis without necrosis or infection). Rationale: Mrs. H had hospital care for pancreatitis immediately prior to her SNF stay. Her principal diagnosis of pancreatitis was included in the summary from the hospital. The surgical placement of her central line does not change her care to a surgical category because it is not considered to be a major surgery. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category.

Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident and his or her family or significant other about any surgical procedures that occurred during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. 2. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. Medical record sources include medical records received from facilities where the resident received health care during the inpatien t hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, progress notes, and other resources as available. 3 J2100 J-38 Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if the resident did not have major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission.

Identify recent surgeries: The surgeries in this section must have been documented by a physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 30 days and must have occurred during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission . Medical record sources for recent surgeries include progress notes, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, diagnosis/problem list, and other r esources as available. Although open communication regarding resident information between the physician and other members of the interdisciplinary team is important, it is also essential that resident information communicated verbally be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure follow -up. Surgery informat ion, including past history obtained from family members and close contacts, must also be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure validity and follow -up. Track Changes from Chapter 3 Section J v1.16R to Chapter 3 Section J v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 7 Chapter Section Page Change 3 J2300 - J5000 J-40 2. Determine whether the surgeries require active care during the SNF stay: Once a recent surgery is identified, it must be determined if the surgery requires active care during the SNF stay . Surgeries requiring active care during the SNF stay are surgeries that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF d iagnosis, as coded in I0020B. Do not include conditions that have been resolved, do not affect the resident's current status, or do not drive the resident's plan of care during the 7 -day look- back period, as these would be considered surgeries that do not require active care during the SNF stay . Check the following information sources in the medical record for the last 30 days to identify \"active\" surgeries: transfer documents, physician progress notes, recent history and physical, recent discharge summaries, nursing assessments, nursing care plans, medication sheets, doctor's orders, consults and official diagnostic reports, and other sources as available. 3 J2300 - J5000 J-40 Coding Instructions Code surgeries that are documented to have occurred in the last 30 days, and during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission, that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF diagnosis, as coded in I0020B .

There may be specific documentation in the medical record by a physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specia list. \u2014 The physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) may specifically indicate that the SNF stay is for treatment related to the surgical intervention. Specific documentation ma y be found in progress notes, most recent history and physical, transfer notes, hospital discharge summary, etc. 3 J2300 - J5000 J-43 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) In the rare circumstance of the absence of specific documentation that a surgery requires active SNF care, the following indicators may be used to confirm that the surgery requires active SNF care: The inherent complexity of the services prescribed for a resident is such that they can be performed safely and /or effectively only by or under the general supervision of skilled nursing. For example: \u2014 The management of a surgical wound that requires skilled care (e.g., managing potential infection or drainage). \u2014 Daily skilled therapy to restore functional loss after surgical procedure s. \u2014 Administration of medication and monitoring that requires skilled nursing. Track Changes from Chapter 3 Section J v1.16R to Chapter 3 Section J v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 12 Chapter Section Page Change 3 J2300 - J5000 J-43 Examples of surgeries requiring active SNF care and related to the primary SNF diagnosis 1. Mrs. V was hospitalized for gram -negative pneumonia. Since this was her second episode of pneumonia in the past six months, a diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed while in the hospital. She also has Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. She was di scharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment for her pneumonia and requires daily skilled care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions, and the I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is J15.6, Pneumonia due to other aerobic Gram -negative bacteria. There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. V did not receive any major surgery during the prior inpatient stay, and she was admitted to the SNF for continued care due to pneumonia . 3 J2300 - J5000 J-43 2. Mrs. O, a diabetic, was hospitalized for sepsis from an infection due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus that developed after outpatient bunion surgery . A central line was placed to administer antibiotics. She was discharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is A41.01 (Sepsis due to Methicillin susceptible S taphylococcus aureus). There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Neither the placement of a central line nor the outpatient bunion surgery is considered to be a major surgery , but the resident was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring. Track Changes from Chapter 3 Section J v1.16R to Chapter 3 Section J v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 13 Chapter Section Page Change 3 J2300 - J5000 J-44 3. Mrs. H was hospitalized for severe back pain from a compression fracture of a lumbar vertebral body, which was caused by her age -related osteoporosis. She was treated with a kyphoplasty that relieved her pain. She was transferred to a SNF after discharge because of her mild dementia and need to regulate her anticoagulant treatment f or atrial fibrillation. Coding: I0020 is coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is M80.08XD (Age -related osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, vertebra(e), subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing). There was no documentation that the resident had major surgery; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. H was treated with a kyphoplasty during the inpatient stay prior to SNF admission. Although k yphoplasty is a minor surgery and does not require SNF care in and of itself, the resident has other conditions requiring skilled care that are unrelated to the kyphoplasty surgery. 3 J2300 - J5000 J-44 4. Mrs. J had a craniotomy to drain a subdural hematoma after suffering a fall at home. She has COPD and uses oxygen at night. In addition, she has moderate congestive heart failure, is moderately overw eight, and has hypothyroidism. After a six-day hospital stay, she was discharged to a SNF for continuing care. The hospital discharge summary indicated that the patient had a loss of consciousness of 45 minutes. Coding: I0020 is coded 07, Other Neurological Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is S06.5X2D (Traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes, subsequent encounter). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2600, Neuro surgery - brain, surrounding tissue or blood vessels , would be checked. Rationale: The craniotomy surgery during the inpatient stay immediately preceding the SNF stay requires continued skilled care and skilled monitoring for wound care, as well as therapies to address any deficits that led to her fall or any functional deficits resulting from her fall.

Mr. D was admitted to an acute care hospital for cytoreductive surgery for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic renal cell carcinoma and post -surgic al care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is C 79.01 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of the right kidney and renal pelvis ). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2810 , Genitourinary surgery - the kidneys, ureter, adrenals, and bladder - open, laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. D was treated with a surgical procedure, genitourinary surgery of the kidney , and admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic kidney cancer and post -surgical care. 3 J2300 - J5000 J-45 6. Mr. G was admitted to an acute care hospital for severe abdominal pain. He was found to have diverticulitis of the small intestine with perforation and abscess without bleeding. He had surgery to repair the perforati on. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is K57.00 (Diverticulitis of small with perforation and abscess without bleeding ), and J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2910, Major surgery - the GI tract and abdominal contents from the esophagus to the anus, the biliary tree, gall bladder, liver, pancreas, spleen - open or laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. G was tr eated with a surgical procedure, repair of the small intestine perforation, which is a major surgical procedure. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care.

Mr. W underwent surgical repair for a left fractured hip (i.e., subtrochanteric fracture) during an inpatient hospitalization. He was admitted to the SNF for post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded as Code 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is S72.22XD (Displace d subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, subsequent encounter for closed fracture with routine healing) and J2100 is coded as 1, Yes. J2510, Ortho surgery - repair fractures of pelvis, hip, leg, knee, or ankle , would be checked. Rationale: This is major s urgery requiring skilled nursing care to provide wound care and to monitor for early signs of infection or blood clots, for which Mr. W was admitted to the SNF.

K0710B2 would be coded 2, 501 cc/day or more, and K0710B3 would be coded 1, 500 cc/day or less. Rationale: The total fluid intake within the last 7 days while Mr. K. was not a resident was 1,900 cc (400 cc + 520 cc + 500 cc + 480 cc = 1,900 cc). Average fluid intake while not a resident totaled 475 cc (1,900 cc divided by 4 days). 475 cc is less than 500 cc, therefore code 1, 500 cc/day or less is correct for K0710B1, While NOT a Resident .

The definition and criteria of \"significant change of status\" is found in Chapter 2, pag e 20Section 2.6, 03. Significant Change i n Status Assessment (SCSA) (A0310A = 04). Regardless of whether the resident meets the criteria for an SCSA, a modification of the resident's plan of care will likely need to be completed. 3 O0400 O-15 Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining as much independence as possible in activities of daily living , mobility , and communication is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, breathing problems , and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries , which contribute to diminished quality of life. The qualified therapist, in conjunction with the physician and nursing administration, is responsible for determining the necessity for, and the frequency and duration of, the therapy services provided to residents. 3 O0400 O-16 Group minutes \u2014Enter the total number of minutes of therapy that were provided in a group in the last 7 days.

All policies regarding mode, modalities and st udent supervision must be followed as well as all other federal, state, practice and facility policies. For example, if two therapists (from different disciplines) were conducting a group treatment session, the group must be comprised of four two to six participants who were doing the same or similar activities in each discipline. The decision to co- treat should be made on a case by case basis and the need for co - treatment should be well documented for each patient. Because co -treatment is appropriate for s pecific clinical circumstances and would not be suitable for all residents, its use should be limited. 3 O0400 O-23 Modes of Therapy A resident may receive therapy via different modes during the same day or even treatment session. When developing the plan of care, the therapist and assistant must determine which mode(s) of therapy and the amount of time the resident receives for each mode and code the MDS appropriately . The therapist and assistant should document the reason a specific mode of therapy was chosen as well as anticipated goals for that mode of therapy. For any therapy that does not meet one of the therapy mode definitions below, those minutes may not be counted on the MDS. (Please also see the section on group therapy for limited exceptions rel ated to group size.) The therapy mode definitions must always be followed and apply regardless of when the therapy is provided in relationship to all assessment windows (i.e., applies whether or not the resident is in a look back period for an MDS assessme nt). 3 O0400 O-23 NOTE: The minutes being coded on the MDS are unadjusted minutes, meaning, the minutes are coded in the MDS as the full time spent in therapy; however, the software grouper will allocate the minutes appropriately.

If therapy is ongoing, the Therapy End Date (O0400A6, O0400B6, and O0400C6) would be das h filled. For example, Mr. T. was admitted to the nursing home following a fall that resulted in a hip fracture in May 2013. Occupational and Physical therapy started May 10, 2013. His physical therapy ended May 23, 2013 but the occupational therapy conti nued. Due to observed swallowing issues, he was referred to SLP on May 31, 2013 and the speech- language pathologist evaluated him on that day. Though Mr. T was able to receive both occupational therapy and speech therapy on June 12, he is unable to receive therapy on June 13 or June 14 due to a minor bout with the flu. The facility does not provide therapy on the weekends, which means that June 15, 2013 represents the third day of missed therapy, triggering an EOT OMRA. The therapy staff and nurses discuss Mr. T's condition and agree that Mr. T should be able to resume the same level of therapy beginning on June 18, 2013, so the facility decides to complete the EOT OMRA as an EOT -R, with an ARD of June 15, 2013.

If a resident receives more than one therapy discipline on a given calendar day, this may only count for one calendar day for purposes of coding item O0430. Consider the following example: Example: Mrs. T was admitted to the SNF on Sunday 10/ 06/18 and discharged on Saturday 10/26/18. S he received 60 minutes of physical therapy every Monday, Wednesday , and Friday during the SNF stay. Mrs. T also received 45 mi nutes of occupational therapy every Monday, Tuesday , and Friday during the stay. Given the therapy services received by Mrs. T during the stay, item O0430 would be coded as 12 because therapy servi ces were provided for at least 15 minutes on 12 distinct calendar days during the stay (i.e., every Monday, T uesday, Wednesday, and Friday). 3 O0450 O-41 Replaced screenshot.

If it will, determine whether therapy will resume no more than five consecutive calendar days after the last day of therapy was provided AND whether the therapy services will resume at the same level for each discipline. If No, skip to O0500, Restorative Nursing Programs. If Yes, code item O0450A as 1. Determine when therapy will resume and code item O0450B with the date that therapy will resume. For example: 3 O0450 O-41 Mrs. A. who was in RVL did not receive therapy on Saturday and Sunday because the facility did not provide weekend services and she missed therapy on Monday because of a doctor's appointment. She resumed therapy on Tuesday, November 13, 2011. The IDT determined that her RUG -IV therapy classifi cation level did not change as she had not had any significant clinical changes during the lapsed therapy days. When the EOT was filled out, item O0450 A was coded as 1 because therapy was resuming within 5 days from the last day of therapy and it was resu ming at the same RUG -IV classification level. Item O0450B was coded as 11132011 because therapy resumed on November 13, 2011. 3 O0450 O-41 NOTE: If the EOT OMRA has not been accepted in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System ( QIES ) Assessment Submi ssion and Processing ( ASAP ) system when therapy resumes, code the EOT -R items (O0450A and O0450B ) on the assessment and submit the record. If the EOT OMRA without the EOT -R items haves been accepted into the QIES ASAP system, then submit a modification request for that EOT OMRA with the only changes being the completion of the Resumption of Therapy item s (O0450A and O0450B ) and check X0900E Z toand indicate that the reason for modification is the addition of the Resumption of Therapy dateitem.

Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries . 3 O0500 O-43 A registered nurse or a licensed practical (vocational) nurse must supervise the activities in a restorative nursing program. Sometimes, under licensed nurse supervision, other staff and volunteers will be assigned to work with specific residents. Restorative nursing does not require a physician's order. Nursing homes may elect to have licensed rehabilitation professionals perform repetitive exercises and other maintenance treatments or to supervise aides performing these maintenance services. In situations where such services do not actually require the involvement of a qualified therapist, the services may not be coded as therapy in item O0400, Therapies or O0425, Part A Therapies , because the specific interventions are considered r estorative nursing services (see item O0400, Therapies and O0425, Part A Therapies ). The therapist's time actually providing the maintenance service can be included when counting restorative nursing minutes. Although therapists may participate, members of the nursing staff are still responsible for overall coordination and supervision of restorative nursing programs. 3 O0500 O-44 Coding Instructions This item does not include procedures or techniques carried out by or under the direction of qualified therapists , as identified in Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services i tem O0400A or O0425A , Occupational Therapy item O0400B or and Physical Therapy item O0400C or O0425C .

Required MDS records are those assessments and tracking records that are mandated under OBRA and SNF PPS. Providers will submit the Optional State Assessment (OSA) records to the QIES ASAP system just as they submit all other MDS assessments. The OSA is not a Federally required assessment. Each State will determine if the OSA is required and when this assessment must be completed. Assessments that are completed for purposes other t han OBRA and SNF PPS reasons are not to be submitted, e.g., private insurance, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage Plans. 5 5.1 5-1 Providers must establish communication with the QIES ASAP system in order to submit a file. This is accomplishe d by using specialized communications software and hardware and the CMS wide area network. Details about these processes are available on the QIES Technical Support Office (QTSO) website at: https://www.qtso.com https://qtso.cms.gov/ . 5 5.1 5-2 Once communication is established with the QIES ASAP system, the provider can access the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page in the MDS system. This site allows providers to submit MDS assessment data and access various information sources such as Bulletins and Questions and Answers.

SNFs must submit assessments according to a standard schedule.

Track Changes from Chapter 5 v1.16 to Chapter 5 v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 3 Chapter Section Page Change 5 5.4 5-6 HIPPS Codes: Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) codes are billing codes used when submitting Medicare Part A SNF payment claims to the Part A/Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC). The HIPPS code consists of five positions. Under PDPM, Tthe first three position represents the Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy (PT/OT) Payment Group, the second position represents the Speech Language Pathology (SLP) Payment Group, the third position represents the Nursing Payment Group, the fourth positi on represents the Non -therapy Ancillary (NTA) Payment Group, and the fifth position represents the positions represent the Resource Utilization Group- IV (RUG -IV) case mix code for the SNF resident, and the last two positions are an Assessment Indicator (AI ) code indicating which type of assessment was completed. Standard \"grouper\" logic and software for RUG- IVPDPM and the AI code are provided by CMS on the MDS 3.0 website. 5 5.4 5-6 The standard grouper uses MDS 3.0 items to determine both the RUG- IVPDPM group and the AI code. It is anticipated that MDS 3.0 software used by the provider will incorporate the standard grouper to automatically calculate the RUG- IVPDPM group and AI code. Detailed logic for determining the RUG- IVPDPM group and AI code is provide d in Chapter 6. The HIPPS codes to be used for Medicare Part A SNF claims are included on the MDS. There are two different HIPPS codes. 1. The Medicare Part A HIPPS code (Item Z0100A) is most often used on the claim. The RUG- IVPDPM version code in Item Z0 100B documents which version of RUG -IVPDPM was used to determine the RUG- IVPDPM payment groups represented in the Medicare Part A HIPPS code. Track Changes from Chapter 5 v1.16 to Chapter 5 v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 4 Chapter Section Page Change 5 5.4 5-6 2. The Medicare non -therapy Part A HIPPS code (Item Z0150A) is used when the provider is required to bill the non-therapy HIPPS. An example when the non- therapy HIPPS is to be billed is when the resident has been receiving rehabilitation therapy (physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech -language pathology services), all rehabilitation therapy ends, and the resident continues on Part A (see Chapter 6 for details, including other instances when this HIPPS code is used for billing purposes). The RUG version code in Item Z0150B documents which version of RUG- IV was used to determine the RUG -IV gro up in the Medicare non -therapy Part A HIPPS code. There is also a Medicare Short Stay indicator (Item Z0100C) on the MDS. For a qualifying Medicare short stay, the RUG -IV grouper uses alternative rehabilitation classification logic when there has been insu fficient time to establish a full rehabilitation regime. The standard grouper uses MDS 3.0 items to determine the Medicare short stay indicator. See Chapter 6 for details. 5 5.4 5-6 Both The HIPPS code s (Z0100A and Z0150A ), the RUG and PDPM version code s (Z0100B and Z0150B ), and the Medicare Short Stay indicator (Z0100C) must be submitted to the QIES ASAP system on all Medicare PPS assessment records (indicated by A0310B = 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, or 0 78). All Both of these values are validated by the QIES ASAP sy stem. The F final V validation Rreport will indicate if any of these items is in error and the correct value for an incorrect item. Note that an error in one of these items is usually a non -fatal warning and the record will still be accepted in the QIES ASAP system. A record will receive a fatal error ( -3804) if the record is a Start of Therapy (SOT) Other Medicare- Required Assessment (OMRA) (A0310C = 1 or 3) and the QIES ASAP system calculated value for the Medicare Part A HIPPS code (Z0100A) is not a group that begins with 'R', i.e., Rehabili tation Plus Extensive Services or Rehabilitation group.

The provider would determine if the Medicare- required or Discharge assessment should be modified or inactivated. Care Area Assessments (Section V) and updated care planning are not req uired with Medicare- only and Discharge assessments. 5 5.7 5-9 Facilities should correct any errors necessary to ensure that the information in the QIES ASAP system accurately reflects the resident's identification, location, overall clinical status, or payment status. A correction can be submitted for any accepted record within 32 years of the target date of the record for facilities that are still open. If a facility is terminated, then corrections must be submitted within 2 years of the facility termination date. A record may be corrected even if subsequent records have been accepted for the resident. 5 5.7 5-11 A stand -alone Discharge assessment (ISC = ND) was completed and accepted into the ASAP system. The provider later (that is, after the day of discharge) determined that the assessment should have been a 30- day PPS assessment combined with a Discharge assessment (ISC = NP). This modification would not be allowed as the ISC for the Discharge assessment combined with the 30- day PPS is different than the stand- alone Discharge ISC. This is an example of a missing 3 0- day assessment. 5 5.7 5-11 An Admission assessment (ISC = NC) was completed and accepted into the QIES ASAP system. The provider intended to code the assessment as an Admission and a 5-day PPS assessment (ISC = NC). The modification process could be used in this case as the ISC would not change.

That is, providers may not submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed prior to October 1, 2019 to a target da te on or after October 1, 2019, nor can they submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed on or after October 1, 2019 to a target date prior to October 1, 2019. The item sets that are effective October 1, 2019 have had significa nt changes, including the omission and addition of many items. It is the target date of the assessment that identifies the required version of the item set, and, because of the substantial changes in the item sets, they are not interchangeable. Therefore, providers may not change target dates on assessments crossing over October 1, 2019. Modification records that contain a target date crossing over October 1, 2019 will result in a FATAL error and be REJECTED from the QIES ASAP system. However, all correc tions to target dates that align with policies in Section 5.7 of this chapter and do not violate this rule will be allowed. To correct the target date of the assessment that violates the cross -over rule, providers must inactivate the incorrect assessment and submit a replacement assessment. Examples of potential scenarios that will and will not be allowed are identified below: Original Assessment Target Date Modified Assessment Target Date Allowed or Not Allowed 8/15/19 9/30/19 Allowed 10/1/19 11/1/19 Allowed 9/15/19 10/15/19 Not Allowed 9/15/19 Not Allowed Track Changes from Chapter 6 v1.16 to Chapter 6 v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 1 Chapter Section Page Change 6 6.1-6.8 6-1- 6-53 This chapter has been extensively revised for this year's manual.
