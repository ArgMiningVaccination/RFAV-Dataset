Serious complications may include long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death. This is true, even if you feel healthy and your medical condition is under control. You can do a lot to manage your health condition(s) and getting vaccinated is an important step in staying healthy. Children with certain medical conditions may also need additional vaccinations. Be sure to talk to their healthcare provider about which vaccines they may need. COVID-19 Vaccination for People with Moderately or Severely Weakened Immune Systems (Immunocompromised) Having a weakened immune system and the use of certain medications/treatments can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. People with a weakened immune system may not be protected even if they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. They should continue to take all [precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including wearing a well-fitted mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html), until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems should [receive an additional dose](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) of the same COVID-19 vaccine they originally got at least 28 days after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine or the single dose of J&J. These individuals should also get the updated bivalent booster, and may be eligible for additional updated booster doses, at the discretion of their healthcare provider. More information for people with moderately or severely weakened immune systems is available [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html#:~:text=People%20who%20are%20moderately%20or%20severely%20immunocompromised%20and%20who%20received,booster%2C%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Diabetes According to the CDC, if you have diabetes (type 1 or type 2), it may be harder for your immune system to fight off infections putting you at risk for more serious complications from an illness like flu and COVID-19. Flu can raise your blood glucose to dangerously high levels, and you are at increased risk for flu-related complications. In fact, adults with diabetes are 3 times more likely to die from flu-related complications and 6 times more likely to be hospitalized due to flu. In addition, people with diabetes have higher rates of hepatitis B than the rest of the population since the disease can be spread from the sharing of blood glucose meters, finger stick devices, or other diabetes care equipment. The CDC recommends people with diabetes get: - Flu vaccine - Get a flu shot every year to help prevent [flu](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/?acc=Influenza)and its serious complications. [Find a flu vaccine](https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/)near you. - Studies show that flu vaccination is associated with reduced hospitalizations among people with [diabetes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809006/) - Studies show that flu vaccination is associated with reduced hospitalizations among people with - Pneumococcal vaccines - Get vaccinated to protect against [pneumococcal disease.](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/?acc=Pneumococcal%20Disease)Ask your healthcare provider, which pneumococcal vaccines you need and when you should get them. - Hepatitis B vaccine - Get vaccinated to protect against [hepatitis B](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/?acc=Hepatitis%20B)if you are unvaccinated and younger than 60 years of age.

After that, adults need a Td booster shot to protect against tetanus and diphtheria every 10 years. (Pregnant people are recommended to get a Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy to help protect BOTH themselves and their babies from whooping cough.) - Shingles vaccine- Get two doses of shingles vaccine if you are 50 years of age or older to protect against [shingles and its complications](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/?acc=shingles). - COVID-19 Vaccine - Get fully vaccinated against [COVID-19](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/?acc=COVID-19), and get boosters if recommended, if you have [diabetes or other medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)that put you at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness, hospitalization and even death.

Asthma, COPD and Other Lung Conditions According to the CDC, if you have COPD or asthma, you are more likely to get complications from the flu and COVID-19. COPD and asthma cause your airways to swell and become blocked with mucus, which can make it hard to breathe.

The CDC recommends people with heart disease get: - Flu vaccine - Get a yearly flu vaccine to protect against [flu and its complications](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/?acc=influenza).
