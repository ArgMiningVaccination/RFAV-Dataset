The model encapsulates several realistic features, such as different vaccine efficacy against transmission and development of severe symptoms, testing practices, implementation of NPIs, isolation of detected individuals, and human behaviour. Using a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold of the model and, if the system is below such a threshold, we compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium. These theoretical results show that precautious human behaviour and effective testing practices are key towards avoiding epidemic outbreaks. Interestingly, we found that, in many realistic scenarios, vaccination is successful in mitigating the outbreak by reducing the prevalence of seriously ill patients, but it could be a double-edged sword, favouring resurgent outbreaks, and it thus calls for higher testing rates, more cautiousness and responsibility among the population, or the reintroduction of NPIs to achieve full eradication.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-09-10", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
