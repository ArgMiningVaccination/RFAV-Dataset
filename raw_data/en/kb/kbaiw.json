Each of the Quartz crystals has been cut to a specific frequency. Each crystal is aligned above one of the seven human energy centers or chakras. Colored lights, chosen to match the vibrational frequency of chakra colors, radiate light and energy through the crystals to each respective chakra, (energy centers of the spiritual and physical body) and shine in a certain rhythm to cleanse, balance, and align your energies. The individual receiving the sessions rests on a massage table and is bathed in the healing energies. In experiencing the Crystal Light Bed one receives three types of healing therapy: the Vogel crystal, light and color. Marcel Vogel \"Crystals are working with energy in the unlimited dimension of a magnetic domain. Crystals are a radio transmitter, a memory element, a transceiver, and a computer that delivers small doses of natural rediation to the body. Crystals agitate the water in the body, using a natural element.\" Vogel Healing Wands, cut according to the specifications of legendary IBM scientist and crystal healer Marcel Vogel, are truly rare and powerful instruments as well as lovely jewel like crystal wands. Marcel Vogel sought to use the power of science and of the lapidary arts to perfect crystalline forms of nature in order to maximize their potential for receiving, amplifying and transmitting Universal Life Force Energy charged with the intent to heal and with the force of love. Vogel cut his crystals to harmonize with the natural quarts structure to enhance the energetic properties of the wand for healing purposes, and the result is also aesthetically pleasing. Vogel believed that the most important thing to remember in working with faceted crystals for healing is that the purpose of the faceting should be to amplify and transmit an increasingly coherent stream of energy to a subject.
