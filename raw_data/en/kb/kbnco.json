From that humble beginning, Buies Creek Academy evolved to become Campbell Junior College (1926), Campbell College (1961), and Campbell University (1979). Throughout these transformations, the institut ion has remained true to its founding principles to address the most pressing needs of North Carolina and to educate men and women for Christian service and leadership around the world. The University enjoys an autonomous and voluntary relationship with t he Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. The founding principles still guide Campbell University today. In 2013, Campbell launched the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine, North Carolina's first new medical school in over 35 years. In A ugust 2016, the Catherine W.

Accreditation status is the highest level of accreditation awarded, and confers all rights and privileges of accreditation. Contact information for the COCA is as follows: Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation 142 East Ontario Street Chicago, IL 60611 Toll-free phone: (800) 621-1773 Department of Accreditation: (312) 202-8124 of Accreditation Fax: (312) 202-8424 About the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) Representing more than 81,000 osteopathic physicians (DOs) around the world, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) serves as the professional family for all DOs and osteopathic medical students.

Postgraduate Medical Education Sponsoring Institution In 2015, Campbell University became the sponsoring institution for CUSOM \"affiliated\" residency programs in preparation for single accreditation. Between 2012 and 2016, we started 17 new residency program in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Obstetrics -Gynecology, Dermatology, Surgery, Sports Medicine, Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Psychiatry. The majority of these programs are now ACGME accredited. 18 OPTI CUSOM is a member of the Osteopathic Medical Network of Excellence in Education (OMNEE), which is committed to develop residency pro grams in North Carolina and the Southeastern United States. North Carolina has the medical facilities to provide sufficient training sites for CUSOM medical students and the opportunity to develop new GME training sites to ensure graduates will have reside ncy positions available to them in North Carolina . 1.6 Osteopathic History The history of CUSOM begins with the advent of osteopathy by Andrew Taylor Still, a native of Virginia. In 1854, Dr. Still, then a practicing allopathic physician in Kansas, became increasingly dissatisfied with the medical practices of his day. He developed a new theory of medicine, which he called osteopathy. He based his new approach to health care on the concepts of body unity, the body's inherent ability to heal itself given all the optimum conditions, and on the proper alignment and function of the musculoskeletal system . CUSOM takes pride in bringing the philosophies of Dr. Still to North Carolina. Over the years, the practice of medicine has evolved and so has the practice of osteopathic medicine. Today, doctors of osteopathic medicine (DOs) serve the public with full medical practice privileges. Osteopathic physicians are trained in all the modern practices science has to offer in medical and surgical care while incorporating the concept of treating the whole person throughout the training. Osteopathic physicians believe hands -on examination (palpation) is an essential part of making a physical diagnosis. In addition to pharmacologic treatment and surgery, manipulative medicine remains an important therapeutic tool utilized by osteopathic physicians in alleviating pain and treating illness. The training of osteopathic physicians has always stressed a primary care orientation . Four Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine 1. The body is a unit; the person is a unit of mind, body and spirit 2. The body is capable of self-regulation, self-healing and health maintenance 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated 4. Rational treatment is based on the above three principles 19 1.7 Osteopathic Oath I do hereby affirm my loyalty to the profession I am about to enter. I will be mindful always of my great responsibility to preserve the health and the life of my patients, to retain their confidence and respect both as a physician and a friend who will guard their secrets with scrupulous honor and fidelity, to perform faithfully my professional duties, to employ only those recognized methods of treatment consistent with good judgment and with my skill and ability, keeping in mind always nature's laws and the body's inherent capacity for recovery. I will be ever vigilant in aiding in the general welfare of the community, sustaining its laws and institutions, not engaging in those practices, which will in any way, bring shame or discredit upon my profession or myself. I will give no drugs for deadly purposes to any person, though it be asked of me. I will endeavor to work in accord with my colleagues in a spirit of progressive cooperation and never by word or by act cast imputations upon them or their rightful practices. I will look with respect and esteem upon all those who have taught me my art. To my college I will be loyal and strive always for its best interests and for the interests of the students who will come after me. I will be ever alert to further the application of basic biologic truths to the healing arts and to develop the principles of osteopathy, which were first enunciated by Andrew Taylor Still. 20 2.

CUSOM no longer accepts scores from MCAT examinations taken prior to April 2015. For the current MCAT examination, CUSOM favors MCAT scores at the 500/50th percentile or higher . Applicants should have achieve d at least a 3.2 science and cumulative grade point average (GPA) on a 4.0 scale. The most competitive applicants have higher science and cumulative GPA. The admissions process is competitive, and a higher GPA and a competitive MCAT can increase chances fo r acceptance. CUSOM also places emphasis on the applicant's interview . 22 The required undergraduate courses for entry are : Biological Sciences: One year with laboratory (8 semester hours/12 quarter hours) Physics: One year (6 to 8 semester hours/9 to 12 quarter hours) Inorganic/General Chemistry: One year with laboratory (8 semester hours/12 quarter hours) Organic Chemistry: One year with laboratory (8 semester hours/12 quarter hours) English: One year (6 semester hours/8 quarter hours) Six (6) additional science hours are highly recommended. CUSOM recommends courses in the 300/400 level or higher in subjects that will enhance performance in medical school such as Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Microbiology, and Immunology NOTE : Courses with equivalent content will be reviewed. NOTE : Students must obtain a grade of \"C\" or better in each of the required courses above to fulfill the pre-requisite course requirement. Applicants are required to meet the Technical Standards for admission and continued enrollment , and affirm that he or she meets the standards. Any falsification or misinformation (e.g. not disclosing prior to matriculation a known pre -existing issue which would lead to not meeting the Technical Standards) regarding the ability t o meet t he Technical Standards may result in dismissal from the program . Applicants must submit all required paperwork per deadlines. If paperwork is not submitted as required, an offer of admission may be retracted . 2.4 Applications Deadline The official AACO MAS application is available online at www. https://aacomas.liaisoncas.com/ . The deadline for CUSOM applicants is March 1, but is subject to change annually. Applicants should consult the CUSOM website. The l ast day for applicants to submit their secondary application and supporting materials is April 1, but earlier submission is highly encouraged . 2.5 Early Decision Admissions Track The Early Decision Admissions Track is an admissions option for candidates who id entify CUSOM as their first choice for pursuing a medical education amongst both osteopathic and allopathic medical schools. To be considered for the Early Decision Admissions Track, the candidate must meet all of the following requirements and agree to apply only to CUSOM until an early decision notification has been made. Please note the Early Decision Admissions Track requirements are in addition to the minimum requirements for admissions listed earlier in this section . 23 Early Decision Admissions Trac k Requirements Minimum Science and Overall GPA of 3.50 Recent MCAT score (by August of the calendar year; three years prior to the date of application) with an MCAT score of 500/50th percentile Submit an application, official transcript from all institutio ns attended, and MCAT scores to AACOMAS by July 1 of the year preceding matriculation. Submit a letter of intent to the Office of Admissions indicating that CUSOM is your first choice for medical schools by July 1 and request review for Early Decision Admissions Track . Submit all secondary application materials including secondary application, application fee, letter of recommendation from a premedical advisor/science faculty member, and a letter of recommendation from an osteopathic or allopathic physi cian by August 15 . The letter of intent should indicate all applications to other medical schools will be withheld until early decisions are made by CUSOM. Students will be notified no later than September 30 . Guaranteed Interview Process This is only appl icable to Campbell University undergraduate students with : A minimum science and overall GPA of 3.30 A recent MCAT score of 50th percentile with a preferred score in the 40th percentile or higher in Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems (BBFLS) Application, transcripts from all institutions attended, and MCAT scores submitted to AACOMAS in June/July of senior year Positive evaluation from the Dean of their undergraduate college Guaranteed interview in September of senior year Guaranteed decision within two weeks of interviewing Acceptance contingent upon maintaining minimum science and overall GPA of 3.30 . 2.6 Application Process Step 1: AACOMAS Application CUSOM participates with other osteopathic colleges in a centralized application processing service called the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). An application may be submitted online at https://aacomas.liaisoncas.com/ or may be obtained by contacting : AACOMAS P.O. Box 9137 Watertown, MA 02474 Telephone (617) 612-2889 To initiate the application process, applicants must apply directly to AACOMAS . 24 AACOMAS is available to the students for the entering class from May through to March of the year applying. Detailed instructions c an be accessed through https://aacomas.liaisoncas.com/ . Applicants must request all official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended to be mailed directly from the institution(s) to the AACOMA S office. Students should also ensure all MCAT scores are forwarded directly to AACOMAS from the AAMC . Applicants who have taken course work and/or have earned a degree from a foreign institution must also submit to AACOMAS an evaluation of their transcrip ts in a course - by-course fashion from one of the AACOMAS -approved evaluation services . Step 2: CUSOM Secondary Application Process After receipt of the primary application, CUSOM performs an initial screening of the application. Applicants who pass the in itial screening may be invited to submit an electronic secondary application and supporting documents. Please note CUSOM screens all primary applications and not all applicants will receive the invitation to submit a secondary application . Applicants invited to submit a secondary application receive an email notification. This email will contain information and instructions on how to complete the secondary application. A non -refundable fee of $50.00 is payable upon submission of the secondar y application for admission. Instructions on how to submit the fee are included in the invitation for secondary application email. CUSOM waive s the secondary application fee if the applicant has an approved AACOMAS fee waiver document . The secondary applic ation process consists of the CUSOM Secondary Application, a non-refundable processing fee, and two required letters of recommendation. CUSOM accept s letters through AACOMAS, VirtualEvals, Interfolio and mail. Letters of recommendation may not be written b y a relative, including relatives through marriage . Letters of recommendation which are included as a part of the pre -health committee packet or letters from an official evaluation collection service are recognized by CUSOM (AACOMAS, Interfolio or VirtualE vals) as a part of their official packet are accepted without signature or letterhead, as long as the letters are sent directly from the authors to the pre -health committee. If the applicant's school does not utilize a pre - health committee, a letter must b e from a science faculty member (typically a PhD) familiar with the academic work of the applicant . Another letter of recommendation must be from either an osteopathic physician (DO) or an allopathic physician (MD). Although a letter from an osteopathic ph ysician is not required, it is strongly recommended . 25 CUSOM welcomes additional letters of support or recommendation from those who are acquainted with the student's academic or professional ability. All additional letters of recommendation must be origin als on professional or college/university letterhead, signed by the evaluator and sent directly to the Office of Admissions . While shadowing experience with a DO is not required, applicants who have shadowing experience with an osteopathic physician demons trate commitment to the profession and understanding of the practice of osteopathic medicine . 2.7 CUSOM Selection Process To be considered for an interview, an applicant must meet all the preceding admissions requirements and technical standards for admissions and have a complete file, including submission of the AACOMAS application, a secondary application, a form/letter of recommendation from either an osteopathic or allopathic physician, a recommendation form/letter from a pre -medical or pre -health committee, or science faculty member (PhD) and the processing fee. After the Office of Admissions receives these materials, the applicant's file is reviewed to determine eligibility for an interview, based on criteria established by the Admissions Committee . Each applicant who accepts the invitation to interview is invited to campus where he/she will interview with members of the CUSOM faculty, staff and administration. During the interview the applicant's academic history and knowledge may be reviewed as well as the attributes that demonstrate the potential to become a caring and competent osteopathic physician and fit for CUSOM's Mission . At the conclusion of the interviews, the interviewers submit their recommendation to the Director of Admissions, and these recommendations are presented and discussed d uring an Admissions Committee meeting. The Admissions Committee reviews each applicant who interviews with CUSOM and makes a recommendation of either accept or deny admission to the Dean . The Dean decides to accept, deny or waitlist the candidate and this decision is provided to the applicant in a timely manner, usually within 2 -4 weeks of the interview date . Intentional misrepresentation or omission of information on any form relevant to admissions or records subject s the student to a retraction of an offer for admission, or for dismissal in the case the misrepresentation/omission is discovered after matriculation. CUSOM reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant for any reason i t deems sufficient. Matriculation may be denied to applicants who have failed to maintain a good record of scholastic performance or good record of personal conduct between the time of their acceptance and their matriculation at CUSOM. Inability to maintai n compliance with educational training technical standards may also result in the revocation of acceptance or matricula tion. 26 Additionally, applicants found to have screening tests positive for alcohol, prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in revo cation of an offer of acceptance or matriculation. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such , the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy . 2.8 Transfer Applicants CUSOM may consider acceptance of transfer applications. Potential transfer students must submit certified and official transcripts from all p ost-secondary educational institutions, achieve passing grades in all subjects at the time of transfer, and have an overall 3.2 GPA or higher on a 4.0 scale at their current medical school . Transfer students leaving an accredited medical school must reques t a letter from both the Dean and one Associate Dean from all prior medical schools attended . Transfer credit will be dependent on coursework completed by the applicant and will be subject to the final approval from the Dean based on the recommendation of the CUSOM Admissions Committee. Students who have completed two years of course work at anothe r medical school are not be considered if they have not passed COMLEX -USA Level 1. Credits are only transferred from COMs accredited by the American Osteopathic Association's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or from schools of medicin e accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). An ad hoc committee appointed by the Dean conduct s an evaluation of courses for transfe r. Students transferring from another medical school to CUSOM are required to complete at least the la st two years at CUSOM prior to graduation. In addition, all transfer students must meet CUSOM's osteopathic manipulative medicine training requirements, including the understanding and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy prior to graduation. Each applicant is reviewed by the Admissions Committee and interviewed prior to the approval to transfer. CUSOM has the right to require additional courses be taken or rotations added if deemed necessary to ensure the graduate are of the highest quality and contribute t o CUSOM successfully meeting its Mission . The Dean determine s satisfactory completion of these requirements. Students must fulfill all requirements for graduation, including passing all NBOME licensing examinations, to receive the DO degree from CUSOM . 27 2.9 Transfer of Credit Credits are only transferred from COMs accredited by the American Osteopathic Association's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or from schoo ls of medicine accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Students wishing to transfer must have completed all course work with passing grades and have at least a 3.2 or greater GPA on a 4.0 scale. Each course is evaluated as to its c ourse content, equivalency, and credit hours prior to any credit being waived. The CUSOM Registrar and Office of Academic Affairs conduct s this evaluation. Transferred credits are only given if the student is eligible for readmission to a previously attend ed COCA -accredited COM or LCME -accredited school of medicine or is currently an osteopathic medical student or allopathic medical student with overall good standing at the institution from which they are transferring . 2.10 Class (Credit) Waivers Credits are only transferred from COCA -accredited COMs or LCME -accredited schools of medicine. Students wishing to transfer must have completed all course work with passing grades and have at least a 3.2 or greater GPA on a 4.0 scale. Each course is evaluated as to it s course content, equivalency, and credit hours prior to any credit being waived . The CUSOM Registrar and Office of Academic Affairs conduct s this evaluation. Any course the transfer student has not taken will need to be taken at CUSOM prior to third year clinical rotations. Regardless of credits, the last two years of instruction must be completed at CUSOM, and all requirements for graduation must be fulfilled in order for the student to be eligible to receive the DO degree . 2.11 Transfers from LCME -Accredited Schools of Medicine For students requesting to transfer from an LCME -accredited school of medicine, at least the last two years of instruction must be completed at CUSOM. In addition, LCME transfer students must complete the CUSOM requirement for osteopath ic manipulative medicine including the understanding and requisite knowledge and application of osteopathic philosophy prior to graduation. Students wishing to transfer must have completed all course work with passing grades and have at least a 3.2 or grea ter GPA on a 4.0 scale. Each course is evaluated as to its course content, equivalency, and credit hours prior to any credit being waived. The CUSOM Registrar and Office of Academic Affairs conduct s this evaluation . Transfer credits are only given if the s tudent is in good standing and acquires letters from the Dean and Associate Dean(s) of the previously attended medical school(s). The letters must state that the student is eligible for readmission to the previously attended school(s) of medicine accredite d by LCME and is in good standing with the institution from which the student is transferring. Final approval for all transfer applicants resides with the Dean . 28 2.12 International Student Applicants CUSOM may accept students who are US -born citizens, naturali zed citizens, green card holders, student visa holders and in DACA status. Applicants need to understand that for intern and residency sites, clearance is determined by the site, not CUSOM. Certain sites have more time -consuming clearance processes, such as the VA and federal facilities. CUSOM cannot guarantee clearance, but will work to place students at the necessary sites to complete their education. CUSOM policy requires applicants who have completed coursework at foreign institutions be evaluated for U.S. equivalence by one of the evaluation services listed on the AACOM web site http://www.aacom.org . The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the US is comparable to a regionally accredited US col lege or university in a course -by-course fashion . CUSOM does not accept transfer students from international medical schools. 2.13 Technical Standards for Admission to CUSOM The requirements to succeed at CUSOM are those necessary to successfully complete the curriculum and to practice osteopathic medicine with full practice rights. Students must be able to function in a variety of learning and clinical settings, and to quickly, accurately, and consistently learn an d process data. Osteopathic physicians utilize palpation (clinically appropriate touching) as part of the osteopathic approach to treatment. As part of the educational process, CUSOM students must be able to tolerate being touched, examined and receive ost eopathic manipulation by members of both genders, and to touch, examine and provide osteopathic manipulation to others (of both genders) in order to acquire the skills necessary for palpation and examination. This palpation is performed in a professional a nd appropriate manner . Acquiring the skills to palpate and examine patients requires a student to examine partially disrobed patients of both genders and is mandatory for successful completion of the curriculum at CUSOM. Students are required to participat e fully as both the examiner and examinee in various clinical laboratory experiences. In clinical skills and osteopathic manipulative medicine laboratory experiences, as well as other clinical laboratories where skills are acquired, students are required to participate in the examination of fellow students of both genders who may be partially disrobed . In order to be able to gain appropriate clinical exposure to the regions being examined and osteopathic manipulative techniques to be provided, students nee d to wear attire such as shorts and are expected to partially disrobe for certain laboratory experiences. Please refer to the Dress Code Policy for additional information . Additionally, CUSOM utilizes cadavers in the gross anatomy laborator y. As such, CUSOM students must be able to tolerate working with , and touching , cadavers. No photographic devices, including cell phones, are permitted in the gross anatomy lab . CUSOM students also participate in ultrasound labs and, as such, may be required to perfor m ultrasound examination of fellow students of both genders who may be partially 29 disrobed . These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural or religious beliefs, in order for the student to acquire the skills necessary to practice osteopathi c medicine. Students who have any concern should discuss them with the Director of Admissions prior to applying . CUSOM will make reasonable accommodations as required by law for students whose disabilities will not prevent them from successfully completing the entire CUSOM curriculum and graduating as an osteopathic physician. Students, however, are required to function with independence and perform at all skill levels described below which CUSOM holds as mandatory for the safe and effective practice of ost eopathic medicine . CUSOM is committed to patient safety and assuring a safe and effective environment that does not place patients, students, or others at risk. Each technical standard has been chosen from standards osteopathic physicians deem necessary fo r the safe and effective pr actice of osteopathic medicine. Applicants who do not meet the technical standards should not apply to CUSOM. Students (Applicants) must possess the abilities and skills in the following five areas: 1. Observation The student must be able to visually observe laboratory demonstrations, microscopic tissue with the aid of the microscope, and electronic images used in laboratory demonstrations. The student must be able to visually and accurately observe physical signs and symptoms of a patient used in diagnosis and management . The use of a trained intermediary in such cases would compromise performance, as it would be mediated by another individual's power of selection, observation, and experience. Observation requires the functional use of vision and somatic sensations and is often enhanced by the sense of smell . 2. Communication The student must be able to communicate effectively in English, as the curriculum and clinical experiences are offered in English. Students are encouraged to learn other languages for medical communication; however, all curriculum and assessment are given in English. CUSOM requires the functional ability to speak, hear, and observe patients in order to elicit accurate medical information. The student must be able to both describe changes in mood, activity, posture, and other physical characteristics and to perceive nonverbal communication . The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in verbal and written form. The student must be able to commu nicate effectively and efficiently with patients and with all members of the health -care team in order to successfully complete the curriculum . 30 3. Motor Students must have sufficient motor function to gather information from patients by palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic measures. The student must have sufficient motor function to carry out maneuvers of general and emergency care and of osteopathic manipulation. Examples of emergent motor functions include, but are not limited to, cardiopul monary resuscitation, administration of intravenous fluids and intravenous medications, management of an obstructed airway, hemorrhage control, closure by suturing of wounds, and obstetrical deliveries. In addition, the delivery of osteopathic manipulation requires the use of extremities in palpation, positioning, and carrying out maneuvers of manipulation. These actions require fine and gross motor and sensory functions, as well as the senses of touch and adequate vision for inspection. Additionally, stude nts must be able to generate sufficient force, and be able to receive these same forces, to successfully learn and provide effective osteopathic manipulative treatments for all techniques taught in the curriculum. These techniques include , but are not limi ted to , muscle energy, counterstrain, Still technique, and high -velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) technique s. 4. Intellectual Students must have the ability to reason, calculate, analyze, measure, and synthesize information delivered in a variety of formats, inc luding, but not limited to electronic/digital sources, EKGs, medical images and similar modalities. The student must be able to comprehend, memorize, synthesize, and recall a large amount of information without assistance, to successfully complete the curr iculum. The student must be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and understand spatial relationships to successfully complete the curriculum and apply fundamental concepts to the provision of patient care. The student must be able to acquire and synthesize knowledge through all types of learning materials and formats utilized in the CUSOM curriculum. In addition, students must be able to perform pattern recognition, memorization, recall information, identify and discriminate important inform ation, problem solve, calculate and make decisions in timed situations and in the presence of noise and distraction . The above intellectual abilities are essential, as students and graduates are expected and required to perform pattern recognition, immedia te recall of learned material, discrimination to elicit important information, problem solving, and decision - making in the emergent diagnosis and treatment of patients. Students must be able to recall and apply important information to generate a different ial diagnosis and to develop a therapeutic management for emergent conditions. This type of demonstrated intellectual ability must be performed in a rapid and time -efficient manner in order to provide appropriate care to patients with emergent conditions.s o as not to place patients in emergent conditions at risk . 31 It is common for emergent situations to occur in the presence of visually distracting and noisy environments. Such emergent situations include, but are not limited to, cardiopulmonary compromise, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, obstetrical and neonatal emergencies, trauma presentations, poisonings and toxic exposures, shock, and hemorrhage . 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes The student must have the emotional health needed for full use of his/her intellectual capabilities at all times. The emotional health required for effective communication and for professional, mature, sensitive, and compassionate patient/physician or patient/student relationships must be present . Students must be able to function effectively under stress and with physically taxing workloads, such as during lectures, labs, written and practical examinations, and on clinical rotations. Students must have the emotional health to be able to function without the aid of medications know n to affect intellectual abilities and judgment in an adverse manner . Students must have the emotional stability and motivation to deliver patient care and to make emergent decisions at all times . The ability to adapt to changing environments and stressfu l situations and to display compassion and integrity, while maintaining the necessary intellectual capacity to care for patients, is one evaluated during the interview process and throughout the student's progress in the medical school curriculum. An abili ty to demonstrate the emotional health necessary for the delivery of quality and safe medical care is mandatory throughout medical school. CUSOM considers drug and alcohol addiction or abuse a significant risk factor for the provision of unsafe patient car e and poor patient outcomes. As such, CUSOM has developed clear policies regarding alcohol and substance abuse which are described elsewhere in this bulletin . Applicants must identify to the Office of Admissions all areas where there is question in meeting these technical standards. If an applicant has a question about his/her ability to meet the minimal technical standards, the applicant is required to notify the Office of Admissions in advance of applying so reasonable testing and evaluation may occur. CUSOM will determine the type of testing required based on the area(s) identified by the applicant. All testing must be performed by a licensed healthcare professional practicing at the highest level of their respective licensure. The applicant must provid e CUSOM a written statement by the treating provider that the testing supports that the student is capable of meeting the technical standards and physical requirements of the curriculum. An offer of acceptance may be rescinded should an accepted applicant be found to not be able to meet the technical standards. For matriculated students, inability to maintain compliance with educational training technical standards may result in dismissal from the program . 32 If an applicant signs that he/she meets the minimum health requirements and technical standards for admission, but it is discovered after matriculation that the student signed knowing he/she did not meet these minimum standards, then the student may receive sanctions up to and including dismissal from the program . 2.14 Americans with Disabilities Act CUSOM is operating in compliance with the timeline established by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), both as amended, to assure that its facilities, programs and student policies are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Students and applicants with specific needs should contact the Director of Student Affairs . 2.15 CUSOM Matriculation and Enrollment Policies Once accepted, students matriculating int o CUSOM are required to meet the following : Health, Vaccine, and Immunizations Requirements All deposited CUSOM students are required to submit the following to the Office of Clinical Affairs : 1. Completed medical history form 2. Proof of immunization 3. Completed substance screen (described below) 4. Completed physical examination conducted by a licensed physician using the appropriate CUSOM form Students must obtain all CUSOM required immunizations and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all immunization requirements through graduation. Students must maintain all immunizations as required by CUSOM in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the osteopathic medical program curriculum. Please refer to the CUSOM Immunization Policy. A complete description of all immunization requirements is available in the Office of Student Affairs. All students must provide written documentation utilizing the AAMC Standardized Immunization Form (completed and signed by their health care provider or institutional representative) verifying that all CUSOM immunization and titer requirements, as listed below and in accordance with the CDC Guidelines (https ://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec -vac/hcw.html ) have been met, affording adequate immunization/immunity for the following: 33 Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus o All students must submit documentation (physician signature or vaccination record) of immunization with a *Tdap booster (Boostrix or Adacel) since the year 2005. o Following the Tdap booster, proof of a Td routine booster is required every 10 years TB test (prior to matriculation and prior to clinical rotations) o There are two acceptable methods for TB screening and all students must provide documentation of the results from ONE of the two methods: A two -step tuberculin skin test (TST) An Interferon -Gamma Release Assay (IGRAs) blood test The TB test must be obtained within 6 months of matr iculation Hepatitis B virus (quantitative titer) o Students must provide dates and verification (vaccination record) of completing a Hepatitis B vaccination series consisting of three (3) hepatitis B injections o In addition verification of quantitative antibo dy titers demonstrating immunity to hepatitis B must be provided Students who do not show immunity following the vaccination series should refer to the immunization policy for further steps MMR: Measles (Rubeola), Mumps and Rubella o Students must provide dates and verification (vaccination record) of 2 MMR vaccinations, occurring at least 28 days apart If the student is able to provide an immunization record or physician signature verifying the dates of these 2 vaccinations, no titer will be required o Students unable to provide immunization records or physician signature verifying completion of the MMR series have 2 options: Repeat the MMR series of 2 vaccinations at least 28 days apart and provide documentation verifying completion of the series Obtain titers for measles, mumps, and rubella Varicella (quantitative titer by the time of matriculation) Influenza vaccination every year In some situations, clinical sites may have additional immunization requirements above those required by CUSOM. CUSOM does not waive immunization or student health requirements for religious or personal preferences . CUSOM may revise the immunization requirements at any time as deemed necessary, and all students will be required to comply with subsequent changes . 34 National Background Checks CUSOM applicants are required to self -disclose any charges, arrests or convictions including misdemeanors, felonies, deferred adjudications, traffic violatio ns, military non-judicial punishment, courts martial, and general or less than ho norable discharge from the military, (all hereinafter \"Offenses\") with the understanding that non - disclosure/falsification of any previous or pending Offenses may result in the revocation of the offer of admission. If prior Offenses are not reported but are discovered after matriculation, a student may receive sanctions up to and including dismissal from the program . If a student has any Offenses pending final adjudication, it is the student's responsibility to immediately inform CUSOM. Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment, and to minimize the risk to patients, a criminal background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation, and on any student whose actions could potentially be considered a risk to others at any time . Should any Offenses , including deferred adjudications , occur after matriculation, the student must report the incident to the Director of Student Affairs within thirty ( 30) days of the incident . Following review, disciplinary action may be instituted, up to and including dismissal from the program . A national background check is done on each student prior to the start of clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites . By accepting admission to CUSOM and matriculating, the student agrees that CUSOM will share background check information in full with the student's respective clinical site(s) . Additional national background checks may be performed at the discretion of CUS OM or its partnering institutions before accepting a student into a clinical rotation . National background checks also may be required at any time deemed appropriate by CUSOM. Discovery of any previously non -reported Offense(s) may lead to referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and possible sanctions, up to and including dismissal . CUSOM has no control over the content of third -party backgro und checks, which may include charges of driving under the influence. Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, and/or employment opportunities . If a student unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inability to pass back ground check requirements, they will not meet graduation requirements. In addition, and as such, they will be referred to the APPS committee . 35 Also, a student with any Offenses is encouraged to contact the licensure boards in the state of intended practic e to ensure the aforementioned Offense will not inhibit the ability to obtain a medical license upon graduation . All current or former students returning from an approved extended period away from CUSOM, such as a leave of absence or an offer to repeat an a cademic year, must notify CUSOM in writing of any Offenses , including deferred adjudications , at least sixty ( 60) days prior to the anticipated return date. An Offense occurring less than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date must be report ed to the Director of Student Affairs within 24 hours of the Offense . Non-disclosure or falsification of any related information may result in the revocation of the offer to return to CUSOM, or if already returned to CUSOM , referral to the APPS Committee for possible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program . CUSOM retains the right to relinquish the seat of any current or former student returning from an extended absence if they have been criminally charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation. Students who have already resumed classes following an extended absence, may be referred to the APPS Committee for sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program . As future physicians, students are held to a high s tandard of professionalism, ethics and honor, and CUSOM has a duty to protect the public from potential harm by its students . All current or former students returning from an appro ved period away from CUSOM, such as a leave of absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, national background check, and controlled substance screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no l ater than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulf ill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. Driver's License As the clinical campus system of CUSOM is widespread across the state of North Carolina, all applicants must provide evi dence of a valid driver's license to allow for travel to various clinical rotations. Students may have to drive up to an hour from the premier educational partner of their respective regional site for an assigned rotation. Therefore, evidence of a valid d river's license must be provided to the Office of Student Affairs by the end of the first year of medical school. Failure to provide evidence of this item by the end of the first year of medical school may result in not being permitted to begin the second year of medical school. 36 Basic Life Support Skills CUSOM students are required to have Basic Life Support (BLS) training prior to matriculation. Each student must provide a copy of their CPR card, documenting current BLS for Healthcare Providers certification, to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to mat riculation. CUSOM only accepts BLS for Healthcare Provider courses authorized by the American Heart Association. Failure to provide evidence of appropriate certification may result in revocation of an offer of acceptance . Emergency Medical Training CUSOM has developed a uniquely designed Emergency Medical Training (EMT) program for inclusion in the medical student curriculum. The addition of this program, which will lead to state and national EMT certification, will significantly enhance the clinical trai ning and experiences of medical students. Participation in EMT training will provide a number of benefits to medical student education. By providing an experiential context for content taught in basic sciences, the experiences encountered during an EMT tra ining program strengthen student understanding, assist in the consolidation of knowledge and improve retention of both basic science and clinical information. Participation in an EMT training program has been shown to provide increased motivation for study ing basic sciences by demonstrating the relationship between basic science knowledge and the clinical practice of medicine. Students completing an EMT training program learn how to promote the importance of professionalism, good communication and the build ing of provider -patient relationships. Completion of an EMT training program has been shown to improve clinical performance in many health professions including improved clinical rotation grades, faculty feedback, letters of recommendation, and most import antly, patient care. Obtaining EMT certification during school may provide a valuable addition to the strength of an application to a residency. Studies have indicated that students in healthcare related professional programs often feel they are inadequate ly prepared and lack the training needed to provide lifesaving care in an emergency. Completion of the EMT program will provide medical students with the acquisition of critical lifesaving skills and medical experience to enable them to administer lifesavi ng care in any situation. 37 Controlled Substance Screening Pre-Matriculation In response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a controlled substance screening must be completed by all accepted appli cants prior to matriculation. This screening must meet CUSOM's standards, and be conducted by an agency approved by CUSOM. Any substance -related incident which occurs before matriculation , including, but not limited to, charges/arrests for driving under the influence , must be report ed by the student to the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs within thirty ( 30) days of the occurrence. Following review, the student's acceptance may be rescinded. If the test result is positi ve (i.e. evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, the Dean will appoint an ad hoc committee consisting of members of the CUSOM Admissions Committee to review the test results and the application for admission. Controlled substance screening results is viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal or controlled substances. Depending on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee , the student's acceptance may be rescinded. For example, altho ugh the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such , the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. By signing the attestation confirming that students have read and acknowledge compliance with the precepts contained in the CUSOM Academic Bulletin, each applicant to CUSOM promise s he/she is not cu rrently using, and that he/she will not use while a CUSOM student, any products or substances in any manner which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. Post-Matriculation Any substance -related incident which occurs after matriculation , including, but not limited to, charges/arrests for driving under the influence , must be report ed by the student to the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs within thirty ( 30) days of the occurrence. Following review, disciplinary action may be instituted, up to and including dismissal from the program . A controlled substance screening is required prior to starting clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites. Additional screenings may be required, at any time, at the discretion of CUSOM or partnerin g-institutions. By accepting admission to CUSOM and matriculating, the student agrees that CUSOM may share controlled substance screening results as deemed necessary. 38 CUSOM has no control over the content of third -party backgro und checks, which may inclu de charges of driving under the influence. Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses , even Offenses which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, and/or employment opportunities . If the test result is positi ve (i.e. evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, the Dean will appoint an ad hoc committee consisting of members of the CUSOM APPS Committee to review the test results and the application for admission. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal or controlled substances. A more detailed description of CUSOM's Substance Abuse Screening Protocol is found elsewhere in this Bulletin . Transcripts All CUSOM students are required to pr ovide official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended if they have course work that was not included with the transcri pts submitted through AACOMAS. All transcripts are included in the student's application so CUSOM only needs official tra nscripts from coursework completed after the application was submitted. All students must submit all required paperwork by the published deadlines. Failure to submit the information could result in an offer of admission being rescinded. Falsification of an y document or omission of any pertinent information may result in dismissal if discovered after matriculation . 2.16 Early Acceptance Program for Medicine Campbell University's Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine offers an Early Acceptance Program for Medicine to attract prospective students who are interested in attending medical school after completing their undergraduate studies. Through this program, seats are reserved in future medical school classes for exceptional students matriculati ng at Campbell University as freshmen.

Financial Aid Renewal Students receiving financial aid are expected to make reasonable and timely Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) towards their graduate degree during all periods of enrollment. Campbell University is consistent in applying the SAP policies to full and part time students. The cumulative GPA for achieving SAP for CUSOM is currently 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Additional information can be found on t h e Campbell University Website: https://ww2.campbell.edu/pdf -top/financialaid/GRAD_SAP_Policy.pdf In addition , should there be an outstanding balance at the end of the semester, students will be placed on a business office hold and will not be registered for the following semester and no t eligible for financial aid until the business office hold is cleared . 3.4 Refund Policy Tuition and fees is refunded in accordance with the Campbell University Refund/Repayment Policy . To withdraw officially from CUSOM, a student is required to complete an o fficial form available from the Office of the Student Affairs. The official f orm must be completed with 42 proper signatures obtained and turned into the Director of Student Affairs. Once all signatures are obtained, the Director of Student Affairs provides a copy to the Registrar for placement in the student's permanent file. Failure to withdraw properly will result in a non - prorated reassessment of charges to the student account . Upon the completion of the official form and the receipt of said form in the C USOM Office of the Registrar, c lass registration is updated as a withdrawal or separation from the University denoting the \"Effective Date\" . The Campbell University Business Of fice verifies all classes have been u pdated accordingly and reassesses student tuition and fee charges. CUSOM students' tuition refunds are issued for a University Withdrawal (\"W\" status). To be eligible for a University Withdrawal tuition refund, the student must withdraw from CUSOM and all classes are assigned a \"W\" status. Withdra wal tuition refunds will be based on the effective date of status change and calculated in accordance with the schedule as follows : Graduate & First Professional Programs Full University Withdrawal (\"W\" status assigned) All Semesters Timeframe Tuition Refund Days 1-5 100% Days 6 - End of Semester No Refund The Campbell University Business Office is responsible for the reassessment of student account charges; however, it is the responsibility of the CUSOM Office of Financial Aid to ensure financial aid awards have been evaluated and reassessed accordingly. The Campbell University Business Office reserves the right to hold refund of credit balances until the CUSOM Office of Financial Aid has evaluated and approved the release of funds awarded to stude nts who withdraw from the University . Any student account balance resulting from a University withdrawal or separation is the responsibility of the student and subject to the collections process. Students will not have grades entered on transcripts, or have transcripts available, if there is an outstanding balance owed the University . 3.5 Student Scholarships CUSOM awards merit scholarships to a limited number of admitted students as an effort to recruit highly qualified medical students. Scholarship criteri a are based primarily on cumulative GPA, science GPA, MCAT score, applicant interview, and scholarship essay. The Scholarship Committee may also consider other factors, such as undergraduate university, interest in osteopathic medicine, and commitment to s ervice . 43 Scholarship Criteria* *Scholarship Criteria are intended to serve as guidelines and may be modified as necessary by the Dean. Presidential Scholarship In order for a student to be considered for the Presidential Scholarship, the student must have a cumulative and science GPA of 3.50 or higher on a 4.0 scale, AND an MCAT score of 75th percentile.

Once approved by the Dean, all decisions are final. Candidates selected for scholarship consideration are emailed a letter inviting them to apply for the respective scholarship. The CUSOM Assistant Director of Financial Aid sends scholarship invitation letters to students via email. An invitation to submit an essay does not guarantee the student a scholarship . In order to be considered for sc holarship, a student must complete and return an essay, of no more than 500 words, explaining the following : Why the student would be an excellent candidate for scholarship assistance How the student will contribute to improving health care in North Caroli na What the student will contribute to Campbell University 44 All scholarship essays must be returned to CUSOM by the due date specified on the student's scholarship invitation. Completed essays should be submitted via email to : CUSOMFinancialAid@Campbell.edu. The Assistant Director of Financial Aid reviews the essay content and makes scholarship recommendations to the Dean. The Dean will make all final scholarship decisions. The Assistant Director of Financial Aid notifies scholarship recipients of their award by sending a formal scholarship notification letter via mail and email . Along with the award notification, students receive a scholarship contract, which must be completed and returned to CUSOM's Assistant Director of Financial Aid by the due date. Failure to complete and return the contract by the due date will result in forfeiture of the scholarship.

During the meeting, team members who have interact ed with the student as well as other pertinent campus and community individuals will present information. III. Upon conclusion, the CUBIT -SOM team may choose one of the following options: make a recommendation on the student's continued enrollment or dismissal; continue to gather information and meet again; or monitor the situation for new developments. The Vice De an for Academic Affairs will send a formal letter detailing the team's decision to the student and appropriate Associate Dean. A decision reached by CUBIT -SOM and/or sanctions imposed by CUBIT -SOM may be appealed by the student within three (3) school day s of the decision. All appeals must be made in writing and deliv ered to the Office of the Dean . If the request is timely filed, the matter may be returned to CUBIT -SOM to allow reconsideration of the original decision and/or sanction. CUBIT -SOM would then reconvene within ten (10) school days to hear the appeal. IV. If the CUBIT -SOM decision is upheld or accepted by the student, the Associate Dean or designee will meet with the student ( typically 1-2 business days) after the meeting to discuss the outcome and g ive the student a copy of the recommendation letter.

Students receive notification of the committee's decision. The CUBIT -SOM will use policies outlined in the Academic Bulletin as a framework for its recommendations; however, the team reserves the right to utilize creativity to find the most appropriate solution as long as it falls in line with the policies of Campbell University and the School of Osteopathic Medicine. All discussions and deliberations of the CUBIT -SOM shall be in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. After -Care Process If the CUBIT -SOM decision is u pheld or accepted by the student, the following procedures will occur: MS-1 and MS-2 Students: Will be followed by the Office of Student Affairs at CUSOM o Given the committee recommendations, Student Affairs will make contact once or more per month to ensure the student is in compliance Depending on recommendations, if the student is not in compliance (e.g., missing required appointments), they are given one warning and attempt to comply with the recommendations If the student is found in non-compliance again, the committee will be notified and will re -examine the case prior to the end of the block o Each month, a report is generated regarding progress , and kept in a secure file storage system that all committee members will be able to access. MS-3 and MS -4 Students: Will be followed by the Regional Deans and their constituent coordinators o Given the committee recommendations, contact will be made with each student once or more per month to ensure the student is in compliance Depending on recommendations, if the student is not in compliance (e.g., missing therapy appointments), they are given one warning and attempt to comply with recommendations If they are found in non -compliance again, the committee will be notified and re -examine the case prior to the end of the block o Each month, a report is generated regarding progress , and kept in a secure file storage system that all committee members will be able to access. 51 4.5 Controlled Substanc e Screening Protocol Controlled substance screening is becoming mandatory at many healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care, either as a learner or as a staff member. In light of this development, a controlled substance screening test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit substances , prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances, which are illegal in the state of North Carolina, is required before matriculation into CUSOM, and again before advancement to year three. Additional screen ing and/or confirmatory tests may be required as determined by CUSOM or the clinical training sites. CUSOM reserves the right to require controlled substance testing and/or a psychiatric evaluation on any student when there is an incident of erratic or unu sual behavior, or there is a reasonable concern due to a student's behavior, appearance or performance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal. Students found to have screening tests positi ve for alcohol, illicit substances , and controlled substances (defined as a drug or substance that is listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812) ) or prescription medications without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal. Please note this also includes substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina, but which may be legal in other states. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such , the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of Uni versity policy. CUSOM will provide clinical rotation sites with a copy of the results of any controlled substance screening performed on students prior to, and for the duration of, their placement at the site. By matriculating at CUSOM, students grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deemed appropriate. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the substance abuse screening or require further screening. CUSOM has no control over the content of third -party backgro und checks, which may include charges of driving under the influence. Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Background checks revealing prior criminal activity , even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, and/or employment opportunities . 52 Prior to starting Year 3: Students must have the controlled substance screening sample collected at the Campbell University's Health Center or another facility approved by CUSOM. If the test result is positive or shows other abnormalities, such as excessively dilute urine, the Dean will appoint an ad hoc subcommittee, a subset of the CUSOM APPS Committee, to review the information and make a recommendation to the Dean regarding the appropriate action. Depending on the decision, the student's advancement to the clinical year may be delayed based on the res ults. Results of controlled substance screenings are made available to clinical rotation sites. A student agrees to sharing this information when they matriculate at CUSOM. All controlled substance screening tests are maintained in a secure location to ensure confidentiality. Routine access to this information is limited to the Director of Student Affairs, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the CUSOM Dean (or Vice Dean as the Dean's designee), and the Campbell University General Counsel. Results from positive controlled substance screens are shared with the Director of Behavioral Health in the event the student requires drug/alcohol counseling. The entire cost of any testing is the responsibility of the student. 4.6 Infection Control Students exposed to infectious diseases should consult the Campbell University's Health Center (910) 893 -1560 for information regarding appropriate evaluation, testing and/or treatment. Students presenting with signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable disease should consult with Campbell University's Health Center or the infection control office at the clinical site to determine if it is safe for them to continue providing care, and if not, when it is safe to resume . Standard Precautions The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious disease. In the health care setting. These include both standard precautions for all patient care, and transmission -based precautions for situations in which specific infections are identified or suspected. A comprehensive description of these precautions are found on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/i ndex.html . Examples of standard precautions that make use of common sense practices and personal protective equipment to protect healthcare providers from infection and prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient, include, but are not limited t o, the following : 53 Hand washing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items Immediately after removing gloves Between patient contact Comprehensive CDC guidelines for hand hygiene in healthcare settings are found at https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/providers/index.html Gloves For contact with blood, body fluids, secretio ns and contaminated items For contact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin Masks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood or body fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may involve contact with blood or body fluid Linen Handle soiled linen to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipment in a manner to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean and disinfect equipment and furnishings in patient care areas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles Avoid removing used needles from disposable syringes Avoid bending, breaking or manipulating used needles by hand Place used sharps in puncture -resistant containers Additional information is found at https://www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/ 54 Patient resuscitation Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth - to-mouth resuscitation Patient placement Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms Needle sticks Incidents involving needle sticks and potential exposure to blood borne pathogens require immediate action to protect a student's health and safety. If a student sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious materials she/he should : CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood borne infectious disease following an exposure are found at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html Wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous membranes). Immediately notify the clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance. Call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center, the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needle stick exposures . Timely consult concerning appropriate tests, risk - assessment counseling and chemoprophylaxis decisions are critical. HIV post -exposure prophylaxis is most effective when initiated within the first few hours following an exposure so it is critical that students be evaluated immediately following any exposu re incident. This will ensure that if post - exposure prophylaxis is indicated, that it is started as early as possible in order to increase its effectiveness. Students who have an exposure after normal business hours, or are for any other reason unable to be evaluated at one of the above locations, should proceed immediately to the Emergency Department for evaluation. Complete an incident report from the facility in which the incident occurred and have a copy of the report sent to the Campbell University's Health Center (PO Box: 565, 129 T.T. Lanier St., Buies Creek, NC 27506). Send treatment and testing bills to the student's insurance company. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline (PEPline) is available by phone, (888) 448-4911, 6am-5pm (Pacific) seven days per week, (or http://nccc.ucsf.edu/ ):to provide guidance in managing exposures. Additional CDC guidelines for the prevention of infection transmission in health care setting s are found at the following websites and should be reviewed carefully before participating in any patient care activities : https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/outpatient/guide.pdf https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/index.html 55 Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident during a CUSOM a ctivity while on campus, the student must complete an incident report, and call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be obtained from Campbell University's Health Center (910) 893 -1560 . If the accident occurs at a clinical training facility, that facility's incident report form should be completed, and the clinical supervisor, Director of Student Medical Education or Director of Medical Education, the Regional Dean and the CUSOM Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs should be contacted for assistance. A copy of the facility's incident report must be sent to Campbell's Student Health Services (PO Box: 565, 129 T.T. Lanier St., Buies Creek, NC 27506) . 4.7 OSHA and HIPAA Training CUSOM requires that all students receive training on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) . CUSOM ensures the privacy and security of patient health information. In the normal course of business and operations, individuals receive requests to d isclose patient health information for various purposes . To support our commitment to patient confidentiality, CUSOM ensures that the appropriate steps are taken to verify the identity and authority of individuals and entities requesting protected health i nformation, as required under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.514(h) and other applicable federal, state, and/or local laws and regulations . Additionally, CUSOM ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems containing electronic protec ted health information by implementing policies to prevent, detect, mitigate, and correct security violations . CUSOM is in compliance with the US Department of Health and Human Services' Privacy Rule as it applies to the creation, collection, use or disclo sure of all individual health information (whether identifiable or not) (\"Information\") in connection with CUSOM . In addition, CUSOM requires that all students who have contact with patients receive OSHA Blood Borne Pathogens (BBP) training and be trained to prevent transmission of communicable pathogens. Students are mandated to review OSHA rules, requirements, appropriate plans and practices . CUSOM has the following plans in place : Blood Borne Pathogen Exposure Plan Infectious Waste Management Plan Biohazard Waste Management Plan The intent of these plans is to prevent blood borne infections by eliminating or minimizing employees and students exposure to blood, blood products, and other potentially infectious materials . 56 4.8 Professional Liability Insurance Students are covered by professional liability insurance in the event of incidents involving patients during clinical training which is part of their curriculum. . Any incidents that occur in the clinical interaction with patients should be reported to the clinical supervisor on -site, the Regional Dean, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, and the Campbell University General Counsel's Office at PO Box 114, Buies Creek, NC 27506, (910) 893 -1217 . 4.9 Exercise and Fitness CUSOM students have access to all Campbell University recreational facilities, which include: Student Fitness Center, Aquatic Center, Running and Walking Track, Keith Hills Golf Course, Tennis Courts, Carter Gym, Cross Country Course, Disc Golf Course and other recreational faciliti es.

Conference rooms are not approved study spaces, and must be reserved within each appropriate CUSOM department for official organized student meetings and/or events. Additional study space is available in Wiggins Memorial Library on main campus . 4.20 Student Conduct All CUSOM students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and personal integrity during medical school training is critical to the training of physicians. It is the responsibility of the student to support the standards and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSOM . All CUSOM students have the rights and obligations of o ther citizens and measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM students speak or act as private persons, they must avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University . As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of ac ademic freedom . 65 Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM student, I will... Be guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the advancement of knowledge and recognize the special responsibilities placed upon me; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly competence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical standards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster honest academic conduct and ensure student evaluations reflect the student's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and faculty, students and administration, and students and staff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inquiry of associates' exchange of ideas and show respect for the opinions of others; Give due regard to the paramount responsibilities within the institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. Respect for Patients CUSOM takes the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confidentiality. As osteopathic medical students, students must demonstrate respect for patients through appropriat e language and behavior, including that which is non -threatening and non - judgmental. In order to maintain professional relationships with patients and their families, patient privacy and modesty will be respected during history taking, physical examination s, and any other contact. It is critical for students to be truthful and not intentionally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclosing information to a patient that only the patient's physician should reveal. Students should always, or at the request of the patient, consult more experienced members of the medical team regarding patient care . 66 Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personnel, and Community Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hospital personnel, guests, and members of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punctuality in relationships with patients and peers, prompt execution of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledg e, experience or capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectful manner when in disagreement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached . Respect for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their daily conduct . Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students must respect the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local community, state and federal government . Chaperoned Physical Exam Policy Purpose The purpose of this policy is to define the need for and usage of chaperones in patient care, simulation, and teaching environments of Campbell University and its affiliated sites. Patient/learner trust cannot be m aintained without a basic understanding of the limits and responsibilities of the professional's role. The valued human experience of the physician -patient relationship is damaged when there is either confusion regarding professional roles and behavior or clear lack of integrity that allows sexual exploitation and harm. Sexual impropriety may comprise behavior, gestures, or expressions that are seductive, sexually suggestive, disrespectful of patient privacy, or sexually demeaning to a patient, that may include, but are not limited to: 1. neglecting to employ disrobing or draping practices respecting the patient's privacy, or deliberately watching a patient dress or undress; 2. subjecting a patient to an intimate examination in the presence of medical students or other parties without the patient's informed consent or in the event such informed consent has been withdrawn; 3. examination or touching of genital mucosal areas without the use of gloves; 67 4. inappropriate comments about or to the patient, including but no t limited to, making sexual comments about a patient's body or underclothing, making sexualized or sexually demeaning comments to a patient, criticizing the patient's sexual orientation, making comments about potential sexual performance during an examinat ion; 5. using the physician -patient relationship to solicit a date or romantic relationship; 6. initiation by the physician of conversation regarding the sexual problems, preferences, or fantasies of the physician; 7. performing an intimate examination or consultation without clinical justification; 8. performing an intimate examination or consultation without explaining to the patient the need for such examination or consultation even when the examination or consultation is pertinent to the issue of sexual fu nction or dysfunction; and/or 9. requesting details of sexual history or sexual likes or dislikes when not clinically indicated for the type of examination or consultation. Policy Medical students at any level of training are held to the same ethical standar ds as established by the medical profession. Efforts to provide a comfortable and considerate atmosphere for the patient and the learner are part of respecting patients' dignity. These efforts may include providing appropriate gowns, private facilities for undressing, sensitive use of draping, and clearly explaining various components of the physical examination. Having chaperones present during the physical exam can also help prevent misunderstandings between patient and learner or health care provider. Medical students and CUSOM faculty should: 1. Adhere to a policy that patients are free to request a chaperone during the medical encounter and ensure that the policy is clearly communicated to patients. 2. Always honor a patient's request to have a chaperone. 3. Never perform invasive or sensitive exams such as breast, pelvic, rectal, and genitourinary exams without the presence of an authorized chaperone. 4. Have an authorized member of the health care team serve as a chaperone. Physicians should establish clear expect ations that chaperones will uphold professional standards of privacy and confidentiality. 5. Use a chaperone even when a patient's trusted companion or family member is present. 6. Provide opportunity for private conversation with the patient without the chapero ne present. Physicians should minimize inquiries or history taking of a sensitive nature during a chaperoned examination. 7. Have chaperones available regardless of the physician's gender. 68 8. Inform the patient that an appropriate staff member can act as a chape rone if required and where possible this will be a member of staff of the same gender as the patient. 9. Respect that the patient has the right, at all times, to decline a particular person as chaperone. 10. Utilize the learning or simulation environment in a manner consistent with respecting patient privacy 11. Utilize same gender models for sensitive physical exam demonstrations whenever possible (cardiac exam, sacral exam, etc...) 12. Perform Osteopathic Manual Manipulation (OMM) only on subjects or patients who are adequately clothed to cover all sensitive areas. 13. Not perform OMM as an invasive procedure. 14. Respect the right of a patient participating in an educational activity (such as, but not limited to OMM lab, ultrasound lab, clinical skills) to refuse any compone nt of the physical exam. 15. Respect the right of a child volunteer in the OMM or Clinical Skills lab to refuse any component of a physical exam, even if approval to perform the exam has been given by the parent. Children participating in OMM or Clinical Skil ls labs must never be forcefully subjected to any physical exam, even if the exam is not considered sensitive in nature. Family members or friends of the patient should not be expected to undertake any formal chaperone role. There is a risk of inadvertent breaches of confidentiality and embarrassment if friends or relatives are chaperones, and they are best avoided unless there is no alternative than postponing an immediately necessary physical examination. There is also the possibility of collusion betwee n the patient and friend/relative/caregiver to conspire where any complaint or abuse is made. Medical students must not conduct any intimate examination unsupervised even if the patient provides permission for them to proceed with the examination without a chaperone. Medical students cannot act as a chaperone to their clinical partner (another medical student) or another health care provider for intimate examinations. It is important that students seek verbal consent from patients for any form of examinati on. For intimate examinations, informed consent is particularly important. Intimate examinations include the following: Vaginal examination Rectal examination Examination of external genitalia Breast examination Any other examination that might embarrass patients through the removal of clothes, particularly those examinations that might expose external genitalia or breasts 69 Procedure Communicate the chaperone protocol to patients by prominent notice through conversation with the patient. Honor all requests for a chaperone. Utilize private facilities for undressing, incorporate sensitive use of draping, and provide clear explanations on the various components of the physical examination. o The nature of the procedure/examination should be explained o The purpose of the procedure/examination should be clearly stated, e.g. \"it is to help me learn how to...\" o There should be an explanation (where relevant) of what will happe n to the information collected ( e.g., \"I will record my findings in the medical notes...\" ) o The pati ent's understanding and acceptance of the procedure/ examination should be assessed and documented. Utilize chaperones on a consistent basis, particularly for intimate examinations and those that may be construed as such regardless of physician or learner' s gender. When a chaperone is present, keep patient inquiries of a sensitive nature to a minimum. Provide a separate opportunity for a private conversation between the patient and the physician, in order to protect the patient's personal health information (PHI). Provide an authorized health professional to serve as the chaperone whenever possible. During a rectal/vaginal examination, surgical gloves must be worn. Gloves act as a barrier and thus help to maintain the clinical nature of the exam. Throughout the examination the health care professional must remain alert to verbal and non -verbal indications of distress from the patient. Any request for the examination to be discontinued should be respected and documented in the patients records. Any discussion during the examination should be kept relevant avoiding any unnecessary personal comments regardless of whether a chaperone is present. A person who is feeling embarrassed or vulnerable is more likely to misinterpret a comment. Document in the patient note or chart the presence of a chaperone with any intimate examination or those that may be construed as such. 70 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers the following additional guidance on the use of chaperones for children and adolescents. In the me dical office setting, the physical examination of an infant, toddler, or child should always be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian is unavailable or the parent's presence will interfere with the physical examination, such as in a possible case of abuse or parental mental health issues, a chaperone should be present during the physical examination . Consequences of non -compliance Items of potential non -compliance are of serious concern and will require confirmation via investigation of any allegation. Due to the sensitive nature of the grievance, CUSOM will require that all real and standardized patient interactions with the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the investigation conclus ion. As outlined in the Academic Bulletin, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct , or unprofessional conduct. The CUSOM Honor Code will guide this review. Outcomes of an APPS committee intervention include any of the following levels of discipline: Disciplinary Probation Suspension Withdrawal Dismissal without the option to return Revocation of Degree Violations of patient rights are serious matters and may result in criminal charges. FERPA privacy laws do not protect violations of a criminal nature. Conclusions regarding fitness to practice and treatment if appropriate. According to the recommendations made by the Federation of State Medical Boards, Campbell University support s the loss of enrollment into the school, as well as revocation of degree upon confirmed misconduct. 71 4.21 Accommodations Policy Campbell University is committed to providing equal educational opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with the nondiscrimination policy of the University and in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 . The law states that a person with a \"disabili ty\" is : \"Someone with a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairment; or a person who is regarded as having such an impairment.\" (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) Equal educational opportunity means that a person with a disability who is qualified for admission must have access to the same university programs, services, and activities as all other students. If necessary to provide equal opportunity, Campbell will make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial burden . Under the provisions of Section 504, universities may not discriminate in the recruitment, admission, educational process, or treatment of students. Students who have self -identified, provided documentation of disability, and requested reasonable accommod ations are entitled to receive approved modifications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educational programs and activities. Section 504 specifies that universities may not limit the number of students with disabilities admitted, make preadmissions inquiries as to whether or not an applicant has a disability, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately measure the academic qualifications of students with disabilitie s because special provisions were not made, exclude a qualified student with a disability from any course of study, or establish rules and policies that may adversely affect students with disabilities . In support of its commitment to provide equal educatio nal opportunity, Campbell provides a variety of services and accommodations to students with documented disabilities. Campbell University's Student Guide for Accessing Disability Services can be accessed here. Questions or comments about this manual should be directed to Laura Rich, Director of Student Success /ADA/504 Compliance Officer . Laura Rich Student Services, Current CUSOM Students with Disabilities Section I - Who to Contact Students with documented disabilities who desire modifications or accommodations must contact the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs : Jennifer Parrish, MEd, LPCA CUSOM Director of Student Affairs Leon Levine Hall of Medical Sciences, Room 115 (910) -893-1846 jparrish@campbell.edu No accommodations will be made without approval through the University's process. A medical, psychological or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disability if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A disability may be temporary or ongoing . Section II: How to Obtain Services General Procedure for Receiving Accommodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Director of Student Affairs to request services as soon as possible . The University is not responsible for identifying students with disabilities and i s not required to provide services unless proper procedures have been followed in making a request . Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Director of Student Affairs, who consults with the Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Offic er to provide documentation of the disability and to complete the appropriate paperwork . Step 3: The Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting documentation , if needed . The process of review depends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions regarding accommodations are made on a case -by-case basis. There is no standard accommodation for any particular disability. CUSOM will make reasonable modification s to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial burden . 73 Step 4: If the request for accommodations is approved, the Directo r of Student Affairs generates a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) document ing the student's individual, approved accommodations. The Office of Students Affairs coordinates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accommodations are not approved i s encouraged to meet with the Director of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Director may discuss the grievance procedure with the student at this time . Additional Information Regarding Documentation and Accommodations For any stude nt deemed eligible, CUSOM provides accommodations and/or modifications to policies and practices in order to ensure that all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and activities. The purpose of accommodations is not to ensure success, but rather to provide access and equal educational opportunity . Accommodations are not provided retroactively. Any student approved for accommodations is entitled to services and accommodations only from the date that approval is given. Even if the studen t can establish that he or she had a disability at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expunge or re - examine coursework completed before the student was reviewed and approved for accommodation . No student is required to disclose his or her disability to the university. However, as discussed above, any student who discloses and receives approved accommodations after he or she has begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accommodations on work completed before the approval for accommodations was made . Documentation of a student's disability is only shared with relevant CUSOM faculty, staff or administration on a need -to-know basis with a release of information signed by the student . Service Animal Information According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individually trained to work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to, guiding individuals with imp aired vision, alerting individuals to an impending seizure or protecting individuals during one, and alerting individuals who are hearing impaired to intruders, or pulling a wheelchair and fetching dropped items\". Providing comfort or support does not qual ify an animal as a service animal. If there are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, a determination is made by Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer . 74 In compliance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all buildings on campus and may attend any class, meeting, or other event. Service animals are expected to exhibit reasonable behavior while on campus. The owners of disruptive and aggressive servi ce animals may be asked to remove them from university facilities. If the improper behavior happens repeatedly, the owner may be told not to bring the service animal into any facility until they take significant steps to mitigate the behavior . Emotional su pport animals are animals that provide comfort and relieve symptoms of mental health disorders. The CUSOM Director of Student Affairs can provide further information. Emotional support animals are not allowed in other campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is deemed as a reasonable accommodation and will be included in the student's Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from CUSOM . Cleanliness of any animal living or working on campus is mandatory. Consideration of others must be tak en into account when providing maintenance and hygiene of animals. The owner is expected to clean and dispose of all animal waste . Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed under the provisions of the Family Education R ights and Privacy Act of 1974. Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their school records as defined by law. Other than for \"Directory Information\", Campbell University will release info rmation only with the student's written consent and will use \"Directory Information\" in the best interests of the student . CUSOM is committed to ensuring all information compiled concerning a student remains confidential as required by applicable law. Any information monitored or collected is used for the benefit of the student . Only those faculty and staff members of CUSOM have access to information collected for use in accomplishing necessary tasks for the student. Any information gathered is not released to third parties except in accordance with state and federal law . A student must give written authorization to release information when he/she wishes to share it with others. The student must specify the information to be released, the purpose of the rele ase, and to whom the information is to be forwarded. This release may be handwritten, or a form from CUSOM Office of Student Affairs may be used . By matriculating at CUSOM, a student agrees that CUSOM may share their Match data. A student has the right to review his/her own file and as a courtesy to the individual, copies of documents and information obtained will be provided at no cost with limitations . 75 Section III: Student Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify him/herself to the Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accommodations. CUSOM is not responsible for identifying students with disabilities or for contacting such students to begin the accommodation request process . 2. Provide documentation which confo rms to the university's guidelines. If the student's documentation is insufficient for any reason, the student is responsible for pursuing whatever additional documentation is required and to pay any costs thereof. CUSOM reserves the right not to provide s ervices or accommodations until all of the documentation specified in the guidelines is provided . 3. Any student approved for accommodations is responsible for retrieving his or her Letter of Accommodation (LOA) and Release of Information Form from the Director of Student Affairs or available at : https://cuweb.wufoo.com/forms/cusom -release -of-information/ Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommodations Testing a ccommodations require frequent communication between the student and the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education (Years 1 and 2) or Department of Clinical Affairs (Years 3 and 4) . It is very important that testing information be shared wi th these offices in a timely manner . At the beginning of the semester , and at least one week prior to the first scheduled test, the student should discuss with the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Affa irs all approved testing accommodation s. This discussion should address the questions of how, when and where the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs will provide the testing accommodations. The student should make sure to have a calendar and a copy of the LOA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs of their need for accommodations at least one week prior to each test/exam . If at any time you feel that the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, or the Department of Clinical Affairs is not adequately meeting your accommodations, discuss this with the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or Department of Clinical Affairs and the Director of Student Affairs immediately . Remember, the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Educatio n is only required to provide accommodations specifically listed in the Letter of Accommodation . 76 Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicapped parking on campus must maintain state -issued handicap parking per mits. The student is also required to purchase an appropriate parking sticker from parking administration . If a student has consistent problems finding necessary handicapped parking near his/her class buildings, notify the Director of Student Affairs and p arking administrator immediately . Section IV: Documenting a Disability General Documentation Guidelines To ensure that reasonable and appropriate services and accommodations are provided to students with disabilities, students requesting such accommodations and services must provide current documentation of their disability. Such documentation generally must include the following : a clear diagnostic statement of the disability prepared by a licensed professional a description of the manner in which the disability limits the student in a specified major life activity and the severity of the limitation It is the responsibility of the student requesting the accommodations and services to document the disability. As such, the cost of evaluations required pursuant to these guidelines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modifications to previously approved accommodations. The student will have to provide current supporting documentation for review at that time. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to supplement documentation, but are generally insufficient documentation when presented alone . Guidelines for Documenting a Learning Disability Every report should be o n letterhead, typed, dated, signed and otherwise legible, and be comprised of the following elements : Evaluator Information : The name, title, and credentials of the qualified professional who conducted the assessment should begin the report. Please note th at members of the student's family are not considered appropriate evaluators . Recent Assessment : The report must provide adequate information about the student's current level of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or complete assessment. 77 Testing : There should be a discussion of all tests that were administered, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e. domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. Informal assessment, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), and/or a 504 plan may help to supplement a more comprehensive test battery but are generally insufficient documentation when p resented alone . In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly stated diagnosis are helpful. The summary should integrate the elements of the battery with background information, observations of the client during the testing situation, and the student's cur rent academic situation. This summary should present evidence of a substantial limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and weakness are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disability diagnosis. It should also demonst rate that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for the learning problem. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discussed. This summary may include recommended accommodations, but these are in no way binding to the University. CUSOM reserves the right to evaluate all documentation and determine appropriate accommodations in each case . Section V: Grievance Procedure All requests for accommodations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs. Problems with approved accommodations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs . If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs, the student and the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs should forward the complaint to the Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer for an informal resolution. The Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer will ar range a meeting with the student and CUSOM Director of Student Affairs within ten (10) business days of receiving the complaint . In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file a complaint with the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. The Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer within ten (10) business days of receiving the complaint . In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file a complaint with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost if the issue involves denial of an academic accommodation . Students are also encouraged to exerc ise their rights of complaint through the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if needed . 78 5. ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND POLICIES 5.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM is a student -centered institution. As such, all administrators will be accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Additionally, senior administrators will strive to have informal meetings on a regular basis, such as \"Breakfast/Lunch with the Dean\", a twice -monthly meeting of small student groups with the Dean and Associate academic Deans. The Academic Advisor -Advisee relationship is one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even teach. The advisor/advisee relationship will ensure consistent feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. The Director of Student Affairs and Assistant Dean for Faculty assign academic advisors to each incoming CUSOM student. The list of academic advisors is then reviewed and approved by the Dean. Academic advisors provide guidance while students are attending CUSOM. The academic advisor, CUSOM Behavioral Health, the Academic Center for Excellence , faculty, Deans, and staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the four years of medical school, and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. As students enter clinical rotations, additional advising relationships are developed to support the specialty selection and residency application processes. CUSOM Clinical Department Chairs provide advice and support to students applying in their fields. Students are provided a list of clinical advisors/mentors classified by their areas of clinical expertise, and are free to choose additional mentors according to their interest in a specific clinical discipline. Clinical advisors provide guidance to the students with a focus on the clinical path they are interested in pursuing. This advising policy ensures that both biomedical science and clinical faculty are involved in student advisement. This relationship endeavors to create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. Significant personal or behavioral health problems are referred to the Behavioral Health Services for assessment and potential referral for counseling. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors is as follows: During Blocks 1 and 2, students will meet with their academic advisor at least once individually each Block and once each Block in a group setting. During the remaining academic blocks in the first and second years, students will meet with their advisors at least once a semester in an individual or group setting. 79 Students who receive a grade of 75% or less on any integrated exam are recommended to contact their academic advisor or the Academic Center for Excellence for an individual meeting. The frequency of follow -up meetings will be determined by the advisor or the Academic Center for Excellence . Students who desire individual advising sessions can schedule additional meetings with their academic advisors or the Academic Center for Excellence at any time regardless of their academic performance. Students on Academic Probation will meet with academic advisors or the Academic Center for Excellence at least twice a month, or as may be required by the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. In addition to their role as specifically assigned academic advisors, faculty also meet with non- assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty publish office hours , and are available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By matriculating at CUSOM, students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate advising effectiveness. 5.2 CUSOM Tutoring Program The program is to help students requesting tutoring service (tutees) become more proficient in subject materials and more efficient as independ ent learners across a broad range of courses through individual, peer tutoring sessions. Overview of Program CUSOM MS1 and MS2 students who wish to receive peer -tutoring support will place their requests by logging onto the Blackboard Class Community and fill in a form following the Wufoo link.

Attendance will be monitored by the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education (Med Ed) using the lecture hall cameras, and electronic attendance records are maintained . Absences for emergencies are considered on a case -by-case basis through Med Ed. Any falsification of attendance records is viewed as an Honor Code violation . Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the first two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action through the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 82 Attendance of MS-3 and MS-4 students is required for all requisite clinical duties of the particular rotation on a daily basis with structured time away from the rotation at the discretion of the clinical site director. Students on clinical rotations are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital committee meetings, on-call assignments, case presentations, etc. Students must abide by attendance requirements as described in the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual. Violations may result in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, and possible notation in the Dean's Letter of Evaluation (Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE )). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. MS-1 and MS-2 Years It is recognized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; however, the student who misses a lecture, laboratory or workshop is not excused from the subject materials or duties of that particular period. The student may be required to make -up the missed educational session(s) during off-hours. Makeup laboratories are conducted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Course Director with consultation with the Block Leaders, Med Ed and Vice Dean for Academic Affairs when necessary. The total n u m b e r o f absences must not exceed 20% of a course. No excused absences are granted while the 20% threshold has not been reached. Once a student has met or exceeded the 20% mark, the student may be eligible to request an excused absence through Med Ed by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: For medical condition/illness, the student must provide Med Ed with a note from the examining physician (who is NOT a family member) indicating the time of medical visit and recommended time off and/or return date must be submitted upon the student's return to class. For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Examples of emergent situations include: o Death in immediate family o Critical status secondary to accident/acute illness involving immediate family member Note: \"Immediate family member\" is defined as a student's parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, spouse's parent, child or sibling . 83 Appropriate documentation to support the request is required, and must be submitted for approval to Med Ed . For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. For attending CUSOM -related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence must be submitted, in writing, t o M e d E d at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence(s). To be considered for such request, students must have a cumulative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good academic standing. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted. CUSOM accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancelled or delayed travel plans. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. As there is no 20% allowance for mandatory laboratory (OMM, Anatomy) or Clinical Skills activities , a separate laboratory excused absence request must be completed and submitted to the Course Director and Med Ed. The same aforementioned criteria outlined above apply. A pproval must be granted and obtained in order to arrange a make -up with the Course Director . An unexcused absence from one of these activities m ay result in a grade of zero (0) and/or an overal l grade deduction (refer to each specific course syllabus) . In the event of any absence from an examination, quiz, or Interprofessional Education (IPE) activity, approval must be obtained to arrange a make -up. It is essential each student makes every effort not to miss any examination or quiz. Requests for make - up examinations or quizzes must be made in a timely manner with Med Ed. An unexcused absence from an examination, quiz, laboratory, IPE event, or assignment may result in a grade of zero (0) for that exercise. For an absence to be considered excused , students must notify Med Ed and complete t h e a p p r o p r i a t e l e c t u r e o r l a b \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. Med Ed will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the student will be notified of the decision in a timely manner. If a student is failing any course or has been placed on Academic Probation, they may not be approved for an excused absence unless for an extraneous situation determined on a case-by-case basis. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an attendance decision. Once an absence request is approved, it is the student's responsibility to contact Course Directors and Me d Ed to arrange a makeup for missed laboratories and a n exam ination/ quiz where applicable. It is important to note that, although the Course Directors will do their best to accommodate the makeup requests, some missed experience s may not be replicable, and the arrangement is at the Course Directors' discretion . 84 Official Holidays CUSOM observes the following University holidays. New Year 's Day Martin Luther King Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas (Varies) Holidays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monday after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell University. https://www.campbell.edu/faculty -staff/human -resources/university -perks/ Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, he or she should advise the respective Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Regional Assistant Dean as soon as possible. Consequences of Non-compliance As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee may be consider non-compliance of the Attendance Policy by MS- 1 and MS-2 students as a violation of CUSOM policy and result in disciplinary action. APPS actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, organization or student government office; and possible notation in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), the Dean's Letter of Evaluation. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 85 MS-3 and MS-4 Years Students in third and fourth -year clinical rotations must abide by the additional attendance requirements described in the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual. One hundred percent (100%) attendance on all clinical rotations is expected. Failure to notify both the Office of Clinical Affairs and the Regional Site Coordinator of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. An unexcused absence will result in either a failing or an incomplete grade and result in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students are required to be at their assigned supervised clinical education experience sites for a minimum of 40 hours per week, unless the clinical site is open less than 40 hours. Students may be assigned to day, evening, night, weekend or holiday work hours. Preceptors may ask students to rotate their scheduled work hours in order to gain the most clinical experience during times of peak patient flow. During certain clinical rotations, students may be assigned to Saturday and Sunday hours as well. Campbell University Holiday schedule is independent of the clinical rotation schedule. Third - and fourth -year students must follow the schedule as outlined by their preceptor for the month. A minimum of 160 contact hours are required for completion and credit assignment for each rotation. If fewer than 160 contact hours are completed the rotation is considered incomplete. Attendance Attendance at all scheduled workdays is mandatory. Students are expected to arrive at least fifteen (15) minutes early on each of their scheduled workdays. Any length of absence (an hour, \u00bd day, full day) must be immediately reported to the Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean and the corresponding Director of Third Year or Director of Fourth Year Rotations. 1. Discretionary Days: Students are allowed three (3) discretionary days total annually. No more than one (1) day may be taken in any given rotation, and discretionary days may NOT be used on a Call Back Friday (last Friday of the rotation). Discretionary days MUST be approved by both the preceptor and Office of Clinical Affairs in writing at least one (1) week in advance to the requested time off. Requests are to be submitted electronically via the CUSOM Absence Request/Subm ission Form (as identified below) to the corres ponding the either the 3rd Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator or the 4th Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator . 86 2. Sick Days: Students are allowed five (5) sick days annually. If more than five (5) sick days total are taken by a student, this may result in referral to the Office of Clinical Affairs and the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review. 3. Family emergencies/ Death in Family Due to the variability of circumstances, time off needed for family emergencies or a death in the family will be reviewed by Office of Clinical Affairs on a case- by-case basis. 4. Time off for residency interviews: Interviews at any CUSOM -sponsored residency program do not count against recorded absences. Students may request no more than four (4) days off for interviewing during any 4-week rotation, and no more than two (2) days over any 2-week rotation. This includes partial day absences of greater than four (4) hours. Students will be required to make up missed time at the rotation director's discretion. All requests for time off must include written verification of the interview location and date, provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs at least one (1) week prior to the requested date of absence. Extracurricular activities, vacations, or lacks of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. Email is the primary method of communication between the Department of Clinical Affairs and students and thus students must check their CUSOM email regularly. Students are required to attend all onsite meetings designated by the Regional Site Coordinator or Regional Dean. Students must contact their clinical site/preceptor as well as the Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean and either the 3rd Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator or the 4th Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immediately if they are missing any clinical time due to illness (leaving early, arriving late, or missing a full day). If 2-4 hours of clinical time is missed, a \u00bd day will be documented. More than four (4) hours of missed clinical time = a full day of sick leave. If an absence of greater than one working day is necessary due to illness, that time must be made up. Arrangements for missed time will be coordinated with the Office of Clinical Affairs through the Regional Site Coordinator. 87 If the student is absent from a single rotation for two (2) days or more due to illness, the student is required to submit a note from a licensed healthcare provider defining the number of days absent, and the expected date of return to the Office of Clinical Affairs . If extraordinary circumstances require a prolonged absence (more than three (3) days in one rotation), the student may be encouraged to consider a Medical Leave of Absence which can be requested through the Office of Clinical Affairs. A Medical Leave of Absence may be required for students who miss more than three (3) days due to medical reasons and are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation. A Medical Leave of Absence may delay the student's graduation. Each case is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Students who require a Medical Leave of Absence will be reviewed the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Dean and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. A Modified Course of Study will be developed in discussion with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Permission for an absence must be obtained in advance with all of the following: CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, Clinical preceptor to whom student is assigned, and Regional Dean/Director of Medical Education of the affiliated hospital. Student absence requests must be made utilizing the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form and may be obtained from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found online at: https://c uweb.wufoo.com/fo rms/m6 3yfw91siq e3g/ All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed using this form. There are no exceptions for this procedure and failure to follow the procedure will result in an unexcused absence. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) days of a 4-week rotation, or two (2) days of a 2-week rotation, regardless of the reason, may not receive credit for the rotation and will be required to appear before the APPS committee. The rotation program is a full-time educational experience, and any other activities will not take precedence or conflict with the student's assigned/required duties. An unexcused absence may result in either a failing or an incomplete grade and referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee. 88 If a student desires to participate in an activity that will take him/her away from an assigned clinical setting, the student must submit a written request fully explaining the request and detailing the time away from assigned duty. This request must be submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs at least two (2) working days (week days), before the requested absence. Students wishing to attend educational seminars or conferences, etc. must have approval from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Only students in \"good standing\" and with an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale at the end of the MS-2 training will be considered. In addition, students must have up-to-date submissions of all clinical rotation evaluations, site evaluations and clinical experience database (logs). Time away from rotation must be made up to achieve the total of 160 contact hours required to receive full credit for the rotation. Educational presentations such as posters or research may be, at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, counted toward the required 160 contact hours. Any excused absence may be required to be made up in order to satisfy attendance requirements as noted in the Academic Bulletin. As noted above, permission for time off for internship/residency interviews must be granted in advance with the aforementioned offices. Training Hours Clear communication of the expectations between students, the Office of Clinical Affairs, and the training sites will permit flexibility within reasonable limits in a way that does not impact either clinical education or reflect on a student' s professionalism. Four (4) weeks of vacation time is included in both the third and fourth years as a scheduled rotation block. Students are generally expected to work five (5) full days (an average of forty (40) hours, with a guideline of sixty (60) per week, but the length (hours) of some required \"shift\" schedules may be different for Surgical, Sub-Internship, and Emergency Medicine rotations. Working hours in each of the services will be indicated and determined by the training site and the physician in charge of that service, in cooperation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Vice President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/Director of Medical Education of the CUSOM affiliated training site. If call, night duty, or weekend duties are required, this will be indicated by the individual rotation. The student may not substitute work day hours from one service to another and are required to stay on the clinical rotation to which he/she is assigned. A student may spend time in another department only if it is part of the assigned clinical rotation's curriculum and only with approval of their attending physician/clerkship director. 89 For example, it is acceptable for a student in general surgery to spend time in pathology following tissue and biopsy results to ensure proper follow -up and continuity of care. It is not acceptable, however, for a student to make -up missed hours of an Obstetrics/Gynecology rotation in the Emergency Department. Any questions should be directed to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. If a student should work call, night duty or the weekend, he/she may be given compensatory time off. Compensatory time off greater than two (2) days must be approved by the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students are not permitted to rearrange their normal working schedule to allow for time off during any rotation. The only exception may be the Emergency Medicine and inpatient Hospitalist rotations in order to accommodate shift schedules, provided it has been approved by the appropriate supervising physician. Professionalism in patient care requires reliable attendance. The Office of Clinical Affairs will centrally track the number of days off for each student. No unexcused absences can be permitted from patient care activities. As noted above, students will be given three (3) discretionary days and five (5) Sick Days (approved absences) per academic year. Any student in violation of attendance policies with more than two (2) days per rotation or a total of five (5) days per academic year of time off (not made up) may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for further review. Anticipated time off: Conferences - Additional excused time off may be granted only if the student is presenting, is a national officer, or by special permission. All requests for conferences need prior approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs as noted above. Students are required to make up time off for conferences. Residency interviews - Prior approval is required as noted above and must follow CUSOM procedure. Students are not permitted to miss more than four (4) days for a 4-week rotation or two (2) days for a 2-week rotation. Students may be required to make up time off for residency interviews. Jury Duty - Appropriate documentation must be provided and the student may be required to make up any extended missed days. Unanticipated time off may be required for such events as: Personal medical illness Unexpected personal time needs (funerals, family illness, etc.) Student absence requests must be made utilizing the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form which may be obtained from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found online at https://c uweb.wufoo.com/fo rms/m6 3yfw91siq e3g/. All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed using this form. 90 Make Up Time Students are be expected to be available to make up anticipated time off at the discretion of the rotation director in order to maintain compliance with the CUSOM attendance policy. If the student's absence involves missing an examination, the student will retake the exam at the discretion of the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) days of a 4-week rotation, or two (2) days of a 2-week rotation, regardless of the reason, may not receive credit for the rotation and may be called to the APPS committee. Tardiness Promptness is a trait healthcare professionals must display and is expected of all CUSOM students. Tardiness is disruptive to the preceptor, patients and fellow students and is thus inconsiderate and disrespectful. Repeated violations are considered improper professional behavior and may result in disciplinary action. Students on clinical rotations are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital committee meetings, on-call assignments, case presentations, etc. Violations may result in disciplinary action by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee including, but not limited to: loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office; and possible notation in the Dean's Letter of Evaluation, Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. Call Back Fridays Students are required to return to Campbell University on the last Friday (or as otherwise designated) of the following core clinical rotations: Family Medicine, Internal Medicine II, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Emergency Medicine. During these sessions, end -of-rotation (Shelf) exams are taken, and r otation specific pre -preparation activities occur including, but not limited to: formal OSCEs; simulation; workshops; seminars; OMM practice, review and practical application ; and interprofessional events. Full attendance and participation the entire day i s MANDATORY. These sessions typically are scheduled for 8am -5pm; therefore, students should NOT make any travel plans prior to 5pm. These times may be subject to change. In the event of illness, BOTH the Shelf exam and the rotation specific pre- preparation activities will need to be completed in order to receive credit for completion of the rotation. Any emergency requiring absence from a Call Back Friday must be communicated to the Office of Clinical Affairs immediately. 91 Fourth Year Call Bac k Requirements Attendance and active participation in a minimum of two (2) on -campus Call Back Friday OMM activities workshops during required rotations. One of these will occur during Residency Development Month, where the students are required to perform an OMM specific OSCE in a simulated outpatient setting. The second will occur when students return to campus to take th eir core emergency medicine end - of-rotation exam, where the students are required to attend an OMM workshop structured to help them dev elop strategies for integrating OMM into their post - graduate education. Students are always welcome to attend additional Call Back Friday activities as space allows. Holidays While on clinical rotations, students are excused only for holidays that are observed by their respective clinical site. If a student is assigned by a preceptor to work on a holiday, the student may NOT request use of a discretionary day on the holiday. Third and fourth year students are required to follow the training site (e.g., hospital, clinic, office, health center) policies and procedures regarding holidays. All major holidays are observed at the discretion of the affiliated training site and must be reported to the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. If a student is required to work on a major holiday, the student may be given a compensatory day off during the holiday week at the discretion of the Vice President of Medical Education/ Regional Dean/ Director of Medical Education. Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, he or she should advise the respective Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Regional Assistant Dean as soon as possible. Consequences of Non-compliance As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. For MS-3 or MS-4 students any unexcused absence while on clinical rotation will automatically result in a failure or incomplete for that rotation and the student r ef err ed to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 92 Severe Weather Policy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules or dining option changes, a message will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and www.campbell.edu/cusom , Facebook, Twitter, and through our inclement weather line: On campus : dial 5700 Local, but not on campus: dial 910-814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 In the case of severe weather while on clinical rotations, students should follow the severe weather protocol of their specific clinical site. If the preceptor is present, the student should make every attempt to be present. If the student is unable to get to the clinical site due to unsafe road conditions, the student must communicate this to their preceptor, their Regional Site Coordinator and the 3rd Year Student Medical Education Clinical or the 4th Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immediately. Any time missed due to severe weather must be made up at the discretion of the preceptor, Regional Dean and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, keeping in mind that students must complete a minimum of 120 hours on a 4-week rotation block in order to receive credit for their rotation. Emergency Preparedness Plan Section One - Assessment of Risk The guiding principle behind the assessment of risk for the Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) shall be the protection of life and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. Communication and coordination between and the CUSOM Clinical Affairs Department and Regional Deans will be crucial to assessing risks within our respective clinical campus regions. CUSOM recognizes that, due to the geographic dispersion of the clinical campuses, events affecting one region might not affect all regions. For events that are anticipated such as ice storms, hurricanes, or other known events, a meeting will be scheduled 4-5 days in advance of the event to include the Dean of CUSOM, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Director and Assistant Director of Clinical Affairs, and Regional Deans to discuss the projected events and the plan for response by each Regional Dean. Regional Deans shall be prepared to discuss their response if the event is \"Green \" which would indicate minimal impact, \"Yellow\" which would indicate a medium level impact, and \"Red\" which would indicate a catastrophic event. 93 Event Category Description Green Event Minimal impact to life and property in the region with expected loss of utilities to last no longer than 1-2 days. Yellow Event Moderate impact to life and property in the region with potential loss of life and moderate damage to local structures. Utility failure projections of at least 3-7 days. Red Event Severe impact to life and property in the region with loss of life and severe damage to local structures. Parts of the area are uninhabitable for weeks. Water and sewer system failure with power loss projections of greater than 7 days. Regional Deans will be the key point of contact for CUSOM and for its students in the respective regions and should print student contact information and carry it with them until the event is over. The Regional Deans, or their representative, will be responsible for contacting each student in their region to make them aware of plans for response to the event at least two (2) days in advance (if known in advance). In an unanticipated event, Regional Deans will have the authority to assess the risk and communicate with students and CUSOM Administration their plans. Section Two - Communication of Risk and Protection of Life Safety CUSOM will send a post-disaster assessment communication to students giving them instructions on what to do, supplies they should have on hand, and key sources of credible information during the event. The Regional Dean will serve as the primary point of contact for students communicating with them directly during a disaster by email, telephone, and text message. Pre-Event Communication with Instructions During Event Email, Text Messaging, Website and Phone Communication s 94 Section Three - Identification of Student Whereabouts and Status Each clinical campus will keep a current list of student cell phone numbers and addresses in a printable format that can be taken home for reference by the Regional Dean in an adverse event. If electronic communication is available, a survey may be conducted online requesting student response with their condition, location where sheltering, and any needs they may have. Section Four - Volunteer Coordination Regional Deans will communicate in advance of an adverse event with students in the region to provide specific instructions regarding when students may return to the facility. Section Five - Educational Program Continuity Regional Deans in affected regions, along with the Clinical Affairs Department, will be in frequent contact to discuss relocation of affected students, when necessary, in order to ensure educational program continuity. End of rotation exams may be rescheduled or alternate days may be offered depending on the impact of the event on students. Section Six - Resources for Displaced Students In the event of a catastrophic event, CUSOM may explore arranging temporary housing and assist with other needs to the extent possible . 5.4 Dress Code Policy Students must maintain a professional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences or rotations. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes, or workshops. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for OMM, Clinical Skills, and Gross Anatomy labs. Students do not need to maintain professional attire after the normal end of the school day, Monday through Friday, or on weekends, except when notified by the school administration . All students must have at least one short, white consultation jacket maintained in a clean and presentable condition. A clean and well-cared -for appearance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well groomed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, or students. Men must wear dress trousers, appropriate shoes and socks, dress shirt and necktie. Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length (no higher than 2\" above the knee when sitting) or slacks with appropriate blouses. Hairstyles should be 95 clean and neat, avoiding extreme length, styles, or colors. Revealing or tight, form fitting clothing is unacceptable. Beards and mustaches must be neat and trimmed at all times. Excessive body piercings are not acceptable. Shorts, jeans, T-shirts are not permitted except in the OMM and Clinical Skills l a b s when appropriate. Hats (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a hat (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Students who have tattoos must ensure they are covered at all times on-campus, and during clinical rotations, except when exposure is required during OMM or Clinical Skills labs. Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus o r t h e i r c l i n i c a l r o t a t io n and not return until appropriately attired. Any class missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Student Affairs or Department of Clinical Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. Additional Dress Code Requirements: Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. These include the laboratory classes of OMM, Anatomy, and Clinical Skills. OMM Laboratory Dress Code The dress requirement in the OMM lab sessions is designed to promote learning by providing optimal access to diagnostic observation and palpatory experience. Wearing inappropriate clothing interferes with a partner's experience of diagnosis and treatment. Appropriat e attire must be clean and includes any clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, palpation, and treatment of the body areas being addressed. Avoid any heavy or thick -seamed clothing; clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination; any inappropriately revealing clothing. Students may need to remove tops to reveal back, rib cage and abdomen. Sports bras and bathing suit tops are appropriate for this. Student Doctors may wear scrubs (or other apparel approved b y the Course Director) over laboratory attire when not in the role of the patient. Remove shoes when you are the patient (no shoes are permitted on the tables). 96 Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in the OMM lab. Religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined or treated (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of OMM training. Anatomy Laboratory Dress Code Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM provides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum i s over. Wear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended . Close -toed shoes and long pants are required. F lip- flops, open toe shoes, shorts or spaghetti -strap tops are not permitted. For ultrasound laboratories, appropriate attire must be clean and includes any clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, and palpation of the body areas being addressed, which requires partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\"). Avoid any heavy or thick -seamed clothing; clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination; any inappropriately revealing clothin g. Students may need to remove tops to reveal back, rib cage and abdomen. Sports bras and bathing suit tops are appropriate for this. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy or ultrasound labs. In ultra sound labs, religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of ultrasound training. Lockers are available in the lock er rooms adjacent to the lab where students may store their gross clothes. Students must provide their own locks. Leave all of your personal belongings in a locker versus stacking them in the 4th floor lobby outside the laboratory. Protective eyewear is su ggested but not required (students provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the chemicals used in the laboratory). 97 Clinical Skills Laboratory Dress Code Students are expected to dress appropriately for Clinical Skills laboratory exercises. Appropriate dress varies based on the activity of the day and is clearly stated in the syllabus appendix. Unless otherwise stated, students will adhere to the standard \"CUSOM dress code\" as outlined in this Academic Bu lletin. White consultation coats are required for all Clinical Skills sessions. The laboratory sessions during Clinical Skills involve physical examination of classmates, models, and standardized patients and students are expected to demonstrate profession alism when examining patients and classmates. The development of a professional approach is crucial. Students are required to fully participate performing in Clinical Skills labs in which require physical examination. Randomly selected student lab partner s allow a broad range of exposure and experience diagnosing and treating patients with different body types, both male and female. No student will be required to examine, or be examined by, a classmate or faculty member for breast, genital, or rectal exam s. However, there will be sessions, such as when practicing examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, or extremities, which will require partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\"). Ladies should wear sports bras or bathing suit tops when exposure of the thorax is needed. No short shorts, tight garments, or attire with inappropriate slogans, are allowed in Clinical Skills Lab sessions. Lab sessions requiring \"scrubs\" are announced in advance. For all encounters with Standardized Patients, formative and evaluated sessions, white coats are required to be worn. Professional dress and a white coat are required for ALL Final OSCE Examination s. Faculty and staff reserve the right to refuse admission to students not compliant with dress code as set forth in this document. NO open toed shoes are permitted at any time during Clinical Skills Sessions. You are permitted to wear neat, clean athletic shoes or clogs when wearing \"scrubs\" or \"OMM dress code\". The course syllabi may provide additional requirements. 5.5 Global Assessment Throughout the C U S O M curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and perfor mance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress on the basis of performance on written and practical examinations, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) in the clinical setting, and performance on national osteopathic board examinations. 98 The Exec utive Director of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, t h e O f f i c e o f C l i n i c a l A f f a i r s , the Office of Academic Affairs (including the Registrar), as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively to determine each individual student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee for disciplinary action or academic review, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication. 5.6 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum, including clinical rotations, based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine: -standards.pdf The Review Committee (IRC, a subcommittee of the CUSOM Curriculum Committee), the CUSOM Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM curriculum as part of the institutional approval process. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award Associate, Baccalaureate, Masters, Education Specialist, and Doctorate degrees. Campbell University was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Board of Trustees of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges reviewed the materials seeking approval of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree program. It was the decision of the Board to approve the program and include it in the scope of the current accreditation and to advance the institution to Level VI.\" Campbell University is one of only three private universities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC, the others being Duke University and Wake Forest University. 99 CUSOM's integrated curricular approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty to explain concepts and prepare students in a logical sequence to become more clinically adept as they progress towards clinical rotations. The third and fourth year c l i n i c a l rotations provide opportunities for in-depth clinical exposure in a variety of core and elective rotations. CUSOM Credit Calculation The CUSOM curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Block of study with a designated number of weeks per Block. For the first two years of the curriculum, there are eight Blocks of study ranging from 9 weeks to 11 weeks duration. For the third and fourth years, clinical rotations represent four-week Blocks of time. Some clinical rotations may be divided into shorter time intervals, such as two weeks, as described in the Clinical Rotation Guide, and as approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours with 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next lower credit value. For example, a course of 10 contact hours would be assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards . Credit Review Process CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, utilizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM Curriculum Committee, as well as the Campbell University Curriculum Council ( UCC), as necessary. To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The process includes, but is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, precedent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consistency with the CUSOM Mission . The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maintained in the Office of Academic Affairs. 100 All proposed curricular changes, including minor and substantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee ( IRC), a subset of the Curriculum Committee, and also the full Curriculum Committee for review, consideration and approval. Minor changes include such matters as the addition/elimination of a course, modifications to an existing course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students, or that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. For proposed non-substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Block Leaders and Course Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Curriculum, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary and finally by the Curriculum Committee. For proposed non-substantive curricular changes in years 3 and 4, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Clinical Department Chairs, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary and finally by the Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the proposed change s are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. Any proposed substantive changes, as defined by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), would follow procedures and deadlines as outlined in the COCA Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Accreditation Standards and Procedures document: The COCA must be notified of all substantive change requests, which the COM wishes to have reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting. The COM must notify the COCA of its substantive change request at least sixty (60) days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting. The COM must submit to the COCA all material that supports their substantive change request at least thirty (30) days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting. Documentation required for the substantive change submission would be submitted as required. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree -granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. As such, any proposed CUSOM substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a timely manner. 101 Grading CUSOM has developed and publicized a system, in keeping with the CUSOM Mission , to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to effective performance as an osteopathic physician. Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in the Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review. Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. This assessment includes: COMLEX -USA Level 1, rates; licensure; geographic of obtainment and completion of postgraduate program; and AOA or ABMS board certification. CUSOM publishes outcomes of student performance in annual reports to the faculty and Board of Trustees. CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades and clinical grades: Grading Scale MS-1 and MS -2 Courses Quality Points MS-3 and MS -4 Rotations Preceptor - Exam Grades Overall Final Grade Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 H-H Honors IC Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 H-HP Honors W Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 HP-HP High Pass C*b 70 2.0 H-P High Pass F < 70 0.0 HP-P High Pass P 70 4.0 P-P Pass P*b 70 2.0 PC*b Pass Clinical FC Fail Clinical a The maximum percentage cannot exceed 100. Percentage grades are rounded to the tenth from 0.50 upwards, therefore 82.50 -82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful remediation of an initial failing grade. 102 Remediation Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in the Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review and possible disciplinary action. Students who fail any part of the curriculum may be offered remediation . A student in the first (MS -1) or second (MS -2) year of studies, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete . The student will receive a gr ade of C* for a graded course or P* for a Pass/Fail course after the successful remediation of the failed course. The * will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation . A student in the third (MS -3) or fo urth (MS -4) year of studies who fails a clinical rotation will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the rotation, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complet e. The student will receive a PC* after the successful completion of the failed rotation, and the PC* will appear on the transcript with the notation that the student passed the rotation after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F C if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECISION MADE BY THE APPS COMMITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BE GRANTED REMEDIATION . Grade Point Average (GPA), Quality Points and Class Rank A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purposes of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not included in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721. In the first two years of the CUSOM curriculum, most courses use a traditional let ter grade system (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA. In the third and fourth years of the CUSOM curriculum, all rotations have a clinical rotation grade provided by the clinical preceptor and all core rotations have clinical modules/exam grades . Both the clinical rotation grade and the module exam portions of the rotation grade use an Honors, High Pass, Pass Clinical, Fail Clinical system. Successful completion of the rotation requires students to pass both the clinical rotation (preceptor evalu ation) and the end -of-rotation exam portions of the course . 103 Students failing a post -rotation exam have a second opportunity to pass the exam within thirty (30) days of notification. If the student fails the second attempt at the post - rotation exam, an F is recorded on the module/exam grade, the entire rotation and post - rotation exam must be repeated. Students who fail a clinical rotation either due to failure of the post -rotation exam or the preceptor evaluation will be reviewed and acted upon by the Academ ic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee . No grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Clinical Affairs certifies to the Registrar, in writing, that an error occurred or that remediation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consideration of a grade change only after the APPS Committee has met . NOTE: \"F\" grades: A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on his/her transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current IC grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at the time the IC is assigned. Once an IC grade has been officiall y changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. The appropriate Associate Dean, however, maintains a listing of previously satisfied F grades in courses and will report suc h grades to the APPS Committee as needed for assessment of the student's overall academic performance and progress. Students who fail to successfully remediate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The highest grade t hat can be given for a remediated course is 70%. The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pass -Fail course . A student may receive any of the following grades for a clinical rotation: Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail. A successfully remediated clinical rot ation will be represented on the transcript as PC*, with the asterisk denoting a remediated clinical rotation . Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM is on a four -point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four points per hour, a \"P\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per hour, a \"C\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and no (0) points awarded for \"F\" or fail ing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three - hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hours = 12 total quality points. 104 Class Rank Students will be provided their class rank at the end of the first and second academic year. Class ranks are calculated at the end of each academic Block through Block 8 after all final grades have been submitted in years one and two. Class ranks are no longer calculated once a student starts clinical rotations beginning in year three. Class ranks are provided for informati onal purposes only, and are only released to the student. The class rank has no direct correlation to the student's cumulative GPA. Final grades in all courses and rotations are calculated into the cumulative GPA throughout all four years. Class ranks are based solely upon the numerical grades earned in each course across Blocks 1 through 8. For example, two students could have a 4.00 GPA but one could be ranked number 1 and the other ranked number 6. The student ranked first achieved higher numerical grade s in some courses (e.g., Student 1 earned a grade of 99% in Anatomy while Student 6 earned a grade of 93% in Anatomy) . Class ranks are not reported on student transcripts, however higher ranks may be identified on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation . Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. The CUSOM Comprehensive Assessment Plan summarizes additional methods and metrics that are tracked for continual program evaluation and improvement. Assessment of knowledge is by multiple -choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled and random intervals. Laboratory, including anatomy, OMM, cli nical skills and OSCE assessments are in written and/or verbal exam format. Assessment of performance on clinical rotations is by end -of- rotation examinations, preceptor evaluations and related methods . Assessment of performance compared to national cohort s occurs through the end -of- rotation COMAT exam and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examinations (COMLEX -USA Levels 1, 2CE and PE and 3) . Grading For Years One and Two Evaluation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM recognizes four categories of evaluation modalities, including, but not limited to : i. Integrated written examinations ii. Laboratory practical examinations iii. Quizzes iv. Other (e.g., SIM performance, Early Clinical Experiences, Projects) Each category is represented within the CUSOM curriculum. A course can be comprised of any combination of the components listed above as determined by the Course Director and approved by the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or Associate Dean for Clinical Integration . 105 Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the four categories identified previously, yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading : Integrated ex ams typically occur three times in each Block in years 1 and 2 . FMP, PCC, OMM and Clinical Skills course questions are not included on the integrated exams except where they are consistent with discipline content in other courses. All other courses may hav e questions on integrated exams. OMM and Clinical Skills may have separate didactic exams, as well as their Practical and Lab exams, as required . Quizzes are typically administered each Friday morning of the MS -1 and MS-2 curriculum. These are integrated a nd include questions from lectures given in the specified preceding 3 -4 instruction days. Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are typically determined based on percentage of total points earned out of total points possible . Grades are defined by the course -grading plan approved prior to start of the course. As such, bonus points are not permitted . In rare instances, there may be exceptions to the established Grading Policy, which require justification for deviation from the o riginal plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the students at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive their course grades . Grading for Years Three and Four The primary basis for the core rotation grade is the \"CUSOM Student Evaluation Form\" and the end -of-rotation exam. The end -of-rotation exam is given at the end of the four week block during select core rotations. The CUSOM Student Evaluation Form is comple ted by the student's attending physician following completion of the rotation and is discussed with the student before submission. For rotations without an end -of-rotation exam, the student's grade is based solely on the preceptor evaluation of the student . 1. Some selective and elective four (4) week rotations may be divided into two different two -week experiences. In such cases, students will receive a grade as determined by the precepto r for each two -week experience. The overall grade for the 4 -week rotati on will be the combination of t he two 2 -week experience grades. Students who fail either two-week rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be called to the APPS Committee for review . 106 2. End-of-rotation examination In addition to the experiences received in the clinical training sites, students are expected to read the assigned text and complete all curricular assignments to prepare for these ex ams. A post -rotation exam (e.g., COMAT, NBME Shelf Exam or equivalent) is administered after the following third - and fourth - year rotations: Internal Medicine II, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Emergency Medic ine. Students must pass the end-of-rotation exam to pass the rotation. Students who do not pass a post-rotation exam are allowed one chance to retake the exam. If the student passes the exam retake, the highest grade possible is a Pass Clinical (PC*) and they are not eligible for High Pass (HP) or Honors (H) for that clinical rotation. If the exam is failed twice, the student will receive a failing grade for the rotation (FC) and be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Commi ttee. If remediation of the rotation exam is permitted and the student passes, a grade of PC* is assigned. If remediation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned . 3. Completion of Learning Modules on Clinical Rotation Various rotations, such as Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, General Surgery, Ob stetrics /Gyn ecology , and Psychiatry utilize evidence - based, medical education online modules to supplement learning in an effort to unify the CUSOM curriculum across all of the Regional Sites. They are mandatory/required as described in the syllabi and are monitored by the respective CUSOM Clinical Chairs . Each CUSOM Clinical Chair selects high -yield educational modules for the student to complete during the Clinical Rotation. Completion of these module s will be required in order to pass the rotation and advance to the next Clinical Rotation. The student must complete all educational modules to a satisfactory level of engagement which is monitored and reported in the Student Progress Reports and Summary Statements . Completion of learning modules are due on the last Friday of the rotation. If the modules are not completed on time, the student's grade will remain Incomplete (IC) until all learning modules are satisfactorily completed in a timeframe to be established by the CUSOM Clinical Chair . If the learning modules are not completed in the defined timeframe, the Incomplete (IC) grade will become a failing grade (FC) and the student will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APP S) Committee . 107 4. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student and Student Evaluation of the Preceptor All evaluations must be completed and submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. Courses of eight (8) weeks dur ation (example: Internal Medicine) require an evaluation to be completed at the end of each 4 -week block. If a student has an approved rotation of two (2) weeks duration, the evaluation is to be completed at the end of the 2 - week period. If a student does not receive a passing grade on the end -of-rotation evaluation from the preceptor, the student will fail the rotation. Competency - based rating forms are used by preceptors to evaluate each student's clinical skills and the application of medical knowledge i n the clinical setting. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students failing a rotation may be required to repeat the failed rotation and be placed on a Modified Cour se of Study, which may delay the student's date of graduation . The CUSOM competency -based evaluation is based on the following core competencies in each area : Osteopathic Philosophy and Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine Medical Knowledge Patient Care Interpersonal and Communication Skills Professionalism Practice -Based Learning and Improvement Systems -Based Practice To receive a grade for each rotation, the student is responsible for ensuring the Student Evaluation Form, Site Evaluation Form, end-of-rotation examination, rotation learning modules, and the clinical experience database (logs) are complete and received by the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Failure to complete any rotation requirement or submit any required rotation documentatio n may result in a grade of Incomplete (IC) and referral to the APPS committee . Items which may also be used to determine grades on clinical rotations : 1. Educational modules - Lectures, cases, reading assignments and other forms of delivery that may be utiliz ed in the third and fourth year curriculum. 2. Students Logs (Procedure Logs) - Students must submit rotation clinical patient logs and procedure logs . 3. Question Bank Review - Students are required to complete the 150 COMBANK questions during each clinical rotation in order to receive credit for the rotation. 108 4. Osteopathic Manual Medicine - Completion of OMM special assignments and participation in lab during Call Back Fridays for core rotations are required. 5. Objective Structured Clinical Performance Examination (OSCE) and Standardized Patient (SP) Exercises - OSCE and SP exercises demonstrate the student's ability to perform clinical skills and to evaluate patient presentations for the most common disorders found in adult and pediatric patients. Multi -station OSCEs will be given at end of first, second, and third years of the CUSOM curriculum. These include taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, evaluating signs and symptoms to formulate a differential diagnosis, performing o r assessing the results of diagnostic exams to evaluate and narrow a differential diagnosis, and demonstrating the ability to manage common medical scenarios. OSCE, Simulation and Clinical Skills may also be incorporated into Call Back Fridays . Preceptor Evaluation of Student Performance A clinical preceptor will evaluate a student's performance during the respective rotation. The Student Evaluation Form will be completed by supervising physicians with input from appropriate hospital staff with direct know ledge of the student's performance. Based on the grading rubric, a grade for the preceptor evaluation will be submitted to the Registrar's Office. Students will have access to the questions on the electronic Student Evaluation Form (grade form), Site Evalu ation Form, and clinical experience database. During the last week of each rotation the student must meet with the preceptor to review their performance and end of rotation evaluation . Completed Student Evaluation Forms are due in the Office of Clinical Af fairs within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation . If the student worked with several physicians, the student should have the principal evaluator submit a composite evaluation based on the input of those physicians the student worked with. Evalua tions of student performance must be completed by the principal evaluator who must be an attending physician. While resident physicians may provide input to aid the attending physician in completing the evaluation, residents are not permitted to serve as t he primary evaluator. Students are not permitted to self-complete the evaluation and submit to the evaluator for a signature . Violation of this policy will be subject to review by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) committee and may r esult in a rotation failure or Incomplete (IC) grade. Any Incomplete (IC) grade will jeopardize student eligibility for financial aid and may also alter/delay their graduation date . It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all clinical evaluation forms are either completed online or submitted to the Clinical Affairs Office within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. It is the student's responsibility to expediently inform the Clinical Affairs Office of any difficulty in obtaining an evalu ation from the precept or at the end of that rotation. 109 The overall responsibility to ensure that evaluations have been completed and returned to the Clinical Affairs Office (or site coordinator if indicated) remains with the student. For this reason, studen ts are responsible for setting up a time to review their final evaluation with their preceptor during the last week of the rotation during which they will discuss their overall performance and obtain their preceptor signature on the evaluation. While the s ummative Student Rotation Evaluation must be completed and submitted at the end of the rotation, students are to request feedback from the preceptor, (e.g., \"How am I doing?\", \"Are there things I should improve?\") by regularly, including the end of the fir st and every week of each clinical rotation, in order to continually address areas that need improvement. This provides students an opportunity to improve any deficient areas while on the rotation, and prevents an unexpected poor evaluation at the end of t he rotation. Students bear total responsibility to seek this ongoing feedback . Students should check with the Office of Clinical Affairs (or site coordinators if directed, regularly to confirm they have received the evaluation. Clinical Affairs staff may a ssist the student in obtaining an evaluation if a preceptor fails to complete the evaluation form or to turn it in to the Office of Clinical Affairs or site coordinator in the required timeframe . Comments from the evaluations will be included on the Medica l Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE, also known as the Dean's Letter) . Delinquent Evaluation Process The process of establishing a Student Rotation Evaluation for a Clinical Faculty preceptor to complete in CUSOM's web-based evaluation system in for a s tudent's rotation performance involves collaboration between the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs Third and Fourth Year Coordinators and the Regional Site Coordinators. During the first week of the rotation, the Regional Site Coordinators will obtain the C linical Faculty preceptor contact information from the students, which includes, but is not limited to, the Clinical Faculty preceptor's name, office address, and email address. During the second week of the rotation, the CUSOM Coordinators will enter the information provided by the Regional Site coordinators into CUSOM's web-based evaluation system . During the third week of the rotation, the Regional Site Coordinators match the student to the appropriate Clinical Faculty preceptor such that an email commu nication is sent to the Clinical Faculty preceptor at the end of that week, indicating he/she has a Student Rotation Evaluation to complete. It is CUSOM's expectation the Clinical Faculty preceptor will complete the Student Rotation Evaluation at the end o f the fourth week of the rotation and review it with the student to provide constructive criticism and feedback . 110 Overdue Clinical Rotation Evaluations Obtaining a Student Rotation Evaluation in a timely fashion is critical to ensure an up-to-date and accurate student academic record and transcript. At the end of the first week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Coordinators run a report in CUSOM's web-based evaluation system to see which Student Rotation Evaluations are incomplete. They report th ese findings to the corresponding student, Regional Site Coordinator, and Regional Dean. The Regional Dean directly contact s the Clinical Faculty preceptor to remind him/her of the pending Rotation Evaluation. At the end of the second week following a Clin ical Rotation, the CUSOM Coordinators run another report in CUSOM's web-based evaluation system to determine the remaining incomplete Student Rotation Evaluations. These are communicated to the corresponding student, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, in collaboration with the Regional Dean, directly contact s the Clinical Faculty preceptor to obtain the pending Rotation Evaluation . If the Clinical Rotation Evaluation is not completed by the third week following a Clinical Rotation, the Regional Dean or a designee complete s the student's evaluation . Any evaluations with a mean score of less than 2.5 indicate poor performance and are automatically reported to the Associate Dean of Clinical Affairs as they represent a failing grade for the rotation . During Rotation Week 2 CUSOM Student Medical Education Coordinators input information provided by Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinators into CUSOM's web -based evaluation system Week 3 Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinators match student to Clinica l Faculty preceptor & email is sent at end of week notifying of rotation evaluation Week 4 (Week 2 if a 2 -week rotation) Student Rotation Evaluation is completed at end of week and reviewed with student Week 1 Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinators obtain updated Clinical Faculty preceptor contact information from students 111 Post-Rotation Rotations, Course Remediation and Academic Probation Failure of a clinical rotation occurs if the student fails either the preceptor evaluation of the student or the end -of-rotation exam after their second attempt. Failure of a clinical rotation for either reason will res ult in a referral to the APPS committee for review. If the student is permitted to remediate, they may be required to repeat the entire rotation, including any associated modules and post -rotation exam, and will also be placed on Academic Probation. Mandat ory repeating of a clinical rotation will result in the institution of a Modified Course of Study, which may result in a delay of graduation. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the repeat rotation. Failure of a second clinical rotation is evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and may result in dismissal from the program . Students who fail a clinical rotation for any reason will come before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committ ee. In addition, repeated performance evaluations in which items performed in a specific category or across categories are rated as \"Unsatisfactory or Below Average\", even if the student achieves a passing rotation grade, will be reason for remediation at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs in consultation with the Clinical Chair, the preceptor, and/or the APPS Committee . Week 1 CUSOM Coordin ators run CUSOM's web -based evaluation system report of incomplete Student Rotation Evaluations and sends to the student, RSC and Regional Dean (RD). RD contacts Clinical Faculty preceptor directly Week 2 CUSOM Coordinators re-run web-based evaluation system and sends to the student, RSC, RD and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (ADCA). ADCA & RD contact Clinical Faculty preceptor directly Week 3 If Student Rotation Evaluation not complete, RD or designee will complete student's evaluation 112 The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will investigate any evaluation rating of \"Below Average\" or less on any competency regardless of an overall passing grade. The findings of this investigation may lead to a follow -up meeting with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Regional Dean, or clinical chair or result in referral to the APPS Committee . Students shoul d show a progression of improvement in performance during the course of clinical rotations. Students who fail to perform satisfactorily on clinical rotations as described above, will be referred to the APPS Committee and may result in additional required c urriculum, repeat of an academic year, or dismissal from the program. Poor ratings on the clinical evaluation in the professional and ethical areas of the assessment of a student are addressed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and may result in a remediation appropriate to correct the deficient area. In the case of concerns in professional or ethical areas, the Associate Dean of Clinical Affairs may refer the student for an APPS Committee hearing. The APPS Committee will act upon this referral depe nding on the severity and the area of the performance measure. Poor ratings in this area must be accompanied by comments as to the exact nature of the rating . 5.7 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standing is defined as a student's grade status at any time within a given academic Block or rotation of the CUSOM curriculum. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses or rotations at any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibilit y for students to participate in CUSOM approved activities, such as conferences, student organizations, etc. Students wishing to serve as officers in clubs/organizations or participate in events, travel to meetings or other related activities must have a m inimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be considered . Academic progress for students in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all Blocks, successfully completing all curricular requirements in the Blocks, passing all components of th e end -of-year testing, and meeting the requirements as set forth by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for students in a Modified Course of Study. Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as det ermined by the faculty and administration . In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, the student must achieve a passing score, as determined by CUSOM, on a CUSOM -identified Qualifying Exam . Each student must pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 in order to be promoted to third year status . 113 Successful academic progress for students in years 3 and 4 of the curriculum includes successful completion of all rotations, end -of-rotation exams, and any other requirements, including but not limited to, clinical modules, procedure and patient logs, Call Back Fridays, and their evaluations of the site and their preceptor. In addition, students who have been placed on Modified Course of Study must be meeting any requirements set forth by the APPS Committee . Each student must pass th e COMLEX -USA Level 2 Cognitive Evaluation (CE) and as well as the COMLEX -USA Level 2 Physical Examination (PE) prior to graduation . In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE, the student must achieve a passing score as determined by CUSOM on a Qualifying E xam. If the student fails to attain the passing score after three attempts at the Qualifying Exam, the student will be required to successfully complete a board preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp ( http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and not to exceed twelve (12) weeks duration, or as approved by the APPS Committee . In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE, the student must successfully pass an Objective Struct ural Clinical Examination (OSCE) administered during Residency Development month, which normally corresponds to the first rotation of the student's fourth year. If the student fails to pass the OSCE, they will undergo a remediation program at the direction of the Chair of Simulation Medicine or other designee. Students are not released to take the COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE exam until approved by the Chair of Simulation Medicine or other designee . Students who experience difficulty successfully completing eleme nts of the CUSOM curriculum or any level of the COMLEX examination series in a timely manner according to the academic calendar may be required to complete a board preparation program or placed into a combination curriculum/remediation program (Modified Co urse of Study) . Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to comply with the plan as determined by the APPS Committee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the Modified Course of Study, they will remain in full -time stat us. Students who do not follow the Modified Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic progress while in a Modified Course of Study, may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or dismissal from CUSOM . Fourth y ear students should refer to the Graduation Requirements section for further information about graduation requirements. Students not making academic progress will be referred to the APPS Committee for review and further recommendations, which may include b ut is not limited to, placement on a Modified Course of Study, Academic Probation or Dismissal from CUSOM . 114 5.8 National Board Exams Students are required to pass the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE, and the COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE prior to graduation as outlined in the table of milestones below . Milestones for Each CUSOM Student Successful Completion of Preclinical Courses Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for Level 1 Successful Completion of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COMAT or Equivalent Subject Examinations for Core Rotations Satisfactory Evaluation by Clinical Faculty for Each Clinical Rotation Successful Completion of a Third -Year OSCE that Assesses the Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) for Entering Residency Successful Completion of Third -Year OSCEs that Assesses student preparedness for the COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE Exam, and the Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) for Entering Residency Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for Level 2 Successful Completion of COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE Successful Completion of COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE Accommodations on COMLEX -USA Exams Students who want to request accommodations for any COMLEX -USA examination must submit their applications directly to the NBOME within the timeframe designated by the NBOME. Please contact the NBOME directly for more information. CUSOM is not responsible for the request or approval for COMLEX testing accommodations . COMLEX -USA Level 1 CUSOM students complete the Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences (CABS) I and II courses in Blocks 5 and 8, respectively, and MUST sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to July 1 in the period between the second and third academic year. Prior to receiving their COMLEX -USA Level 1 scores, all students, including those on appeal for failure to complete any required cou rsework, may be considered \"provisional\" third year students and allowed to participate in clinical rotations. Full third year status is not granted until a student passes COMLEX -USA Level 1 . Students are provided a course of study within Block 8 which ser ves as a capstone to the first two years of the curriculum, and also should assist in final preparation for national licensing exams. This course of study is credit -bearing and is provided by CUSOM . 115 In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, the student must achieve a pre -identified \"passing\" score on a Qualifying Exam. CUSOM identifies the passing parameters by the end of Block 5 each year. CUSOM pay s for the first Qualifying Exam with students potentially responsible for the cost of subsequent exams or progr ams. Students have three attempts to achieve a minimum pre -identified score on the Qualifying Exam . Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to passing the qualifying exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre - identified score are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1 . Students who do not pass the Qualifying Exam after three consecutive attempts are referred to the APPS committee and placed on a Modified Course of Study, during which they will be required to comp lete a Boards preparation program, such as Boards Boot Camp ( http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and not to exceed twelve (12) weeks duration. Upon successful completi on of the designated board preparation course of the Modified Course of Study, the student is required to take COMLEX -USA Level 1 within eight (8) weeks, or as approved by the APPS Committee . Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 must meet with the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. The student will be placed on Academic Probation and subject to sanctions as described below. The student must also meet with the Associate Deans for Biomedi cal and/or Clinical Affairs in -person or by phone, typically within seven (7) days of receiving a failing score, for assistance in analyzing the student's deficiencies and assigning a remediation plan . Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 1 are required to complete a boards preparation pr ogram prescribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and not to exceed eight (8) weeks duration, or as approved by the APPS Committee. This require s the student to enter a Modified Course of Study . A student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 on their first attempt, but has already completed a boards preparation program (e.g., Boards Boot Camp) prior to taking COMLEX -USA Level 1, may be placed on Suspension (ine ligible for financial aid and not an active student ) or be required to complete a different preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as the PASS Program (https://www.pass - program.com/ ), at the student's expense and not to exceed eight (8) weeks duration, or as approved by the APPS Committee. This require s the student to enter a Modified Course of Study. Upon successful completion of the remedial program, the student is required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the second attempt within eight (8) weeks, or as approved by the APPS Committee . 116 Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 a second time must again meet with the APPS Committee. The student may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not an active student ) or be required to complete a boards preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as the PASS Program (https://www.pass -program.com/ ) at the student's expense and not to exceed eight (8) weeks duration, or as ap proved by the APPS Committee. This require s the student to enter a Modified Course of Study. Upon successful completi on of the remedial program, the student is required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the third, and final, time within a timeline designate d by the APPS Committee . A student is permitted only three attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1, after which they will be subject to dismissal from the program . Students who have been removed from clinical rotations for a COMLEX -USA Level 1 failure may be p ermitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam, while waiting for release of their COMLEX -USA Level 1 retake score. Students who are unsuccessful on the second attempt of the COMLEX -USA Level 1 may be placed on Suspension (in eligible for financial aid) or be placed on a Modified Course of Study (e.g., a residential program at student's expense, possibly eligible for financial aid). Students who do not pass COMLEX - USA Level 1 after three attempts may be dismissed from the progr am. A Modified Course of Study is individually planned based upon the student's performance and needs. Students are required to complete the Modified Course of Study designed by the APPS Committee. Students not following the individualized plan for remedia tion may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not an active student ) at any time. If a student decides upon an immersion course and is removed from fourth -year clinical rotations, a Modified Course of Study may be designed by the Assoc iate Dean for Clinical Affairs with approval by the APPS Committee. T he Dean serves as the point of appeal . COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE Third year students must take and pass an end -of-rotation exam after each core rotation. In additio n to demonstrating the student has learned the appropriate material on the rotation, the exams function to prepare students for COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE. In addition, at the end of the third year students must take and pass Standardized Patient (SP) and Objec tive Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) exams. These exams are administered to assure the student has competently achieved the clinical skills expected in the third year and to prepare the student for COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE testing . Students must schedule their COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE no later than March 15 of the MS -3 year and sit for the exam no later than September 1 of the MS -4 year unless otherwise approved . In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, the student must achieve a passing score as determined by CUSOM on a Qualifying Exam, such as a CUSOM -proctored College of Osteopathic Medicine Self -Assessment Exam (COMSAE) or a similar exam. 117 CUSOM identifies the passing parameters for this exam and pay s for the first Qualifying Exam, with students responsible for the cost of subsequent exams. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE prior to passing this Qualifying Exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre - identified score on three consecutive attempts are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE . If the student fails to attain the passing score on the designated qualifying exam after three attempts, the student is required to successfully complete a boards preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and not to exceed twelve (12) weeks duration, or as approved by the APPS Committee. In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE, the student must successfully pass the Objective Structural Clinical Examinations (OSCE) that are administered during Residency Development month, which generally corresponds to the first rotation of the fourth year. If the student fails to pass the OSCE, they will undergo a remediation program at the direction of the Simulation Medicine Department, Chair of Simulation Medicine or other designee. Students are not released to take the COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE exam until approved by the Chair of Simulation Medicine or other designee . Students who fail either the SP or OSCE exam are required to successfully complete the designated remediation program a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to taking COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE. Students who do not successfully remediate will have their COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE release withdrawn . Students are required to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE by November 30 in their fourth year. As it takes a minimum of ninety (90) days to receive scores for COMLEX - USA Level 2 PE, it may be to the student's advantage to take this exam earlier in order to provide them with ample time to retake the exam prior to graduation in the case that they fail the exam . Passing both COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE is required to graduate. In addition, most residency programs require students to pass COMLEX - USA Level 2 CE to match with their program. Some residencies also require proof of passing COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE prior to interviewing their program . Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE is required to graduate. Students who do not pass both CE and PE by graduation within the maximum number of attempts will be placed on Suspension. Students on Suspension do not qualify for fi nancial aid and are not active students . Students are not removed from Suspension until they demonstrate a passing score on the deficient exam(s). Students on Suspension for a period exceeding six (6) months will be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and are subject to dismissal from the program. 118 Any student who fails their initial attempt on COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE will be immediately placed on Academic Probation and, as determined by the APPS Committee, may be withdrawn from clinical rotations until they successfully pass the exam. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE must meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the APPS Committee within seven (7) days of receiving a failing score. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will assist the student in analyzing their deficiencies and assigning a remediation plan. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE wi ll be required to complete a remedial program prescribed by CUSOM , such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and not to exceed twelve (12) weeks duration. Upon successfu l completi on of the remedial program, the student will be required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE within eight (8) weeks , or as approved by the APPS Committee . Students who have been removed from clinical rotations due to a COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE failure are placed in a Modified Course of Study and may be permitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam while waiting for release of their NBOME score. Students who are unsuccessful on the second attempt of the COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE will be referred to the APPS Committee and may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid). Students on Suspension for a period exceeding six (6) months will be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee an d may be dismissed from the program . A student is permitted only three attempts to pass COMLEX - USA Level 2 CE, after which they will be subject to dismissal from the program . A Modif ied Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing , individual ized study plan for students w ho require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as board preparation, required remediation, illness, le aves of absence, or withdrawals. The Modified Course of Study will be individually designed based upon the student's perform ance and needs by the respective Associate Dean and approved by the APPS Committee.

Penalties or sanctions for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be administered regardless of whether the actions of the student are also civil or criminal violations. Whenever disciplinary actions lead to the student leaving CU SOM, grades are assigned in accordance with the CUSOM grading policy . In addition to sanctions described above, the following actions may also be taken by the Dean in an appeal : Withdrawal: Withdrawal is the administrative removal of a student from a class or from CUSOM and may be imposed in instances of unmet financial obligations to CUSOM. The withdrawn student may also be barred from re- enrollment until specific conditions have been met. Dismissal from the program without the option to return.

Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean . Special Meetings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, or has been on Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional action is required . 127 5.11 Withdrawal/Leave Procedures All requests for withdrawal must be made in writing to the office of the Director of Student Affairs and adhere to the following steps : A voluntary withdrawal is requested in writing thro ugh the Office of the Director of Student Affairs. The student must complete a Withdraw/Separation Form and return the form and any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of the Registrar before the student will be considered Withdrawn in Good Standin g. The date for a voluntary withdrawal is the date of the student's written request . Upon receipt of the completed Change of Status Form and CUSOM issued items, the student is voluntarily Withdrawn in Good Standing from CUSOM and entitled to certain benefi ts, i.e., application for readmission or an official transcript if requested . A pre -approved leave of absence less than six (6) months in duration require s completion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items de pending upon the specific circumstances of the leave of absence . Additionally, students on Suspension may not Withdraw. Students failing a course, though, may possibly be permitted to Withdraw prior to the start of the last exam or assessment event of the course they may be failing. A student may not Withdraw if a grade has been assigned or if a final exam ination has been started. The Dean makes the final decision regarding withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM, for any reason, are required to complete a Withdrawal/Separation Form. Medical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standing, who provide acceptable supporting documentation i ndicating a valid medical reason requiring a leave of less than 180 calendar days. Decision s regarding the granting of a medical leave are determined by the Dean. A medical leave of absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days, after which it will bec ome a medical withdrawal . A Medical Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calendar days will require the student to file a Medical Withdrawal . In order to return from medical leave, the student must supply documentation from a physician approving/releas ing the student to return as a full time student in the curriculum. The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, withdrawal, or has been on suspension to determine where th e student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action is required . 128 Medical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standing and who have an appr oved medical reason for medical leave of absence that exceeds 180 calendar days. Students may apply for re -admission through the CUSOM Admissions process if granted a Medical Withdrawal, but are not guaranteed a seat in a future class. A subset of the Admi ssions Committee, consisting of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance . The committee will also determine the placement in the curriculum for all students who have withdrawn for medical purposes and are in good academic standing. All current or former students returning from an appro ved period away from CUSOM, such as a lea ve of absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipa ted return date. Additional requirements, such as a psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will ne ed to re -apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. Military Withdrawal Military Withdrawal is granted to students whose military orders may require a period of absence from the academic program when they are called to extended active d uty. Readmission is guaranteed pending proof of compliance with the Technical Standards , background check, substance abuse screening, and the CUSOM Honor Code . If the student returns within two years, they will be placed in the curriculum as close to their current position as possible in order to provide them the appropriate continuum in the curriculum and the training required to be successful, competent, and able to perform well on their board exams. For students with a military leave of two or more years , the request to return will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis. In any case, the student will not be charged any additional tuition from their original obligation. The Dean, Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will meet with the individual student to determine the appropriate curriculum to be completed in the remainder of the degree program that will bring the student to a competency level eq ual to his or her peers. 129 Personal Withdrawal Personal Withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM for personal reasons are not guaranteed re -admission. To be deemed Wit hdrawn in Good Standing, the student must have passed all classes and be in good academic standing, complete all paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures during the withdrawal process . Administrative Leave of Absence An Administrative Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. An administrative leave may not last longer than 180 calendar days as deemed appropriate and necessary. An Administrative Leave of Absence is rare and is present to address such situations as a death of a spouse, child, or such other s evere circumstance that would interrupt a student's education. The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, withdrawal, or has been on suspension to determine where the stud ent will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action is required . Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution and during this period students are not considered \"active\" and may not be eligible for financial aid. The duration of the Suspension will be determined by the Dean and may include recommendations from the APPS Committee. Students may be assigned independent studies during Suspension to remain current; however, these independent studies do not replace course attendance or rotation requirements. While on Suspension, students are not eligible for financial aid and should not represent themselves as CUSOM students. They must not participate in any clinical activities or not wear their CUSOM white coat. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled and the period of Suspension is greater than 180 calendar days, the student may be dismissed from CUSOM . Students on Suspension may not Withdraw. Dismissal Dismissal from CUSOM is based up on recommendations made by the APPS Committee, with final approval for dismissal by the Dean . Unofficial Withdrawal Any student who ceases to maintain adequate academic attendance in CUSOM or leaves without withdrawing officially will be considered for an Unofficial Withdrawal and receive a grade of \"W\" for each course . 130 General Withdrawal Failure to complete a Change of Status Form and to obtain the required signatures will result in a hold placed on all academic records . o Tuition refunds will be based upo n the schedule shown under the section on Refund Policy o For any withdrawal, voluntary or involuntary, CUSOM recognizes and follows the date of determination as defined by the U.S. Department of Education in its Code of Federal Regulations . For any withdra wal, voluntary or involuntary, the student must return the following to Student Affairs at the time of departure : o CUSOM Identification card o Campbell University parking decal o All CUSOM -supplied computers and peripherals including, but not necessarily limited to, laptops, iPads, ARS/clickers, and chargers o White Coat, if applicable o Any other CUSOM -supplied items Withdrawal must be completed no later than two (2) business days prior to the end of a course or clinical rotation. Failure to withdraw by this date will result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Block, or for that rotation, which will adversely affect the student's GPA . Withdrawal from a course or rotation after an exam has been administered and/or a rotation completed, will resu lt in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F . In instances when the Dean extends an offer of readmission, that offer may be rescinded if the student fails to provide requested documentation and written acceptance of terms in a timely manner as defined in the offer . NOTE : Although different categories of Withdrawal are identified, the student transcript will reflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal . 5.12 Graduation Requirements The degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine is granted to , and conferred upon , candidates who : Have satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation ; Have passed the COMLEX -USA Level 1 , COMLEX COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE ; Have demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character ; Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during the academic program . 131 To become eligible for graduation, each fourth -year student must have successfully completed all the above requirements within six (6) years of matriculation. The six (6) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, behavioral or other leaves of absence . Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students must demonstrate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for success and continued study and pr actice of osteopathic medicine; the suitability for the practice of medicine by dutiful and responsible acceptance for patient care; and integrity in the conduct of clinical duties. Students may be dismissed from CUSOM if any of these competencies are not met. In addition, the revocation of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree may occur following graduation for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean . A student must have completed all curricular requirements at CUSOM, or a minimum of two (2) years at CUSOM and another institution accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), between the date of matriculation and graduation. In addition to this requirement, the student must have been enrolled full -time at CUSOM during their third and fourth academic years . A CUSOM student must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, a s determined by the individual course directors, clinical rotations supervisors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to graduate. The Dean makes the determination on any student appeals of APPS Committee recommend ations, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee at the time of the initial hearing and deliberation. The Dean makes the determination on any appeal of the Dean's recommendation, based solely upon new and meaning ful information not available to the Dean at the time of his or her decision . Students must meet with the Assistant Director of Financial Aid and Registrar to complete all required exit forms in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM students must attend the ex it process and commencement program in order to receive a diploma . Upon passage of COMLEX -USA Level 1 and Level 2 CE and Level 2 PE requirements, and all other requirements as delineated in the Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation . 132 5.13 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is Suspended, takes a Leave of Absence, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, they will be placed on a Modified Course of Stud y (MCOS) which delay s the scheduling of clinical rotations and the student's graduation date. Voluntary course withdrawals, temporary leaves of absence or suspensions secondary to academic, administrative suspensions or as a result of failure to pass Board exams consistent with CUSOM policy may also cause a delay in scheduling clinical rotations and a delay in graduation . Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education -based fina ncial aid. In addition, placement in a Modified Course of Study may impact the student's ability to participate in the residency match process. Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the CUSOM Office of Academic Affairs and the University's O ffice of Financial Aid for these or other indicated situations . 5.14 Clinical Policies and Procedures Students should refer to the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual for a comprehensive review of all student policies relating to all clinical rotations . CUSOM Medical Student Shadowing Many students choose to engage in clinical shadowing experiences during breaks in the formal CUSOM curriculum such as during Block breaks, summer break or weekends. Shadowing experiences can be extremely valuable and students may choose to include these experiences in their Curriculum Vitae, personal statement or Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Shadowing experiences can occur with CUSOM - appointed clinical faculty members or physicians not affiliated with CUSOM . It is essential that students choosing to engage in shadowing experiences understand the differences between shadowing and the required clinical rotations students participate in as part of the CUSOM curriculum. Clinical rotations that occur in conjunction wit h the CUSOM clinical curriculum (Early Clinical Experiences, Outreach, International Medical Missions and MS -3 and MS -4 scheduled rotations) completed under the supervision of CUSOM -appointed clinical faculty and follow very specific guidelines in regards to student's roles, responsibilities, supervision requirements, and feedback and evaluation processes . In contrast to clinical curriculum experiences, shadowing experiences do not occur as part of the student's required CUSOM curriculum, and may lack the d efined structure, supervision, feedback mechanisms and medical -legal protections provided by formal clinical rotations . Students choosing to engage in a shadowing experience acknowledge they will do so while adhering to the following principles . 133 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands - on activity occurs with patients, this should be limited to patient examination only, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be repeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to perform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences , including but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, b r e a s t , rectal and genitourinary systems. Students should not perform any Osteopathic manipulation while on shadowing experiences. 2. Students are not protected by malpractice insurance provided by Campbell University, Incorporated while engaged in physician shadowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM -appointed faculty member . Students are required to let non-CUSOM appointed physicians they are shadowing know that they are not covered by malpractice insurance provided by Campbell University, Incorporated. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, or ambulatory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or health care system policies so it is the student's responsibility to make sure they review and comply with any applicable policies. 4. Individual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is therefore the student's ethical and professional duty to fully explain their level of training. Shadowing with CUSOM Clinical Faculty Members 1. Shadowing experiences with CUSOM clinical faculty members may be counted as Early Clinical Experiences (ECE). 2. Students shadowing with CUSOM clinical faculty members should wear their CUSOM name badge and white coat unless directed otherwise by their preceptor. 3. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty member must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form , completed in its entirety, to the Department of Clinical Affairs. 4. In general, shadowing experiences should be arranged in conjunction with the preceptor and Regional Dean (when applicable), both of whom must sign the agreement form to indicate their approval. 5. In addition, the student must sign the form and initial all required attestations. 6. The completed form must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing experience. 134 Shadowing with non -CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow with non-CUSOM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. Shadowing experiences with non -CUSOM clinical faculty members will not be counted as Early Clinical Experiences (ECE). 3. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obtain affiliation agreements with the sites in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will not provide the clinician or site with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and background checks, immunization records, academic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students may not wear their CUSOM white coat or name tag. d. Students or the physician they are shadowing are not protected by malpractice insurance . e. Students acknowledge that Campbell University, Incorporated will not be liable for any medical coverage if they are to be injured or become ill during the clinical shadowing experience. They also release Campbell Uni versity, Incorporated from any liability from any injury or illness that occurs on the shadowing experience . 4. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non -CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previously in this document . Violation of any conditions of these Shadowing Guidelines is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee . 135 5.15 Academic Freedom Policy The teacher is entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution in advance of the acceptance of employment . The teacher is entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduce into his teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limit ations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment . The university teacher is a citizen, a member of a learned profession, and an officer of an educational ins titution. His/her primary loyalty is to his/her institution, his/her profession, and his/her growth and development as a scholar, a person, and a teacher. He/She possesses the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from his/her position as an employee of the University; to be accurate, to exercise proper restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make every effort to indicate that in his/her role as a citizen he/she is not an institutional spokesma n. Moreover, he/she should allow for the fact that many members of the general public will find it difficult to disassociate his/her utterances as a citizen from his/her institutional identification. He/She should not use official university stationery, lo gos, watermarks or his/her institutional title in issuing public statements which he/she makes purely in his/her role as a citizen . 136 6. OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE CURRICULUM Academic Calendar Academic calendars are made available to all students. Actual weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs but are generally structured so that lectures primarily take place in the morning, with labs and clinical skills typically taking place in the afternoons . Morning lecture -discussions are complemented by afternoon labs and skills sessions, with embedded study time. OMM and other clinical skills are taught longitudinally throughout the first two years in a progression designed to integrate with, and provide a seamless transition to the third and fourth y ears. Content is presented by physicians and biomedical faculty using concepts of team -teaching and small group learning. For years three and four, clinical rotations are typically four (4) week duration at the Regional Clinical sites . Evaluation of perfo rmance during the first 8 blocks includes integrated exams, quizzes, OSCE, clinical skills, anatomy, and OMM exams, and end -of-block and end -of-year evaluations. Weekly clinical case exercises, help students integrate and apply material presented during th e week, and provide faculty with an assessment of student progress. For years three and four, student evaluation is performed by clinical preceptors at the end of each clinical rotation, and similarly students evaluate each clinical rotation to promote curricular improvement . 6.1 Years 1 and 2 Curriculum The first two years of the CUSOM curriculum focus on teaching students fundamental principles of biomedical science with significant emphasis on clinical science, elements of clinical practice, and professi onalism. Historically, the first two years of medical school instruction have been viewed as \"pre -clinical\" with the remaining two years being viewed as \"clinical\". At CUSOM, the curriculum is integrated to provide a core of strong biomedical principles in addition to a robust foundation in clinical sciences and osteopathic principles, principles of clinical practice, and professionalism . Curricular Content Overview All semesters of the first and second year are partitioned into two 9 -week Blocks, with the exception of ten (10) weeks for Block 4 and eleven (11) weeks for Block 8. Within the first two Blocks, the students are introduced to the biomedical foundational concepts of Anatomy, Biochemistry/Cell Biology, Microbiology/Immunology, Pathology, Pharmacol ogy, and Physiology. Anatomy continues throughout the first year, integrating wherever possible with the systems approach of the remaining three semesters of the first two years . In Blocks 3 through 8, the CUSOM curriculum uses an organ -system approach to medical education. Faculty utilize instructional materials that go beyond the basic biomedical principles mastered during the first semester. Biomedical faculty, primary care physicians, and sub -specialty physicians collaborate to deliver integrated conten t relating to the particular organ system . 137 The Clinical Skills and Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine courses address content that will allow CUSOM students to learn and thrive in the basic philosophy, principles, and practice of osteopathic medicine. Hands -on diagnosis and treatment is the foundation of osteopathic whole -person health care. Lectures and labs incorporate state-of-the-art instruction. Additionally, simulation and Standardized Patient experiences, allow students to enhance their clinical skill s such as physical exam techniques, interviewing, counseling, and medical reporting skills necessary to progress to the third and fourth years . The Foundations in Medical Practice (FMP) courses provide CUSOM students a broad overview of evidenced -based med icine, epidemiology, research methodology, and experimental design. The students are exposed to the calculations and strategies required to appropriately locate, interpret, design and complete a research/scholarly paper with clinically relevant knowledge r elated to competent medical practice. The FMP paper is a means for students to participate in student -driven or faculty -driven research and scholarly activity . The Professional Core Competencies (PCC) courses are presented through all semesters of the firs t and second year curriculum, and are designed to teach the core competencies necessary for caring, compassionate, effective and holistic practice throughout the physician's career. The use of lecture, discussion, and other unique activities, introduces students to medical humanities, biomedical ethics, medical law and jurisprudence, quality improvement and patient safety, global health issues, and professionalism . 6.2 Years 3 and 4 Rotation Structure Minimum requirements for clinical rotations are typically 160 hours for each four -week rotation. The Office of Clinical Affairs schedule s the rotations according to the availability of rotation sites and numbers of requests. There is opportunity to participate in approved two-week elective and selective rotations. CUSOM selective rotations are chosen from the CUSOM selective lists and are based on educational standards and requirements, the student's self -assessment of areas where they would benefit most from further education and patient exposure, along with input from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the discipline Chairs. The Primary Care, Medical, and Surgical Selective rotations are completed at CUSOM core sites where CUSOM has established rotations, affiliation agreements, and faculty . Limited exceptions may be granted by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Specific information regarding scheduling of third and fourth year selective rotations can be found in the C U S O M Clinical Rotation Manual. Electives may be scheduled outside CUSOM regional hospital sites; however, each elective site and rotation request must be submitted to the Department of Clinical Affairs at least ninety (90) days in advance of start date and must be approved through the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs . 138 Third Year Clinical Rotations CUSOM's third year osteopathic medical students are required to complete twelve rotations. Each rotation consist s of approximately 160 contact hours. The required rotations for third year are listed below; all core rotations must be taken and completed at CUSOM core rotation sites with CUSOM appointed faculty. Core rotations are clinical rotations involving patient care which are required to be completed at a CUSOM clinical site with CUSOM faculty . The third year core rotatio ns are Family Medicine, Internal Medicine I and II, Medical Selective, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Medical/Surgical Selective. All third year rotations must be successfully completed prior to progressing to the fourth year and must be completed at the student's Regional Site.

CUSOM does not assume any travel expenses, or liability for health or safety while on international rotations. Course Overview and Philosophy of Clinical Training: The philosophical framework of clinical education and training at CUSOM is to prepare students to become osteopathic physicians possessing the highest competencies in the profession. The program will educate students to be competent osteopathic physicians who clearly recognize their roles as professionals and providers of comprehensive healthcare to the individual and the family as a unit, and to the communities they serve . Osteopathic physicians must be able to function in the role of leader of a healthcare team to bring about needed change from the level of the individual to the level of the community. The ultimate intent of the program is to prepare patient -centered physicians who will positivel y impact the equality of healthcare and healthcare delivery systems, and will improve healthcare access for individuals and their families . 143 CUSOM believes the physician must assume a leadership role not only in the medical community, but also in the broa der community in which he/she serves. Community leadership is an integral part of improving the healthcare of the community as a whole; thus, physicians must be motivated toward the prevention of illness and the upgrading of the delivery of healthcare serv ices at extended levels . In pursuit of excellence, the CUSOM clinical curriculum is a challenging blend of the traditional and innovative, designed to : Foster the analytic and problem -solving skill requisites for physicians involved in disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients, families, communities, and populations at large ; Ensure the acquisition and application of basic clinical knowledge and essential clinical skills ; Develop an understanding of contemporary healthcare delivery issues ; Cultivate effective physician -patient relationships based upon integrity, respect, and compassion ; Develop high ethical standards ; and Promote a lifelong commitment to learning . Following clinical training, students will be knowledgeable about the important roles of the primary care physician including, but not limited to, the ability to : Demonstrate clinical excellence, using current evidence - based medicine, and biomedical knowledge in identifying and managing the medical problems presented by hi s/her patients . Provide continuing and comprehensive care to individuals and families . Integrate the behavioral/emotional/social/environmental factors of individuals and families in promoting health and managing disease . Develop and maintain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for the best care and outcomes in modern medical practice in a rapidly -changing world . Pursue a regular and systematic program of lifelong learning . Recognize indications for and initiate consultation with other medical specialists while maintaining continuity of care . Share tasks and responsibilities with other healthcare professionals . Be aware of the findings of relevant research; understand and critically evaluate this body of research; and apply the results of research t o medical practice . Manage his/her practice in a business -like, cost -efficient manner that will provide professional satisfaction and time for a rewarding personal life . Serve as an advocate for the patient within the healthcare system . Assess the quality of care that he/she provides and actively pursue measures to continually improve . Use current medical knowledge to identify, evaluate, and minimize risks for patient and family . Recognize community resources as an integral part of the healthcare system; participate in improving the health of the community . 144 Inform and counsel patients concerning their health problems, and recognizing and valuing differences in patient and physician backgrounds, beliefs, and expectations . Develop physician -patient relationshi ps conducive to promoting comprehensive problem -identification and problem -solving . Balance potential benefits, costs, and resources in determining appropriate interventions . Integrate and effectively utilize osteopathic principles and practices in the delivery of optimal patient care . The general expectations for all clinical rotations are designed to help students develop the fundamental skills of medical problem solving, case management, procedural expertise, and professional demeanor. Some focus on d ata acquisition (medical history, physical examination, laboratory data, or literature review), while others emphasize psychomotor skills or attitudes and feelings . Rotations are under the direct supervision of the CUSOM Office for Clinical Affairs, led by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM has established affiliations with a wide range of hospitals, clinics, and physicians offering diverse training opportunities. The clinical program has been organized to permit the greatest degree of education al exposure in a practical, clinical environment and to develop expertise in the areas of patient diagnosis and management . The rotations provided at each affiliated site, and the number of CUSOM students assigned to each affiliated site, are determined by mutual agreement with CUSOM, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Hospital Administrator(s), Regional Dean, Vice -president for Medical Education (VPME) / Director of Medical Education (DME), Clinical Faculty and the Office for Clinical Affairs. Wh enever possible, CUSOM utilizes hospitals with accredited postdoctoral programs approved by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for postdoctoral training to provide assurance of adequate teaching material and faculty . Clinical Modules Clinical Modules including videos, lectures and other educational materials are utilized to supplement clinical rotations. These modules are appropriate for both third and fourth year students and offe r the learner flexibility. These supplement topics covered on clinical rotations and function as study guides for both the end -of-rotation exams, and COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE. Clinical Modules are an important supplement to a student 's education, but do not replace the extensive reading, studying, patient contact, etc. students must achieve on clinical rotations . Students are provided with required curricula during the third year and fourth year. Learning objectives and corresponding reading assignments are provided for the core discipline rotations . 145 Graduate Medical Education CUSOM strives to develop a sufficient number of residency positions for our graduates. The Associate Dean for Postgraduate Affairs is responsible for facilitatin g residency program development and ensuring the placement of CUSOM graduates into graduate medical education programs. Regional Deans, who supervise third and fourth year student rotations at their site, also assist in the development of residency trainin g programs. CUSOM's goal is to develop the same or greater number of GME positions as our number of graduates. These programs provide CUSOM graduating students postgraduate training opportunities, and help meet the need for future physicians to care for th e rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States and the nation . 6.4 Schedule of Course Offerings Fall Semester, Year 1 Block 1 Course Number Course Title OMED 500 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 501 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 502 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 503 Professional Core Competencies OMED 511 Cell Biology and Biochemistry OMED 524 Microbiology and Immunology OMED 530 Anatomy and Lab Block 2 Course Number Course Title OMED 504 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 505 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 506 Foundations of Medical Practice OMED 507 Professional Core Competencies OMED 522 Pharmacology OMED 540 Physiology OMED 551 Pathology OMED 560 Anatomy and Lab 146 Spring Semester, Year 1 Block 3 Course Number Course Title OMED 508 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 509 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 513 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 514 Professional Core Competencies OMED 570 Musculoskeletal System OMED 590 Anatomy and Lab Block 4 Course Number Course Title OMED 515 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 516 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 517 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 518 Professional Core Competencies OMED 579 Neuroscience OMED 583 Psychiatry OMED 594 Anatomy and Lab Fall Semester, Year 2 Block 5 Course Number Course Title OMED 600 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 601 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 602 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 603 Professional Core Competencies OMED 610 Cardiovascular System OMED 611 Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences I OMED 620 Respiratory System Block 6 Course Number Course Title OMED 604 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 605 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 606 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 607 Professional Core Competencies OMED 631 Hematology OMED 640 Renal System OMED 651 Dermatology 147 Spring Semester, Year 2 Block 7 Course Number Course Title OMED 608 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 609 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 613 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 614 Professional Core Competencies OMED 670 Endocrine System OMED 680 Gastrointestinal System Block 8 Course Number Course Title OMED 615 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 616 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 618 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 619 Professional Core Competencies OMED 690 Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II OMED 695 Reproductive System Fall and Spring Semester, Year 3 Course Number Course (Rotation) Title OMED 710 Internal Medicine I OMED 712 Internal Medicine II OMED 714 Medical Selective OMED 720 Surgery OMED 730 Family Medicine OMED 740 Pediatrics OMED 750 Obstetrics and Gynecology OMED 760 Psychiatry OMED Medicine OMED 780 Rural/Underserved /International OMED 790 Medical/Surgical Selective 148 Fall and Spring Semester, Year 4 Course Number Course (Rotation) Title OMED 810 Medical Selective OMED 820 Surgery Selective OMED 830 Primary Care Selective OMED 840 Geriatrics OMED 850 Emergency Medicine OMED 860 Elective I OMED 862 Elective II OMED 864 Elective III OMED 866 Elective IV OMED 868 Elective V OMED 870 Residency Development OMED 880 International/Underserved Rotation OMED 890 Elective Sub Internship OMED 892 Primary Care - Sub Internship OMED 894 Medical Selective - Sub Internship OMED 896 Surgical Selective - Sub Internship COURSE DESCRIPTIONS SPECIFIC COURSE OVERVIEWS, YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1, BLOCKS 1 AND 2 The curriculum in Blocks 1 and 2 of the first year introduces students to the biomedical concepts of Cell and Molecular Biology, Genetics, Biochemistry, Gross Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, Immunology, Microbiology, Pathology, Pharmacology and Physiology.

In addition, students will learn and practice various osteopathic manipulative treatments such as including soft tissue techniques, muscle energy, counterstrain, high -velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) and myofascial release techniques to manage certain disease states. Year Two Each student will receive a minimum of \u00bd day per week of lecture and hands -on OMM instruction that is under the supervision of a n American Osteopathic Board of Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine Board Certified physician and with the assistance of DO faculty table facilitators (approximate faculty to student ratio 1:10). Throughout the second year, the students will gain a deeper unders tanding of body system dysfunction and homeostasis and the role of osteopathic manipulative medicine in managing disease entities throughout the various body systems and/or specialties. Students will become more adept at utilizing these skills in managing all stages of patient care through infancy, adolescence, geriatrics, and pregnancy. The OMM lab will also review students on common techniques used to manage conditions such as short lower extremity, tension and migraine cephalgia, and cervical/thoracic/lu mbar dysfunctions. Years Three and Four CUSOM has taken a structural, rather than a functional, approach to osteopathic (OMM) integration in the clinical years. The assessment of the cognitive learning and practical application of osteopathic manipulation will consist of evaluation and assessment of students' psychomotor learning through practical hands -on and oral evaluations under the supervision of clinical faculty. This will assist students in their preparation for both the COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE and COM LEX -USA Level 2 -PE exams . 176 Participation in for \"hands on\" OMM experience is included during the third and fourth year clinical rotations, Call Back Fridays and Residency Development month. Osteopathic education plays a key role in the entire curriculum and students will gain an understanding of the osteopathic profession regarding all aspects of health care . OMM COMAT Requirement: Osteopathic manipulative medicine reading assignments are included in each of the relevant core rotations throughout the course of the 3rd year of training. Students are required to complete these reading assignments concurrently with all other assigned modules for each rotation. The information contained in the OMM reading assignments are assessed using the OMM COMAT scheduled during Residency Development Month. Students are required to take and pass the OMM COMAT within two (2) standard deviations of the mean. Osteopathic medical knowledge consists of: Concepts basic to osteopathic health care including: the self -healing tendency/processes, the unity of the organism in its environment, and the indications and application of osteopathic diagnostic and therapeutic manipulative processes, and when and how to apply them. The philosophy and principles of osteopathic medicine. The history, growth, and development of the profession. The effects of growth, development, and aging on the musculoskeletal system (normal and variations of normal) . Topical anatomy and neuroanatomy correlated with structural anatomy . Anatomical structures and their inter -relationships within the musculoskeletal system . Most frequently encountered structural anomalies and functional abnormalities in the musculoskeletal system at each age lev el. Somatic changes which occur as a result of distant disease proc esses and the relationship of these changes in delaying the resolution of the disease process. Musculoskeletal evaluation assessment techniques suitable for each age group/situation . Primary somatic changes resulting from anatomical syndromes and their relationship to other syndromes .

Using a variety of techniques in osteopathic manipulative medicine applied/ adjusted to the unique needs of the individual patient (e.g., in terms of age, development, disorder, body habitus). A recognition of the relationship of disease/disorder of the musculoskeletal system to total well -being . Writing of appropriate orders and progress notes relevant to the use of Osteopathic Manipulative T reatment . During clinical rotations, students and preceptors comprise the primary audience for OMM integration. Students have had substantial experience in developing an osteopathic approach to common medical problems in their first and second year. The pu rpose of clinical integration is to provide a major incentive to keep active with hands -on treatments throughout rotations . During clinical rotations, students are required to return to CUSOM on the last Friday (Call Back Friday) of the following core clin ical rotations: Family Medicine, Internal Medicine II, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery and Emergency Medicine. During these sessions, students take end -of-rotation exams, clinical skills and OSCE experiences are given, and a variety of professi onal seminars conducted. Students returning from their pediatric and psychiatry rotations are also required to participate in Osteopathic Principles and Practice OSCE sessions (with debriefing sessions in the OMM Lab). Full attendance and participation fo r the entire day is MANDATORY. These sessions run from 8am - 5pm; therefore students should NOT make any travel plans prior to 5pm . On each Call Back Friday, students take a COMAT (or comparable) exam (for designated rotations) from 8am -noon then, in the afternoon, students participate in OSCEs (including OMM specific OSCEs) and Simulation lab activities relevant to the student's upcom ing rotation or other educational session as described above . Fourth Year Call Back Requirements: Attendance and active participation in a minimum of two (2) on -campus Call Back Friday Simulation/OSCE workshops during residency development month and emerge ncy medicine required rotations. Students are encouraged to attend additional Call Back OMM workshops . During Residency Development Month, students are required to perform an OMM specific OSCE in a simulated outpatient setting. Students returning to camp us to take their core emergency medicine end of rotations exam are required to attend an OMM workshop structured to help them develop strategies for integrating OMM into their post -graduate education. 178 6.5 Juris Doctor and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine ( JD/DO) Dual Degree Program Campbell University offers a six -year combined program of study (JD/DO Dual Degree Program) leading to awarding of both the Juris Doctor (JD) degree and the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree upon successful completion of all requirements. One goal is to complete the program in six years, thereby reducing the amount of time it would otherwise take to earn these two degrees by one calendar year. This program is designed for those students who wish to pursue both the Juris D octor and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degrees by reducing the amount of time it would otherwise take to earn these two degrees. Campbell JD/DO graduates will most likely practice in just one of the professions; however, their studies will provide them with exceptional insights into today's complex medico -legal issues. This program is a rigorous and demanding program; enrollment will be limited to those students meeting the criteria for both Campbell University School of Law and Campbell University Scho ol of Osteopathic Medicine Admissions Standards. Students admitted to the JD/DO program complete both degrees in six years typically, beginning their studies in the Campbell University School of Law. During the first year, the student would begin law scho ol studies during the Summer Semester followed by law school classes in fall, spring and summer semesters. The second year, the student would begin medical studies at Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine and complete three years in medical s tudies before returning to the law school. As a dual program, it is important to note that both the law school and the medical school are accredited. North Carolina has six ABA -accredited law schools: 1. Campbell University 2. Duke University 3. Elon University 4. North Carolina Central University 5. University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill 6. Wake Forest University North Carolina has five LCME - or COCA -accredited medical schools: 1. Campbell University (COCA -accredited) 2. Duke (LCME -accredited) 3. East Carolina Univer sity (LCME -accredited) 4. University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill (LCME -accredited) 5. Wake Forest University (LCME -accredited) CUSOM is the only osteopathic medical school in North Carolina, and the JD/DO program is unique. In North Carolina, at the time of this Bulletin only Duke University has a similar dual-degree program. In the United States, the only other osteopathic medical school with a similar joint degree program is Rowan University is New Jersey. 179 7.

HONOR CODE, GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES AND AOA CODE OF ETHICS 9.1 Honor Code The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Conduct (CUSOM Honor Code) embodies a spirit of mutual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell University communities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on t he fundamental belief that every student is worthy of trust and that trusting a student is an integral component in making them worthy of trust. It is maintained to protect the right to participate in an academic environment free from injustice caused by d ishonesty . Further, students at CUSOM are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner befitting the honorable profession they are entering. Students have an obligation to maintain the highest standards of integrity. It is not possib le to enumerate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, nor is it possible to enumerate all behaviors considered inappropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the standards of a CUSOM student. The following serves on ly as a guideline to students . In general, the founding principles of the CUSOM Honor Code are the established rules and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any institution where CUSOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Violation of these rules and regulations may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior that may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code include, but are not limi ted to the following : 1) Cheating: Providing, acquiring or receiving any unauthorized assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing information from testing/exams is also considered a form of cheating . 2) Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or computer code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof . 3) Falsification: Fabrication of information on any form of academic work or attempt thereof ; including but not limited to , the following : a) Clinical requirements, b) Internships, and c) Assignments such as: obtaining patient histories, performing physical exams, ordering or interpreting laboratory tests, documenting and submitting rotation records, etc. 192 4) Disruptive Behavior: Any inappropriate etiquette or inappropriate disturbance repeated often enough to establish a disrespectful trend. Inappropriate disturbances include but are not limited to the following : a) Arriving late for class, or leaving class wh ile in progress . b) Disrupting class with pagers or cellular phones . c) Disrupting class with computers or computer games . d) Disrupting class with loud talking or other activities that create a distraction . e) Leaving trash in classrooms or academic areas, including student small group study rooms . f) Bringing food into unauthorized areas or hosting food functions without permission . g) Posting unapproved materials or approved posting materials in inappropriate areas . h) Parking in inappropriate or reserved space s. 5) Unacceptable use of technology: Any violation of the acceptable use guidelines as published by the CUSOM IT department.

Lecture materials, including PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confidential and proprietary information and material protected by intellectual property laws. Students do not have permission to share them . 6) Unprofessional or unethical behavior: Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending student or in the CUSOM community by the public, faculty, staff, c olleagues, or the -community - at-large. Suspected violations in this category are referred, at the Dean's discretion, to the APPS Committee. If agreeable to the Dean, a student may request to waive a hearing by the APPS Committee for suspected violations in this category and have their case heard by the Dean, or his/her designee only . In such c ases, the Dean, or his/her designee only must agree to hear the case, and must accept the student's waiving of a hearing; the Dean, or his/her designee only decision is final and cannot be appealed. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include , but is not limited to, the following : a) Entering or using the facilities of the CUSOM community without appropriate authorization or during inappropriate times . b) Knowingly and purposely disrupting teaching, research, administrative, or student functions of the CUSOM community . c) Abusive or disrespectful conduct toward members of the faculty, administrative or professional staff, employees, students, patients, or visitors of the CUSOM community . 193 d) Disclosure of privileged information from campus activities or patient care . e) Improper relationships or activities involving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requirements, which extend beyond those educational requirements. Entrusted persons may include, but are not limited to, patients or other students under supervision . f) Screening tests w h i c h show abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine , o r s c r e e n i n g t e s t s w h i c h a r e positive ( i . e . , e v i d e n c e o f t h e s u b s t a n c e o r s h o w i n g p r e s e n c e ) for alcohol, prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina . Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. Another example is a breathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentration sample identifying levels of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Under the Infl uence charge. The presence of these substances, regardless of any legal considerations or adjudication by the courts, is considered unprofessional or unethical behavior by CUSOM. g) Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is considered a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the professional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community. Suspected violations in this category are referred, at the Dean's discretion, to the APPS Committee. If agreeable to the Dean, a student ma y request to waive a hearing by the APPS Committee for suspected violations in this category and have their case heard by the Dean, or his/her designee only . In such cases, the Dean or his/her designee only must agree to hear the case, and must accept the student's waiving of a hearing; the Dean's decision is final and cannot be appealed . h) A violation of any policy of the University or CUSOM, including but not limited to the American Osteopathic Association Code of Ethics . 9.2 Code of Misconduct Violations may include, but are not limited to: Harassment (other than a violation of the Title IX Policy) , harm , abuse, or damage to any person or property in the CUSOM community. This includes knowingly or purposely causing damage to or vandalizing CUSOM community property . Conviction of a criminal offense other than a minor traffic offense . Participating in academic or clinical endeavors in the CUSOM community while under the influence of alcohol, or controlled substances . Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illicit substances , prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Controlled substance s will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws 194 governing illegal substances. Please note this includes substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina, but which may be legal in other states. Communicating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including written or electronic/Internet communications, which would result in a loss of respect by patients or other members of the public toward the offending student or toward CUSOM . Release of Information All documents and other informati on concerning student discipline, including written reprimands, are securely maintained in a confidential file. Such actions become a part of the student's permanent education record but are only released at the written discretion of the Dean. However, as required on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE, Dean's letter), all disciplinary actions are reported . 9.3 GRIEVANCE PROCESSES Resolution and Grievance Procedure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to problems, disagreements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of institutional policy. CUSOM also recognizes the responsibility of the student to express their concerns in a professional and ethical manner.

The administrative officer may refuse the meeting if the appeal has not been p resented in writing, in advance of the meeting . If the concern is financial, or with other areas of CUSOM, the student should follow the appropriate chain of command as defined by the CUSOM Organizational Chart . Reminder: Course Assessment policies and tes t question challenges are not covered under student grievances. See course -specific syllabi for information regarding these issues . Grievance Procedure for Harassment* or Discrimination Students who feel they are being discriminated against have the right to exercise the Grievance Procedure . Retaliation against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance process is strictly prohibited. In the event a student or anyone who participated in the grievance process believes they have be en subjected to retaliation, that individual may use the Harassment Grievance procedures listed below . 196 Step One: The Resolution Process Students who meet the Technical Standards for admission to CUSOM, as described in this Academic Bulletin, and feel they are being discriminated against shall first meet with the Director of Student Affairs to explain their grievance .

At the time of filing, the student should have followed all the procedures listed in this Academic Bulletin. 197 Step Two: The Grievance Hearing Process If the student feels the informal resolution has not been successful, or disagrees with the informal resolution, he/she may request the Director of Student Affairs and the Dean to call a Grievance He aring. The student has thirty ( 30) calendar days after receiving written notice of denial of the grievance to request such a hearing .
