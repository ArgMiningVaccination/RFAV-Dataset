Other specialties include lactation support, family dynamic transitions, body mind awareness and intuitive energy work. Rachel attended Bastyr University for her doula education including perinatal mental health and lactation. She is an educator and facilitator for the Gottman Institutes \"Bringing home Baby\" trainings and programs. Rachel also graduated as a Voice Dialogue Facilitator and Counselor. A therapeutic modality to help the client work from a place of an aware ego as well as a certified EFT tapping clinician. She has been attuned as a reiki master level 2 from Northwest Healing Studio as well as completed her 8 month Reiki Intuitive energy healing mentorship and level 3 Reiki master training and attunement. She has been on the journey of intuitive healing and processing for years. A healing session can be strictly silent hands on energy healing or it can be more an emotional talk therapy session with intuitive hands on healing as needed. She uses all her facets to create and hold space for the client. Her passion is to reignite the spark within every client and to empower and lift the vibrations and energy of each one she touches. She believes everyone has the innate ability to radiate and function at their highest good and her intention is to help usher that in. She feels strongly that each parent and family can feel empowered in their role given the right tools, knowledge, and support. Her passion is rooted in her deep respect and belief in the way of all the ancestors that did this work for centuries before and the ideology that it takes a village. After having her own postpartum doula practice she is thrilled to be joining the Glow family of practitioners to more fully build each client's \"village\".

She was an early childhood educator for many years and has worked with infants through toddlerhood and their families for the last 15 years. She has a holistic approach and likes to meet her clients where they are and support them in whatever way they need. She brings all her knowledge to the table and pulls from the parts that seem to be most beneficial and relevant to the client. Rachel was born in San Francisco,raised in Seattle and lived in LA and NY. She now calls Seattle her home where she lives with her partner, children and two dogs. When not with clients you can find her trying to snuggle her \"not-so-baby-babies\", doing barre, meditating, reading, watering her plants, eating an abundance of kale and kimchi and trying with limited success to read her partner his horoscope.

[ Read More ](#/staff_member/59/bio) Paneled with Premera, Lifewise, PIP, First Choice, Kaiser(PPO) and Regence I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker holding credentials to provide psychotherapy in Washington State (LICSW). I am a graduate of the State University of New York at Buffalo's School of Social Work, where I earned my Master's of Social Work (MSW) degree. I have developed a breadth of experience from hospital employment that included medical case management, dialysis care, inpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency treatment, and outpatient mental health counseling, as well as from Community College counseling, where I provided academic, career and personal counseling to the students and faculty. My Approach My approach to therapy is holistic, from a Strengths-Based, Mindful perspective, acknowledging that all people have strengths - often untapped or unrecognized. Strengths-Based Social Work practice is an empowering alternative to traditional therapies. Traditional psychotherapy more often defines an individual's poor functioning in terms of psychiatric diagnoses. My approach, in collaboration with the patient, is to uncover or rediscover the patient's own abilities. I view my patients as resourceful and resilient in the face of adversity, and empower them to be active participants in the healing process. My work is informed by and grounded in Transpersonal Social Work Theory (Body and Spirit), and reflects my professional training in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Reality Therapy, Family Systems, Mindfulness, and Body Awareness. I have a special interest in Integrative Mental Health (our brains are not separate from our bodies!). I work with all individuals struggling with chronic illness and pain, depression and anxiety, as well as those overwhelmed by transitions in life, but I have a particular personal interest in supporting and managing the stress and anxiety associated with fertility issues by employing a mindfulness approach. More About Tina I joined the staff at Glow Natural Health Center in November 2009 when my husband, our pets, and I took on the challenge of uprooting ourselves from our home in New York State and moving to Seattle to be near our daughter Lindsey, son-in-law Joel, and new grandchild Eli. I believe real growth and transformation can result from changes we make in our lives, even though change can be uncomfortable or downright scary. However, challenging oneself can be very empowering! I am enjoying the abundant cultural opportunities that Seattle provides as well as furthering my life-long interest in nature in the incredible beauty of the Pacific NW. The therapeutic relationship between patient and therapist is a special one. To help you assess whether or not we make a good connection, I offer a free 30-minute consult. I welcome the opportunity to work with you! Check out her website http://tinamichalski.com/ for more information.

She can still remember the herbal scents which filled her home as she watched her grandma prepare food and herbal remedies for the family on a daily basis.
