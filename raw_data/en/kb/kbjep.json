The team worked with blood experts and focused on the connection between AstraZeneca vaccines and reports of blood clots, mining through the available data. They found no connection between AstraZeneca and blood clots. They will continue to investigate the incidents in younger individuals, and suggested that anybody who experienced adverse effects get a healthcare professional's opinion. The PRAC said that most of the nine deaths across the European bloc occurred in women aged under 55. The EMA explained in a statement: \"Because these events are rare, and COVID-19 itself often causes blood clotting disorders in patients, it is difficult to estimate a background rate for these events in people who have not had the vaccine.\" Blood clots can lead to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is when a blood clot forms deep in the body and can lead to serious internal damage or death if left untreated. But COVID-19 itself can cause blood clots, including organ failure and proven rates of death - which has led to medical authorities in the EU and UK to suggest that populations continue to be vaccinated. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"The Oxford and AstraZeneca jab is safe and the Pfizer jab is safe. The thing that isn't safe is catching COVID.\" The PRAC say that the vaccine's value to protecting populations from hospitalisation and death outweighs \"the extremely small likelihood\" of developing a medical issue from a blood clot. However, after this public feud over the blood clot issue, an emerging concern for healthcare leaders is increased vaccine hesitancy and nationalism. Speaking to the NYT, Michael Breiden, a 53-year old night nurse in a psychiatric hospital in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said: \"The point is that we have a German-made product that is the market leader, but we are not able to get it.\" Rachel Cheng, Communications Manager & Gis\u00e8le Yasmeen, Executive Director from Food Secure Canada, argue that post-COVID, a zero hunger Canada is within reach Last year, Canadians flocked to stores and worried about having enough food to stock their pantry. Yet for many of us, the worry of putting food on the table is not new. Even before COVID-19, food insecurity was a reality for millions of Canadians. Indigenous, Black and racialized communities were experiencing hunger at even higher rates. Meanwhile, farmers were facing an income crisis, and too much of our food chain depended on precarious, low-paid jobs and gig work. From farm to fork, people are struggling to get by, and it is apparent that structural change is required. It is an opportune moment to look at the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their ambitious targets for a better world, including ending hunger, prioritising sustainable food, and taking urgent action on climate change. Addressing inequality & hunger: Sustainable Development Goals Only six years ago in 2015, the SDGs were adopted by Member States of the United Nations, including Canada. These goals are compelling not only because of their big vision, but also because they act as objectives to which we can hold our governments accountable. They inherently require the collaboration of actors across sectors, departments, and levels of government, as well as with a diverse set of stakeholders. Leaving no one behind is core to the SDGs, and while the world was making progress towards reducing inequality (SDG 10), the upheaval from COVID-19 has led to what the UN acknowledges as \"the worst economic and social crisis in generations.\" (1) In Canada, food insecurity is now experienced by almost one in seven (14.6%) of Canadians (2). Moreover, specific communities experience higher rates of food insecurity. Before the pandemic, Black households in Canada were already three and a half times more likely to experience food insecurity (3), and this is likely amplified by the pandemic, which is disproportionately affecting racialized communities, many of whom labour in essential services or jobs in which they cannot work from home. In a country priding itself on its diversity, Canada must confront the systemic biases, discrimination and racism, which lead to certain communities being more at risk of hunger. Growing resilience and equity in Canada The deadline to meet the SDGs is quickly approaching in 2030, but the good news is that communities already know many of the ways forward. Using the SDGs as a framework, Food Secure Canada launched a roadmap for getting to healthier, more just, and more sustainable food systems, in Growing resilience and equity: A food policy action plan in the context of Covid-19. This action plan outlines policy priorities based on lessons learned from those working in community, academic, and non-profit organisations, using an inclusive public interest-based approach. Key proposals include: Address the root cause of food insecurity through establishing a universal liveable income floor beneath which no one can fall, while ensuring that everyone in Canada has access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. Support Indigenous food sovereignty where First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit determine their own place-based food systems, advancing policies that will best support self-determined resilient futures. Champion decent work and justice for all workers along the food chain by ensuring decent pay and conditions for every food worker, and meeting the specific demands of migrant workers. Ensure everyone is at the policymaking table through the Canadian Food Policy Advisory Council (CFPAC), which should include resourcing to ensure that wider civil society voices, above all those most marginalised by the present food system, are included. Meeting the SDGs in Canada In Canada, the recently launched Food Policy for Canada is intended to align with the commitment to the SDGs, including ending hunger within the next nine years. As such, there is no time to waste in implementing policy proposals from the grassroots that are supported by evidence. Fortunately, the Food Policy for Canada will be supported by the Canadian Food Policy Advisory Council, a multi-stakeholder group with representatives from across the food system that was named in February 2021. The result of years of advocacy by Food Secure Canada and its allies, this Council has the potential to encourage an integrated approach to food systems governance. The Council will also help Canada meet the SDGs in a transparent manner, with the development of measurable targets and associated indicators, which should include race-based data developed with and by affected communities. We cannot rely on charitable food to end hunger While food banks and similar organisations do invaluable work, only a fifth of those who are food insecure in Canada go to food banks, (4) and it is clear that we cannot rely on charitable food to solve hunger. Moreover, the effects of hunger impact more than physical health, negatively impacting one's mental health and ability to find and retain employment. (5) This is why one of the most urgent policy proposals is to establish a universal liveable income floor beneath which no one can fall. This can start by increasing existing income supports and tax credits at both the federal and provincial levels, such as the recent increase to the Canada Child Benefit. This can also be complemented by social programs such as rent subsidies, pharmacare, and is connected to the related push for a liveable minimum wage here in Canada. As a post-COVID world comes into focus, we must not lose time or momentum to effect profound change in the way we grow, cook, and eat food. The inseparable crises of food insecurity and social inequality have been magnified by the pandemic. In Canada, we must not forget our commitments to the SDGs not only for the sake of the goals themselves, but for the health and wellbeing of the diversity of communities from coast to coast to coast. Noa Khamallah, former Executive at Voi and Lime, argues that not only are e-scooters the perfect fit for the cities of the future but they can also help speed up the UK's emergence from the pandemic Everything old is new again. Just ask Lady Florence Norman, the suffragette who in 1916 first popularised the 'motor scooter' as the future of transport. \"Everybody that can ride a bike can ride a motor scooter,\" Norman enthused from atop an Autoped during the First World War. It is fair to say that Lady Norman's efforts were somewhat more successful in securing women the vote than scooting. Bar a post-Second World War surge in scooters owing to fuel rationing, the future of British transport has belonged to the motor vehicle. And so it is again as our cities struggle with COVID-19. People have returned to their cars to avoid a brush with this crippling virus on public transport. COVID-19 pandemic The challenge for cities is that congestion and pollution are not going away. Nor, at least in the short-term in the midst of another government-mandated lockdown, is the coronavirus. Cities are going to have to embrace new ways of moving to beat back their challenges and that means embracing e-scooters and other forms of so-called 'micromobility' as safe and convenient alternatives to car, bus, tram and train travel. Now forget what you hear about e-scooters being a scourge. Yes, there are a few bad apples who don't use them responsibly, but our roads and motorways are plagued by similarly irresponsible drivers. And yes, some people use their scooters to get into trouble. But people also use bikes and cars to get up to no good, and we don't blame cars or bikes for their actions, do we? Besides, any misuse of scooters is vastly outweighed by the benefits of micromobility. Scooters are accessible to people on a wide range of incomes, easy to use, cheap to operate, convenient to store in your home or office, and environmentally friendly. In other words, they are perfect for the cities of the future. More importantly, e-scooters can help propel cities out of the worst of the pandemic in the coming months. If we are to touch normal again this year, we need every safe mode of transport available to citizens. Why subject yourself to crowded train carriages or buses when you can freely cruise the streets instead? This isn't to suggest there are no problems with the various e-scooter trials being conducted up and down the United Kingdom. There are too many free-floating e-scooters cluttering our pavements and causing headaches for pedestrians and councils across the country. Allowing people to place their e-scooters anywhere is an invitation to frustration; nobody wants to have to dodge obstacles as they walk or push their pram through the High Street. Docking Thankfully there is an answer to these problems: docking. Give e-scooters a storage point on our streets and they will be welcomed as a trusted companion to cycles. Docks can also double up as a charge point for e-scooters, thereby eliminating the need for an army of contractors to race around town collecting, charging, and re-distributing scooters around our pavements- a practice that eliminates much of their environmental benefit. The problem right now is that very few councils are insisting on using docks for their e-scooter trials, meaning e-scooters are ending up in our canals, car parks, and tips. Councils are repeating the mistakes they made with dockless cycles, and it will be a major detriment to the UK's urban hubs if the option of scooting is taken away. Our streets are not the play or dumping grounds for free-floating e-scooter companies. Councils need to put convenience, reliability, and safety to the fore, so locals can enjoy the benefits and freedoms that can come with e-scooters, especially those on lower incomes who cannot afford a car or daily train travel. COVID has given us an (unwanted) opportunity to change the way we move around cities. We can either complain about the pandemic's restrictions on our freedoms or invent new ones that respect the current reality. E-scooting gives us a way to keep one of the few benefits of the pandemic - cleaner air - while eventually getting us safely back to work. Lady Norman wasn't wrong; she was simply ahead of her time. Now it's time for councils to embrace the future. Delivering a Net Zero UK by 2050 will require the fastest and most ambitious energy system transformation ever undertaken. In less than 30 years we will have to transform how we use, store and consume energy and this means the infrastructure that underpins our society must be re-designed and rebuilt. To have any realistic chance of achieving this goal, the UK must make investments and strategic choices today and investing in hydrogen is key. In the UK, transport accounts for 29% of all energy consumed, but the other 71% is heat and electricity[1], so if we are to succeed then we must start by recognising the elephant in the room - how do we decarbonise our demand for heat? What are the options? Various solutions for the decarbonisation of heat have been proposed such as electrification, biomass, biomethane or hybrid systems such as district heating. Heat pumps are a very efficient means of decarbonising heat for residential and small commercial users, with proven technology available but high capex and a significant footprint is often needed. Bio-energy resources are also widely used and continue to be deployed, though their pace is expected to decline with the end of the non-domestic RHI in the UK. District heating has been widely used in Europe and while attempts have been made by public sector bodies, few if any have got off the ground. The financing having been challenging to secure. Simply put, all these technologies can and must play a role in the pursuit of net-zero, but none will be a silver bullet for all energy solutions. Not all buildings are suitable for 100% electrification, nor is there a sufficient supply of bio-energy resources domestically to meet all our heat demand. It is because of these limitations that large energy consumers such as the public sector should be looking more at what role hydrogen can play in helping them to decarbonise. Why Hydrogen? Hydrogen is an energy vector, or fuel if you like, that can be created from renewable power and water, or from processes that encourage hydrogen to escape its bonds with carbon-based fuels, e.g., natural gas. Hydrogen can be combusted to generate heat, with commercial and residential boilers commercially available that can use hydrogen either in its pure form or blended with other gases e.g., biomethane, natural gas, etc. But it can also generate heat through fuel cell technologies that combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity, heat and water. These solutions are similar to conventional fossil fuel-based CHP systems, but with the notable benefits that they are quieter, they can reduce particulate emissions by filtering the air to extract oxygen, and as an electro-chemical process they have fewer moving parts and require less maintenance. Hydrogen is attractive is because we have used it before. The old town gas system in the UK consumed up to 21TWh of hydrogen during the 1960's-70s, where it made up almost 50% of the UK gas grid. Hydrogen indeed is still part of several gas grids internationally, including Hong Kong and Singapore where it is blended alongside natural gas for use in heat and power generation. Another benefit is that it is flexible, with the ability to produce hydrogen at differing times during the day, month or year and store it until needed. An important linked benefit of these elements is reliability and resiliency. The gas network in the UK provides a vast amount of energy storage and resiliency against extreme weather events such as the beast from the east. In a similar manner, hydrogen can provide long term seasonal storage and thus help to facilitate the integration of the UK's abundant, but intermittent, renewable power resources such as solar PV and wind. Why should hydrogen matter to public sector organisations? The public sector is a unique energy consumer. It has a duty to consider the long-term implications of its investments, it places a higher value on resiliency and reliability and many private sector entities, and it can leverage state-backed resources more effectively to drive through significant change. These factors are crucial because the most immediate reason why the public sector should be looking at hydrogen is time. Heating systems are often designed to last for 25 years or more, which means that public sector bodies who are looking at new heating investments today must pick solutions that can deliver zero-emission heat over their asset lifetimes. Failure to do so will not only bake in inertia towards continued fossil fuel use, but could also lead to stranded assets that are retired before the end of their operational life. Preparing for and exploring the role of hydrogen for decarbonising heat in public sector operations should be regarded as a no-regrets decision. Hydrogen ready boilers (and fuel cells) today can function on the existing gas grid, and with varying blends of hydrogen as the grid transitions over time. These technologies can also sit alongside heat pumps and other zero-emission technologies if/when they become more widespread in their deployment. Projects such as HyHy by Wales & West are good examples of this. Protium is a green hydrogen energy company that delivers zero-emission energy solutions to companies and organisations that are committed to achieving net-zero. We develop, build, finance and operate green hydrogen and renewable energy infrastructure assets to provide zero-emission hydrogen energy services, a model we call a HESCO. We work with consumer-facing manufacturers, such as Bruichladdich in Islay to decarbonise heat demand, but also with public sector bodies such as hospitals, council buildings and locally owned infrastructure such as airports. Working with public sector bodies, we allow organisations to access the benefits of decarbonised heat solutions without them absorbing the technical risks or having to finance the upfront capex needed. We allow organisations to move faster than the grid alone might facilitate and thus help organisations to truly lead on net-zero by providing dedicated green hydrogen solutions. Rick Goud, Chief Information Officer at Zivver, discusses the importance of becoming a digital enabler through implementing accessible and user-friendly security solutions Surely, you can't have it all...well, actually you can. The common misconception among organisations is that digital security is complex as well as inaccessible, and it requires too many changes in the way that employees work. But, in search of the right trade-off between security and usability, a fundamental concept has been overlooked. Ultimately, it is increased usability that promotes increased security. Usability should not be equated with simplicity in technology. Easy-to-use security solutions that are intuitive and seamlessly embedded into everyday working lives, will enable the non-tech-savvy employees to participate in cybersecurity efforts. Without clear-cut, manageable measures, the end result will be low adoption rates among employees, in turn, making security risks far more probable. Usability interlinked to adoption rates Usability has a direct impact on adoption rates - if something is confusing or difficult to use fewer people will utilise it. The problem is that low adoption rates can be a real inhibitor to the success of a security initiative. Essentially, if employees are not operating a service to its full capacity, then it does not matter how much has been spent on the technology. Technology is one thing, but it only becomes beneficial when individuals apply it in a meaningful way. A key issue with many inbuilt security systems from email providers or supplementary applications is that data protection can only be achieved through behavioural changes or additional user actions. For us, we believe that the problem largely stems from this. The 21st-century employee is not only extremely busy, but they are also people of habit and often like to follow specific routines. Therefore, forced changes in working behaviour may seem unnatural to workers whilst additional user actions could be too time-consuming. For instance, on Outlook the only way to encrypt an outbound email is by following a manual three-step approach. On some systems, we also find that recipients are required to create an account and log onto a separate portal. In this sense, we increase barriers rather than lower them and largely disincentivise adoption. Who is going to remember to activate these systems every time they send an email? Combined with this, we often see solutions interfering with employee workflow. Pop-ups, which are common on many security platforms, are very distracting for individuals and they can even become frustrating. With this in mind, it is understandable that security is not at the top of employee priority lists. The harm caused by poor usability and low adoption rates The importance of striking a balance between usability and security cannot be overstated. Without an effective and easy-to-use platform, the first concern is that data breaches are more likely. Sensitive information can be leaked either through human error internally or external threats. Organisations are then met with problems ranging from financial and legal implications to reputational damage, to name just a few. The educational aspect of security is also lost. Higher adoption rates, due to a more usable platform, can serve the functionality of increasing employee understanding and awareness of security-related issues and encourage people to remain alert to threats. Organisations can also invest substantial amounts into IT budgets, particularly as the world becomes more digitalised. However, a platform with poor usability means that technology becomes irrelevant and underused. As mentioned above, low adoption rates make it even more likely for data breaches to occur, ultimately costing your company even more. Becoming an Enabler: Striking the balance It all comes down to being an enabler. It is about ensuring that technology is security compliant, integrated into the existing way of working, that it is familiar, intuitive, and recognisable for the people using it as well as intelligent in helping people make better decisions. Embracing usability and security should go hand in hand. They are not opposing ideas, but rather complementary terms that need to be fully embraced by the working community. From increasing employee productivity to instilling confidence in company operations, it is safe to say that engaging with a usable system has multiple benefits. Novacyt Group, discusses the evolution of testing and sequencing during COVID-19 with a panel of distinguished speakers The advances in testing and genome sequencing during the COVID-19 pandemic will be crucial to predicting and managing future pandemics, according to scientific discussion during the NovaTalk webinar on 26th February 2021. What's more, the expanse of science over the past 15 months could now be applied to tackling the growing worldwide incidence of antibiotic resistance. Prof Sharon Peacock, Director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium and Professor of Public Health and Microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said: \"I'm not afraid of the next pandemic. Let's not be afraid, but let's be prepared. After COVID-19, we are in a much stronger position than we were before. We have better diagnostics, better ways of detecting viral threats and better means of control. But we have to be vigilant. There's no point not learning from this pandemic and we have to understand where the next threat might come from, be able to detect and diagnose it as fast as possible and control it as fast as possible.\" Prof Peacock was among a panel of four invited to debate 'The role of diagnostic tests and sequencing in managing a pandemic' in a webinar organised by the clinical diagnostic company, Novacyt Group. She was joined by Prof Chris Malloy, CEO of Medicines Discovery Catapult, Founding Director of the UK Lighthouse Labs and Independent Chair of the UK's COVID-19 UK's Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC), together with Prof Steven Jones, the EVP Public Health at Bluefield Health Group. Back on track Discussing the UK's ability to return to 'the new normal' since the COVID-19 outbreak, all agreed on the importance of testing - together with genomic sequencing. Prof Jones said: \"Testing is a key part of getting us back to normal. We have testing that is strong enough to enable us to get back to normal. We've come a long way, even in the last 20 years since SARS, in our ability to understand the evolution of a virus in real-time. We now need the capacity to rapidly deploy new diagnostic tests. It is also essential that we have a privacy-preserving mechanism to share verified health status based on these tests.\" Prof Peacock said: \"Testing has a vitally important place in driving down the disease burden, combined with vaccines and genomic sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and COVID-19 vaccine efficacy are set to be long-term partners.\" \"In the past few months, we've seen a peak of variants, and we need sequencing over time, to track and understand how much of a threat a variant might be to the population, so we can titrate our response. The SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates at around one or two times per month, but the fact that there have been more than 100 million COVID-19 cases worldwide has given the virus a lot of opportunity to evolve. So, it's essential to monitor how its behaviour changes, how its transmission changes, whether it can evade the immune system, and how it's picked up by diagnostic tests so we can forewarn the diagnostic test manufacturers to develop new tests.\" \"We can look ahead - get ahead of the virus - so that we can work with the diagnostic test makers and know from the users' perspective, what tests will be suitable. Genomic sequencing is, therefore, a prospective as well as retrospective ability.\" Test combination \"We need both forms of testing,\" said Prof Peacock, \"- easy-to-use tests that you can distribute to schools, airports, workplaces, for rapid results to enable people to get back to what they want to do. Centralised testing has high value in efficacy, accuracy, throughput, data collection, and these large, centralised labs are at the top of their game.\" Prof Molloy said: \"There are so many different use cases for testing and having a combination of tests and locations is important. Over time we have developed and used a range of these and crossed the Rubicon in terms of accepting them in everyday life.\" Prof Jones said that whilst diagnostic tests were essential for diagnosing who had a disease, especially if they were asymptomatic, antibody tests also had a strong role to play in providing information about where, and to what extent in a community, a virus has occurred. \"Both tests broaden our knowledge of the behaviour of a virus,\" he said. Routine testing Testing will become a routine part of everyday life, he added, together with vaccines and maintaining public health measures such as facemask-wearing, hand washing and social distancing. \"The key thing here is to make the behavioural changes required as a result of the testing. If you test positive, even if you had no symptoms, you have to stay at home.\" Prof Jones said: \"Normal made us vulnerable. The new normal will be taking tests and if you have an infectious disease, stay at home. It's not just a benefit to you, but it's a public health intervention to help us manage a pandemic today or in the future.\" \"I hope we learn the lessons from COVID-19 that we failed to do from SARS, MERS or Ebola - analysing what went wrong and what went right.\" Prof Molloy reiterated how fast science had advanced during COVID-19 with a 'can-do' attitude that broke down barriers. He said that future collaboration was key to predicting, detecting, treating, and managing COVID-19 and any future pandemics. \"We should be prepared to work across boundaries of organisation and discipline, and to intrinsically trust people to share the same purpose,\" he said.

Dale Peters, Research Director at TechMarketView, shares his top 5 predictions for the UK public sector in 2021 Public sector organisations have faced, and continue to face, enormous challenges associated with the COVID-19 crisis. Digital services have been introduced and adapted at pace, staff have transitioned to remote working, and priorities have been reset to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. There is a new acceptance of digital amongst public sector leaders, collaboration efforts have strengthened relationships, and many of the barriers to transformation have been stripped away. Many of the budgetary pressures that existed prior to the pandemic have been exacerbated by the crisis. This has resulted in organisations, many of which have faced significant reductions in funding over the last decade, with limited scope to adapt without reimagining service delivery, rethinking their approach to digital and embracing new technologies. Clearly the challenges are many, but public sector organisations need to ensure that the momentum and innovation established during the crisis is not lost. Looking across the current year, here are five trends we can expect to see in the public sector. Budgetary pressures will increase the need to automate With limited capacity to absorb further pressures on budgets and services, public sector organisations will need to reimagine their operating models and embrace automation. The Government has highlighted the importance of automation as a way of achieving savings and increasing productivity in the public sector. Its Automation Marketplace DPS (Dynamic Purchasing System), launched in March last year, was designed to help public sector organisations find support to design, build or buy, and use the automation solutions effectively\u2014it should accelerate the adoption of automation across Whitehall and beyond. There will be a continued shift in the focus of automation programmes away from tactical productivity enhancements and efficiency gains towards improving outcomes for citizens and staff, and we expect automation to increasingly become embedded within existing products. Sustainability will become a differentiating factor In September 2020, the Government launched a new model to deliver social value through its commercial activities\u2014the impact will be felt widely across the public sector. It means social value should be explicitly evaluated during procurement, rather than just considered, and it should carry a heavy enough score to be a differentiating factor in bid evaluations. Approximately three-quarters of councils in the UK, as well as many universities and NHS trusts, have declared a Climate Emergency. Many have set 2030 as a target date for going carbon zero. Despite the pressures of the pandemic and budgetary uncertainty, climate change, sustainability and, social value more broadly, will be a growing factor when moulding contracts and selecting suppliers. Remote working will continue to bring opportunities and threats Prior to the pandemic, just 3% of public sector workers reported they mainly worked from home; far lower than in the private sector. The rapid shift to home working, which has been a key feature of the COVID-19 crisis, has necessitated significant unplanned investment in devices, infrastructure and support services. This expenditure will continue to take its toll on future IT budgets but given the investment it will be impossible to justify a return to the old ways of working. Once we move away from the pandemic, most organisations will settle into a hybrid model, comprising both home-based and office-based work. Public sector organisations will embrace smaller, lower-cost but more flexible estates, and the ability to work remotely will facilitate more efficient and agile models of delivering public services. However, more employees working remotely will bring a host of additional challenges, such as the need to monitor the wellbeing and engagement of home-based staff and the increased threat of cybercrime. The use of AI faces increasing scrutiny The use of data and artificial intelligence (AI) during the pandemic has raised important privacy, ethical and moral questions that will have significant implications for the future of digital technology in the public sector. AI has been applied widely in planning the national response to the pandemic, helping to predict the demand for resources and organising public health data, and the potential AI offers for improving public services more generally is enormous. However, as the fear of COVID-19 declines, concerns about data privacy and the use of AI will intensify. Public sector organisations will need to be upfront and honest with citizens about the ethical considerations associated with the technology and work hard to allay their fears. Collaboration momentum will accelerate innovation The dramatic shift to remote working during the pandemic resulted in a wide-scale expansion in the adoption of collaboration tools. These have been rolled out across the NHS, police forces, councils and the wider public sector, enabling staff to work effectively from home, on-site or on duty. However, collaboration during the pandemic has gone way beyond enhanced communication. The fight against COVID-19 has required an urgent and global collaboration effort between governments, health systems, academia and the private sector. Relationships have been reinforced and will provide assurance for new digital programmes, which, combined with a newfound confidence in technology in the public sector, will help sustain innovation momentum. Whilst day to day pressures will inevitably start to take over, partnerships will be sustained and play a vital role in future digital transformation initiatives. Huge progress has been made, but there is still much to be done to break down the silos that exist in the public sector and ensure services are resilient to the future challenges that await. Hannah Paterson, Principal Consultant at Step5, points out how to spot if someone is struggling with their mental health from a distance and how to encourage a culture of wellbeing to prevent issues from developing in the first place Working from home has its perks. As a working mum, it gives me far more flexibility. Because I'm no longer commuting, I'm always around for the kids' bedtime. That said, working from home for almost a year amidst a global pandemic poses some unique challenges. From the general disruption of our normal daily lives to our inability to meet relatives, friends or colleagues face-to-face, it's easy to see why some employees might be feeling the strain. But how can you tell if someone is struggling when your only interaction with them is virtual? What are the signs to look out for, and how can you foster wellbeing in your team so that mental health issues are less likely to arise in the first place? Look for changes According to Jon Manning, founder of mental health consultancy Arthur Ellis, you should be alert to psychological, physical or social changes among members of your team. This might be someone asking more probing questions or using more negative language than usual, or seeming more apathetic or even flippant. Physical signs can be more difficult to spot from a distance, but marked changes in someone's appearance or even background on video calls, such as mounting piles of dirty dishes or laundry, could be a red flag. Social cues could be someone becoming withdrawn, consistently missing or being late for team calls or never turning on their camera. One isolated change isn't cause for alarm but if in doubt, it's better to ask the person how they are rather than wonder if everything's OK. They may be reluctant to open up, but knowing that they can and that you're there to listen is important. I also find that sharing my own personal challenges establishes common ground and shows people that it's OK to admit you're not OK. Prioritise wellbeing Rather than reacting to mental health issues when they develop, experts recommend taking a more proactive approach to wellbeing. According to Deloitte, employee mental health initiatives are most effective when they focus on prevention or build employee resilience. Regular physical activity has a positive impact on how people feel. Getting out into the fresh air and exercising raises energy levels, improves cognitive function and boosts our mood overall. A group of academics agrees and recommends people do a pretend commute when working from home to protect their health and create a clear distinction between home and work life. It's easy to get engrossed in a task and barely leave your desk, so the key is to encourage your team to make time in their schedule for exercise. That might mean giving employees a designated lunch break or diarising exercise time. I regularly book 'walking meetings' with my team: doing a lap of the park while chatting on the phone offers a welcome break from the intensity of video calls too. Collaboration tools have been our lifeline during the pandemic but it's important to switch off from the screen from time to time. Build connections Research consistently shows that social interaction plays an essential role in wellbeing which, in turn, has a positive impact on employee engagement and performance. Building social connections is much easier when you're in the office; catch ups at the coffee machine, chats in the corridor, a quick drink after work are all part of normal working life. And you can usually see if a team member is more stressed than normal. Opportunities to communicate diminish when you're working from home, and you have to make a conscious effort to stay connected and stop people becoming isolated. I regularly check in with my team individually, especially people who I know have a lot on their plate or who live alone, and I build in time at the start of calls for a general catch-up. Not everyone is comfortable chatting on the phone, so I also use instant messaging to keep the channels of communication open. Model healthy behaviours The best way to encourage healthy behaviour is to practice what you preach. I try and lead by example. As a working mum of two under-fives, late afternoon and evening are my most challenging times; I block them out on my calendar so that no one arranges meetings, and I let my team know that if I'm needed, the phone is the only route. I hope this shows them that working flexibly around other commitments is both possible and accepted. One of the biggest challenges of working from home is creating boundaries. People often end up working longer hours - more than two hours a day since the start of the pandemic, according to research - which can lead to stress, fatigue and even burnout. Several years ago, Robbert Rietbrook, then CEO of PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand, encouraged his leadership team to \"leave loudly\", to promote a healthy work/ life balance. His idea was that if the senior team were seen to go home, everyone else would feel comfortable leaving. So, I'm very open and vocal about logging off for the day or taking a break, and hope my team will feel inspired to do likewise. Put people first In the space of a year, the way we live and work has fundamentally changed, creating new challenges for businesses and putting new demands on leaders to support their teams. Just as the most effective digital transformation programmes prioritise the user experience, the most successful companies will prioritise their people and treat them as individuals. In the new world of work, where remote working will continue to be part of the mix, retaining talent is no longer enough. Organisations need people who are healthy, happy and engaged, resilient enough to manage the challenges of hybrid working and perform at their best. There has never been a more legitimate time to ask your team how they are and to really mean it. Jacob Bor, Assistant Professor in Global Health and Epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health, says COVID shed light on what he describes as \"decades of neglect\" It's springtime in the USA. The deadly winter surge of COVID-19 has subsided. Currently, 20% of Americans have been vaccinated, and we are projected to reach herd immunity by Summer. Americans are waking up to an extra $1400 in their bank accounts. And this is just the first installation of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which is projected to cut child poverty in half and boost economic growth to nearly 7% this year. In this season of optimism, with life edging back towards normal, it is tempting to ask if we can just declare victory and move on. Doing so would be a mistake. For one thing, we're not out of the woods yet. We learned early in the COVID-19 pandemic that letting down our guard too soon had dire consequences, spurring second and third waves. Repealing mask mandates and opening bars and indoor entertainment venues seem particularly ill-advised. Still, as vaccine coverage improves, the risks of resurgence fall. COVID-19 exposed the underbelly of American exceptionalism Anaemic worker protections and enforcement led to high rates of workplace exposure. A healthcare system that ties people to their employers left millions uninsured when they most needed care. Decades of divestment in public health infrastructure contributed to slow ramp-up of COVID-19 testing and excess spread of the virus by people who did not know they were infected. Poverty wages for service sector workers such as custodial staff, grocery clerks, and other frontline workers; crowded housing and segregated communities; and absence of universal paid sick leave put workers and their families at risk, and led to higher community transmission. Mass incarceration put millions at risk of infection, and immigration policy criminalised migrants and discouraged use of public services. These factors have led to dramatic differences in exposure to COVID-19 by race and class, as well as large differences in economic impact of the pandemic and control measures. Decades of neglect brought the country to this moment Even before COVID-19, decades of neglect had left the U.S. with health outcomes far worse than other wealthy nations. As my colleagues and I illustrated in the Lancet Commission report on \"Public policy and health in the Trump era\", published last month, 461,000 deaths would be averted each year if the U.S. had mortality rates equivalent to other G7 nations. This number - similar to the COVID-19 death count in 2020 - has increased steadily since 1980. Even if the Biden Administration can successfully bring COVID-19 to heel, the U.S. will still be losing half a million Americans each year to premature death. These excess deaths occurred due to many of the same root causes that have led to poor control of COVID-19. There have been some key policy successes against COVID-19. The CARES Act of 2020 was an economic lifeline to many businesses and households. In particular, the Federal unemployment insurance subsidy of $600/week through July 2020 led to marked reductions in food insecurity. Eviction moratoria have provided some temporary security against displacement. Rapid vaccine development and approval was the consequence of major public investments in discovery, development, approval, and distribution. Still, widening inequality and extreme vulnerability experienced by so many Americans during the pandemic made clear that despite gestures of solidarity, we were decidedly not \"all in this together\". What about the American Rescue Plan (ARP)? The President Biden's American Rescue Plan is a sign we are starting to \"learn the right lessons\". The ARP makes a sharp break - not just from the Trump Administration, but from social policy since Clinton - in reinstating a pro-poor cash welfare system. A mirror image of Trump's $1.9 trillion tax cut for high-earners, the ARP plows an equivalent sum into the pockets of low-and middle-income Americans. By reducing economic precarity, the ARP could have substantial impacts on population health. However, the ARP is temporary (benefits expire in 2022) and does little to change the structural inequalities that have seen wages stagnate since the 1970s. As Americans look beyond COVID-19, we need to make sure we learn the right lessons from the epidemic, focusing on policies that reduce economic precarity and protect public health. Neil Isaacson, CEO, Liberty Charge, discusses how a huge network of electric vehicle charging stations will be built and looks at who will fund it We're seeing a real thrust towards EV adoption driven by a combination of government initiatives as part of its net-zero target, rapidly improving technology and consumer demand to match. For evidence, look no further than the rocketing valuation of Tesla. This is all set against the backdrop of the UK's desire to 'build back better' as we recover from the impacts of the pandemic. Indeed, with its combination of green credentials, investment and growth opportunities and a platform to blend the best of public sector and private enterprise, there is no reason why the EV sector should not epitomise this approach. And in the year that the UK hosts COP26, the timing is perfect to tackle the one major reason this sector is being held back - the under-supply of charging points. Infrastructure needs to keep pace The data paints a clear picture of the scale of this challenge. In the UK, all-electric cars went from 1.6% of the market in 2019 to 6.6% of the market in 2020, representing a near three-fold increase in sales volume. Earlier this year, the government announced a \u00a320 million 'cash injection' to boost the number of on-street electric vehicle charge points across the UK. The On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS) will be extended to 2021/22, allowing Local Authorities to continue to install chargers for those without private parking. This is welcome news and a positive step forward if the UK is to hit its well documented net-zero targets. Yet a report in October 2020 by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed that while sales of EVs had increased 110% over the previous three years in Europe, the number of public charging points had grown by just 58%. Most EV drivers, despite loving their cars, will tell you that the infrastructure is already inadequate with too few public chargers and many regularly out of service. This is only going to get worse if EV sales continue to outstrip charger installations by such huge margins. The role of private enterprise It's a point underlined by the think tank, Policy Exchange, which recently released a new report - Charging up - that explores policies to deliver a comprehensive network of public EV charge points across the UK. The report found the UK is likely to need around 400,000 public charge points by 2030. Today, the UK has around 35,000 public chargers according to the thinktank, with ChargePoint operators installing around 7,000 new charge points per year so it's clear that the numbers don't add up. To install enough public charge points to meet the requirement, roll out will need to occur five times faster at a cost of between \u00a35 billion and \u00a310 billion by 2030. Clearly, neither the government nor local authorities can be expected to foot the bill in full but the solution doesn't automatically have to mean large governmental expenditure. This is because public charging can make money in the same way as domestic energy and communications supply. What it does need is the establishment of strong private-public relationships in order to help deliver on the government's objectives. In fact, if we have any chance of meeting our net-zero objectives, bringing together the best of these sectors is mandatory. Local authorities control and manage the public roads where people without driveways park, while private enterprises have the technology, skills, tools and, in certain cases, the ability to fund and own a long-term infrastructure asset at their fingertips. A clear path to installation Take the matter of site selection, for instance. The act of identifying where to place on-street charging is a time-consuming and complex process. For every site selected, councils may have looked at and analysed anywhere up to 20 alternative locations before securing one location - that's a huge amount of wasted time, effort and money that local authorities can better utilise elsewhere. Not only can private enterprise speed up the process by using geospatial tools to identify where the uptake will be highest, and this can be done with full macro visibility into influencing factors, mitigating many issues before they occur. Like, for example, finding sites that don't have path pathway restrictions - ideally at least 1.8 meters of pathway space is needed, to avoid charge points becoming blocking obstacles. And this is just one hurdle of many. By engaging support from the private sector, local authorities are getting the insight, expertise and knowledge to chart a much clearer path to a quicker installation. The need for speed There are some great examples of local government doing this well, particularly in London, Oxfordshire and Milton Keynes but to unlock the major blockage in the roll-out of EVs, more needs to be done. According to research, commissioned by Centrica, councils are planning to install an average of only 35 on-street electric vehicle chargers each, between now and 2025. This is a figure that must be addressed. The recent funding announcement is a welcome move from the government and a further indication of its commitment to the acceleration of EVs but an adequate supply of street chargers is now becoming essential. The EV revolution is clearly coming if you look at sales volumes, particularly in the UK and Europe. But if the charging infrastructure doesn't pick up, it could leave thousands of EV drivers disappointed, disillusioned and, quite literally, disconnected. But working with local authorities, we can address this problem head-on - and quickly. They need not feel alone when it comes to scaling this challenge. Quite the opposite, in fact: private companies are ready and willing partners to help build a fit-for-purpose EV infrastructure in the UK. Faisal Abbasi, Managing Director Western Europe and MEMA, Amelia, explores how the government can make the most of its Help to Grow scheme to boost entrepreneurship and create the next generation of technology leaders Small businesses have been some of the worst affected throughout the pandemic, without the same reserves as some larger players. That's why the government's Help to Growscheme is such an important initiative to help smaller businesses look at how they can better use technology to optimise operations and services, as well as bring new and innovative ideas to the market. In addition to supporting skills development, the Digital route will provide eligible businesses up to \u00a35,000 to secure a 50% discount on productivity-enhancing software. Where to prioritise funding With Help to Grow: Digital, the Government is prioritising discounts on technology which will help businesses \"build customer relationships and increase sales, make the most of selling online and manage their accounts and finances digitally.\" There is no doubt that automation and Artificial Intelligence-powered (AI) technologies must play a key role here. The Government previously published estimations that by 2035 AI could add an additional \u00a3630bn to the UK economy, in turn increasing the annual growth rate of GVA from 2.5% to 3.9%. Not all AI software is equal But for many small businesses, expensive enterprise packages are often not an option. The high upfront investment and requirements for in-demand and expensive AI or automation expertise means that they are often unsuitable for many small businesses. Instead, there must be a focus on productivity-driving technologies that are easy, accessible and affordable, such as low code/no-code solutions, which can be implemented and managed by employees with minimal technical expertise. This is especially important given the current skills shortage. As the World Economic Forum's latest Future of Jobs report highlights, even large companies are struggling to hire for Data Analysts and Scientists, AI and Machine Learning Specialists as well as Software and Application Developers. Small businesses, unless a technology company themselves, are often cost-out of these in-demand skills and, as a result, the important productivity benefits they offer. How low code/no-code AI platforms offer a viable solution With small businesses accounting for 99.3% of the UK total business population, it's important that the government's Help to Grow scheme helps bridge the AI-divide between large and small enterprises. Low code/no-code platforms offer a viable solution to this challenge, providing non-tech-savvy workers with guided instructions to easily and quickly design, deploy and implement conversational AI agents that can support day-to-day tasks, from customer service through to finance management. These types of solutions mean that small businesses can easily automate time-intensive administrative processes, driving productivity and allowing their employees to focus their time, resource and attention on value-add projects to grow the business. In IT, for example, you can easily deploy an IT Help Desk Engineer, converging front- and back-office functions to automate IT requests including password resets and Wi-Fi access. Or externally, you can design a 24/7 call centre agent that is trained in company protocol to respond to customer enquiries round-the-clock and escalate only the tricky or emotionally sensitive queries to human customer service agents to manage. This democratised approach to implementing AI will increase the velocity for use-case development while driving greater adoption to accelerate the time-to-value of AI within small businesses. It will also empower employees to identify and develop AI use cases for their specific needs, rather than retrofitting an enterprise solution to a small business challenge. Ushering in a new wave of entrepreneurship and creativity The past year has been a challenging one for many small businesses in the UK and the government is right to invest now to support them in both securing their immediate future and helping them future-proof their organisation with productivity-saving AI solutions. Low code/no-code platforms that will help lower the technical barrier to entry to AI will be transformative for the UK small business community. Not only will driving greater productivity help them become more competition amongst their peers on the international market, but it will also empower them to compete on the same technological level as their larger counterparts, punching above their weight in areas like employee and customer experience. Now, Israeli scientists led by Professor Jacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute of Science have successfully grown embryos outside of a living body. Scientists have wanted or attempted to grow embryos outside of a uterus since the 1930s, but these experiments have never been successful. Over seven years, the team led by Professor Hanna has created a two-step process to grow mice embryos in an artificial womb. They extracted 250 embryos from pregnant mice, then placing these on a lab dish and getting the balls to attach to this as if it was the uterine wall. It was in this step that the team saw the embryo double and triple in size, as it grows into three different layers. Professor Hanna said: \"To us, that is the most mysterious and the most interesting part of embryonic development, and we can now observe it and experiment with it in amazing detail.\" What could this research mean for humans? The concept of growing a human outside the womb remains a far away dream for now. But this new way of growing embryos can help the team to understand why so many pregnancies fail to implant and why the window for mammalian implantation is so short. They want to use stem cells to create the embryo next time, which will also help to explore how conditions of formation can later lead to developmental disorders. They could even answer fundamental questions about why stem cells stop being stem cells. According to this experiment, genetic code can work like \"dominos\" \"We think you can inject genes or other elements into the cells, alter the conditions or infect the embryo with a virus, and the system we demonstrated will give you results consistent with development inside a mouse uterus. \"If you give an embryo the right conditions, its genetic code will function like a pre-set line of dominos, arranged to fall one after the other. Our aim was to recreate those conditions, and now we can watch, in real time, as each domino hits the next one in line.\" Terry Sunderland1,2 & Amy Ickowitz2 tell us about the links between forests, food security and nutrition For 95% of human history, human societies have been nomadic. During this period, their diets were mostly made up of wild foods that they hunted or gathered. Most evidence suggests that these roaming bands of humans were generally well-nourished, and lived in a system of \"affluence without abundance\". The agricultural revolution of 10,000-12,000 years ago, however, changed the nature of human culture, livelihood practices, and our diets. Communities became more and more sedentary and relied increasingly on foods that they cultivated, rather than from the wild. This process dramatically accelerated in the last century with the Green Revolution, the further intensification of agriculture, and the increased dominance of international food conglomerates. People all over the world now consume fewer and fewer types of plants and animal foods. Since the late 19th century, there has been an increasing global trend towards dietary simplification. Today, an estimated 12 crops and 14 animal species provide 98% of the world's dietary needs with wheat, rice and maize alone accounting for 50% of the global calories produced. In short, we have witnessed a massive dietary shift from diets that were primarily plant-based and characterised by high fibre and complex carbohydrates with small amounts of animal foods, to diets dominated by commodity crops such as soy and oil palm, high in fats and oils, meats and refined carbohydrates. Current methods of production also come at an increasingly high environmental cost. Agricultural expansion is responsible for 40% of permanent forest loss globally, notably for the production of commodities such as oil palm, soy, and cattle, among others. Up to 70% of the world's freshwater is appropriated to nourish crops and livestock, soil erosion and loss exceeds formation and agriculture accounts for almost one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also a system still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for fertiliser production and mechanisation. Commercial agriculture is pushing planetary boundaries to the extent it is profoundly unsustainable. The dietary and nutrition impacts of our current global food system are also significant. There were more than 800 million people who were classified as hungry before the COVID-19 pandemic while an estimated 2 billion people were overweight or obese. And many millions more suffer from micronutrient deficiencies from poor quality diets. The role of forests and tree-based landscapes Perhaps because of the heavy emphasis on staple crop production and monoculture agriculture in the last few decades, the role of forests and tree-based landscapes in contributing to global food security have been greatly under-estimated. Globally, it is estimated that an estimated one-third of the human population depends on forest goods and services such as food, wood fuel, medicines, employment and income. Yet, of the estimated net forest loss of 4.7 million hectares per year, 80% is the result of habitat loss to agriculture. The contribution of forests and trees to food security and nutrition has two main routes: direct and indirect. In terms of direct contributions, the harvest of wild meat, fruits and other food rich in micronutrients provide an invaluable component of rural diets, particularly for those households with less purchasing power. Research has shown that people living in the proximity of forests have more diverse and nutritious diets. The indirect contributions of forests and trees include the provision of essential ecosystem services that support food production. These include water regulation, soil protection, pollination, pest control, among others. Given this, it is no surprise that a significant proportion of the world's food is grown in complex, multi-functional landscapes dominated by forests, trees and other wild habitats. Forest resources that are marketable also provide income to purchase food items and inputs for small-scale agricultural production. Fodder for livestock and the provision of wood fuel for cooking and water purification are also important indirect contributions from forests and trees. In recent years, the evidence of the contributions of forests and trees to food security and nutrition has been mounting, culminating in two major policy processes. The first, published in 2015, was undertaken by the Global Expert Forest Panel of the International Union of Forestry Research Organisations (IUFRO) provides comprehensive \"evidence on how forests and tree-based landscape can be (and must be) an integral part of the solution to the global problem of food security and nutrition\". The second, released in 2017, was a global report commissioned by the United Nations Committee on World Food Security (CFS) which included consultations with the UN member countries. The report concluded that \"sustainable forestry is a key component of sustainable food systems\" and that, based on this key finding \"policy-relevant knowledge [should be developed] on the direct and indirect contributions of forests, trees and agroforestry to sustainable development and food security and nutrition\". The take-home messages on forests and food security and nutrition are essentially that: Diverse forest and tree-based production systems offer advantages over monocropping systems because of their adaptability and resilience. Forest and tree-based production systems most often contribute the diverse nutrient-rich foods that are often in short supply in the diets of the poor. There are a multitude of ecosystem services provided by forests and trees that simultaneously support food production, nutrition, sustainability as well as environmental and human health. Managing landscapes on a multi-functional basis in a way that integrates food production, biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of ecosystem services can contribute significantly to global food and nutritional security Forests and trees alone will not achieve global food security, but can play a major role: discourse has started to change. Policy reform and implementation to reflect this shifting paradigm now needs to take place. References Faculty of Forestry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.

The NHS released new information explaining that there would be a vaccine shortage in the UK from 29 March, meaning under-50s will wait longer for their first jab as second doses are given to the most vulnerable cohorts The memo released by the NHS yesterday (17 March) was sent to vaccination leaders across the country, to explain a \"significant reduction\" in AstraZeneca vaccines after 29 March. Those aged 49 and younger are now expected to receive their first jab in May. Until that day, vaccine availability is expected to go up from where it was last week - meaning this two week window will see more as many doses administered as possible. This means that second doses will be prioritised over first doses in April. The Department for Health and Social care said in a statement that \"we remain on track to offer a first vaccine to over 50s by 15 April and all adults by 31 July.\" However, those under-50 with medical condition should still come forward and register for the first dose. Over 25 million people in the UK have now been given their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Will your appointment be cancelled? No. If you have booked an appointment and been confirmed, that will still happen. If you are trying to book for April, those bookings are no longer available unless you are medically vulnerable or going for your second dose. Why is there a vaccine shortage in the UK? According to The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the Government became aware of the shortage only in the last 48 hours. The vaccine shortage issue for AstraZeneca doses appears to be connected to a larger problem in the international supply chain, which is apparently impacting every batch of vaccines apart from Pfizer. There is speculation that 10 million doses manufactured in India are the cause of this shortfall. Currently, AstraZeneca is 75% of the vaccines that have been given out so far - meaning any loss of availability will create a bigger impact than if Pfizer deliveries had been delayed. Some expected vaccine deliveries from AstraZeneca have therefore fallen through, meaning that the UK will have less doses available from 29 March. Yesterday, the EU said that Pfizer vaccines manufactured in Europe could be withheld from the UK if the expected deliveries of AstraZeneca were not received. This comes after two months of tension between the UK drugmaker and EU leaders, who will be receiving 60% less AstraZeneca vaccines than they ordered for Spring. Dr Eugene Durenard, CEO of Hyperbolic Holdings GmbH discusses promising emerging technologies in the field of early detection and prevention of major chronic diseases In our article for the January 2021 edition of Open Access Government, we discussed several inefficiencies in the global healthcare innovation landscape that were accentuated by the COVID crisis. Here, we point out technologies that should help address those inefficiencies and how they could potentially yield a much bigger benefit for the conduct of large preventive trials. We also give examples of some exciting technologies in early disease discovery and preventive interventions that Hyperbolic is involved with. Harmonising approvals In January, we highlighted that a major systemic improvement is needed in the harmonisation of regulatory approvals of drugs and devices between jurisdictions. This lack of harmonisation has direct consequences on increased time to market and pricing, and translates into longer waiting times and higher costs to patients. Putting in place such regulatory fungibility will directly benefit the population and increase incentives for cross-border sourcing of innovation. It will also help Biotech and MedTech companies by focusing their resources on perfecting their innovations rather than on repeating trials in different countries. Hyperbolic has initiated a project to address this issue by assembling a group of experts from the fields of regulation, policy-making strategy, industry, data integrity and health innovation. We expect to put in place some workable recommendations and pilots in the months to come. We think that the main technological input, needed to bring the basis of trust for data and process reproducibility is a distributed ledger technology able to tag and store unstructured data coming from the patient, lab and treatment process. Such technologies exist already and are ripe for scalable deployment. We are excited about this initiative because we expect the associated progress to additionally benefit another crucial area of public health -\u2014 prevention. From reaction to proaction Most key opinion leaders agree that catching diseases early and implementing interventions to slow down disease progress is key to better survival and a major factor in reducing the cost burden on health systems. Prevention is mediated by behaviour changes and is also dependent on regularly measuring the onset and severity of diseases. While a large bulk of innovation is still focused on the detection and treatment of existing diseases, Hyperbolic is involved in emerging technologies expected to play significant roles in the scaling-up of preventive interventions. We believe that the adoption of such technologies will be encouraged by health systems that find themselves in an even more stressful situation than before the COVID crisis. Technology in preventative trials Preventive trials are hard to implement. A major hurdle is the difficulty in recruiting enough participants and systematically collecting, for long periods, scientific evidence on outcomes. Hyperbolic is working with a client that optimises patient engagement and retention thanks to innovative personalisation and data collection technology. This enables preventative studies to be recruited faster and conducted with minimal attrition. A major G7 health system has just started using this approach for a preventative trial in women's health. The confluence of the distributed ledger technology with personalised patient engagement and data-collection technology, is, in Hyperbolic's opinion, the winning solution for conducting substantial preventative trials. If any systemic improvements were to emerge from the COVID hiatus, this one would be truly transformative for the future of global health. Some innovations in prevention Hyperbolic is involved with several innovations that we expect to become highly significant for the prevention of some non-communicable diseases. Cardiovascular Cardiovascular diseases are recognised to be the largest cause of death worldwide. Several preventive methodologies and recommendations have been developed such as healthy eating, exercise and cessation of smoking. People are generally stratified into risk groups determined from past population-wide outcomes. Such risk classification, however, does not indicate the actual severity of the person's disease, nor does it suggest an actual treatment plan to follow. A crucial innovation is to objectively measure the severity of CVD diseases for asymptomatic people in ways that lead to concrete preventative interventions and treatments. Hyperbolic is involved with a company that developed a CVD severity screening methodology based on a major multi-year trial. Its attractive health economics make the screening process affordable and scalable. We are working to expand the market reach of this methodology with select clinical partners. Metabolic Diabetes is another major chronic disease with estimates above 400 million afflicted people worldwide, plus a vast amount of pre-diabetics. Diabetes leads to a variety of co-morbidities, several of cardiovascular nature. Diets have become richer in added sugars at the expense of fibres. Endocrinologists agree that sugar over-consumption leads to an increased risk of diabetes. Nutrition scientists agree on the importance of dietary fibres for gut microbiome health, satiety, and reduction of obesity risk, all reducing diabetes risk. One of Hyperbolic's clients is a super-expanding natural fibre-based supplement that absorbs sugars from the meal and transports them to feed the gut microbiome. We are working with this very strong, scalable candidate for diabetes prevention in facilitating clinical trials and strategic distribution partnerships. Cancer Cancer causes one of the largest cost burdens on the global economy, estimated at around $1 trillion per year of lost output. The ability of cancers to re-programme their phenotypes leads to the problem of evasion from treatments. This ability increases with cancer maturity; hence specialists agree that detecting and treating cancers early is the only viable long-term solution. A recent deeper understanding of interplays between cancer and the immune system is opening a new paradigm for screening and therapy. Behind it stands a fundamentally new immune-signatures screening technology and therapeutic vaccines developed by one of Hyperbolic's clients. The key aspect of this technology is its ability to screen cancer early, and potentially treat it, both at a reasonable cost. This approach is also applicable to canine cancers and our client is conducting the largest veterinary oncology trial in the world. Hyperbolic is working with this platform technology to build strategic partnerships for its various applications. Conclusion We are passionate about engaging with opportunities in this exciting and dynamic innovation landscape. We believe that some lessons should be extracted from the COVID crisis to create a more efficient regulatory environment. We anticipate that technologies enabling early disease screening and prevention will continue to gain importance. Our team at Hyperbolic Holdings looks forward to hearing about your strategic and business needs concerning MedTech and Biotech innovation. We help innovators with business strategy and work with strategic investors on target sourcing, due diligence and deal-making. Professor Jess K. Zimmerman from the University of Puerto Rico, explains how natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, can affect the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) The Luquillo LTER project has pioneered a balanced approach in which the self-organising mechanisms of ecosystems are disrupted by periodic disturbances (e.g., hurricanes, landslides), on the one hand, and constrained by legacies and large-scale, slow-tempo environmental change (i.e., land use and global climate change) on the other. How do hurricanes affect forests of the LEF? In 1989, Hurricane Hugo devastated the LEF with wind speeds of 148 km h-1 and rainfall of 225 mm d-1. The forest canopy was heavily affected, and while the initial mortality of trees was relatively low at 7-9%, studies of delayed mortality showed that 30% of broken and 55% of uprooted stems died within 5 years after the storm. As devastating as the effects of Hurricane Hugo were, forest resilience was surprising. In a few months, the understory became alive with herbs and shrubs and newly recruited tree saplings. Some forest processes such as soil nutrient cycling and stream chemistry returned to near pre-hurricane levels quickly, exhibiting a high degree of resilience. Forest structure, stream-water exports of coarse particulate matter, and abundances of some plants and animals recovered slowly or never fully recovered their pre-Hugo values. However, resilience overall was high. Nine years later, another intense hurricane, Georges, provided the opportunity to compare the effects of different storms on forest structure and resilience. Hurricane Georges resulted in much less structural and compositional change, largely because the branch structure of the forest had not fully recovered from Hugo, reducing the effects of the second storm on the forest canopy and the amount of generated woody debris. Two hurricanes (Irma and Mar\u00eda) struck the LEF in close succession 2017. Hurricane Irma (September 7) passed to the north and had mild to moderate effects on the site. Hurricane Mar\u00eda (September 20), with strong, category 4 winds (248 km h-1 at landfall), passed near the LEF and caused widespread defoliation and significant alteration of forest and stream structure. Hurricane Mar\u00eda was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since hurricane San Felipe in 1928. Hurricane Mar\u00eda killed twice as many trees as Hurricane Hugo, and for all but two species, broke 2- to 12-fold more stems than Hurricanes Hugo or Georges. Because of Maria's strength, stem breakage was not related to tree species wood density, as was found for Hugo and Maria. Thus, even species with strong trunks are vulnerable to intense storms, which may influence the overall resilience of the forest to these kinds of events. How does disturbance affect biodiversity in the LEF? Studies of the effects of hurricanes on biodiversity in the LEF suggest that plant and animal populations are quite resilient to disturbance. Although the immediate effect of hurricanes is quite variable among different species, over time abundance of organisms seems to be quite stable. Moreover, overall species richness is not affected much by hurricanes. Changes in plant community composition after a hurricane tends to return to pre-hurricane conditions after about 60 years, in the absence of further disturbance. Because hurricanes have always been a part of the environment of the LEF, natural selection has eliminated those species that are unable to cope with a variable environment. Studies of hurricanes Hugo and Georges have shown that cyclonic storms alter physical and chemical characteristics of ecosystems but have relatively fewer effects on biological characteristics (e.g., species richness). How will climate change affect forests of the LEF? Our studies suggest that tropical ecosystems of the LEF are highly resilient to many disturbances, both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic in nature (Brokaw et al., 2012). We anticipate three principal changes wrought by a warming world. Warming itself may challenge species' physiological tolerances and alter species demography. Increased warming may also increase the frequency of intense hurricanes driven by the warmed waters of the North Atlantic and increase the frequency or length of dry periods, coupled with a change in the seasonality of rainfall. These last two changes suggest a world in which precipitation extremes become more common as extended dry periods are combined with more numerous heavy rainfall events. More fundamentally, we ask whether the range of conditions contemplated under the global change scenario for the Caribbean exceeds the historical range relevant to evolutionary time spans. Forests of the LEF have been subject to hurricane disturbance since at least the Last Glacial Maximum (Zimmerman et al. 2020). There is evidence that the frequency of intense tropical cyclone landfalls (between 250 and 1150 C.E) have exceeded current frequencies across the Caribbean over the last 2000 years. Similarly, periods of drying in the last 10,000 years may have created extinction filters favouring drought-tolerant species. Studies from the Pacific hurricane belt suggest that frequent cyclones result in forests with reduced stature but with demographic and trait dynamics similar to Caribbean forests that suffer little exposure to cyclonic storms. These results suggest future changes to LEF forests may result from selection for increases in the abundances of species most resistant to the changing climate or disturbance regime, without a distinct change in ecosystem function. Although the composition of the forest may change, the change may occur more gradually. We will be watching to see. In any case, the deep history of changing climate and disturbance regimes in the LEF likely explains the robust resilience to a disturbance in the LEF that we have witnessed in the last century of research.

The Food Web of a Julia Stuckey, Business & Economy Manager at Swindon Borough Council, discusses working with a diverse range of partners to help mitigate the impact of the closure of the Honda factory Swindon is a member of the 'Five Fast Growth City' network with a strong and diverse business network and growing population. Ideally situated between London, the West and Midlands, the electrified rail link to London means a sub-60 minute journey time. Honda purchased the aircraft production site in 1985, taking on previous Great Western Railway site workers. Only half the 370-acre site is developed which at peak, produced over 250,000 vehicles per year. The site closure was announced in February 2019. The Secretary of State for The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) established a National Taskforce to coordinate national activity and charged Swindon Borough Council with local coordination. The Council created a Honda & Supply Chain Coordinating Steering Group with five Task Groups of local and national partners. The Task Groups focus on supply chain support; career transition and training; community and well-being; future use of the sites and communication. \"We have been working with Honda and supply chain companies since the closure was announced 2 years ago, to ensure successful transition for staff into the next phase of their careers. Our role is to make sure our economy is as strong as it can be as we move out of the pandemic. We are investing hundreds of millions of pounds in infrastructure and regeneration, to create the right environment for businesses to create even more jobs on the site in the years to come.\"Councillor David Renard, Leader of Swindon Council and CO-Chair of the Honda National Task Force Honda employs 3,500 Associates. It also owns 3 local supply chain companies. With 15 other Tier 1 suppliers, local redundancy numbers in July 2021 could be 5,000. Other businesses will also be affected as they deliver secondary services. Swindon - the place for business Skills provision is strong with a new Institute of Technology and Universities of Bath, Oxford Brookes and the Royal Agricultural in situ. Digi-tech, advanced manufacturing, pharma manufacturing and professional and financial services are also growing. Swindon has over 9,200 businesses of every shape, size and type, across multiple sectors. Global names include BMW, Catalent; Intel, Nationwide Building Society; RWE NPower; Thermo Fisher and Zurich. A strong and growing network of innovative entrepreneurs and SMEs thrive here. Recovery partners Over 100 delivery partners including Government, other councils, the Swindon and Wiltshire Local Enterprise Partnership (SWLEP), training providers, business organisations, charities, religious leaders, residents. have offered help. Six months before closure The focus is on supporting staff with career transition as well as supporting their mental and financial wellbeing. \"The National Careers Service provides careers support to employees affected by the closure. We have delivered over 400 support sessions and worked with colleges and training providers to deliver retraining, and financial and wellbeing support and coaching in employability skills and job searching\".Maninder Hayre, Head of Delivery for National Careers Service in the South West and Oxfordshire Local employers have already employed Honda and supply chain staff with others waiting for the closure to recruit from this productive workforce. \"We worked with Honda's apprenticeship team to identify opportunities. We are proud to launch our apprenticeship programme with New College for formal qualifications in engineering and business skills. This allows employees of all ages to develop life-long skills whilst attaining valuable academic qualifications\".Penny Grobler Recycling Technologies \"Collaboration between Catalent and Honda showed staff the similarities between the two industry sectors. Many skills are transferable. The workers were very attentive and engaged and 26 of the 30 apprentices applied for positions with Catalent\".Peter Allen Catalent Pharma Solutions Honda owns the manufacturing site, so partners play a supporting role in securing its future use, sharing enquiries for this high-grade employment site. To add to its attraction, the SWLEP is funding transport and clean energy studies. Challenges The time between announcement and closure requires additional effort to keep stakeholders engaged, although the preparation time has been a benefit. Partners were surprised there was not more published from other similar situations, almost a guide against the diverse range of pitfalls when you are faced with a large business closure. Engaging Associates who have not looked for work whilst they are still employed takes time. We are working with other organisations, community and religious leaders to help 'spread the word'. \"Swindon has a proud history of building and rebuilding its industry to reflect changing times. Working together, Honda employees, supply chains, central and local government, will respond to the challenges we all face\".Paul Moorby OBE, Chair of the SWLEP and CO-Chair of the Honda National Task Force The COVID-19 pandemic challenges affected manufacturing production and pushed all training, consultation, and advice sessions online. Thankfully, technology has allowed most services to continue. \"Colleges and other training providers provide courses focussed on functional skills and industry courses to support Associates in their next steps. Industry specialists held drop-in sessions in a range of sectors to share skills and qualifications\". Paula Kimmel New College, Swindon Benefits of collaboration Coordinating national and local stakeholders requires resource and support, but the benefits far outweigh the effort. These include reduced duplication; agreeing key messages; sharing resources and information particularly where it avoids service bottlenecks. This promotes civic pride; preventing companies from being overwhelmed by offers of support; and countless others. It has not been an easy programme to coordinate, but probably one of the most rewarding. From public health and job creation to environmental sustainability and safer communities, the social and behavioural sciences empower people everywhere to find solutions, Dr Arthur Lupia & Jason Stoughton from the U.S. National Science Foundation explain Just a few months into a brand-new decade in 2020, the world was already reeling from a series of body blows: a deadly pandemic, a global economic crisis, disruptions to a wide range of social and educational institutions and climate change-fuelled extreme weather events. For each of those challenges, science and technology offer inventive potential remedies. Realising that potential, however, can be complicated by human factors. Specifically, how individuals and communities respond to potential remedies and how these remedies ultimately affect our well-being. Examples of this critical balancing act are all around us. Scientists can create effective vaccines with incredible speed and efficiency. But the potential societal value of those vaccines depends on how many people are willing to take them. The increasingly broad applications of artificial intelligence can spur new industries and opportunities. And yet, some applications can amplify our existing biases or impact opportunities for employment. The free-flowing exchange of information through social media and other digital platforms allows us immediate contact with our communities and others. Those same platforms helped give rise to the rapid spread of misinformation and mistrust. Whether the issue is health, the economy, education, climate or national security, the extent to which our decision-makers and leaders accurately understand the \"human factor\" will greatly influence whether attempts to help others ultimately succeed or fail. Fortunately, the precise and methodical exploration of the human factor is what social and behavioural scientists have been doing for decades. Discoveries and innovations created by scientists working in fields like social psychology and behavioural economics provide an increasingly broad and rigorous evidentiary basis for understanding how people think and behave. Given the nature and scale of humanity's current challenges, their work is more important today than ever before. Their advances and discoveries have led to many quality of life improvements that you've probably experienced firsthand, even if you didn't know that the idea originally came from scientific research. Their findings, our reality Unlike many other scientific discoveries, fundamental breakthroughs in social and behavioural science often become so embedded in practice or culture that we forget their scientific origins. The neurons in our brains and the dynamics in our groups are present in every human head and every workplace, boardroom, kitchen table and social media platform on the planet. Through the discoveries and insights of social and behavioural scientists, the some- times puzzling actions of people have been studied, quantified and understood to an incredible degree. Consider legendary psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. In the 1970s, they applied evidence from cognitive psychology to examine an idea broadly held at the time, that people behave in accordance with their own well-being when it comes to financial decisions. Spoiler: we often don't. You might suspect as much if you've read \"The Big Short\" about the 2007- 2008 financial crisis or more recently about the \"game- stonks\" phenomenon on Reddit. Kahneman and Tversky's discoveries revealed that our illogical behaviour can be identified and even predicted on a large scale. Their research has had broad applications and led many companies to change their business practices \u2014 such as how retirement plans are offered to employees. As a result of social and behavioural research, most companies now automatically include employees in their company-offered retirement plan. That was not always the case. Previously, employees typically had to opt-in to participate in a company-provided retirement plan. Even when companies offered \"free money\" in the form of matching contributions, many people did not choose to participate. In so doing, countless employees left real money on the table and put their financial futures at risk. The research of Kahneman, Tversky and others provided a scientific basis to understand this behaviour, predict it and create a solution: include employees by default but give them a choice to opt-out. That elegant scientific solution has benefited \u2014 and will continue to benefit \u2014 millions of families and communities around the world. The next time you look at the balance in your retirement account, remember that social and behavioural science helped you build that nest egg. Let's build it together In recent times, social and behavioural scientists \u2014 many supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation \u2014 have turned their skills to battling the COVID-19 pandemic. They are exploring how we can Working together allows us to better understand the human factors that so often determine whether an inventive remedy achieves the greatest possible good. By utilising all scientific disciplines and in partnership with private and public sector innovators, the social and behavioural sciences offer a path from our current circumstances to a future that expands opportunity and improves quality of life for people all over the world. We can build that future together. Siemens provides a perspective on being smarter, safer and more connected when it comes to what's the 'next normal' for our building technology, including comment on energy consumption Before the pandemic, we spent roughly 90% of our lives in buildings. It sounds like a staggering statistic, but when you start to interrogate it, it perhaps doesn't seem that high. We're born in hospitals, spend our childhoods in homes and schools, then head to colleges and universities and begin our working lives in offices. In 2021, the role of buildings is changing. This has been accentuated by the pandemic, our national decarbonisation targets, and the changing face of the future of work. Building owners must ask themselves, is my building safe enough for employees to return to? Is it energy efficient? And is it flexible enough to deliver high productivity with potentially low occupancy? Smart buildings hold the answers to these questions. A smart building intelligently prioritises safety, productivity, and sustainability, reducing costs for owners, increasing the wellbeing and productivity of its occupants, and directly benefits the environment through intelligent energy usage. Why smart means sustainable Buildings are responsible for about 36% of global energy consumption and 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions over their life cycle and they are a key factor in the transition to a sustainable future. The smart office decreases a building's consumption through intelligent building controls and incentivises users to reduce their individual consumption. For example, a building management system that is installed to the Class A guidelines (BS EN15232) can deliver up to 30% energy savings compared to one which meets a Class C standard. Our research has found that 54% of employees will opt not to return to offices in the future. Lower levels of occupancy will inevitably create energy challenges for building owners. Intelligent fixture management helps switch off lighting, heating, and ventilation in unoccupied areas of the office. By learning the behaviour patterns of users, the smart office knows when to start heating or ventilating spaces to avoid peaks in energy use when people begin entering the office each day. Through the use of desk and workspace booking in the smart office app, the building applies intelligent space management to ensure users fully book spaces on one floor first before spreading to the next. With an optimised mix of distributed energy resources, including renewable energy from solar panels or small wind turbines, and energy storage solutions such as batteries or hydrogen, the smart office generates its own electricity and optimises what it takes from the grid. With our electricity grid becoming smarter, buildings play a huge part in what's called demand-side response. When peak demand rises at key times in the day, power stations would usually provide more capacity onto the grid to meet the demand. However, smart buildings can work with the grid to lower their heating and lighting requirements - industrial fridges could be lowered by 1 degree, lights turned off, or the air conditioning altered. The cumulative effect of thousands of smart buildings at the grid edge reducing consumption could negate the need for additional power, balancing the grid more intelligently. A smart building with people at the heart A smart office ensures that productivity measures are built-in, placing each user at the heart of their own personalised experience. But while many of our customers are quick to fit traditional temperature sensors, few fully realise the huge benefits afforded to humidity sensors. For instance, if the relative humidity is kept between 40-60%, then the spread of cold and flu viruses can be reduced by up to 70%. Likewise, internal air quality can be maintained by either measuring CO2 levels or VOCs (volatile organic compound) levels. High CO2 levels in buildings with poor ventilation have been proven to make employees feel sluggish and unable to concentrate, dramatically lowering productivity. Aside from viruses, bugs and germs in an office, the building must meet a fundamental requirement to keep its occupants safe from fire. However, more than 75% of automatically generated fire alarms in the UK are false or unwanted. The Fire Industry Association estimate that these such false alarms cost the UK over \u00a31 billion in public funding every year. Smarter, multi-sensor detectors can sample a combination of different fire indicators, including heat, smoke, carbon monoxide and light. Individually, these are unreliable markers, but a device that can sense some or all of them is far more accurate. These intelligent devices are more discerning and slower to react to false stimuli such as steam or smoking toast, without compromising the speed of reaction to real fire threats. Flexibility is the next normal for smart buildings As we look further ahead to life beyond the pandemic, the 'next normal' will be a period defined by flexibility. Digital planning of the office space enables quick reaction to changing needs. COVID-19 forced firms all over the world to redesign office layouts to accommodate physical distancing requirements, implement health and safety procedures and install new technologies to be able to return to the office. However, it's not only external shocks, but also changing internal needs that can trigger a desire to reconfigure the office - team sizes and work focus change, and more project and innovation spaces than usual may be required. To increase space efficiency, the smart office relies on the insights generated from the building twin. Are there spaces nobody ever uses? Are more quiet working spaces needed because existing ones are always full? What are the routes most people take to get to the kitchen? Where do people have the most interactions? From the data collected, stakeholders can jointly derive improvement measures. You can have any colour building you like, as long as it's green The future of work, decarbonisation, productivity, and personal wellbeing will all involve our ability to rethink, reshape and reboot our portfolio of buildings in the UK. The vision is for a network of buildings that ensure that when we return to our offices, we're in the safest, most productive, and sustainable environments possible. Racial prejudice, fuelled by poor coping mechanisms and biased social media consumption, has shaped how the US public view Asian Americans during the pandemic The study by Ohio State University suggests that there are three reasons, which supplement one another. Racial prejudice, poor coping ability and highly partisan media viewing leading to an online echo chamber are the three reasons that people of Asian descent have been demonised during the pandemic. But results showed that it was racial prejudice that was the leading cause of this ongoing blame. Former President Donald Trump regularly and continuously refers to the COVID-19 virus as the \"China Virus\", also publicly promoting conspiracies theories via Twitter that suggest the virus was purposefully engineered in a lab. This has been debunked several times. This isn't the first time this issue has existed. In fact, many individuals associate particular diseases with a group of people, such as Irish Catholics are responsible for \"Irish disease\" (cholera), Jewish immigrants for \"consumption\" (tuberculosis), Irish and German immigrants for yellow fever, and Italians for polio. In times of great uncertainty and fear, it is easier to align the blame with a singular group of people who are perceived to be outside of your community. This is known as scapegoating, which has been a tactic for political leaders for hundreds of years. Giving a disturbed population a target has always resulted in the dehumanisation of the targeted group, and distraction away from policy-making decisions. A similar situation unfolded in India earlier on this year, as Muslims were blamed for the spread of COVID-19 in partnership with negative stereotypes. \"It was striking that this general prejudice against Asian Americans appeared to play a powerful role in the stigmatization of this group in the specific context of COVID-19,\" said Hyunyi Cho, lead author of the study and professor of communication at The Ohio State University. Blaming Asian people for the pandemic The UN recently reported that there had been more than 1800 racist incidents against Asian Americans from March to May 2020, according to research conducted by Stop AAPI Hate. \"All Asian Americans are being hit hard by the groundswell of anti-Asian rhetoric promoted by our president, but youth are particularly vulnerable,\" said Dr. Russell Jeung, Professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University. \"The hate Asian-American youths are facing could cause irreparable damage to their self-identity and social relationships. The Youth Campaign taught our youth how to disarm hate through conducting research, analyzing data, and advocating for policies that will improve their lives.\" The organisation, Stop AAPI Hate, has been conducting extensive research on hate crimes and an increasingly hostile attitude from wider society. One of their reports examines the attitudes of young Asian Americans toward the changing attitudes. An anonymous 13 year old commented: \"I feel scared to let my grandparents go out in fear that they may be harassed. I feel anger and confusion since society has normalized it so much that when we try to speak up about it, people still try and joke around about it.\" The Ohio State University study Findings were published online recently in the journal Ethnicity and Health. The study comes in the wake of other evidence of prejudice against Asian Americans linked to COVID-19, a virus that was first identified in the Wuhan province of China. An April poll of Americans found that one-third had seen someone blaming Asian people for the pandemic. \"We wanted to see what could explain people of Asian descent being stigmatized for this virus,\" Cho said. The researchers conducted a nationwide survey of 842 American adults between May 11 and May 19. Stereotypes about Asian Americans Participants were asked a variety of questions about COVID-19 and how they have been impacted and coped with the pandemic's effects, media use, their views of Asian Americans, and other related issues. Overall, stereotypical racial beliefs about Asians and envy about the success of some Asian Americans in society were most linked to stigmatisation. \"It turned out that the stereotypes and beliefs that people already had about Asian Americans were more powerful in predicting stigmatization than other factors we studied,\" said Wenbo Li, study co-author and doctoral candidate in communication at Ohio State. \"That is what was most surprising to me.\" More fear about COVID-19, more likely to blame Asian Americans But other factors did play a role, such as how people were coping with the pandemic. People who reported higher levels of fear about COVID-19 were more likely to stigmatise. The same went for those who felt most harmed by the pandemic and also reported lower levels of ability to deal with the crisis. As in many issues in the United States today, ideology played a role in stigmatisation. One example was where people got their news. Findings showed that people who reported more viewing of COVID-19 news on Fox News and social media outlets were more likely to blame Asian Americans and see them as a disease risk than those who got their news from CNN or MSNBC and didn't consume as much social media. In addition, people who believed the Trump administration was doing a good job responding to the pandemic crisis were more likely to report prejudicial views about Asian Americans. \"We saw evidence in our results that stigmatization of Asian Americans because of COVID-19 can have a political and ideological aspect,\" Cho said. How can this ongoing stigmatisation be changed? But some findings suggested ways to help reduce the stigmatisation aimed at people of Asian descent, Cho and Li said. For example, results showed that people who reported watching more foreign language movies showed less prejudice. \"Being exposed to other cultures, even through media like movies and TV, can help mitigate stereotypes,\" Cho said. Most importantly, lower stigmatisation was found in people who reported higher levels of what researchers call \"collective efficacy.\" People high in collective efficacy strongly agreed with statements like \"I feel that Americans can work together to effectively overcome the current COVID-19 crisis.\" \"Finding ways to foster collective efficacy can be an antidote to divisive communication on partisan cable television and social media,\" Li said. In essence, being highly responsible about publishing news that is accurate and unbiased can go a long way, especially to inform people who have little contact with racial minorities in their day-to-day life. This is their key point of information, which they are unlikely to challenge when they consume similar social media content. The researchers said they believe this study has implications beyond Asian Americans and COVID-19. \"It is Asian Americans who are targeted in COVID-19. But in another crisis, it may be a different group,\" Cho said. \"It is about how people make sense of crises like this pandemic and how biases and prejudices can be exacerbated in situations "}
