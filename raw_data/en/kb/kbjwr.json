Luckily, you can instead opt for what's sitting in your medicine cabinet or pantry and use [home remedies for clear skin](http://www.rd.com/health/beauty/home-remedies-for-acne/). Some natural products that you already may have at home can do the job just as well as a fancy face wash, and it can't hurt to try these solutions first, as they are natural and won't cost you a dime. For some people, their skin isn't that bad and doesn't require a dermatologist,\" says [dermatologist Debra Jaliman](http://www.drjaliman.com/) over email. \"Home remedies are simple and inexpensive.\" Of course, if you have severe or persistent acne, it's always best to visit a dermatologist to figure out the best course of treatment for you. But if you've got a pimple or two that pops up here and there, you may just want to open a cabinet instead of taking a trip to the doctor's office. If you want to clear up your skin without any medications or special creams, try these 10 natural remedies that you likely already have at home. 1. Tea Tree Oil \"Tea tree oil contains anti-microbial properties that kill bacteria,\" says Jaliman. A study from the Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprology found that 5 percent tea tree oil [was effective at treating mild to moderate acne](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314442). 2. Green Tea Extract \"A study showed reduced acne in adolescents with mild acne when applying a 2 percent green tea extract twice a day,\" says Frey. [Green tea contains antioxidants that can help protect skin](http://www.webmd.com/beauty/skin/20000817/green-tea-could-be-good-for-your-skin-study-finds) and fight against free radicals, according to WebMD. 3. Aloe Vera The plant isn't just good for soothing sunburns \u2014 it can help clear up acne as well. \"A study on 60 acne patients who were also using tretinoin ( a prescription anti-acne medication) fared better when they also applied 50 percent aloe vera gel for 8 weeks compared to those who used tretinoin alone,\" says [dermatologist Fayne L. Frey, MD, FAAD](http://www.fryface.com/) over email. 4. Honey Honey can not only help lock in moisture in the skin, but [it can prevent breakouts and infections from bacteria](http://www.livestrong.com/article/112833-benefits-honey-skin-care/), as it has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, according to Livestrong. 5. Coconut Oil \"Coconut oil is a wonderful treatment for dry irritated skin and eczema on the body, but it can cause blocked pores on the face,\" says [dermatologist Heather D. Rogers, MD](https://mdinseattle.com/#medical-surgical-and-aesthetic-dermatology) over email. If you have dry skin, you can try coconut oil to moisturize your face, but if you are more sensitive, you might want to stick to using it only on the rest of your body. 6. Castor Oil \"Castor oil is less likely to cause blocked pores, as it can be used a gentle oil cleanser or eye make remover,\" says Rogers. Castor oil contains a compound called undercylenic acid, [which helps to disinfect the skin and kill bacteria](http://www.livestrong.com/article/173986-uses-of-castor-oil-on-the-face/) that cause skin conditions such as acne, says Livestrong. 7. Aspirin Aspirin's active ingredient, acetyl salicylic acid, [has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties](http://www.medicaldaily.com/aspirins-health-and-beauty-hacks-6-little-known-uses-common-pain-reliever-298596) that help treat pimples, according to Medical Daily. Applying aspirin topically can can reduce swelling, unclog pores, and even soften your skin. 8. Chamomile Chamomile is an [anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and mild astringent](https://www.bustle.com/articles/used%20to%20treat%20inflammations%20of%20the%20skin%20and%20mucous%20membranes), according to a review published in the Molecular Medicine Reports. It's especially used to treat inflammations of the skin. 9. Lemon Lemon and other citrus fruits contain alpha hydroxy acid. \"This natural acid found in citrus fruit acts as an exfoliant, removes the superficial cells from skin, and may decrease clog pore formation (an initial step in acne development),\" says Frey. Although most of these at-home remedies are mild, proceed with caution and test a small area of skin before applying anything in full strength to a large area, suggests Frey. "}
