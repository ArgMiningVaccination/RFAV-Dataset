It is natural to feel fear during and after a traumatic situation. Fear triggers many split - second changes in the body that help defend against or avoid danger. This \"fight or flight\" response is a typical response to protect a person from injury. Almost everyone experiences a range of reactions after trauma, but most people recover naturally from the initial symptoms. Those who continue to have problems may be diagnosed with PTSD. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or scared even when they are not in danger. (NIMH \u00bb Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder nih.gov) First Responders who suffer from secondary traumatic stress and substance problems often find it difficult to admit what 's happening and ask for help. Several factors help explain this reality including: The desire to maintain an appearance of professional invulnerability The desire to maintain the confidence needed to act in emergency situations The fear of not measuring up to the expectations of being a first responder Fear of the cultural stigma that can come from admitting to the presence of mental health problems Fear of experiencing workplace repercussions for mental health issue and/or substance use Why is dealing with PTSD so difficult? It's hard to understand why your family member or friend with PTSD is so volatile and hard to get along with. It 's also common to feel anger to- wards your loved one, and frustration about how their PTSD is changing and affecting the entire family. Perhaps your loved one is going through one of the consequences of PTSD such as drug or alcohol abuse or job loss. There 's no doubt it: PTSD takes a heavy toll on relationships. Strong alone.

Northern De: 800-969-4357 Southern DE 800-345-6785 SELF - COMPASSION Self-compassion is the extension of self-compassion in cases of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general suffering. By definition, self -compassion consists of three main elements: Self-kindness Common humanity Mindfulness Self-compassion also includes an element of wisdom \u2014 an acknowledgment of our common humanity. It means accepting the fact that we, along with everyone else on the planet, have flaws and are imperfect beings. We will get hit by the slings and arrows of outrageous (but perfectly normal) misfortune. It sounds obvious, but it's funny how easily we forget. We fall into the trap of believing that things are \"supposed\" to go well, and that when we make a mistake or a problem arises, something must have gone terribly wrong. (https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/ the_five_myths_of_self_compassion) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self -compassion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self -compassion 5 MYTHS OF SELF -COMPASSION 1. Self - compassion is a form of self - pity 2. Self - compassion means weakness 3. Self - compassion will make one complacent 4. Self - compassion is narcissistic 5. Self - compassion is selfish When we deal with trauma with gentle self -care, our hearts open. Compassion engages our capacity for love, wisdom, courage, and generosity. It is a mental and emotional state that is limitless and directionless, based on the great spiritual traditions of the world, but accessible to every human being simply by virtue of being human. Mental health includes emotional, psychological and social well -being. It affects how we think, feel, act, make decisions and relate to others. Mental health is more than the absence of mental illness - it is essential to your overall health and quality of life. Self -care can play a role in maintaining your mental health Self -care looks different for everyone, and it's important to find what you need and what you enjoy. It may take trial and error to find what works best for you. Furthermore, self -care provides us with an understanding as to what causes or triggers symptoms and what coping techniques Self -care means taking time to do things that help you live a good life and improve your physical and mental health. When it comes to your mental health, self -care can help you manage stress, reduce your risk of disease, and increase your energy. Even small acts of self -care in your daily life can have a big impact. Here are some tips to help you get started with self - care: Get regular exercise. Just 30 minutes of walking every day can help boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don 't be discouraged if you can 't do 30 minutes at one time.
