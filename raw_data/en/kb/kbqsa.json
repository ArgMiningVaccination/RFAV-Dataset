We hope you are having a restful break! While you've only been away from campus for a week or so, we are already excited to welcome you back after the holidays. As you get ready to return to campus, we want to share important updates about COVID-19 as well as mental health and wellness. More information will be coming the week of December 27 so be sure to keep an eye out for that as well. COVID-19 Updates We continue to track the impact of COVID-19 and the rise of the omicron variant in our community. As Santa Clara County Public Health notes, [cases are increasing across the country](https://covid19.sccgov.org/news-releases/pr-12-16-2021-omicron-variant-rise-globally-and-us-two-shots-are-not-enough-anymore-and-getting). With that in mind, we will be making some adjustments to start the winter 2022 term: - Classes will still start on January 3, although faculty have the flexibility to offer some courses online or in a hybrid format for that first week. Law school classes will continue to be in person and start on January 10, as previously scheduled. Please pay close attention to any communications from your faculty. - COVID-19 boosters are required as soon as you are eligible. You should get your booster as soon as possible and must upload your updated vaccination information into the Cowell Center | My Student Health Portal by March 17, 2022. If you already received a University-approved exemption, this does not apply to you. - Regardless of your vaccination status, testing for COVID-19 is expected before arriving back on campus. If you test positive during the winter break, please observe all [isolation protocols and precautions](https://www.scu.edu/preparedscu/health-and-safety/isolation--quarantine-guidelines/?utm_source=T4&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=week-10-roundup&utm_source=Prepared-SCU-Weekly-Roundup&utm_medium=email&utm_term=&utm_campaign=), and only return to campus after you complete your 10-day isolation period. ALL students are required to [get tested using Color twice during Week 1](/preparedscu/testing-protocol/) of the winter term (spring semester for Law School). Masks will still be required indoors. - Dining will be grab-and-go for the first week of the winter term to reduce the potential of community spread, and social distancing will be required in large venues such as the University Library and Malley Center. - All public events will continue, but participants need to follow event requirements and show proof of vaccination or negative test results (PCR lab test results within 72 hours or rapid antigen test within 24 hours). You play a key role in keeping the campus safe and helping us offer classes and activities in person. Make sure to get tested, get a booster, wear a mask, wash your hands, and follow all other prevention measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Student Mental Health and Wellness You have been through a lot this year. We see and hear you, and we have been hard at work to increase access to mental health resources and create additional ways for all of us to stay connected (while still staying safe during the COVID-19 pandemic). Here's just a quick snapshot of what you can expect when you return: - Every student has access to [At Risk Mental Health for Students](https://kognito.com/products/at-risk-for-college-students), a brief online course that focuses on skills to support your mental health.
