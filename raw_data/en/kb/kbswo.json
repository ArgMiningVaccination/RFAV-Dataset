Seems to have worked. No side effects from the vaccine. Apply it to fur as also putting it in the food. So grateful for this product! How do you give your cats drops in their mouths? I have 2 kittens and having to give them ring worm medicine and it's quite difficult. I tried giving them homeopathic sulphur which just tastes like water and they don't want anything put in their mouths. I have used this remedy for several years. Detoxes vaccines that otherwise cause skin rashes and other side effects of vaccines Always used thuja for vaccine detox with great success but wanted to give this a try. Won't be using it for a few mons. when my fur baby will get her rabies vac. Since I've had good results with your other flower essence products I believe this will also work. "}
