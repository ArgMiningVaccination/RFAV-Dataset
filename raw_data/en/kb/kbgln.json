The jurisdictional surveys that ar e included cover countries from six continents and reflect national, regional (European Uni on, EU), and international (World Health Organization, WHO) approaches to the problem. The report is supplemented by an annotated bibliography that lists recently published English-language monographs and academic articles on issues related to handling public health crises. All surveys in cluded in this report review government structures tasked with delivering public health protection, relevant legislative frameworks for addressing health emergencies, and the powers of government institutions in times of health crises and their ability to mitigate the consequences of such crises. Analyses of the regulation of such issues as disease surveillance and notifica tion systems are also provided. Individual surveys discuss the role of medical and emergency services personnel in responding to public health challenges, the coordination of government activities aimed at minimizing the spread of epidemics, and the cooperation of nati onal health-care institu tions with the WHO in implementing pandemic preparedness measures. Measures taken by national governments in response to recent outbreaks of infectious diseas es, including the Ebola epidemic in western Africa in 2014, are also described. I. Introduction All the countries surveyed recognize the existence of a threat to public health from a variety of infectious diseases, mass illnes ses resulting from technological catastrophes or the malicious distribution of viruses, and the po tential use of chemical and biol ogical weapons by terrorists. All the reviewed jurisdictions appear to be aware of the importance of maintaining national health care infrastructures to co mbat public health crises and readily available communications systems that inform the public on prepare dness plans and serve as clearinghouses for crisis information. In addition to the national governments, the WHO pe rforms a critical role in confronting health crises. The WHO coordinates international health work a nd provides technical and policy assistance to national governments and medical authorities in support of programs to promote health, prevent and control health problems, c ontrol or eradicate diseases, and strengthen national health systems. It also keeps comm unicable and noncommunicable diseases and other health problems under constant surveillance, sets safety standards, issues regulations that are binding on member states, collects and dissemina tes health data, and carries out statistical analyses and comparative studies concerning various diseases. The EU survey reflects measures aimed at improving the coordination of Member States' actions. While public health emergencies occurri ng within the EU fall primarily within the *This comparative summary was originally prepared by Giovanni Salvo and Karel Wennink, former Foreign Law Specialists, in August 2003; it was updated for the purposes of the present report. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 2 domain of the individual Member States, the lega l acts of the EU pertaining to public health complement the national policies of the EU memb ers, coordinate their actions, and facilitate communication and the exchange of informati on among Member States. Addressing existing deficiencies in managing health crises, the EU has passed new legislatio n expanding the list of threats beyond communicable diseas es to include biological, chemical, environmental, and other events that may pose a risk. Three newly establ ished institutions demonstrate the EU's response to health care challenges that emerged with recent epidemics and terrorist attacks: the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, mode led after the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Early Warning a nd Response System; and the Health Security Committee, which developed into a full-fledged in stitution in charge of information exchange and response planning from an informal discussion forum on public threats. The Nordic states take a regi onal approach toward tackling h ealth crises th rough cooperative preparedness efforts. These countries have mutu al obligations to help each other when necessary and may send their patients to other countries for better treatment. The Baltic states likewise take special actions against contagious diseases jointly. In another example of the regional approach toward managing health care emergenc ies, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), together with China and Japan, adopted a joint resolution on standard border controls in 2003 during the SARS (Sever e Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic to counter the spread of the disease, and also distributed standardized health declaration cards to all travelers at airports. In 2009, following the A/ H1N1 (swine flu) virus epidemic, and in 2014, because of the Ebola virus threat, national gove rnments issued guidelines and took measures similar to those suggested by the US Center s for Disease Control and Prevention, another example that demonstrates the increasing in terconnectedness of health care management authorities in various countries. II. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management Systems In the countries surveyed, the sy stem s of health care and health crisis management are governed by statutory and regulatory measures that reflec t general constitutional principles concerning the protection of the public and the heal th of an individual. Responsib ilities for dealing with health crises are distributed among the central or fe deral governments and re gional and municipal authorities to prevent, monitor, and respond to public health emergencies. This distribution prevails regardless of the cause of the heal th emergency. In the case of terrorism, the intervention of other government authorities may be required. In Germany the legislative power for public health remains with the states; how ever, the German Federation has concurrent legislative power over measures to combat most public health threats. Decision-making powers and the authority to declare emer gencies appear to be concentrat ed in the hands of specified officials, who are assisted by civil servants from the agencies involved. The participation and cooperation of different agencies and of special units, if they exist, appear to be a common feature in the countries surveyed where the minister responsible fo r health issues plays a leading role. The appointment of a sp ecial commissioner may be an op tion in certain cases. Reporting systems for notifiable diseases have b een widely adopted so that authorities with decision-making powers can monitor the situation in order to take the appropriate measures. Almost every country reviewed ha s its own classification of infect ious and contagious diseases, Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 3 depending on disease severity, as well as relevant national action plans to respond to an outbreak of such diseases. III. Power s of Public Health Authorities In the m ajority of the countries surveyed, the Ministry of Health is the central authority in public health crises and takes appropriate emergency measures to c onfront such crises. In many countries, separate agencies d ealing with epidemic surveillan ce and sanitary control are subordinated to the Ministry of Health for the duration of a cris is. While in the majority of the countries reviewed such agencies are usua lly responsible for planning, coordinating, and implementing the response to a crisis, in some countries (e.g., Brazil and Russia) they have the actual power to mobilize resources. In Canada, th e Prime Minister and provincial premiers have the authority to declare emergencies for all types of crises, including public health crises. In England, the Secretary of State ha s broad powers with respect to a health crisis. The power to proclaim a state of emergency is vested in the president in Nigeria and Kenya, according to their constitutions. In several countries, depending on the type of health crisis, other de partments (such as the Departments of Agriculture, Justice, Interior, an d Environment), in coopera tion with the Ministry of Health, may be involved in the decision-making process. This cooperation is often in addition to the involvement of other agencies' special units, where existing. Public hea lth services at any level are primarily entrusted with the bulk of the measures needed to prevent and control a health crisis. These measures are often preventive in na ture, including the power to enter private homes and coercive powers to carry out precautionary measures, including the right to quarantine infected individuals, conduct ma ndatory inoculations, and ex amine and monitor diseased persons. In Japan, provincial governors may order th e hospitalization of pa tients, whereas the report on England indicates that public authoritie s do not have the power to force a quarantined, diseased person to undergo treatment. A number of reports point out th at during a simultaneous outbreak of an infectious disease in several countries, as was the case with SARS in 2003, avian flu in 2005, and the A/H1N1 virus in 2009, or when a threat comes from a disease outbreak outside of the country, as during the 2014 Ebola epidemic, health author ities can impose stricter contro ls on travelers coming from high-risk areas and require air carriers to provide detailed inform ation regarding their passengers' itineraries. Heath authorities exercise control with the help of health questionnaires, sanitary monitoring, and the mandatory hospitalizati on of infected persons. Measures necessary to curb a public health crisis may include comp ulsory health procedures, such as vaccinations, disinfection, quarantine, a nd travel restrictions . Most of the reports illustrate that measures taken during health crises are, in many instances, in co nflict with the constitutional and legal rights of individuals, such as those concerning the in violability of person and home, freedom of movement, the use of property, peac eful assembly, and the ability to conduct business. In most of the surveyed countries, the constitution perm its intrusions into these constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights to the extent that the intrusive measur es are specifically authorized in statutory provisions and are in th e public interest, such as for the protection of public health. In Brazil, the govern ment may issue a compulsory licen se for the use of a patent if a patent holder does not comply with a request fo r its use, in order to secure the reserve of medicines needed to fight a public health crisis. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 4 The failure to comply with measures taken in a crisis generally results in administrative or criminal sanctions. Medical personnel who fail to provide assistance in emergency health situations, or to act on or report a case, may be more severely pe nalized. These sanctions are not only set forth in the body of the legislation au thorizing the specific m easures, but are also included in the criminal codes of a majority of the countries surveyed. IV. Trans parency of Public He alth Crisis Management System Recognizing that a well-inform ed public is better prepared to deal with an emergency and minimize its impact, education and the disclosure of public health information appear to be important components of the response to public h ealth crises. The need for transparency is emphasized in many of the surveys. The duty to supply information concerning public health finds its basis (with some exceptions) in the countries' constitutions or special laws. V. Cooperation with the WHO Recognizing the im portant role of the WHO in helping its Member States to confront and overcome health crises, the countri es surveyed generally cooperate with the WHO. All of the countries have agreed to implement the WHO In ternational Health Regu lations of 2005 and are making efforts to comply with the requireme nts prescribed by that document. The Law Library of Congress 5 Argentina Graciela Rodriguez-Ferrand Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY The strengthening of Argentina's Epidemic Surveillance System h as been a government priority for the last fifteen years and, although the public health in the country at large has improved, many more resources need to be devoted to reach a higher level of health, especially regarding epidemic prevention and cont rol. In 2002 the declaration of a health emergency required the adoption of urgent measures to ensure the supply of medicines to the population. Following the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico in April 2009, the government declared a health emergency, taking immediate action to ensure the supply of medicines to the population. The current alert on the Ebola virus outbreak is under strict surveillance by health authorities in the country, who are following the World Health Organization's international epidemiology protocols. I. Government Structure Argentina 's political organization was established by the National Constitution1 as a Federal Republic consisting of twenty-three provinces and the autonomous city of Buenos Aires. The federal state is headed by a President, who a ppoints a cabinet and holds the country's executive power. The legislative power is exercised by a bicameral Congress with a Lower Chamber (C\u00e1mara de Diputados) and an Uppe r Chamber (C\u00e1mara de Senadores). Under the National Constitution, each province has its own provincial constitution, legislation, and resolutions. However, provincial legislatio n may not violate any of the individual rights protected under the National Constitution. The provinces have delegated to the federal legislature the power to enact laws of na tional scope governing civil, commercial, and other matters.2 Although not stated explicitly, the National Cons titution guarantees the right to health as a derivative of the right to life.3 Several provisions al so guarantee the right to health, including the right to a healthy environment,4 the right of consumers to the protection of their health,5 and in a broader sense, the right to protect collective rights.6 The constitutional guarantee of health 1 CONSTITUCI\u00d3N DE LA NACI\u00d3N ARGENTINA , Dec 15, 1994, http://infoleg.mecon. 4999/804/norma.htm Jurisprudencial 1234 4 Constituci\u00f3n de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina art. 41, para. 1. 5 Id. art. 42, para. 1. 6 Id. art. 43, para. 2. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Argentina The Law Library of Congress 6 protection may be defined as the ri ght of all individuals to be protected by th e state with regard to the prevention and treatment of dis eases and the maintenance of health.7 II. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management System The health system has a decentralized stru cture where many responsibilities have been transferred to the provinces. The Law on Ministries of 1999,8 as amended by Decree 355/2002,9 restructured the Ministry of Health (MH), cr eating two new subdivisions : the Secretariat for Health and Care and the Secretariat for Health Policy and Regulation. The Secretariat for Health and Care has an office of the Undersecretary of Prevention and Prom otion Programs, which comprises the National Directorate of Health Programs and the Directorate of Epidemiology (DE). Under the Law on Ministries, the MH is assigned th e responsibility of assisting the President in all health matters, including executing plans, programs, and projects related to health; medical aspects of immigration and the defense of borders, ports , airports, and international means of transportation; coordinating national, provincial, and municipal health services; participating in the control of food safety in coordination with the Ministry of Production; intervening in the assignment and control of s ubsidies to solve health emergencies, either unforeseen or not covered by the system in place; preparing health statistics and ensuring acce ss to health information for the population; developing epidemiology research studies to improve the efficiency and quality of health services; managing international health relations, not only with other countries, but also with international health organizations; planning health campaigns to eradicate endemic diseases, rehabilitate the ill, and detect and prevent nontransmissible diseases; epidemic control and surveillance, including the management of the disease notification system; planning national vaccination a nd immunization programs; and 7 SABSAY AND MANILI , supra note 3, at 1235. 8 Law 25233, Law of Ministries, Dec. 10, 1999, http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/60000- 64999/61394/norma.htm (in Spanish). 9 Decree 355/2002, amending Law 25,233, Law of Ministries, Feb. 21, 2002, http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infoleg Internet/anexos/70000-74999/72483/texact.htm (in Spanish). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Argentina The Law Library of Congress 7 establishing integrated programs to cover specific pathologies affecting groups determined to be at risk because of their geographic location.10 In the provinces, health services are provided by a network of provincial prim ary and secondary care services and by the private sector. The MH establishes basic regulati ons for the delivery of health services and the operation of health facil ities, but most provinces also have an extensive set of regulations. The MH is represented in each province through a Federal Health Council, which constitutes the link between the nation al MH and the provinces in all health- related matters. 11 The Federal Health Plan 2010-2016, released by th e MH, provides for general guidelines on public health in the country. However, the guid elines are only indicators, since provinces have autonomy in setting their own hea lth policies for the pr otection of their popul ation. The Federal Health Council, which is made up of the mini sters of health of all the provinces and municipalities in the country, facilitates the coor dination of health policie s and services between the National Health Authority and the provinces. 12 In 2011, the MH and the Ministry of Planning signed an agreement to integrate hospitals, primary health care centers, integrated comm unity centers, and other health care centers throughout the country into the National Fiber Optics Network, 13 which became operative in August 2014.14 III. Powers of Public Health Authorities The DE and its National Epidemiological Surveill ance System are responsible for the registration of diseases subject to obligatory reporting, as established by Law 15465. 15 The Law includes a list of diseases that is updated periodically as needed.16 The reporting is required not only in confirmed cases but also in suspected cases.17 Physicians and veterinarians and, when applicable, laboratory technici ans and pathologists , dentists, OB/GYNs, and kinesiologists,18 are 10 Id. art. 23 ter. 11 Pan American Health Organization [PAHO], Argentina , in II SALUD 2012, at 35-36, http://www.paho.org/saludenlas americas/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=186&Itemid 37. 14 Manzur en Marcha la red federal . 15 Law 15465, on Required Reporting of Diseases, Sept. 29, 1960, http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/ 195000-199999/195093/norma.htm , regulated by Decree 3640/64, May 19, 1964, http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/ infolegInternet/anexos/195000-199999/195289/norma.htm (in Spanish). 16 Decree 2771/79, Nov. 1, 1979, art. 2, available on the Legisalud website, at http://test.e-legis-ar.msal.gov.ar/ leisref/public/showAct.php?id=4140&word (in Spanish). 17 Id. art. 3. 18 Id. art. 5. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Argentina The Law Library of Congress 8 all under obligation to re port the listed diseases.19 Noncompliance with this obligation is punishable by a fine and temporary suspension of the professional license to practice for one to three months.20 The sanctions are determined by the MH or its provincial counterparts when the offense falls under their jurisdiction.21 The Advisory Commission on Epidemic Surveillance was also created within the jurisdiction of the DE to provide guidance on procedural and operational aspects of epidemic surveillance actions. 22 The Advisory Commission on Epidemic Su rveillance provides technical advice to the provinces contributing to the organization and development of the National Epidemiological Surveillance System, of which it is a part.23 The DE also promotes the control of transmissi ble and nontransmissible diseases and health risks and regulates all activities rela ted to environmental health, in cluding training, research, and control in situ upon request of the different jurisdictions. 24 This system is organized by levels and is comprised of the DE at the national leve l and epidemiology directorates, departments, and units within ministries of health at the provi ncial level. The system compiles information on reportable diseases and laboratory data weekly.25 The provincial Federal Health Department is in charge of controlling epidemic diseases; this includes diseases subject to quarantine and those that, by their character, danger, or scope, may become a national threat. 26 To this end, the Fede ral Health Department reports the presence of any such diseases by means of a uniform national procedure and, together with the provincial authorities, carries out epidemic re search related to these diseases.27 Such reporting and communication are confidential. The manner in which the information is reported allows the Federal Health Department to id entify and locate the individuals affected and the source of infection. 28 However, the National Health Author ity is the only govern ment body with the power to report on this subject abroad.29 19 Id. art. 4. 20 Law 15465, art. 16. 21 Id. art. 18. 22 Ministry of Health, Manual de Normas y Procedimie ntos de Vigilancia y Control de ia (rev. ed. 2007), 23, 2014). 25 MINISTRY OF HEALTH , supra note 22, at 6-8. 26 Decree-Law 4143/58, Health Assistan ce, Apr. 2, 1958, arts. 2 & 7, B OLET\u00cdN OFICIAL , Apr. 16, 1958. 27 Id. 28 Law 15465, on Required Reporting of Diseases, Sept. 29, 1960, arts. 7, 8. 29 Id. art. 11.

The Directorate of Health Emergencies ha s a permanent communications unit on call for emergencies in coordination with the Federal Em ergency System. However, it has been reported that the Federal Emergency System has not been efficiently used in spite of the considerable amount of funds assigned for its operational budget.32 Since its creation in 1972, the Directorate of Health Emergencies has assisted both in Arge ntina and abroad in a nu mber of disasters and health emergencies, providing medicine, medi cal assistance, and transportation when the seriousness of the situation required treatmen t in a more sophisticated medical facility.33 T h e Directorate of Health Emerge ncies coordinates with the National Directorate for Trauma, Emergencies, and Disasters within the jurisdic tion of the Undersecreta ry of Prevention and Promotion Programs to implement assistance at th e national, provi ncial, and municipal level in cases of emergencies or disaster s requiring federal intervention.34 The National Directorate for Trauma, Emergencies, and Disasters is the author ity in charge of the evacuation and reception of victims and the referral of patients, whether indi vidually or in mass, in cases of natural, technological, or other disasters.35 The Border Health Program is in charge of ma intaining health and epidemic control at the borders and in the international transportation te rminals, according to international standards and in compliance with the International Health Regulation.36 30 Id. art. 14. 31 Nora B\u00e4r, La Argentina Desarrolla una Red de Federal de Emergencias 7, 2013), http://www.lanacion. com.ar/1570410-el-sistema-federa l-de-emergencias-no-se-utiliza . 33 For historical data on emergencies in Argentina and abroad covered by the Directorate of Health Emergencies, see Historia , DINESA (June 13, 2011), . 35 Decree 1106/2000 of the Ministry of Health, Nov. 27, 2000, Annex II, http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/ anexos/65000-69999/65187/norma.htm ; DP'12 - D 1343/2007, 5, http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/130000- 134999/133099/texact.htm . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Argentina The Law Library of Congress 10 As a result of the 2003 worldwide SARS alert, the MH took a number of measures to prevent and eventually control the disease.37 The Secretariat for Health Policy and Regulation of the MH ordered the strict control over any vesse l and its crew ente ring the country.38 The Criminal Code sanctions with imprisonment of three to fifteen years anyone who knowingly propagates a dangerous and contag ious illness to human beings. 39 If the propagation is due to negligence or violation of the publ ic authorities' regulations or directives but does not result in the death or infection of someone else, a fine ma y be imposed. If the propagation does result in death or infection, the offender is subject to impr isonment for six months to five years.40 Anyone who violates the measur es adopted by the designated authorities to prevent the introduction or containment of an epidemic is subject to imprisonment for six months to two years. This crime is punishable even when an epidemic does not occur. If the wrongdoer is a public officer or professional, the sanction will include a special disqua lification from his/her post for a period double the length of the penalty. 41 IV. Transparency of Public He alth Crisis Management System The Statistics and Health Information Directorate is the agency in charge of the collection and analysis of health data on a permanent basis. It s objectives include the identification of health factors that allow the early detection of di seases to prevent their spread and alert the population.42 The DE publishes an epidemiological bulletin entitled Bolet\u00edn Epidemiol\u00f3gico Peri\u00f3dico , which is available on the MH webpage. 43 This weekly report includes the latest news on health issues, the current situation on specific i llnesses threaten ing the population, outbreaks of new diseases in the country and abroad, and the epidemic surveillance da ta provided by the provinces.44 V. Management of Health Emergencies In September 2002, the MH, together with its provincial counterparts, implemented a surveillance system called unidades centinela (health watch units) to closely monitor specific 37 See MINISTERIO DE SALUD , PLAN DE CONTINGENCIA NACIONAL - S\u00cdNDROME (SRAG) (Apr. 2003), de Buenos . 38 Id. annex D.1.A, at 21. 39 C\u00d3DIGO PENAL DE LA NACI\u00d3N ARGENTINA , as amended (1984 revised text), art. 202, http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/ infolegInternet/anexos/15000-19999/16546/texact.htm#22 . 40 Id. art. 203. 41 Id. arts. 205, 207. 42 DIRECCI\u00d3N DE ESTAD\u00cdSTICAS E INFORMACI\u00d3N DE SALUD , SISTEMA Responses to Health Emergencies: Argentina The Law Library of Congress 11 health threats like pneumonia.45 Since 2001, the National Health Statistics Program has been equipped with the proper hardware and software to make the health information collected accessible to all in a timely manner.46 In March 2002, the President declar ed a National Health Emergency 47 as part of an overall public, social, economic, financial, and monetary emergency declared by Law 25561.48 T h e social and economic situation in the country was so serious that the provision of medicine and other health and medical supplie s, especially those imported, was undermined, causing a genuine crisis and collapse of the national health system. The critical situation of the health sector constituted an exceptional circumstance, render ing it impossible to provi de health services according to regular procedures. 49 Under the National Hea lth Emergency, the MH was empowered to take all necessary measures to guarantee the provision of medicine to the population, and to establish the procedures and priorities for its distribution.50 The MH instituted exceptional procedures to acquire such medicine , authorized special f unding for its acquisition,51 and imposed price controls to avoid excessive price increases.52 The MH also developed a system that prioritized medical attention during the emergency.53 On April 29, 2009, as part of the measures take n by the Argentine government to control the swine flu outbreak that originated in Mexico, a ll flights incoming from Mexico were suspended until May 5, 2009. 54 At the same time health control poin ts were set up at al l points of entry to the country, and sensors to de tect fever among the travelers we re set up in international airports.55 Flights from Mexico resumed on May 15, 2009,56 but measures to check the body temperature of arriving passengers at international airports remained in effect for some time.57 45 Id. 46 BOLET\u00cdN DEL Programa Nacional de Estad\u00edsticas en Salud\" under \"B\u00fasqueda Avanzada\"). 47 Decree 486/02 on National Health Emergency of March 12, 2002, http://infoleg.mecon.gov.ar/infoleg Internet/anexos/70000-74999/72887/texact.htm (in Spanish). 48 Law 25561 on National Emergency of Jan. 6, 2002, http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/in folegInternet/verNorma.do; jsessionid=A917C3C78C096E7D9B12CFD246CC3D4A?id=71477 (in Spanish). 49 Id., intro. 50 Id. arts. 2, 3. 51 Id. art. 9. 52 Id. art. 10. 53 Id. arts. 18-20. 54 Resolution 201/2009 of the Secretar\u00eda de Transporte, Apr. 29, 2009, http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/ anexos/150000-154999/152904/norma.htm ; Resolution 214/2009 of May 4, 2009, http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/ infolegInternet/anexos/150000-154999/152973/norma.htm . 55 Por la Gripe los vuelos 15, 2009), http://www.lanacion.com. ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1128307 . 57 Id.

Current Crisis On August 7, 2014, the MH issued an epidemiological warning ( alerta epidemiol\u00f3gica ) in the country because of the Ebol a virus outbreak in Africa.58 The warning provides specific instructions and a health pr otocol to follow in suspici ous and confirmed Ebola cases.59 It further provides information about symptoms to the popul ation at large and specific information for travelers entering the country.60 On August 20, 2014, the MH published a comprehensive update on the evolution of the Ebola virus in the world, providing an update of the reinforcement prevention, notification and de tection measures in comp liance with WHO standards.61 On September 10, 2014, Argentina announced that the Malbr\u00e1n Institute of Health in Buenos Aires had developed a biological molecular method for detecting the Ebola virus in less than twenty-four hours. 62 The Minister of Health announced th at Argentina was the first country in Latin America that had a diagnos is method for Ebola that had b een validated by the WHO. Health authorities have been working in training health staff, acquiring equipment for patients' isolation, and developing and updating a protocol for handling Ebola cases. Currently there are three hospitals in the country already se lected and ready to treat Ebola patients.63 58 DIRECCI\u00d3N Id. at 2, Pol\u00edtica, Regulaci\u00f3n y Fi scalizaci\u00f3n, Ministerio de de Riesgo http://www.telam. com.ar/notas/201410/81135-argentina-metodo-diagnostico-ebola.html . 63 Id. The Law Library of Congress 13 Australia Kelly Buchanan Chief, Foreign, Comparative, and International Law Division I SUMMARY Under Australia's federal system, states a nd territories have primary responsibility for matters related to health care and emerge ncy management. The federal government provides various funding, policy leadership, and coordination assistance in the context of national responses to public hea lth emergencies. It also has quarantine powers and powers related to border management that can be utilized where there is an epidemic or threat of an epidemic. National agreements, as well as th e National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth), establish structures and processes for preven ting and responding to national health emergencies, with different entities providing oversight and coordination at the national level, and states and territories applying th eir own laws, jurisdictional responses, and coordination processes. This includes a national notification and surveillance system under which state and territory authorities report on instances of certain diseases to a central authority, which then ma kes information available for analysis and discussion. In the event of a public health threat, state and te rritory public health laws provide a range of powers to enable action to be taken by aut horities. This can include ordering medical examinations, treatment, and detention of individuals. The Australian government, along with state a nd territory governments, has taken a range of actions in response to the 2014 Ebola viru s disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa. This includes enhanced screening of passengers at airports, stopping the processing of visa applications from citizens of affected countries, issuing national guidance to public health units and laboratories, and the development of detailed state and territory response plans. As of October 2014, around twenty people w ho arrived in Australia from EVD-affected countries had been placed on home quarantine. I. Introduction Australia has a federal system of governme nt with powers divided under the Constitution between the Commonwealth government and the c ountry's six states and two mainland self- governing territories. 1 The matters over which the Commonw ealth Parliament has legislative powers are listed in sections 51 and 52 of the Constitution.2 Most of these legislative powers are concurrent, meaning that they are shared with st ate and territory parliaments. Where there is a conflict between state and federal laws, the federal law will override the state law to the extent of the inconsistency.3 1 See generally Making Laws , PARLIAMENTARY EDUCATION OFFICE , http://www.peo.gov.a u/learning/closer- look/governing-australia/making-laws.html (last visited Oct. 28, 2014). 2 AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION ss 51 & 52, http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013Q00005 . 3 Id. s 109. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Australia The Law Library of Congress 14 Section 96 of the Constitution provides the Commo nwealth Parliament with the power to grant financial assistance to any state \"on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.\"4 In practice, this may include tying grants to the implementation of certain policies by the states.5 Often such policies are the subj ect of agreements between the state and federal governments, such as through the mechanisms of the Co uncil of Australian Governments (COAG).6 I n addition, state and territory parliaments may refer matters within their legi slative powers to the Commonwealth Parliament.7 Section 51(ix) of the Constitution provides that the federal government has legislative powers with respect to quarantine. In addition, th e commerce and trade powers under section 51 are interpreted broadly, enab ling the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws in a range of health- related areas. 8 In general, however, all other matters related to human health fall within the residual powers of the states. Public hospitals are owned and op erated by state and territory governments, which also fund and deliver various health programs and services. However, as a result of long-term funding and policy arrangements, the federal government part ially funds public hospitals and \"is primarily responsible for health service f unding; regulation of health products , services and workforce; and national health policy leadership.\" 9 Various national agreements impact funding, policy, and implementation arrangements within the health sector.10 II. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System A. Federal Laws and National Agreements In addition to the states and te rritories having residual legislativ e powers in relation to health care, the management of emergencies is also not generally a matter for which the federal government may give directions to states and territories under the Constitution. Therefore, \"cooperative and collaborative mechanisms\" between these levels of government are needed for the strategic coordination of responses to nationa l emergencies, including public health crises.11 4 Id. s 96. 5 Christopher Reynolds, Public and Environmental Health Law 44-45 (2011). 6 See About COAG , COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS , https://www.coag.gov.au/about_coag (last visited Oct. 28, 2014). 7 Australian Constitution s 51(xxxvii). 8 REYNOLDS , supra note 5, at 40-41. 9 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Health Care Delivery and Financing, in 1301.0 - YEAR BOOK AUSTRALIA , 2012, http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20 Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Health%20care %20delivery%20and%20financing~235 (last updated Jan. 21, 2013). 10 See Health and Ageing , COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS , https://www.coag.gov.au/health_and_ageing (last visited Oct. 28, 2014). 11 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements \u00a7 3.2 (Nov. 2011), available on the website of the Australian Government Department of Health, at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/ publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-response- arrangement-nov11-l (last visited Oct. 29, 2014).

National Health Security Act and Agreement All of the states and territories signed the National Health Security Agreement in 2008,12 which supports the National Health Security Act 2007 (C th) and National Health Security Regulations 2008 (Cth).13 These enactments give effect to the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations (2005).14 These regulations required Australia to \"develop multi-level capacities in the health sector to effectively manage public health threats and to develop, strengthen and maintain the capacity to detect, report and respond to public health events.\" 15 The objectives of the National Health Security Act include (a) to provide a national system of public h ealth surveillance to e nhance the capacity of the Commonwealth and the States and Terr itories to identify, and respond to, public health events of national significance which include: (i) the occurrence of certain communicable diseases; or (ii) certain releases of chemical, biological or radiological agents; or (iii) the occurrence of public health risks; or (iv) the occurrence of ove rseas mass casualties; and (b) to provide for the sharing of information with: (i) the World Health Organization; and (ii) countries affected by an event rela ting to public health or an overseas mass casualty; and (c) to support the Commonwealth and the Stat es and Territories in giving effect to the International Health Regulations (other th an as mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b)). 16 The National Health Security Agreement is primarily concerned with strengthening Australia's public health surveillance and reporting system. It sets out the responsibili ties of entities at the national and state levels of government with regard to su rveillance and reporting of communicable diseases and responding to significant public health events. 2. National Health Emerge ncy Response Arrangements The Australian government's 2011 National H ealth Emergency Response Arrangements, referred to as the NatHealth Arrangements, \"articulate the strategic arrangements and mechanisms for the coordination of the Australian health sector in res ponse to emergencies of Infectious Disease Outbreak (Research Paper No. 3 2004-5, Nov. 16, 2004), A USTRALIAN PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY , http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliame ntary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/ pubs/rp/rp0405/05rp03 . 12 See National Health Security Agreement, available on the website of the Australian Government Department of Health, at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-nhs-agreement.htm (last visited Oct. 29, 2014). 13 National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth), http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00121 ; National Health Security Regulations 2008 (Cth), http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00171 . 14 WHO, International Health Regulations (2d ed. 2005), http://www.who.int/ihr/publications/9789241596664/en/ (last visited Oct. 28, 2014). 15 National Health Security Agreement, supra note 12, recital B. 16 National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth) s 6.

Emergencies of national consequence are those th at \"require consideration of national level policy, strategy and public messaging or inter-jurisd ictional assistance, where such assistance is not covered by existing arrangements.\" 18 The NatHealth Arrangeme nts may be triggered to coordinate a national response to health impacts ar ising from, for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, biosecurity threats, and emergent or re-emergent communicable diseases. They operate in the broader context of Australia's national security fr amework, which includes various strategic plans and arrangements related to both conventional and nonconventional threats.19 They may also be utilized for an international health emergency affecting Australian interests or nationals.20 B. State and Territory Responsibilities The National Health Security Ag reement recognizes that state and territory governments have \"primary responsibility for the pub lic health response\" to public he alth events within their own jurisdictions, 21 while the Commonwealth government has \"primary responsibility for international border surveillance and public health events occurri ng at interna tional borders.\"22 Where there is a \"Public Health Event of National Significance,\" a \"national health sector response will occur at the request of an affect ed, or potentially affected, State or Territory.\"23 Such a response will be coordinated at the nati onal level in accordance with Commonwealth and state and territory legislation, as well as any established national plans or protocols, and each state and territory will also \"undertake it s own jurisdictional co ordinating processes.\"24 According to the NatHealth Arrangements, [s]tate and territory health authorities ha ve well established em ergency management legislation, and well rehearsed and integr ated emergency management arrangements. Jurisdictional health authorities have exis ting command and control structures for the management of health facilities, public hea lth units and pathology laboratory services. Additionally, in some jurisdictions ambul ance services also come under the health authority response arrangements. 17 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements, supra note 11, \"Authority.\" 18 Id., \"Introduction.\" 19 Id. 20 Id. \u00a7 3.3.2. 21 National Health Security Agreement, supra note 12, art. 3. 22 Id. art. 22. 23 Id. art. 14. 24 Id. art. 20.

Key National Coordination Entities 1. Australian Health Protection Committee The Australian Health Protection Committee (AHP C) was established in 2006 by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC). Along with a second new committee, the Australian Population Health Development Committee, the AHPC replaced the previous National Public Health Partnership. 26 It is responsible for \"high level cross jurisdictional collaboration in public health protection, plan ning, preparedness, response and recovery in relation to public health emergencies arising fr om man made emergencies or natural disasters.\"27 Its membership includes the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Health Officer of each state and territory, as well as health disaster officials, clinical experts, and representatives from the federal Department of Health, Au stralian Defence Force, and the Emergency Management Australia division of th e Attorney-General's Department.28 The roles of the AHPC include, among others, advising and making recommendations to AHM AC on health protection matters; to mitigate emerging health threats related to infectious diseases, the environment, natural disasters and disasters related to human endeavour in a context of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery; advising on national health protection prio rities and coordinating the allocation of health resources to these priorities; national coordination of emergency opera tional activity in health responses to disasters and health protection issues of national significance; enabling development and adoption by st ates and territories of national health protection policies, guidelines and standards[.]29 The AHPC has various standing committees, including the Comm unicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA), National Health Emergency Management Subcommittee (NHEMS), and the 25 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements, supra note 11, \u00a7 4.2. 26 The National Public Health Partnership , NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERSHIP (archived by the Victoria Department of Health), http://www.health.vic.gov.au/ archive/archive2014/nphp/ (last updated Feb. 22, 2010). 27 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements, supra note 11, \u00a7 4.3. 28 Presentation, Dr. Robyn Walker, Department of Health and Ageing, RACMA Annual Conference 2011, slide 5 (Oct. 12, 2011), Royal Australasian College of Medical Examiners website, http://files.racma.com.au/ conference_racma2011_Walker-135.pdf .

The AHPC and these three standing committees receive secretariat support from the Office of Health Protection within the Department of Health.30 a. National Health Emerge ncy Management Subcommittee According to the NatHealth Arrangements, [t]he National Health Emergency Management Subcommittee (NHEMS) addresses the operational aspects of disaster medicine and health emergency management in an all hazards context with a focus on preparedn ess and response. The NHEMS reports to the AHPC. In an emergency the AHPC may task NHEMS to provide advice on operational aspects of the response. 31 b. Communicable Diseas es Network Australia The CDNA was established in 1989. It \"provides national pub lic health co-o rdination on communicable disease surveillance, prevention a nd control, and offers strategic advice to governments and other key bodies on public hea lth actions to minimi se the impact of communicable diseases in Australia and the region.\" 32 The committee meets every two weeks to review information and developments related to communicable diseases surveillance. Its ongoing projects include developing a nationa l communicable disease framework and developing national guidelines for the Series of National Guidelines (SoNGs). Such guidelines are endorsed by the AHPC and \"provide nationally consistent advice and guidance to public health units in responding to a notifiable disease event.\"33 The CDMA also provides advice on the inclusion and removal of conditions on the Nationally Notifiable Diseases List.34 c. Public Health Laboratory Network The PHLN was first established as part of th e previous 1996 National Communicable Diseases Surveillance Strategy in order to complement the CDNA.35 It is a \"collaborative group of pathology and veterinary laborator ies, nominated by state and te rritory health departments,\"36 with the central role of providi ng \"leadership and consultation in all aspects of public health 30 About the Office of Health Protection (OHP) , AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH , http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-about.htm (last updated Sept. 25, 2014). 31 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements, supra note 11, \u00a7 6.5.1. 32 About Communicable Diseases Network Australia , AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH , http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/cda-cdna-cdna.htm (last updated Nov. 4, 2013). 33 Series of National Guidelines (SoNGs ), A USTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH , http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdnasongs.htm (last updated Oct. 14, 2014). 34 About Communicable Diseases Network Australia, supra note 32. 35 Overview of the Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN) , AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH , http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/cda-cdna-phln-phln.htm (last updated Feb. 26, 2014). 36 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements, supra note 11, \u00a7 6.5.1.

Australian Medical Assistance Teams The AHPC also oversees multidisciplinary civilian medical assistance teams situated throughout the country. The Australian Medical Assistance Teams (AUSMATs), which are designed to be self-sufficient and have field deployment capab ilities, include vari ous volunteer health professionals such as doctors, nurses, paramedi cs, firefighters, environmental health staff, radiographers, and pharmacists. 39 AHPC may deploy AUSMATs to affected Australian jurisdictions or overseas to assist in the event of health emergencies.40 2. Department of Health and Health Emergency Management Branch According to the NatHealth Arrangements, the fede ral Department of Health provides leadership and national health sector coordination in the ev ent of an emergency of national consequence. This may include \"provision of e xpert health advice and national policy development, logistical coordination of extra jurisdictional health sect or resources (human, e quipment and peripherals) and linkages to inte rnational health authorities and bodies.\"41 The federal budget for the Department of Health includes a specifi c outcome related to \"Biosecurity and Emergency Response.\"42 The Department of Health's Office of Health Pr otection aims to \"prot ect the health of the Australian community through eff ective national leadership a nd coordination and building of appropriate capacity and capability to detect, prevent and respond to threats to pub lic health and safety.\" 43 It consists of several br anches, including the Health Protection Policy Branch, Health Emergency Management Branch (HEMB), and Immunisation Branch. HEMB is the designated National Focal Point un der the National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth) and the International Health Regulations (2005). 44 It undertakes a range of activities related to 37 Overview of the Public Heal th Laboratory Network (PHLN), supra note 35. 38 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements, supra note 11, \u00a7 6.5.1. 39 AUSMAT , NATIONAL AND TRAUMA RESPONSE CENTRE , http://www.nationaltraumacentre. nt.gov.au/what-we-do/dis aster-management/ausmat (last visited Oct. 28, 2014); SA HEALTH , http://www.sahealth.s a.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public +content/sa+health+internet/ protecting+public+health/emergency+manag ement/australian+medical+assistance+team (last modified Oct. 21, 2014). 40 National Health Emergency Response Arrangements, supra note 11, \u00a7 6.5.1. 41 Id. \u00a7 4.1. 42 Australian Budget 2014-15 Health Portfolio Budget Statements, Outcome 9: Biosecurity and Emergency Response (2014), http://www.health.gov.au/internet/budget/p ublishing.nsf/Content/2014-2015_Health_PBS_ sup2/$File/2014-15_Health_PBS_2.09_Outcome_9.pdf . 43 About the Office of Health Protection (OHP), supra note 30. 44 Id.

The relevant diseases are smallpox, poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus; human influenza caused by a new subtype; severe acute respiratory syndrome haemorrhagic fevers; cholera; rabies.56 The reporting requirement may also be triggered by any other poten tial \"Public Health Event of National Significance or Public Health Emergenc y of International Concern\" depending on the circumstances.57 Events that constitute a Public Hea lth Emergency of International Concern are defined in Annex 2 of the Intern ational Health Regulations (2005).58 Notification requirements that may be imposed on others, such as the captains of ships or aircraft entering Australia, are included in the Quarantine Act 1908 (Cth).59 The Department of Agriculture is notified of ill passengers before a plane lands or a ship docks. In addition, information about where a person has traveled and whether they are feeling ill upon entering Australia may be required.60 Further information on powers th at may be exercised under the Quarantine Act 1908 (Cth) is provided below. Under the National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth), where a state or territory authority places a traveler who enters, and is in transit, under public health observation while in Australia, the National Focal Point must be notifie d and provided with certain details. 61 55 Communicable Diseases Information , AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH , http://www.health. gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-communic-1 (last updated Oct. 23, 2014). 56 National Health Security Agreement, supra note 12, definition of \"Public Health Event of National Significance to be Reported to the NFP.\" 57 Id. 58 Id., definition of \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" 59 Quarantine Act 1908 (Cth) s 22, http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00612 .

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Australia The Law Library of Congress 22 III. Powers of Public Health Authorities A. Vaccinations As a general rule, there are no diseases for whic h vaccination is compulsory for persons living in Australia. However, unless an appropriate medical or philosophical exemption has been obtained, children must be assessed as fully immunized in order for parents to be eligible for the federal Family Tax Benefit Part A supplement and other payments.62 A national childhood immunization register record s vaccinations given to child ren under seven years of age.63 Parents may be required to keep a nonimmun ized child home from school or day care if certain cases of vaccine-preventable diseases occur at that facility.64 Furthermore, where cases of quarantinable diseases arise, quarantine officers have the power to require a person who is subject to quarantine to submit to vaccina tion or prophylaxis if this is considered necessary to prevent the spread of th e disease or is specified in the International Health Regulations. 65 The Quarantine Act 1908 (Cth) was amended in 2008 to meet certain requirements under the International Health Regulations (2005) for vaccinations and other health measures related to travelers.66 B. State and Territory Public Health Legislation As noted above, state and territory government s have various powers under their respective public health and emergency management laws. For example, in New South Wales, the largest state in the country, the Public Health Ac t 2010 (NSW) provides that, where a state of emergency exists under the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989 (NSW), the relevant Minister may take actions or give orders that could in clude directing all persons in a specified group or area to submit to medical examination. 67 Furthermore, where a situation exists that is co nsidered a threat to public health, the Minister may take actions to reduce the ris k, segregate or isolate people in an area, and prevent access to 62 AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH , THE AUSTRALIAN IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK , App. 4: \"Commonly about ed. 2013), http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/appendix4 .

This might including ordering the person to refrain from certain conduct, submit to supervision, or undergo specified treatment.70 Where such an order is contravened, th e person may be arrested and detained.71 In New South Wales, the above public health orde rs may be made with respect to persons who have the following conditions: avian influenza in humans; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Severe Acute (SARS); tubercul Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. 72 Similar public health orders and other powers re lated to notifiable diseases are available under the public health legisla tion of Queensland, the third largest state. For example, a judge may issue a detention order for a person with a \"cont rolled notifiable condition\" whose condition or behavior constitutes an \"immediate risk to public health.\" 73 The person subject to the order must remain at the place of detention for the period st ated in the order and undergo ordered medical examination or treatment.74 C. Federal Quarantine Law The Quarantine Act 1908 (Cth) is administered jo intly by the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture. Under the federa l statute, in the event of an emergency a proclamation may be issued declaring that \"any or all measures of quarantine prescribed by or under any State Act\" must cease to ha ve effect for a period of time.75 In addition, the Commonwealth government may enter into arrangement s with states and territories with respect to a range of quarant ine-related matters.76 The federal government may declare by proclamation the existence of an epidemic or the danger of an epidemic caused by a quarantinable disease.

Response to Ebola Virus Epidemic in West Africa Australian federal and state and territory governme nts have taken a range of actions in response to the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in several countries in West Africa. This includes the appointment of an infectious disease expert to oversee the response.94 State and territory Chief Health Officers provide weekly updates on their prepared ness plans at meetings of the AHPC. Australia's Chief Medical Officer stated in October 2014 that [n]ationally and at a local level we have al erted doctors, hospital, paramedics and other health professionals on what to do if they suspect a patient has Ebola. All States and Territories have their own response plans which include designating specific hospitals to treat su spected cases and ensuring ther e are adequate facilities and equipment, including personal protection, available. In addition the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia has produced a series of special guidelines for hospitals, public health units, clinicians and GPs. The guidelines give step by step guidance on identifying and dealing with a suspected case and they are continually under review as new info rmation and experiences from overseas are received. 95 Enhanced airport screening of passe ngers traveling to Australia from affected countries started in August 2014, and airport border agencies have b een provided with guidance by the Department of Health \"to identify and quarantine any passengers presenting Ebola sympto ms in flights or at airports.\"96 Travelers who have been in EVD-affected countries are asked a series of questions by a Biosecurity Officer \"to assess their risk of exposure to EVD.\"97 Passengers may then be referred to state health authorities for assessment if required.98 As at late October, more than nine hundred passengers had been scr eened at ten Aust ralian airports.99 Twenty-four people had undergone a full screening process, \"including be ing referred to human quarantine officers.\"100 94 Sophie Scott & Brigid Anderson, Infectious Disease Expert Professor Lyn Gilbert Appointed to Oversee Australia's Response to Ebola Threat , ABC NEWS (Oct. 23, 2014), http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10- 23/infectious-diseases-expert-named- as-australias-ebola-tsar/5837000 . 95 Press Release, Australian Government Department of Health, Ebola Health Protection Update (Oct. 17, 2014), http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr14-dept-dept010.htm . 96 Press Release, Australian Health Protection Principal Comm ittee, Australia is Well Prep ared to Deal with Ebola (Aug. 15, 2014), http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishi ng.nsf/Content/ohp-ebola.htm//$File/AHPPC- Statement.pdf . 97 SMARTRAVELLER .GOV.AU, http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw- cgi/view/travelbulletins/Ebola (last updated Oct. 25, 2014). 98 Press Release, Hon.

The Law Library of Congress 29 Brazil Eduardo Soares Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY In Brazil, health is a fundamental righ t under the Constitution and the government has responsibility for the regulation and control of health activities and services, as well as sanitary and epidemiologic surveillance. A Unified Health System, defined as a body of actions and health services provided by public organs and institutions at all govern ment levels, is in charge of executing epidemiologic surveillance proceedings, incl uding those for the purpose of recommending and adopting preventive measures and the control of diseases. The Brazilian Penal Code provides for punishin g whoever causes an epidemic or fails to comply with public health regulations, a nd Brazil is currently in the process of incorporating the revised International Health Regulations into its domestic legal system. Recently, the Ministry of Health updated a Contingency Plan for the Ebola Disease designed to guide government actions to prev ent and a possible epidemic in the country. I. Constitutional Principles - Health The Brazilian Constitution states that health is a right of all and a duty of the government, guaranteed by social and economic po licies aimed at reducing the risk of disease and at the equal and universal access to actions and services for its promotion, protection, and recovery.1 It further states that health activities and se rvices are of public im portance and it is the government's responsibility to provide, in ac cordance with the law, for their regulation, supervision, and control. Such activities and se rvices must be carried out directly or through third parties and also by individuals or legal entities.2 Public health activities and services are part of a regionalized and hierarchic al network and constitute a unified3 system.4 According to the Constitution, the Unified Health System (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade, SUS) is responsible, inter alia, for the execution of ac tions regarding sanitary and epidemiologic surveillance, as well as those rela ting to the health of workers.5 1 CONSTITUI\u00c7\u00c3O FEDERAL [C.F.] art. 196, http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm . 2 Id. art. 197. 3 Id. art. 198. 4 Article 198 of the Constitution also provides the organizational directives that must be followed by the unified health system. 5 Id. art. 200(II). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 30 II. Unified Health System The SUS was established by Law No. 8,080 of September 19, 1990,6 and, pursuant to article 4, is composed of the body of actions and health services provided by public organs and institutions at the federal, state, and municipal levels of direct and indirect administration, 7 and by the foundations maintained by the government. Federal, state and municipal public institutions of quality control, research, and production of s upplies and medications, including blood and blood products and health equipment, are also part of the SUS.8 The private sector can participate in the SUS in a complementary manner.9 The SUS's duties encompass, among othe r things, epidemiologic surveillance, 10 which is defined as a group of actions that provide for the knowle dge, detection, or prevention of any change in the determining and conditioning factors of individual or collective health, for the purpose of recommending and adopting measures to prevent and control diseases. 11 Law No. 8,080 also provides for the organization of the SUS at the federal, state, and municipal levels;12 the attributes of each organization;13 and their competencies.14 A. National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance Pursuant to the authority in Law No. 8,080,15 on January 26, 1999, the government issued Law No. 9,782, which further defined the National Sy stem of Sanitary Surveillance (Sistema Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ri a), and created the National Agen cy (Ag\u00eancia Nacional de sob regime especial ) linked to the Ministry of Health the institutional purpose of which is to foster the protection of th e health of the population by exercising sanitary control over the production and marketing of products a nd services subject to 6 Lei No. 8.080, de 19 de Setembro de 1990, http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8080.htm . 7 Direct Administration is considered to be the body of public administrative servi ces exercised directly by the government (federal, state, and municipal) through government organs, such as ministries and secretaries, which are integrated into the structure of the Ex ecutive. Indirect Administration is th e body of acts and services rendered by decentralized administrative agencies ( autarquias ) or public entities created by law, in the exercise of their own activities or government functions, through delegation by the government.

The Law Library of Congress 39 Canada Tariq Ahmad Legal Research Analyst SUMMARY Emergency measures and emerge ncy management at the fede ral level in Canada are regulated by the Emergency Act and the Emerge ncy Management Act. However, there is a relatively high trigger for the federal government to take the lead in a health emergency. Therefore, most health emergencies or crises ar e dealt with at the municipal and provincial level in coordination with th e federal government. Most provinces and territories have passed various \"health acts\" that govern the pow ers and duties of health officials during a health emergency. I. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System Legislative competence in relation to public health matters is shared by all levels of government in Canada.1 The Constitution Act, 1867,2 which defines much of the structure and operations of the Government of Canada, \"does not explicitly include 'health' as a legislative power assigned either to Parliament (in sec tion 91) or to the provincial legislatures (in section 92).\"3 In the 1982 case of Schneider v. The Queen , the Supreme Court of Canada stated that \"health\" is not a matter which is subject to specific constitutional assignment but instead is an amorphous topic which can be addressed by valid federal or provincial legislation, depending in the circumstances of each case on the nature or scope of the health problem in question. 4 Under Section 91 of Canada's Constitution Act, the federal government derives its jurisdiction to directly or indirectly regulat e on public health-related issues principally from its powers to legislate on quarantine and the establishment and maintenance of marine hospitals; criminal matters; public debt and property; 1 Background , PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY OF CANADA (PHAC), http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca /about_apropos/back- cont-eng.php (last updated Oct. 9, 2014). 2 Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 3 (U.K.), \u00a7\u00a7 91, 92, http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page- 1.html . 3 Martha Butler & Marlisa Tiedemann, Library of Parliament, Legal and Social Affairs Division, The Federal Role in Health and Health Care \u00a7 1, Pub.

A. Federal Laws At the federal level, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is primarily responsible for the promotion of health, prevention and control of chronic diseases, prevention and control of infectious diseases, and preparation a nd response to public health emergencies. 11 The PHAC operates under the Minister of He alth and Health Canada. It was established by the 2006 Public Health Agency of Canada Act12 \"for the purpose of assisting the Mi nister of Health in exercising 5 Constitution Act, 1867, \u00a7 91. 6 Id. \u00a7 92. 7 STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS , SCIENCE , AND TECHNOLOGY , CANADA 'S RESPONSE TO THE 2009 H1N1 INFLUENZA PANDEMIC (Dec. 2010), http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/403/soci/rep/ rep15dec10-e.pdf . 8 Responding to an Infectious Disease Outbreak: Progress Between SARS and Pandemic Influenza H1N1 , PHAC, http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ep-mu/rido-iemi/index-eng.php#in (last updated Apr. 11, 2012). 9 Id. 10 Id. 11 Mandate , PHAC, http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/about_apropos/what-eng.php (last updated June 16, 2011). 12 Public Health Agency of Ca nada Act, S.C. 2006, c. 5, http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/ eng/acts/P-29.5/FullText.html .

The Emergency Management Act \"sets out the leadership role and responsibilitie s of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, including \"coordinating emergency management activities among government institutions and in cooperation with the provinces and other entities.\" 20 The federal government works in collaboration with provinces and territories \"to support communities when disasters strike.\" 21 According to the website of Public Safety Canada, \"[t]o this end, An Emergency Management Framework for Canada was revised and approved by Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers in 2011.

Prevention/mitigation includes structural mitigative measures (e.g. construction of floodways and dykes) and non-structural mitig ative measures (e.g. building codes, land- use planning, and insurance incentives). Pr evention and mitigation may be considered independently or one may include the other. Preparedness - to be ready to respond to a disa ster and manage its consequences through measures taken prior to an event, fo r example emergency response plans, mutual assistance agreements, resource inventories and training, equipment and exercise programs. Response - to act during or immediately before or after a disaster to manage its consequences through, for example, em ergency public communication, search and rescue, emergency medical assistance and evacuation to minimize suffering and losses associated with disasters. Recovery - to repair or restore conditions to an acceptable level through measures taken after a disaster, for example return of evacuees, trauma counseling, reconstruction, economic impact studies and financial assistan ce. There is a strong relationship between long-term sustainable recovery and prevention and mitigation of future disasters. Recovery efforts should be conducted with a view towards disaster risk reduction. 24 Canada's federal legislation also includes the Quarantine Act,25 the purpose of which is \"to protect public health by taking comprehensive meas ures to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases.\"26 The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) assists the PHAC in the administration of the Quarantine Act and the Quarantine Regulations .27 The Act is by and large a border-control statute that is a pplied at entry and departure points. B. Provincial Laws Public health activities, including public hea lth crisis management at the provincial and territorial levels, are gover ned by Public Health Acts (or their equivalent) and rela ted regulations. These Acts usually have provis ions on reporting requirements , prevention, inspection powers, emergency measures, and the powers a nd duties of health officials. 23 PUBLIC SAFETY CANADA , AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR CANADA (2d ed.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Canada The Law Library of Congress 43 Provinces and territories also ha ve Emergency Management Acts in their respective jurisdictions that provide the legal basis for establishing emergency management or ganizations (EMOs) and creating provincial/territorial-lev el emergency management plans to help coordinate a provincial response to an emergency.28 II. Powers of Public Health Authorities A. Federal 1. Emergency Powers At the federal level, the Emergencies Act authorizes the government of Canada to take special temporary measures through a declaration of a \"public welfare emergency,\" which the Act defines as an emergency caused by a real or immi nent disease in human beings, animals, or plants (among others) \"that results or may result in a danger to life or property, social disruption or a breakdown in the flow of essential goods, servi ces or resources, so seri ous as to be a national emergency.\" 29 However, the federal government's pow er to issue a decl aration of a public welfare emergency can only be trig gered after a relative ly high threshold is met. According to the Act, [t]he Governor in Council may not issue a declaration of a public welfare emergency where the direct effects of the emergency ar e confined to, or occur principally in, one province unless the lieutenant governor in c ouncil of the province has indicated to the Governor in Council that the emergency exceeds the capacity or authority of the province to deal with it. 30 Therefore, it has been argued that the Emerge ncies Act essentially \"r estrains, even denies, federal statutory authority to tackle a disease outbreak while it remains small, manageable, and confined to one province. Rather, federal au thority begins only once the outbreak has spread, reaching the out-of-control quality of an epidemic.\"31 While an emergency declaration is in effect, th e government has the power to issue orders and regulations on the following matters: 28 Emergency Management Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, Province of Ontario Emergency Response Plan (2008), http://www.emergencymanagementontario. ca/english/emcommunity/response_resources/plans/provinicial_emergency_response_plan.html . 29 Emergencies Act \u00a7 5. Section 3 defines a \"national emergency\" as \"an urgent and critical situation of a temporary nature that\": \"( a) seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians and is of such proportions or nature as to exceed the capacity or authority of a province to deal with it, or ( b) seriously threatens the ability of the Government of Canada to preserve the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of Canada.\" Id. \u00a7 3. 30 Id. \u00a7 14(2). \"Governor in Council\" is another phrase for the Federal Cabinet. 31 Amir Attaran & Kumanan Wilson, A Legal and Epidemiological Justification for Federal Authority in Public Health Emergencies , 52 M CGILL L.J. 381, 385 (2007), http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/5670367- 1219616683_Attaran__Wilson.pdf .

Quarantine The Quarantine Act \"authorizes the Minister of Health to establish quarantine stations and quarantine facilities anywhere in Canada, and to designate various office rs, including quarantine officers, environmental health o fficers, and screening officers.\" 33 The Act also \"authorizes measures that can be taken in re spect of international travellers, or other persons at an entry or departure point, who have or might have a co mmunicable disease (one that poses a risk of significant harm to public health).\"34 It also authorizes procedures \"that can be taken in respect of conveyances arriving in or departing fr om Canada, and cargo on those conveyances, which could be the source of a communicable disease.\"35 32 Emergencies Act \u00a7 8(1). 33 List of Acts and Regulations, PHAC, supra note 13. 34 Id. 35 Id. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Canada The Law Library of Congress 45 B. Provincial Powers 1. Emergency Powers Given the limitations on the federal government to deal with health-related emergencies, responsibility for this matter is largely left to the provinces. All the provinces and territories have their own legislation dealing with em ergencies and emergency management. While \"[t]here is considerable variation among the provinces and territo ries with respect to the content, provisions, and the limits of authority defined in the respective legislation,\"36 the laws are more or less the same in terms of pow ers and organizational structure.37 For example, they empower \"the province or territory, munici palities, individuals, private co rporations and/or organizations to formulate emergency plans to prepare fo r and respond to emerge ncies or disasters.\"38 Other common features of these laws include provisions establishing Emergency Management Organi zations with assigned powers and duties, defining the roles and respons ibilities of munici palities and their relationship with the provinces, providing \"extraordinary power to local government if required,\" in some jurisdictions requiri ng local governments \"to create and maintain an emergency measures/management organization and program/plan,\" enabling \"provision of Disaster Financial Assistance to vic tims of all disasters,\" and \"provid[ing] exemption from civil liabili ty to all emergency service workers.\" 39 2. Quarantine and Other Powers Health officials in the provinces and territori es have extensive powers under various \"health acts\" to protect the public against pandemi cs and public health emergencies.

The Law Library of Congress 50 People's Republic of China Laney Zhang Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY China's public health crisis system has b een under restructuring since 2003. With the outbreak of a public health crisis, the emer gency headquarters set up by the State Council is responsible for leading and commanding th e nationwide response to the crisis. The provincial emergency headquarters are r esponsible for leading and commanding the response to the crisis within their own jurisdictions. The State Council and its health department, formerly the Ministry of Health and since 2013 the National Health and Family Planning Commission, have the power to declare a crisis involving a statutory infectious disease and draft and implement public health crisis contingency plans. The measures that may be taken when a crisis occurs include the evacuation or isolation of people, the blocka de of infectious disease epidemic areas, and the compulsory quarantine and treatment of su spected carriers and people in close contact with them. In 2010, the ban on the entry into China of aliens with HIV/AIDS or leprosy was lifted. According to the current rules, aliens with ser ious mental disorders, infectious pulmonary tuberculosis, or other infectious diseases that may significantly endanger the public health may be prohibited from entering China. I. Legislative and Regulatory Framework The public health crisis system of the People's Republic of China (PRC or China) has been significantly restructured primar ily as a result of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis of 2002-2003. Alth ough a statutory and regulatory framework to handle public health emergencies had been in place prior to the SARS crisis, major laws, regulations, and government measures have been amended or newly enacted since then to curb health emergencies. A. PRC Constitution on States of Emergency On March 14, 2004, the Constitution of the Pe ople's Republic of China was amended 1 to expand the power of the National People's Congress, Pres ident, and State Council to declare martial law This is a revised and updated version of a report authored by Wendy Zeldin, Senior Legal Research Analyst of the Law Library of Congress, in 2003. 1 XIANFA (1982, as amended on Mar. 14, 2004) (P.R.C.); for the Chinese text, see Announcement of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China: Amen dments to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China , NPCSC GAZETTE (Special Issue, 2004) 1-27 (Mar. 15, 2004).

Emergency Response Law and National Sy stem of Contingency Plans for Emergencies For the purpose of preventing and reducing emergent hazards such as natura l disasters, industrial accidents, public health crises, and public security hazards, the first PRC Law on Emergency Response (Emergency Response Law) was promulgated and entered into force in 2007. 3 Since the passage of the Emergency Response Law, the country has established a national system of contingency plans for emergencies, as provided by the Law on Emergency Response. 4 The Law requires the government at all levels, including the State Council and its departments, to formulate contingency plans for emergencie s, which these government bodies are to apply according to their level of authority.5 The central government has set up a webpage on its official website where it publishe s the contingency plans for emer gencies formulated by the State Council, its departments, and the provinces. Th e webpage also publishes special project plans.6 As part of the national system of continge ncy plans for public emer gencies, the National Contingency Plan for Public Health Emerge ncies was formulated on February 26, 2006, 7 in accordance with the Health Emergency Regulations , as discussed in Part III(B), below. C. Regulations on Contingent Public Health Emergencies A major set of provisions specifically addres sing public health emergencies comprise the Regulations on Contingent Public Health Em ergencies (Health Emergency Regulations), promulgated by the State Council on May 9, 2003. 8 The Regulations define \"public health emergencies\" as \"major epidemic situations of infectious diseases, broad-spectrum diseases with an unknown cause, major food and occupational poiso ning incidents, and other serious public health incidents that occur unexpectedly and ca use or may cause grave harm to public health in society.\"9 2 XIANFA arts. 67, 80, 89. 3 Tufa Shijian Yingdui Fa [Law on Emergency Response ] (promulgated by the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee on Aug. 30, 2007, effective Nov. 1, 2007), 2007 Z HONGHUA RENMIN GONGHE GUO FAGUI HUIBIAN [FAGUI HUIBIAN ] [COMPILATION OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE PEOPLE 'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ], 81-97, English translation available at Westlaw China (by subscription). 4 Law on Emergency Response art. 17. 5 Id. 6 Guojia Tufa Gonggong Shijian Yuan Tixi [National System of Contingency Plans for Public Emergencies ], CENTRAL PEOPLE 'S GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE 'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA , http://www.gov.cn/yjgl/2005-08/31/ content_27872. htm (last visited Weisheng Shijian Yingji Yu'an [National Contingency Plan for Public Health Crises ], XINHUA NEWS AGENCY (Feb. 26, 2006), Public Health Emergencies] (Health Emergency Regulations) (promulgated by the State Council, May 9, 2003), available at Westlaw China. 9 Id. art. 2.

Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases Prior to the 2003 Health Emergency Regulations , the primary legisla tion addressing the prevention and treatment of in fectious diseases, including the reporting and releasing of information in epidemic situations, was the PRC Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (Infectious Diseases Law), which was enacted in 1989. The Law was significantly revised in August 2004. 10 Effective on December 1, 2004, the new version doubled the length of the former Infectious Diseases Law from forty-one articl es to eighty articles.11 The Infectious Diseases Law divi des contagious diseases into th ree categories, each requiring the implementation of different preventive and contro l measures. Category A covers bubonic plague and cholera; category B includes such diseas es as SARS, anthrax, AIDS, typhoid, and viral hepatitis; and category C contains such dis eases as influenza, leprosy, mumps, and schistosomiasis. 12 The 2004 amendment to the Law added infectious SARS and highly pathogenic avian influenza to category B, ther eby increasing the total number of infectious diseases to thirty-seven.13 Three category B diseases\u2014infect ious SARS, pulmonary anthrax, and highly pathogenic avian influenza\u2014are designated to be treated with preventive and control measures applicable to category A diseases.14 E. Other Relevant Laws, Regula tions, and Government Measures The prevention, control, and el imination of epidemic diseases among animals are under the general supervision of the State Council's Ministry of Agricultu re and regulated under the PRC Law on Prevention of Epidemics in Animals. The Law was enacted in 1997 and amended in 2007. 15 Under the Law, animal epidemics are groupe d into three categories, the first of which includes epidemics that menace human beings and an imals so seriously that urgent and intensive compulsory measures are required for th eir prevention, control, and elimination.16 Some other major laws and regulations for addre ssing public health crises include the PRC Food Safety Law 17 and various laws and regulat ions on quarantine.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: China The Law Library of Congress 53 State Council is to organize the formulation of a national food sa fety emergency response plan; the government at or above the county level mu st also make food safety emergency response plans for its own administrative region.18 The central government departments also estab lished the following measures to specifically manage information reporting, transportation ad ministration, and border quarantine when public health crises occur: Ministry of Health: Measures for the Administration of Info rmation Reporting in Monitoring Public Health Emergencies and Epidemic Inf ectious Disease Situations (November 7, 2003; revised August 24, 2006); 19 General Administration of Quality Supervisi on, Inspection and Quarantine: Provisions on the Emergent Response to the Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine of Frontier and Port Public Health Emergencies (November 7, 2003);20 and Ministry of Health and Minist ry of Transportation: Provisi ons on Traffic Preparedness and Response to Public Health Emergencies (March 4, 2004; effective May 1, 2004).21 In 2007, the State Council passed the Regulations on Open Government Information. Effective from May 1, 2008, information concerning public em ergency contingency plans, early warnings, and responses to emergency situations are included in the \"key information\" that the government at and above the county level must disclose to the public. 22 II. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management System A. Central and Local Institutions The State Council is the highest executive organ and has the power, among others, to direct and administer public health work.23 In 2013, the Ministry of Health merged with the newly established National Health and Family Planni ng Commission (NHFPC), a department under the 18 Id. the Administration of Information Reporting on Monitoring Public Health Emergencies and Epidemic Situation of Infectious Diseases], MOH Order the Entry-Exit Inspection and Quaran tine of Frontier and on Traffic Preparedness and Response to Public Health Emergencies], available at Westlaw China. 22 Zhengfu Xinxi Gongkai Tiaoli [Regulations on Open Government Information] (promulgated by the State Council, Apr. 5, 2007, effective May 1, 2008) art. 10, 2007 F AGUI HUIBIAN 98, 99, English translation available at http://www.epa.gov/ogc/china/open_government.pdf (last visited Oct. 20, 2014). 23 XIANFA art. 89, item 7, in part. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: China The Law Library of Congress 54 State Council.24 The NHFPC is in charge of most health-related matters at the national level. It supervises and administers contagious diseas e prevention and various aspects of hygiene, organizes and oversees international cooperati on and exchanges involving health care, and mobilizes national health care personnel and tec hnical resources to assist local governments and other concerned departments in dealing with out breaks of epidemics and disease and in taking emergency measures to prevent and control them.25 A health emergency office, the Public Health Emergency Command Center, is set up in the NHFPC to address public health emergencies.26 Once a public health crisis has been iden tified, the State Counc il sets up emergency headquarters, over which it exercises unif ied leadership and command. The national headquarters set up for a crisis is to be compos ed of relevant departments of the State Council and the Armed Forces, with the co mpetent leader of the State Counc il as the general director in charge. The NHFPC and other relevant department s of the State Council carry out related tasks within the scope of their duties and responsibilities. 27 Provincial-level governments are also required to set up emergency headquarters on the outbreak of a public health crisis, with pr incipal provincial leaders as the general directors in charge of handling contingencies in their re gion. The provincial headquarters are to direct the response to the crisis within their respective jurisdictions. The health departments of local governments at and above the county level are re sponsible for investigating a nd managing health crises and organizing medical treatment. 28 B. Decision Making With the outbreak of a public health crisis, the emergency headquarters set up by the State Council is responsible for leading and commandi ng the nationwide response to the public health crisis.29 The provincial emergency headquarters are responsible for leading and commanding the response to the crisis with in their own jurisdictions.30 In the case of the SARS crisis, a National SARS Prevention and Control Headquarters was established by the State Council, with the Vice Premier and Minister of Health as the 24 Guojia Organs, and Personnel of the Na tional Health and Family Planning Commission] (issued by the State Council by Guo Ban Fa [2013] No. 50, June 9, 2013), http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2013-06/18/content_ 2428241.htm . 25 Id. 26 Id. 27 Health Emergency Regulations art. 3. 28 Id. art. 4. 29 Id. art. 3. 30 Id. art. 4.

Ten special teams (e.g., on preventi on and control, quarantin e, and rural areas) and a General Office were component units.31 C. Reporting and Releasing Information About Emergencies The state, according to the Health Emergency Regul ations, is to establish a system for reporting emergencies. Under the system, the following circumstances may trigger a provincial-level government emergency report to the NHFPC, which must be submitted within one hour after the provincial-level government learns of the emerge ncy: (1) the outbreak and spread, or potential outbreak and spread, of an infectious disease; (2) the occurrence or discovery of a broad- spectrum disease with an unknown cause; (3) the loss of infectious disease bacteria and viruses; and (4) the occurrence or potential occurren ce of major food and occupational poisoning incidents. 32 The NHFPC is to promptly report to the State Council any emergency \"that may cause significant social repercussions.\"33 The Health Emergency Regulations also require that notifications of health emergencies be transmitte d from monitoring and medical organizations to local health departments to the local government to higher-level health departments (including the NHFPC), with each organization or department required to transmit the information within two hours of receiving it.34 The Health Emergency Regulations also require the reporting and release of information from the NHFPC to other departments under the Stat e Council, to the health departments of provincial-level governments, and to the Arme d Forces; from the health departments of provincial-level governments 35 to their counterparts in the neighboring provinces; from provincial health departments to lower-level health departments within the same jurisdiction; and from the governments at the county level and above to their health departments.36 In addition, any entity or indi vidual in China has the right to report to the government on the potential danger of a public health emergency, as we ll as the right to report to a higher level if a local government fails to carry out its duties and responsibilities or carry them out according to regulations. A reporting hotline is also to be established .37 31 Local SARS headquarters and work mechanisms were also established .

Declaring a Statutory Infectious Disease Outbreak When an acute infectious disease is newly id entified, the health department under the State Council, formerly the Ministry of Health (M OH) and since 2013 the NHFPC, has the power to declare it a statutory infectious disease in accordance with the Infectious Disease Law.38 Only the State Council itself may declare such a disease to be a category A disease.39 The NHFPC has the power to declare the addition of a disease to category B or C.40 The MOH or NHFPC may also, upon approval by the State C ouncil, decide to apply the pr eventive and control measures applicable to category A diseases to certain ca tegory B diseases and othe r infectious diseases whose outbreak has occurred from unknown causes.41 Such a decision was made, for example, in the 2009 H1N1 influenza A crisis.42 B. Drafting and Implementing Contingency Plans Under the Health Emergency Regulations, the health department under the State Council, currently the NHFPC, is to draft a national contin gency plan for emergencies and submit it to the State Council for approval. On the basis of th e national plan, provincial-level governments are to draw up contingency plans for th eir respective administrative regions.43 When a public health emergency occurs, health de partments are to organize experts to evaluate and classify it and propose wh ether a contingency pl an should be implemented. Specialized technical organizations designate d by health departments at and above the provincial level or by other relevant departments are responsible for investigating em ergencies; verifying relevant evidence; and addressing, managing, and assessing such emergencies.44 With State Council approval, the NHFPC implemen ts a contingency plan nationwide or across provinces. The decision to implement a continge ncy plan in a province is made by the provincial government, not the health authorities, a nd must be reported to the State Council.45 38 Id. art. 30. 39 Id. 40 Infectious Diseases Law art. 3. 41 Id. art. 4. 42 Weishengbu Gonggao 2009 Nian Di Ba Hao [MOH 8, Apr. 30, 2009], http://www. gov.cn/jrzg/2009-05/01/content_1302001.htm . 43 Health Emergency Regulations art. 10. 44 Id. arts. 26, 29. 45 Id. art. 27.

Evacuation, Isolation, and Blockade Emergency headquarters have the power to evacuate or isolate people and to blockade areas of epidemic infectious disease. 46 Suspected carriers and people in close contact with infected patients who need to be quarantin ed and treated or put under medical observation must cooperate with the health department or relevant orga nizations. Compulsory implementation will be carried out with the a ssistance of the police.47 2. Assembling Personnel and Facilities Emergency headquarters have the power to assemb le personnel, materials in reserve, transport vehicles, and relevant facilities and equipment to deal with emergencies.48 Relevant departments of the State Council and local governments at and above the county level are to ensure the production and supply of medical and rescue equipment, medici ne, medical instruments, and other needed materials.49 3. On-Site Control Emergency headquarters may adopt measures to control food and water sources. Government health departments are to adopt measures to control the crisis and provide emergency vaccinations, medicines for preventive purposes, and community-based protection measures to people who are vulnerable to infections or harm.50 4. Right of Entry Specialized technical organizati ons designated by the NHFPC or ot her relevant departments of the State Council have the right to enter an emergency scene to conduct investigations, samplings, technical analyses, and tests. The cooperation of the relevant units and individuals is mandatory.51 5.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: China The Law Library of Congress 58 D. Sanctions The Health Emergency Regulations contain admi nistrative sanctions (e .g., written criticism, warnings, demotions, dismissal) for impermis sible acts committed by government officials involved in public health emergencies. Thes e include, for example, covering up, delaying reporting, or lying about public health emergencie s or instructing others to do so; refusing to cooperate with higher-level gove rnment investigations or ca rry out contingency-related responsibilities; derelic tion of duty. Officials will be dism issed if their acts cause infectious disease contamination, spread, or harm to public health. Medical institutions that refuse to receive and treat patients or fail to promptly adopt control measur es are subject to administrative sanctions and may face revocatio n of their license; officials involved will be disciplined. Responsible units or individuals who fail to carry out reporting duties, obst ruct technical or other personnel, refuse to cooperate in investigations , etc., may incur administrative or disciplinary sanctions. If any of the above act s result in a crime, the perpet rator will be investigated for criminal responsibility.53 IV. Transparency of Public He alth Crisis Management System The Infectious Diseases Law explicitly makes it i llegal for responsible offi cials and antiepidemic health personnel to conceal the outbreak of cont agious diseases or instruct others to do so.54 It also requires the NHFPC and, under its authoriza tion, provincial-level health departments to promptly release information on and publicly announce an epidemic.55 The Health Emergency Regulations reinforce the Law. Information on public health emergencies is to be released in a \"timely, accurate, and comprehensive way,\" and no unit or individual is allowed to cover up, delay reporting, or lie about public health em ergencies or instruct others to do so.56 Despite such provisions, the transparency of the public health crisis management system may be problematic considering that the media is controlled by the Communist Party through government agencies, and that the government ma y treat infectious diseases as a matter of national security requiring secrecy. 57 Furthermore, the military's health departments supervise and control the prevention and tr eatment of infectious disease in the People's Liberation Army.58 For example, in the SARS crisis, the independent administration of the military hospitals made it possible for such hospitals in Beijing to keep se cret the number of SARS patients being held in 53 Id. arts. 45-51. 54 Infectious Diseases Law art. 37. 55 Id. art. 38. 56 Health Emergency Regulations arts. 21, 25. 57 Sin-ming Shaw, China's Glasnost Moment? , 25 CHINA REVIEW 9 (Summer 2003); D AVID COWHIG , OPENNESS MANDATED BY PRC LAW, SECRECY IS ILLEGAL : BUT IS NON-GOVERNMENT INFORMATION JUST PUNISHABLE RUMOR , available at http://bulldog2.redlands.edu/dept/AsianStudiesDept/cowhig.pdf (last visited Oct. 20, 2014). Cowhig states that perhaps the best exam ple of such government secrecy with regard to health crises is the top secret documents kept by the MOH and the Henan provincial heal th bureau on the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout Henan during the early to mid-1990s. He not es that some Chinese officials have ev en contended that health secrecy\u2014for example, keeping secret the incidence of AI DS\u2014protects a locality's collective privacy. 58 Infectious Diseases Law art. 6. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: China The Law Library of Congress 59 them, resulting in a major underreporting of cases. Even after the actual number of cases was made known, officials were reportedly not forthcom ing with statistics from the PRC's nearly two hundred army hospitals.59 Although the 2004 amendment to the Infectious Dis eases Law continues to provide that military departments in charge of health are to superv ise and control the prev ention and treatment of infectious disease in th e People's Liberation Army,60 it now places a reporting requirement on military hospitals. Military hospitals, some of wh ich are open to the public, must report on the epidemic infectious disease situ ations they encounter when provi ding medical services to the general public in accordance with relevant NHFPC regulations.61 V. Cooperation with the World Health Organization The PRC is a member of the World Health Or ganization (WHO), has a WHO representative in Beijing, and is part of the WHO Western Pacific Region. At leas t sixty-four Chinese health research institutions have been designated as WHO collaborating centers.62 During the early stages of the SARS crisis, the PRC was dilatory in notifying the WHO of cases and admitting inspectors, and was criticized for its lack of transparency. However, the PRC did issue WHO- compatible health rules for international trade and travel, disinfected conveyances, and required health documents for travelers. Despite its initi al failure to cooperate, a senior WHO official later praised the PRC for its \"excellent work\" in preventing and treating SARS and said that the government accepted advice from international experts and made changes in combating the disease. 63 Although the PRC's delay in responding to SARS was partially attributed to concerns about economic repercussions, the PRC first treats an inf ectious disease as a medical problem requiring a medical response. Thus, the delay may have been due in part to (former) bureaucratic procedures that required classification of an in fectious disease as a category B disease before local health authorities were required to report it to the central government. It may also have been unclear whether the diseas e fell under the WHO's Internati onal Health Regulations (IHR) framework that makes reporting to the WHO mand atory. Before May 2003, compliance with the IHR was up to the discretion of the Member States; the WHO lacked any enforcement powers and had to rely on persuasion and recommendations to encourage Member States to notify the WHO within twenty-four hours of infectious disease outbreaks. Moreover, only three diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) and no othe r emerging infectious diseases were covered under the IHR. It was not until late May 2003, during its 56th session, that the WHO adopted a resolution on SARS confirming the WHO's aut hority to verify dise ase outbreaks from all 59 Gordon Chang, SARS Crisis: New Disease, New Leaders, Same Old Regime , 3:8 C HINA BRIEF 5 (Apr. 22, 2003). 60 2004 Infectious Diseases Law art. 6(3). 61 Id. art. 30(2). 62 See WHO C OLLABORATING CENTERS GLOBAL DATABASE , http://apps.who.int/whocc/ReportDetails.aspx?id=1 (last visited Oct. 21, 2014).

Recent Developments A. Entry Ban Lifted for Foreigners with HIV/AIDS On April 24, 2010, the State Council issued a decr ee to amend the implementation measures of the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law.65 The measures were first approved by the State Council in 1986 and amended in 1994. Under the old measures, foreigners suffering from \"mental disorder, leprosy, AIDS, venereal diseases , contagious tuberculosis, or other infectious diseases\" could be prevented from entering Chin a. The new measures amended this section only, removing the ban on aliens wi th HIV/AIDS or leprosy, while leaving intact the entry ban on those with \"serious mental di sorder, infectious pulmonary tube rculosis, or other infectious diseases that may endanger the public health in a major way.\" 66 B. Application of the International Health Regulations On May 14, 2007, the Chinese government declared that the Intern ational Health Regulations (IHR), which would enter into fo rce on June 15, 2007, applied to the entire territory of the People's Republic of China, incl uding the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The then MOH of China was designated as China's \"national foca l point,\" pursuant to Paragraph 1 of Article 4 of the IHR. The IHR also designated the local health administrative authorities as the health aut horities responsible for the impl ementation of the IHR in their respective jurisdictions, and the General Admini stration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of China and its local offices as th e competent authorities at the points of entry referred to in Article 22 of the IHR.67 In this declaration, China vowed to revise its Frontie r Health and Quarantine Law to meet the needs of applying the IHR.

The Law Library of Congress 62 Egypt George Sadek Senior Legal Analyst SUMMARY Law No. 137 of 1958, as amended by Law No. 55 of 1979, regulates the powers of public health authorities in Egypt in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. Additionally, Presidential Decree No. 268 of 1975 defines the Ministry of Health's mission and objectives. The World Health Organization has worked closely with the Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) to establish a cooperation st rategy to prevent and control public health crises. The MOH posted on its official website an action plan to combat infectious diseases in public places, including schools and medical facilities. While no cases of Ebola have been reported in Egypt, the MOH has issued a precautionary announcement to Egyptians. I. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System Egypt is a low-income, developing country with a per capita GDP of about LE47,050 (approximately US$6,600).1 The country is divided into twen ty-seven governorates. The major provider of health care services is the Ministry of Health (MOH). Health services offered by the MOH are free of charge to all E gyptian citizens. Those services are subsidized by the Egyptian government. The MOH supervises a nationwide he alth care system th at includes outpatient clinics and urban hospitals.2 The current structure of the health care system was developed during the 1960s under the administration of President Nasser, who adopted socialist economic policies.3 II. Powers of Public Health Authorities Law No. 137 of 1958, as amended by Law No. 55 of 1979 (Combating Contagious Diseases), defines the term \"infectious dise ase\" and regulates the powers of public health authorities in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. 4 Article 6 of the Law allows health authorities in any province of the country to requir e all individuals, incl uding adults, to be vaccinated against any infectious diseases.5 Article 10 grants the Minister of Health the power to issue necessary 1 The World Factbook: Egypt , CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY , https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the- world-factbook/geos/eg.html (last updated June 22, 2014). 2 Ravi P.

Presidential Decree No. 268 of 1975 defines the mission and objec tives of the MOH. Article 1 of the decree provides that the Ministry's main mission is to pr otect the health of all Egyptian citizens through preventive and curative services at a centralized level. 10 The MOH has an array of objectives, which include the following: (1) shaping national health care policies; (2) recording h ealth care data and conducting economic health studies; (3) providing centralized health services, including central laboratories, pharmaceutical services, and manpower training; (4) monitoring the quality of medicine; (5) offering effective management during public health crises; (6) administrating health services and units; and (7) coordinating with domestic medical units on the local level in all governorates. 11 The administrative structure of the MOH consists of the following departme nts: (1) health care and nursing, (2) protective affair s and disease, (3) birt h control, (4) treatment, (5) training and research, (6) technical support, a nd (7) provincial health affairs. 12 III. Transparency of Public Heal th Crisis Management System According to an action plan to combat infectious disease issued by the MOH, the Ministry is required to report any outbreak of infectious diseases in public places.

Cooperation with the World Health Organization Egypt is a member of the World Health Organi zation (WHO), to which Egypt is obligated to report any outbreak, emergence, or r eemergence of infectious diseases.14 The WHO has also worked closely with the Egyptian MOH to esta blish a cooperation strate gy to assist in the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks. Th e WHO's local field office in Cairo, Egypt, has contributed to the Cairo Agenda for Action on Aid Effectiveness. According to a WHO progress report, the organization is curren tly working with health-related sectors, including the Ministry of Agriculture, to prevent an outbreak of the H5N1 influenza virus. It is also sharing expertise with the MOH to prevent and c ontrol the spread of hepatitis.15 V. Response to the Outbrea k of Infectious Diseases The MOH has posted on its official website an ac tion plan to combat infectious diseases in public places, including sc hools and medical facilities.16 According to a WHO report, the MOH is responsible for providing all necessary immunizations and vacci nations to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This strate gy has led to a decline in the number of people infected with such diseases as H1N5 and hepatitis.17 In an effort to monitor any possible outbreak, th e Egyptian health authorities have joined the regional rotavirus surveillance network and launch ed a national rotavirus surveillance program. The MOH has also established similar surveillance programs for other viruses such as measles, rubella, haemophilus influenza type B, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. 18 Finally, the MOH has establishe d an active program to contro l any outbreak of infectious diseases in health care facilities. The Minist ry has provided health car e facilities across the country with necessary guidelines to deal with such public health crises. 19 VI. Response to the Ebola Virus Outbreak While no cases of Ebola have been reported in Egypt, in respons e to this global h ealth threat the MOH has issued an announcement urging people to take the following precautionary measures: 14 WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION [WHO], COUNTRY COOPERATION STRATEGY FOR WHO AND EGYPT 2010-2014 (2010), http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooper ation_strategy/ccs_egy_en.pdf?ua=1 . 15 WHO, COUNTRY COOPERATION STRATEGY AT A GLANCE : EGYPT (Mar. 23, 2013), http://www.who.int/country focus/cooperation_ stra tegy/ccsbrief_egy_en.pdf . 16 MOH, G UIDELINES ON OUTBREAK OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES (2d ed. 2008), http://www.mohp. gov.eg/programs/InfectFight/DocLib/part11.pdf (in Arabic). 17 Law No. 137 of 1958, al-Jardah al-Rasm yah, vol. 27, 11 Sept. 1958, p. 15. 18 Id. p. 16. 19 Presidential Decree No. 268 of 1975, al-Jardah al-Rasm yah, vol. 2615, 23 Mar. 1975.

The Law Library of Congress 66 England Clare Feikert-Ahalt Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY The public health crisis system in England is based on broadly drafted modernized legislation and regulations. It operates on a lo cal level with primary health care providers using national guidelines to draft emergency pl ans. Designated agencies or departments are responsible for coordinating local efforts if the crisis becomes national or spills over into more than one local area. Multiagency groups help to coordinate the response. Cooperation and coordination is emphasized as es sential to manage public health crises. The legislation regarding infectious diseases has recently been amended to take into account modern-day challenges and scientific knowledge. I. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System A. Government Responsibilities The Secretary of State has a legal duty to protec t public health in England from disease and other dangers.1 The Secretary has established a number of bodies and programs to meet this duty. The National Resilience Capabilities Programme (NRCP) is the core framework through which the government is preparing for emergencie s across all parts of the United Kingdom. 2 This program aims to ensure that the UK has a well-prepared infr astructure that is able to address rapidly and effectively a wide range of emergencies. The program is divided into a number of different groups, one of which includes in fectious diseases in humans.3 The Department of Health is the lead organization in planning for this type of emergency. The Department of Health, the National Health Se rvice (NHS), Public Health England, and local government authorities 4 are the main organizations respon sible for addressing public health crises and, under the NRCP, inf ectious diseases. These orga nizations are responsible for 1 Health and Social Care Act 2012, c. 7, \u00a7 11, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted , inserting \u00a7 2A into the National Health Service Act 2006, c. 41, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/ 41/contents . 2 HM GOVERNMENT , EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND RECOVERY : NON STATUTORY GUIDANCE ACCOMPANYING THE CIVIL CONTINGENCIES ACT 2004, Oct. 2013, \u00b6 3.4.2, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/ attachment_data/file/253488/Emergency_Respons e_and_Recovery_5th_edition_October_2013.pdf . 3 Id. 4 \"Local Authority\" is defined in section 1 of the Public He alth (Control of Disease) Act 1984, c. 22, as district councils, county councils, county borough councils in Wales, the Common Council of the City of London, the Sub- Treasurer of the Inner Temple and the Under-Treasurer of the Middle Temple, and the Council of the Isles of Scilly; see also UK Resilience, Pandemic Flu , CABINET OFFICE (Apr. 2008), http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ukresilience/ pandemicflu.aspx .

Department of Health The Department of Health is involved on an orga nizational level in the pr evention and control of infectious diseases by developi ng policies and setting standards. It is the lead government department involved in planning for a human influenza pandemic.7 Responsibility for the functions of the Department of Health rests wi th the Chief Medical Officer, the government's principal medical advisor.8 There are a number of bodies th at advise the Department of Health and the NHS on the control and prevention of infectious disease. One of these is Public Health England, an executive agency of the Department of Health.9 Public Health England's role is to \"protect and improve the nation's health and wellbeing, and reduce health inequalities\"10 and its general duty is to fulfil the Secretary of State's stat utory duty to protect public health.11 It works in a number of areas to discharge these functions, such as pr oviding the government, the NHS, public health professionals, and the public with scientific advice; supporting local government with advice on how to protect health; and ensuring that effectiv e local and national arrange ments are in place to respond to health protection concerns and emergencies.12 Public Health E ngland is responsible for the Secretary of State's duties under the Hea lth and Social Care Act 2012.

National Health Service The National Health Service (NHS) is responsible for the diagnosis and tr eatment of individuals with infectious diseases, as well as for improving and protecti ng the health of the population.17 Regarding the latter two functions, the NHS has a broad array of responsibi lities to prevent and control infectious diseases that include implementing health progr ams, preventing the spread of the disease, surveying the local community, and monitoring any emergence or transmission of infectious disease. Under the Civil Contingences Act the NHS must demonstrate the ab ility to effectively respond to an emergency, including in fectious disease outbreaks. 18 This type of prep aration in England is known as emergency preparedness, resilience, and response (EPRR).19 To manage its EPRR responsibilities, the NHS has established commissioning boards and c linical commissioning groups.20 It has also established local health resili ence partnerships to co ordinate the work and planning for EPRR across all health bodies.21 13 Category 1 responders are designated by the Civil Continge ncies Act; they are \"likely to be at the core of the response to most emergencies [and] are subject to the full range of civil protection duties in the Act.\" They currently include the police, fire and rescue, health bodies, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, local authorities and the Environment Agency.

Local Authorities Local authorities have a number of statutory obligations and pow ers to control the spread of infectious diseases under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.22 The types of infectious diseases that trigge r the local authorities' powers under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act are known as notifiable diseases a nd are specified in the Act and the regulations made under the Act.23 Additional infectious diseases ha ve been added to the list through regulations, and the Secretary of State has discretion to add more , although the inclusion of any further disease is dependent upon the impact of the disease.24 Diseases subject to the WHO's International Health Regulations ar e contained in the list. Doctor s and health care providers also have the duty to report other diseases th at pose a significant risk to human health.25 All incidents of notifiable dis eases must be reported to an officer appointed by the local authority. 26 There are no requirements in the legisl ation as to whom should be appointed, but typically the post goes to the local Consultant in Communicable Disease Control. Doctors and health care providers are under a legal duty to complete the no tification form immediately on suspecting or diagnosing a notifiable disease. La b confirmation of the suspected disease is not needed in order for notification to occur.27 Once notified, the proper officer must report the case to Public Health England within three da ys, or twenty four hours for urgent cases.28 To ensure that health needs are met on a local le vel, local authorities can order that a disease not provided for in the Public Hea lth (Control of Disease) Act or in regulations issued by the Secretary of State be labeled a notifia ble disease within its designated area. 29 The order must specify the provisions in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Ac t that apply to the disease and, unless the situation is an emergency, be approved by the Secretary of State.30 22 Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, c. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/ 22/contents . 23 are acute encepha litis, acute hepatitis, cholera, hemolytic uremic sy ndrome (HUS), infectious bloody diarrhea, invasive group streptococcal disease, legionnaires' disease, leprosy, malari a, measles, meningococcal septicemia, mumps, plague, rabies, rubella, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), scarlet fever, small pox, tetanus, tuberculosis, t yphus, viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), whooping cough, and yellow fever. 24 Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010, SI 2010/695, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/ 659/made . 25 Guidance: Organisms: How to Report , PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND (May 1, 2010), https://www.gov.uk/notifiable-diseases -and-causative-organisms-how-to-report . 26 Health Protection 2-3, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/659/made . 27 Id.; see also PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND , supra note 5. 28 Public Health England, supra note 5. 29 Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, c. 22, \u00a7 16(1). 30 Id. \u00a7 16(2).

Civil Contingencies Secretariat The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) assist s the government in preparing for public health crises. The CCS was established in 2001 as part of the Cabinet Office to improve the UK central government's ability to prepare for and handle emergencies.31 The CCS assists relevant organizations, both within the government and outside of it, in planning and preparing responses to emergency situations. The work of the CCS c oncentrates on four main areas: risk assessment, preparation and planning, response and r ecovery, and building a resilient society. 32 F. Department for Environment and Rural Affairs The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) plays an important role in any health crisis related to a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans.33 T h e Minister of Agriculture has wide-ranging powers, which are di scussed in Part II(E), below. G. Port Health Authorities Port health authorities al so exist throughout England.34 During an emergency, their primary function is to control inf ectious diseases at ports of entry into the country.35 The port health authorities may be part of a local authority, or in some cases they may be a single authority that conducts the functions across a numb er of local authorities. Th e port health authorities work closely with a number of other government bodies.36 H. Collection of Public Health Information Diseases surveillance in the UK is based on stat utory reporting required of doctors and other health workers who diagnose or suspect notifiable diseases. 37 Statutory reporting requirements are contained in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act and the Health Protection (Notification) Regulatio ns 2010. The Act requires registered medical practitioners who become aware or suspect that a patient is suffering from a notifiable disease to submit a certificate containing the patient's details to the local authority.38 Laboratories that confirm the diagnosis 31 Cabinet Office and National Steering Committee on Warning & Informing the Public, Improving the UK's Ability to Absorb, Respond to and Recover from Emergencies , http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ukresilience/ ccs.aspx (last updated Sept. 18, 2014). 32 Id. 33 About Us, DEP'T FOR ENV'T, FOOD & RURAL AFFAIRS , https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department- for-environment-food-rural-affairs/about (last visited Nov. 5, 2014). 34 Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2. 35 HM GOVERNMENT , supra note 2, \u00b6 3.2.26. 36 Id. \u00b6 3.2.26. 37 Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. 38 Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, \u00a7 11.

Decisions and Decision Makers In the United Kingdom, the decision makers are determined according to the structure provided by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.41 All responder organizations designated as category 1 under this statute follow a nationally recognized st ructure of three different levels of command\u2014 operational, tactic al, and strategic.42 Operational (also known as bronze) command refers to people managing the working elements of the respons e in such settings as hospital wards or the scenes of major incidents.43 Tactical (also known as silve r) command is responsible for managing an organization's response to an incident . Tactical command mu st ensure that plans are in place to achieve objectives set by st rategic command and that operational command provides an efficient, coordinated response.44 Strategic (also known as gold) command has overall command of the organization's resources. Th is level of command liaises with partners to develop strategy and policies and allocat es funding to help address incidents.45 For incidents and emergencies involving severa l organizations and agencies, a Strategic Coordinating Group may be convened to coordinate. 46 The NHS's emergency response teams take the form of area Commi ssioning Boards. In cases of wide-reaching emergencies, the Commissioning Board national team can assume co mmand of all of the resources of the NHS across England, and the regional Commissioning Bo ards take action based on the commands of that team.47 J. Crisis Triggers In addition to regional procedures for outbreaks of infectious diseases, a general health crisis in England is referred to under the broader term \"m ajor incident.\" The NHS defines the term as [a]ny occurrence that presents ser ious threat to the health of the community, disruption to the service or causes (or is likely to cause) such numbers or types of casualties as to 39 Health Protection (Notifica tion) Regulations 2010, \u00b6 5. 40 Notifiable Diseases: Report , PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND , https://www.gov.uk/government/ publications/notifiable-diseases-current-weekly-report (last updated Nov. 5, 2014). 41 Civil Contingencies Act 2004, c. 36, sched. 1, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents . 42 NHS Commissioning Board, NHS Commissioning Board Command and Control Framework for the NHS During Significant Incidents and Emergencies, Jan. 7, 2013, \u00b6 5.1, http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp- content/uploads/2013/01/comm-control-frame.pdf . 43 Id. \u00b6 5.2. 44 Id. \u00b6 5.2. 45 Id. \u00b6 5.2. 46 Id. \u00b6 5.3. 47 Id. \u00b6 6.1.18.

II. Powers To Prevent the Spread of Disease A. Legal Overview The government was criticized at the turn of the century for not having a clear, coherent legislative and regulatory framework for an effectiv e public health crisis system that could deal with major health risks, particularly the risk of human pandemic diseases.49 A 2003 report from the House of Lords recommended that the roles and respon sibilities of the groups involved in the fight against infectious dis ease be more clearly defined.50 The result of this report was the development of the NHS's Emergency Pl anning Guidance, first published in 2005.51 T h i s guidance provides general principles on how NHS organizations should handle major incidents, which are defined to encompass \"big bang\" incident s, such as casualties arising from a terrorist attack, and \"rising tide\" inci dents, such as an infectious disease epidemic.52 The primary piece of legislation that addresses public health emergencies is the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. 53 This Act served to conso lidate a number of pieces of legislation from the nineteenth century, much of which was \"directly derived from Victorian antecedents.\"54 The laws were based on the scientific knowledge and social circumstances of those times and, therefore, did not address modern risks, such as contamination from chemicals or radiation. This Act was reformed in 2009 after the Law Reform Commission recommended that public health legislat ion was overdue for review,55 noting that the scientific understanding of disease contagion at the time the laws were drafted were not congr uent with today's scientific knowledge. Additional powers to detain individuals suffering from diseases caused concern that the Law would not stand up to a challeng e brought under the Human Rights Act 1998, as it 48 Id. \u00b6 1.4. 49 A STRONG BRITAIN IN AN AGE OF UNCERTAINTY : THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY , Cm. 7953, 2010-11, \u00b6 HOUSE LORDS , SELECT COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY , FIGHTING INFECTION , FOURTH REPORT , H.L. 138, 2002-03, http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa /ld200203/ldselect/ldsctech/138/138.pdf . 51 National Health Service: Department of Health, Emergency Preparedness Division, NHS Emergency Planning 2005: Underpinning Materials, \u00b6 2.2.4, http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/ http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_dig italassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_081303.pdf . 52 Id. 53 Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, c. 22, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/22/contents . 54 THE LAW COMMISSION : NINTH PROGRAMME OF LAW REFORM , March 2005, H.C. 535, http://lawcommission. justice.gov.uk/docs/lc293_9th_Programme.pdf . 55 Id. \u00b6 4.4. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: England The Law Library of Congress 73 would be \"difficult [for the government] to argue th at exercise of these powers is 'necessary' or even effective in disease control.\"56 The Law Reform Commission ex pressed \"fear . . . that the effectiveness of the British response to a major outbreak of contagious disease could be significantly impaired by th e defects in the law.\" 57 As a result of these concerns, the government enacted the Health and Social Care Act 2008, which repealed a large number of provisions in the Public He alth (Control of Disease) Act 1984. 58 The amendments aimed to bring the provisi ons concerning infections up to date and take into account other concerns, su ch as radiation a nd chemical contamination. The updated provisions of the 1984 Act provide two areas under which regulations may be made in relation to diseases. The first relates to in-countr y provisions and the second to England's international borders.59 B. Current Laws and Regulations Under the Health and Social Care Act 2008, th e Secretary of State may make regulations (referred to as \"health protection regulations\") to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to an incident or to the spread of infection or contamination in England, even if the threat originat ed from outside the country.60 The Law provides examples of powers that the Secretary of State may exercise by regulation, including imposing or enabling restricti ons or requirements on individua ls in the event of, or in response to, a threat to public health; or providing local authorities with functions to monitor public health risks.61 The restrictions may include keeping a child away from school, prohibitions or restrictions on events or gatherings, a \"special restric tion or requirement\" or \"Part 2A order,\" 62 or requirements 56 Robyn Martin, The Exercise of Public Health Powers in Cases of Infectious Disease: Human Rights Implications , 14(1) M ED.

Special restrictions may only be imposed in response to a \"serious and imminent threat to public health, or . . . contingent on there being such a threat at the time when it is imposed.\" Id. \u00a7 45D(4). Part 2A orders are described below. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: England The Law Library of Congress 74 with regard to the handling and treatment of dead bodies.63 Any restriction imposed under the provisions of this Act must be proportionate with the aim that it is trying to achieve,64 in order to comply with human rights prin ciples adopted in the UK. The Secretary of State may not make regula tions requiring that a person receive medical treatment, including vaccinations, as was the case under previous legislation. However, special requirements and restrictions may, if there is a serious and imminent threat to public health, require \"medical examinations, removal to or dete ntion in a hospital or ot her establishment, or isolation or quarantine.\" 65 The statute limits the powers and penalties the regulations may confer. The regulations can confer functions on local aut horities and other persons; create offenses, although these cannot be punishable with impris onment or a fine of more than \u00a320,000 (approximately US$35,000); enable courts to order that anyone convicted of an offense under the regulations take or pay for remedial action; make regulations that apply to different areas of the country; 66 provide for the execution and enforcement of restrictions or requirements imposed; provide for a system of appeals from and revi ews of decisions made under the regulations; allow or prohibit charges to be levied; permit or require the payment of incentive pa yments, compensation, and expenses; and/or provide for the resolution of disputes.67 To prevent the spread of infection or contaminat ion, the Public Health (C ontrol of Disease) Act provides that Justices of the Peace may impose restrictions and requir ements on individuals, premises, groups, and objects throug h orders, known as \"Part 2A Orde rs.\" Only local authorities may apply to a Justice of the Peace for a Part 2A Order, and these orders may, in certain circumstances, be made without notifyi ng the individual aff ected by the Order. 68 Once made, an individual affected by the order, the local authorities, or any other body that is responsible for enforcing or executing the order may a pply to have it revoked or varied.69 63 Id. \u00a7 45C. 64 Id. \u00a7 45D. 65 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 45D-E.

The Justice of the Peace may issue the order only if he/she is satisfied that a person may be infected or contaminated, could present significant harm to human health, and there is a risk the person may infect or contaminate others. 72 The Justice of the Peace may also order that the suspected infected or co ntaminated person provide information about the identity and location of other individuals that may be in fected or contaminated who pose a risk to others, to enable \"contact tracing\" of these individuals.73 Justices of the Peace have similar powers to make orders in relation to premises or things that may be infected or contaminated when they c ould present significant harm to human health and there is a risk that they ma y infect or contaminate humans. 74 For items (things), the order may impose a number of restrictions or requirements, including that the thing retained; isolated; quarantined; disinfected; decontaminated; destroyed; the case of dead bodies, cremated or buried. 75 For premises, the order may impose restrictions or requirements, including that the pr emises be closed, disinfected, 70 Id. \u00a7 45L. 71 Id. 72 Id. \u00a7 45G. 73 Id. 74 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 45H-I. 75 Id. \u00a7 45H.

Sanctions and Fines for Failing to Comply with Requirements Failing to comply with the requirements of an order without a reasonable excuse can result in a fine of up to \u00a320,000 (approximately US$35,000). Wher e the court is satisfied that the \"failure or willful obstruction constituting the offence has caused premises or things to become infected or contaminated or otherwise damaged them in a material way\" by an individual convicted of an offense under the Act, the court may require the individual to ta ke or pay for remedial action. 81 The police may take individuals that contravene an order of detention, isolation, or quarantine into custody and return them to the place specified in the order.82 E. Animals and Disease England's experience with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and foot and mouth disease has caused it to introduce nu merous pieces of legislation to prevent the spread of such diseases and halt any impact they might have on public health. The Animal Health Act 198183 (the 1981 Act) contains broad provisions ranging from requiri ng the disinfection and cleansing of places where animals reside or visit, to pr ohibiting animal movement and imports, to requiring vaccinations and the slaughter of animals. The Minister of Agriculture has wide-rangi ng powers under the 1981 Act and can issue orders setting standards for the declarat ion of infected areas that state who can declare an area as infected, as well as the effect, conseque nce, and duration of such a declaration. 84 The Minister can make orders prescribing the seizure, detention, or disposal of diseased animals, or those suspected of being diseased. To prevent and reduce the risk of spreading any animal disease to humans, the Minister can make an order providing that any provisi on of the 1981 Act will apply to a specified disease.85 Enforcement of the 1981 Act falls to the police, who can arrest and detain any person suspected of, or found committing, an offense under the Act. Punishment is either imprisonment and/or a fine. If a person infects an animal with a diseas e specified in the 1981 Act, he/she is guilty of an offense and can be fined and/or imprisoned for up to two years, as well as disqualified from keeping or dealing with any animals.86 F. Vaccines The UK currently does not have th e capability to produce large numbers of vaccines; most are purchased from France and Belgium.87 Certain strategic vacc ines and drugs are being 81 Id. \u00a7 45O. 82 Id. \u00a7 45N. 83 Animal Health Act 1981, c. 22, as amended , http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/22/contents . 84 Id. \u00a7 17, as amended . 85 Id. \u00a7 29, as amended . 86 Id. \u00a7 28A-B. 87 HOUSE OF LORDS , supra note 50, \u00b6 4.8.

Transparency of Public He alth Crisis Management System A. Disclosing Information to the Public There is a duty under the Civil Contingencies Act 200489 for those connected with the public health crisis system to disclo se information to the public, and the NHS has noted that this is based upon the \"belief that a well-informed public is better able to respond to an emergency, and to minimise the impact of the emerge ncy on the community and on NHS services.\"90 The NHS follows the Civil Contingencies Act Ten Step Cycle91 of communications, which helps to provide for effec tive communication.92 The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 places two duties on responders to public health crises. The first duty is to warn and inform the public of any likely risks and threats that NHS organizations may a ddress, and of any planned responses to these risks and threats. The second duty is the organiza tion's response to a crisis. The NHS notes that when making information available to the public in crises, the communications must be \"simple and easily digestible.\"93 B. Methods of Dissemination There is no formal emergency broadcast system in England for public health crises, but there are long-standing protocols as to how inform ation should be disseminated. The NHS has implemented a web-based cascade system known as the Central Alerting System that issues \"patient safety alerts, important public health messages and other safety critical information and guidance to the NHS and others.\"94 The NHS notes that the media will play a key role in disseminating information to the public and that there must be clear guidelines for providing clear and accurate information through these means.95 88 Statement on Swine Flu/AH1N1, DEP'T OF HEALTH , http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh. gov.uk/en/MediaCentre/Pressreleasesar chive/DH_098573?PageOperation=email (last updated Apr. 27, 2009). 89 Civil Contingencies Act 2004, c. 36, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents . 90 NHS COMMISSIONING BOARD , supra note 20, \u00b6 12.12. 91 GOV.UK, CIVIL CONTINGENCIES ACT (2004): DUTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC , 2007, https://www.gov. uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60906/10_step_cycle.pdf . 94 Central Alerting System , NHS, https://www.cas.dh.gov.uk/Home.aspx (last visited October 29, 2014).

Effectiveness of the Communications System The BSE crisis, followed by the foot and mout h epidemic, led to a massive loss of public confidence in \"official pronouncements about in fectious disease issu es\" from government institutions.96 This loss of confidence wa s exacerbated by the government repeatedly stating that certain events pose no risk to the public's health.97 National Audit Office examinations of debriefs to the media also found that there wa s a lack of coordination and consultation in disseminating this information, resulting in in appropriate health advice being given to the public.98 The communication system during the swine fl u outbreak in 2009 appeared to operate effectively, with statistics on indi viduals who were tested for the flu, as well as those who tested positive, available on the Internet from reli able government pages and distributed via the media. 99 IV. Cooperation with the WHO England complies with the WHO's International H ealth Regulations. The provisions from these regulations were implemented in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act, 100 as supplemented by regulations. V. Recent Developments Public Health England has helped to provide en hanced screening for Ebola at England's main ports of entry (Heathrow, Gatwick, and St. Pancra s). \"Targeted Passengers\" are those identified by the Border Force officers as those who have trav elled from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. These passengers must have their temperature ta ken and complete a questionnaire that includes information about their current he alth, travel history, and any cont act with Ebola patients. The results of these tests and questions will determine whether the person will be permitted to continue their journey with advi ce or receive additional checks and possibly be transferred to a hospital. 101 96 HOUSE OF LORDS , supra note 50, \u00b6 7.20. 97 Most notably, during government announcements in the midst of the BSE crisis, the government reassured the public that British beef was safe to eat, with the Agri culture Minister feeding his daughter a beef burger to demonstrate the point. In the BSE case, the government late r asserted that its statement about British beef being safe to eat did not mean that there was no risk involved. 98 COMPTROLLER & AUDITOR GENERAL , NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE , FACING THE CHALLENGE : NHS EMERGENCY PLANNING IN ENGLAND , H.C. 36, 2002-03, at 37, http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2002/11/020336.pdf . 99 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ET AL ., UK PANDEMIC INFLUENZA COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY 2012, at 15, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads /attachment_data/file/213268/UK-Pandemic-Influenza- Communications-Strategy-2012.pdf . 100 Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, c. 22, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/ 22/contents . 101 Press Release, Public Health England, Department of Health and NHS England, Enhanced Ebola Screening Process Begins (Oct. 14, 2014), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-health-england-enhanced-ebola- screening-process . The Law Library of Congress 80 France Nicolas Boring Foreign Law Specialist* SUMMARY At the national level in France, the manageme nt of a public health crisis caused by a communicable disease is primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, which is aided in its task by public establishments un der its supervision such as the Institut de Veille Sanitaire, France's national health mon itoring institute. At the local level, the prefects, who are the state representatives, have also been given specific powers in times of epidemic crisis. A reserve health corps was created in 2007. France drew up its first comprehensive national plan for the prevention and control of an influenza pandemic in 2004, and last updated it in 2011. The plan is aimed at protecting the French population, as well as French citi zens living abroad, against a pandemic threat and limiting the social and economic consequences of a pandemic. Recently, the government has taken steps to prev ent or limit the spread of the Ebola virus in France. These steps include screenings at ai rports in at-risk countries, the preparation of specialized wards in hospitals, and the di ssemination of information to both health care professionals and the general public. I. Introduction Public health crises can take many forms, such as disease epidemics; large-scale incidents of food or water contamination; and harmful expos ure to chemical, radiological, or biological agents. Their causes may be natural, accidental, or deliberate. How France deals with a crisis and which public authorities are involved depends on the nature of the crisis. This report first focuses on the operational management of a pub lic health crisis caused by a communicable disease. It then addresses, as examples, the 2009 national plan for the prevention and control of an influenza pandemic, and measures recently take n in the context of th e current Ebola crisis. The administrative division of France plays a ro le in how the governme nt prepares for and manages a health crisis. France is divided into twenty-two regions, and there are ninety-six d\u00e9partements within metropolitan France. Each d\u00e9partement has a pr\u00e9fet (prefect), who is the representative of the central government. For purposes of emergency planning, France is also divided into seven zones of de fense, each under the responsibil ity of a zone prefect who will manage emergency crises exceeding the boundaries of the d\u00e9partement . 1 The region prefects are also given specific powers in times of epidemic crisis.2 Finally, France has incorporated into its * This is a revised and updated version of a report authored in 2009 by Nicole Atwill, Senior Legal Specialist at the Law Library of Congress (retired). 1 CODE DE LA DEFENSE art.

II. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management System The operational management of a public health crisis caused by a communicable disease principally involves the Ministry of Health; the Minist ry of Interior; the tional health monitoring institute; the pr\u00e9fets (prefects), who are the state representatives in the d\u00e9partements ; and the mayors. A reserve health corps was also created in 2007. A. Directorate General of Health The Ministry of Health is divi ded into several directorates. Among them, the Dire ction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9 (DGS, the General Directorate of Hea lth) sets forth health pol icies and, as a guarantor of health security, may take a ny measures to prevent or res pond to public he alth crises\u2014in particular, a crisis related to communicable diseas es. Following audits and reports prepared after the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) a nd other health crises, the DGS was reorganized in 2007 to reinforce its action on pr evention, to better manage em ergencies and health threats, and to improve its governance and performance. 4 The Health Code provides that when an epidemic threatens the count ry or part of the country and local means are insufficient to stop it, the Mini ster of Health may, by means of a ministerial regulation, set forth all appropria te measures and allocate duties to prevent the spread of such disease. The decree may give authority to the pr efects to implement one or more of the needed measures. 5 The measures taken are regularly revi ewed by the High Council for Public Health (Haut Conseil de la Sant\u00e9 Publique), wh ich checks whether they are appropriate.6 Created in 2004, this Council comprises six specialized co mmissions: transmissible diseases; chronic diseases; risks linked to the environment; patient safety; education and promotion of health; and lastly, evaluation and strategy.7 One of its missions is to provi de the necessary expertise for the 3 D\u00e9cret No 2007-1073 du 4 juillet 2007 portant publication la Assembl\u00e9e la sant\u00e9 le 23 mai [Decree No. 2007-1073 of July 4, 2007, on the publication of the International Health Regulations (2005) Adopted by the Fifty-eighth Health Assembly on May 23, 2005], J OURNAL OFFICIEL DE LA R\u00c9PUBLIQUE FRAN\u00c7AISE [J.O.] [OFFICIAL http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/ affichTexte.do;jsessionid=AA3B324B58F8360A41FC03636B303E8A. tpdjo06v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000467563&categorieLien=id . 4 \u00e0 l'organisation de l'administration centrale du Minist\u00e8re charg\u00e9 de code de la sant\u00e9 publique [Decree No. 2007-840 of May 11, 2007, on the Organisation of the Central Administration of the Ministry of Health, and Amending the Health Code], J.O., May 13, 2007, p. 11240, http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessi onid=DF0736163CBBEC68BCF10AE49A507B8E.tpdjo06v_3? 5 CODE DE LA SANTE art.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: France The Law Library of Congress 83 To perform its mission, the InVS has access to a network of se venteen regional centers called Cellules interr\u00e9gionales d'\u00e9pid\u00e9miologie (CIRE, Inter-regional Epidemiological Units). These CIRE fall under the authority of General Director of the InVS, but are integrated into local Agences r\u00e9gionales de sant\u00e9 (ARS, Regional Health Agencies). 14 ARS were created in 2009 to centralize and better coor dinate the various government hea lth-related resources at the regional level.15 The CIRE investigate and assess pot ential health safety warning signs,16 and provide each ARS with methodological support and i ndependent expertise regarding such warning signs.17 In addition to the CIRE, the InVS works with a great number of other organizations that contribute to the monitoring of public he alth, particularly doctors and hospitals. 18 Medical doctors and laboratories (both public and private) must report to their local ARS diseases that necessitate urgent local, national, or interna tional intervention, and diseases that require monitoring for the evaluation of public health policies.19 A list of the diseases that must be reported is published in the Code of Public Health and is regularly updated.20 Information must be sent to the ARS and InVS in a ma nner that protects the patients' privacy,21 and all those who have access to this information, in whatever cap acity, are required to obs erve the confidentiality of the information.22 A violation of the confidentiality re quirement is punishable by one year of imprisonment and a fine of \u20ac15,000 (approximately US$17,000).23 The Public Health Code does not provide for a penalty when a doctor fails to re port a listed disease. However, failure to report may be prosecuted under the provisions governing the risks caused to another24 or the omission to render assistance25 when such failure results in the cont amination of other individuals either 14 Missions des CIRE [Missions of the CIRE ], INSTITUT 2011), http://www.invs. itoires/Missions-des-Cire portant r\u00e9forme de l'h\u00f4pital et aux territoires [Law No. 2009-879 of July 21, 2009, Re forming Hospitals and Regarding Patients, Health, and Territories] (July 21, 2009), http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020879475& categorieLien=id ; http://www.ars. sante.fr/Presentation-generale.89790.0.html (last 2014). 16 Missions des CIRE , supra note 14. 17 Qui sommes nous?

Responding to the Ebola Crisis The first case of Ebola infection in Guinea was identified by a French laboratory on March 23, 2014. This prompted French authorities to info rm the European Commission and the European Health Security Committee, and to monitor the epidemiological situation in African countries where the virus is present in collaboration with the WHO and the European Center for Disease Control. 50 An interministry task force, including a pr efect and representative s from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was set up to c oordinate the French response to the Ebola threat.51 The InVS is continuously monitoring the epidemiological situation, both in France and internationally, and special measures were put into place for the early detection and isolation of any person who might be contagious on French territory.52 Screening processes have been set up at the airports of at-risk coun tries to assess traveler s going to France, and informational brochures have been given to air lines to be distributed to passengers traveling between France and at-risk countries.53 French citizens ar e encouraged to postpone any travel to at-risk countries.54 If a person infected with the Ebola viru s is detected in France, that person is 44 Id. at 39. 45 Id. 46 Id. at 47. 47 Id. at 50. 48 Id. at 55-61. 49 Id. at 65. 50 Nous agissons contre Ebola [We Are Acting Against Ebola INIST\u00c8RE DES AFFAIRES SOCIALES , DE LA SANT\u00c9 [MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS , HEALTH , AND WOMEN 'S RIGHTS ], http://ebola.sante.gouv. fr/nous-agissons-contre-ebola/ (last visited Oct. 30, 2014). 51 Press Release, [Pri me Minister], Reinforces the Interm inistry Organization Against the Ebola presse_de_manuel_valls_premier_ministre_-_crise_ebola.pdf. 52 Nous agissons contre Ebola, supra note 50. 53 Id. 54 Id.

The Law Library of Congress 88 Greece Theresa Papademetriou Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY The Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity is in charge of public health issues in Greece, such as those related to communicable diseases, weather-related disasters, and others. Two major centers play a central role in coordinating, planning, and fighting the spread of communicable diseases: (a) the National Health Operations Center, and (b) the Center for the Control and Prevention of Communicable Di seases. In response to the Ebola crisis, Greece established a comprehensive plan to fight the virus that involved setting-up a special unit for potential victims and staffing entry points with medical experts to detect suspected cases, among other measures. As a Member of the European Union and the World Health Organization, Greece complies with European Union and World Health Organization legislation on issues related to public health crises and is in constant collaboration with both entities. I. Introduction In Greece, public health issues fall within the domain of the Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity. The mission of the Ministry is to prom ote the health care of citizens; provide a high level of medical, pharmaceutical, and hospital se rvices; and work towards the prevention of diseases, in compliance with European Union (E U) legislation and regu lations issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 Greece is required to comply with EU Decision No. 1082/2013 on Serious Cross-Border Threats to Health2 and is also in close contact with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, established by the EU.3 In addition, Greece participates in the Early Warning and Response System established in 1998 in order to provide notification of alerts concerning serious publ ic health threats with cross-border implications. 4 The Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity also participates in the Health Security Committee, established at the EU level.5 As a WHO member, Greece ratified the revised 2005 International Health Regulations, which entered into force in June 2007 and require WHO Members to provide notif ication of all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. 6 In February 2014, 1 HELLENIC REPUBLIC , MINISTRY OF HEALTH , http://www.moh.gov.gr/articles/ministry/organogramma/45- armodiothtes-toy-ypoyrgeioy-ygeias-kai-koinwnikhs-allhleggyhs (in Greek; last visited Nov. 26, 2014). 2 Decision No. 1082/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 on Serious Cross- Border Threats to Health and Repealing Decision No. 2119/1998/ EC, 2013 O.J.

National Agencies Responsible for Public Emergencies At the domestic level, Greece has established two major agencies in order to effectively address public health crises, including na tural disasters, communicable diseases, weather-related events, illegal migration, and others. A. National Health Operations Center The National Health Operations Center (NHOC ) (in Greek, EKEPY) was established in 2004, during Greece's preparations for the Olympic Game s. Its headquarters are located in Athens, while four divisions operate in other areas of Greece. The tasks of the NHOC are to assist the public in case of communicable diseases, natural disasters, and weather-related events such as floods or fires, as well as healthcare mana gement associated w ith illegal migration. 10 It operates at the national level under the aegis of the Minister of Health and Social Solidarity and at the EU level by collaborating with si milar institutions in the EU.

KEELPNO also makes suggestions and recommendations on national policy concerning diseases to the Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity. In addition, KEELPNO informs the public and disseminates inform ation and circulars to groups that are at high risk of being infected by a disease.16 KEELPNO has been designated as the national authority to closely communicate with the Europ ean Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in particular in the area of developing surveillance responses to health threats, providing scientific opinions and scientific and techni cal assistance, collecting data and identifying emerging health threats, and conduc ting public information campaigns.17 III. National Response to the Ebola Crisis In the wake of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, KEELPNO announced that there is a \"very low\" risk of the Ebola virus reaching Greece.

The Law Library of Congress 92 India Tariq Ahmad Legal Research Analyst* SUMMARY India's Central Government and state govern ments are empowered to regulate health- related matters. The Epidemic Diseases Act is the main legislative framework at the central level for the prevention and spread of dangerous epidemic diseases. The Act empowers the central government to take necessary measures to deal with dangerous epidemic disease at ports of entry and exit. The Act also empowers the states to take special measures or promulgate regulations to deal with epidemics within their state jurisdictions. In such emergencies the states delegate some of these powers to the deputy commissioners in the districts, typically thro ugh state health acts or municipal corporation acts. Thus, responsibility for directly addressing the crisis rests with the deputy commissioner at the district level. I. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System India is a union of twenty-eight states and se ven territories, with a constitutional division of legislative responsibilities between the central government and the states. Both the central government (also known as the Union government ) of India and the state governments are constitutionally empowered to legislate on matters of public he alth. The Union law may deal with port quarantine, includi ng in connection with seamen's and marine hospitals.1 The law may also deal with interstate migration and quarantin e. State law may provide for matters relating to public health and sanitation, hospitals, and dispensaries.2 The central government and state laws may also provide for the prevention of the transmi ssion from one state to a nother of infectious or contagious diseases or pests aff ecting humans, animals, or plants.3 There are several central laws managing the prevention of contagious diseases. A. Union Laws 1. Epidemic Diseases Act The preamble to the 1897 Epidemic Diseases Act stat es that its objective is to provide for better prevention of the spread of dangerous epidemic diseases.4 The Epidemic Diseases Act empowers the state governments and the central government to take measures as may be warranted or necessary to control the further sp read of disease.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: India The Law Library of Congress 93 when satisfied that any part of its territory is threatened with an outbreak of a da ngerous disease, may adopt or authorize all measures, including quarantine, to preven t the outbreak of the disease.5 Similarly, the central government, when satisf ied that there is an imminent threat of an outbreak of an epidemic disease and that the provis ions of the law at that time are insufficient to prevent such an outbreak, may take measures and prescribe regulations allowing for the inspection of any ship or vesse l leaving or arriving at any por t and for the detention of any person arriving or intending to sail.6 Any person who disobeys any re gulation or order made under the 1897 Act may be charged with an offense under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. 7 The person in violation of the provision is liable, upon conviction, to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one month, a fine, or both. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, such offense, at the discretion of the trial magistrate, may be trie d summarily. No suit or legal proceeding lies against any person or authority for anything done, or in good faith intended to be done, under this Act. Some critics have observed that the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 \"is a century-o ld blunt act\" that needs a \"substantial overhaul to counter the rising burden of infectious diseases both new and old.\" 8 Some of the issues that require revisiting, they argue, are the \"definition of epidemic disease, territorial boundaries, ethics and human rights principl es, empowerment of officials, [and] punishment.\"9 It appears that India's National Ce ntre for Disease Control (NCDC) is developing a \"Public Health Emergencies Act,\" whic h is \"expected to take care of public health emergency situations in the count ry arising as a result of disa sters and bio-terrorism incidents besides dangerous epidemic diseases incl uding newly emerging infectious diseases.\"10 In recent years, the Epidemic Disease Act 1897 was invoked by a number of states in India to deal with the pandemic H1N1 (\"swine flu\") influe nza and other communicable diseases.11 2.

However, where any person is required under the rules to be disembarked and isolated for any period, the officer may cause him to be remove d to a hospital or another approved place and detain him in quarantine. 17 If necessary, the officer may require the person to report to him at specified intervals during the period of surveillance.18 The health officer may also remove, cause to be removed, or order the removal of a ny person, other than so meone proceeding on an international voyage, who, in the opinion of the offi cer, is likely to spread any quarantinable or infectious disease.19 When it is brought to the attention of the health officer, he may prohibit the embarkation on any aircraft of any person showing symptoms of any quarantinable disease and any person whom the health officer considers likely to transmit infec tion because of his clos e contact with a person showing symptoms of a quarantinable disease. 20 When a case of typhus or relapsing fever occurs at the airport, the person on an international vo yage who is considered liable by the officer to spread such a disease must be disinfected.21 Upon request, the health officer must issue to the commander of an aircraft a certificate specifying the health measures taken with respect to the aircraft, the parts of th e aircraft treated, the methods empl oyed, and the reasons why the measure have been applied.22 Regulations require that airline staff report an y suspected cases or passengers who in their opinion, from observations made in flight, may be suffering from symptoms of a quarantinable disease. 13 Id.

On August 26, 2014, six Indian nationals were isolated after returning from Liberia but al l tested negative for the virus.26 Similar quarantine restrictions are provide d under the Indian Po rt Health Rules 1955, 27 pursuant to the Indian Port Act,28 for passenger ships, cargo ships, and cruise ships. B. State Laws In order to prevent the outbreak of smallpox, states have enacted la ws in their territories for the vaccination of children under thirteen years of age. 29 For example, the Punjab Vaccination Act makes primary vaccination and revaccination of children compulsory throughout the state. Where the state's Superintendent of Vaccination has reasons to believe that a child was not vaccinated, he may serve notice on th e guardian of the child, requiring him to bring the child for vaccination. Upon failure to comply with the notice, a district magi strate may summon the guardian and demand an explanation for noncomplian ce with the Superintendent's notice. If the explanation is not satisf actory, the district magi strate may require him to produce the child for vaccination and also produce a certification of such vaccination within the period specified.30 II. Powers of Public Health Authorities Every state in India is divided in to districts, and the deputy comm issioner of each district is not only head of the district administration but al so acts as revenue collector and as district magistrate, responsible for the maintenan ce of law and order in his jurisdiction. 31 He is the key official, and acts as a liaison betw een the people and the government. 23 Nita Bhalla, India Goes on Alert for Ebola, with Thousands of Nationals in West Africa , REUTERS (Aug. 8, 2014), http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/08/08/ebola- india-virus-west-africa-idINKBN0G80OA20140808 . 24 Id. 25 Id. 26 Sneha Shankar , Ebola Alert: Six Indians Isolated at Delhi Airpor t Test Negative, More People Expected to Arrive and Be Tested , INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TIMES (Aug. 26, 2014), http://www.ibtimes.com/e bola-alert-six-indians- isolated-delhi-airport-test-negativ e-more-people-expected-arrive-1669216 . 27 Indian Port Health Rules, 1955. 28 Indian Ports Act, No. 15 of 1908, http://www.mumbaiport.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/6177609667.pdf . 29 E.g., Punjab Vaccination Act, No. 49 of 1953. 30 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 13-14. 31 Introduction , DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION SANGRUR , http://sangrur.nic.in/html/dcrole.html (last visited Nov. 17, 2014). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: India The Law Library of Congress 96 In order to meet a health crisis, following the ou tbreak of an epidemic, the Epidemic Diseases Act gives wide ranging powers to the states.32 The states, in such emergencies, delegate some of these powers to the deputy commissioners in the districts typically through state health acts or municipal corporation acts. Thus, responsibi lity for addressing the crisis rests with the deputy commissioner. A. State and Municipal Governments If at any time a state government is satisfied that th e state or any part of it is threatened with the outbreak of a dangerous disease and that ordinary provisions of the law in force at the time are insufficient for the purpose of addressing the outbreak, it may take, require, or empower any person to take such measures and, by public noti ce, prescribe such temporary regulations as may be necessary to be observed by the public or by any person or class of persons for the prevention of the outbreak or spread of such disease. 33 A state government may also take measures and prescribe regulations for the inspection, vaccination, and inoculation of persons traveling by road or rail, including their segregation in a hospital, temporary accommodati on, or otherwise, if such persons are suspected by the inspecting officer of being inf ected with any such disease. 34 A state government, by general or special orde r, may also empower a deputy commissioner to exercise, in relation to his di strict, all the powers under sect ion 2 of the 1897 Act that are exercisable by the state government in relation to the state, other than to determin e the manner in which and by whom any expenses are to be defray ed. Many of these powers are prescribed in Municipal Corporation Acts 35 governing \"major municipal areas,\"36 or Public Health Acts37 that also provide municipal-level co mmissioners or collectors with quarantine or other powers, including the following: Removal of a person to separate premises for medical treatment : \"Persons suffering from such a disease may be removed to any hospital or place for medical treatment, based on an order from the Commissi oner or the Collector.\"38 32 Epidemic Diseases Act, No. 3 of 1897, \u00a7 2(1). 33 Id. \u00a7 2(2). 34 Id. \u00a7 2(3). 35 See, e.g., Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, http://mcdonline. gov.in/tri/sdmc_mcdportal/publications/ DMC%20Act.v.11..pdf ; and Chennai City Municipal Corporation Nadu Act IV of 1919), Dangerous Neglect , XL(49) ECON. & POL.

Political and Civil Rights By its very nature, the ambit of section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act is wide enough to allow a state or a lower functionary in the administra tion, in dealing with an emergency caused by the outbreak of a dangerous disease, to seek or re quire the cooperation of the public or corporate bodies in the public or pr ivate sectors. If the desired cooperation is not forthcoming, a regulation may be imposed. Failure to obey or comply with restrictions imposed by such a regulation constitutes a punishable violation.41 Powers of segregation or quarantine that th e central government and state governments enjoy may impinge on the political and civil rights of th e public. Fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Constitution of India, are justiciable. The judiciary doe s not shy away from enforcing these rights or voiding orders that consti tute violations of such rights. Quarantine is a measure that adversely affects the fundamental right \"to mo ve freely throughout the territory of India.\" 42 However, this right is to be enjoyed subject to reasonable restrictions that the state may impose in the interest, among others, of the general public.43 As noted above, section 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act includes a protection clause that give s state immunity such that \"[n]o suit or other legal proceeding\" can be brought against \"any pe rson for anything done or in good faith intended to be done under this Act.\"44 The right to privacy, as such, is not a fundamental right in India. The Supreme Court of India has found that the right of privacy is an essential component of the right to life, but that it is not absolute and may be restricted to prevent crime or disorder, or to protect health, morals, or the rights and freedom of others. 45 During the SARS epidemic in 2003, there wa s concern over the severity of quarantine enforcement measures, the discrimination that patients faced, and the lack of privacy and 39 Id. 40 Id. 41 Epidemic Diseases Act \u00a7 3. 42 INDIA CONST . art. 19(1)(d). 43 Id. art. 19(2), (4). 44 Epidemic Diseases Act \u00a7 4. 45 'X' v.

There were also reports of shaming of colleagues and neighbors who had been placed in quarantine.46 III. Transparency of Public Heal th Crisis Management System Within the democratic system, the judiciary in India ensures transparency in government actions and executive orders. The public frequently s eeks judicial review of executive orders and regulations. The Parliament of India has also enacted a Freedom of Information Act, requiring transparency in government actions.47 The Act entitles the public, by filing a written or electronic application, to obtain information from any public authority.48 IV. Cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) In 1997 the WHO set up the National Polio Survei llance Project to he lp provide technical support for the government with surveillance of polio, mass vaccination campaigns, and routine immunizations.49 In 2008, WHO, in collaboration with the NCDC, star ted a pilot project to prevent humans from contracting rabies in five Indian cities. The project \"includes training of health professionals in animal-bite management and raising public awar eness about the need to seek post-exposure treatment, notably through posting message s on buses and in other public places.\" 50 Besides those projects, the WHO is available to provide assistance in all emergencies\u2014for example, earthquakes, epidemics, or disasters resu lting from terrorism of any sort that may create a health emergency in the country. The W HO's Regional Office annually conducts ten-day, intercountry training courses on epidemic preparedness and response to develop regional capacity in early detection and response to diseas e outbreaks. Specifically, the WHO is assisting the National Centre for Dis ease Control (NCDC) (formerl y the National Institute of Communicable Diseases) in the prepar ation, printing, and distribution of CD Alert , a monthly newsletter published by NCDC. The WHO has also been assi sting the NCDC in cooperating more closely with neighboring health systems in south and southeast As ian countries through workshops and other meetings. 51 46 Sanjay Nagral, Editorial, SARS: Infectious Diseases, Public Health and Medical Ethics , 11(3) INDIAN J.

The Law Library of Congress 99 Israel Ruth Levush Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY Israel's Ministry of Health (MOH) is gene rally responsible for public health crisis management. The Minister of Health is authorized to classify specific diseases as \"communicable diseases,\" and to declare a public health crisis caused by such diseases. The Minister may resort to special powers to limit and fight communicable diseases. The Minister's powers include the authority to order quarantine and decontamination of property. Despite the apparent infringement on the basic rights of protection of privacy, confidentiality of medical information, human dignity, and freedom, the law permits the restriction of these rights for the purpose of e liminating public health catastrophes such as epidemics and chemical or biological attacks. In responding to intentional contamination, the Home Front Command (HFC) of the Israeli Defense Forces is charged with making the fi rst response. The HFC regularly publishes information on threats and on measures that should be taken against contamination. Although data on the spread of communicable di seases is freely available, many aspects of counter biochemical and radiological terrorism are classified out of concern that their disclosure would endanger the public. Israel develops and implemen ts special plans for preventi ng the spread of communicable diseases as warranted. For example, Israel's MOH has issued a special memorandum on preparedness for and the prevention of Ebola. Previously, a special directive was issued by the MOH General Manager on May 4, 2009, regarding preparation for A/H1N1 2009 influenza. In 2007 the MOH issued a report titled Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan for the Health System . The Plan includes specific requirements for reporting and monitoring, as well as a means of responding to a pandemic health crisis in cooperation with the World Health Organization and its regulations. I. Introduction Israel's systems of health crises preparedness, disease reporting and surveillance, and alert and response management are under the responsibil ity of the Ministry of Health (MOH). The MOH's jurisdiction extends to managing the me dical aspects of Israel's preparedness for, and response to, public health crises, including the operati on of hospitals and clinics, identification and reporting of health crises, pur chase and allocation of vaccines and medications, and distribution of information to the public. Othe r aspects of addressing health crises, including activating an emergency status, ordering quarantin es, maintaining public order, and determining the closing and opening of schools, are handl ed by the Ministry of Defense through the Homeland Security Command. The MOH issues new requirements on the spr ead, prevention, and treatment of disease periodically as needed. Most recently, in August 2014, the MOH published special guidelines on Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 100 preparedness for and prevention of the spread of the Ebola virus.1 In 2007 the MOH issued a detailed report titled Pandemic Influenza Preparedne ss Plan for the Health System .2 This report describes the struct ure of the public health crisis management system in Israel, procedures for the determination of pandemics, a nd the special powers granted to public health authorities for disease and pandemic prevention. It also discusses the impact of these powers on human rights in Israel as well as the legal requirement for transparency in the public health crisis management system. The report includes info rmation on special prevention programs including preparedness for chemical or biological attacks on the homeland. II. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management System Israel's public health crisis system is regulated by law and subsidiary le gislation. The MOH is responsible for collectin g information and making decisions fo r the protection of the public and for implementing these decisions and policies.3 Health services are usually dispensed through companies called health insurance establishments (HIEs) that are partially subsidized by the state.4 Every resident has a right to health servi ces provided in a manner that protects human dignity, privacy, and medical confidentiality.5 A. Declaring a Disease \"Communicable\" The statutory framework for dealing with comm unicable diseases is based on Public Health Ordinance No. 40 of 1940,6 as amended. A \"communicable dise ase\" is defined by the Ordinance as any disease listed in the second appendix to the Ordinance, or one declared by the Head of Health Services or a designee as a communicable di sease. The declaration must be made in the official gazette and must specify the area and the period for its application. The list appended to the Ordinance may be amended by the Minister of Health, who is authoriz ed to add or delete diseases from the list through public ation in the official gazette. 7 The list currently includes diseases of internat ional importance requiring immediate notification by the treating physician to the MOH regional offi ce or other MOH offices in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Internat ional Health Regulati ons (2005), such as 1 State of Israel Ministry of Health [MOH], Memorandum No. 13/14 by Head of Public Health Services (Aug. 7, 2014), http://www.health.gov.il/ hozer/BZ13_2014.pdf (in Hebrew). 2 MOH, P ANDEMIC INFLUENZA PREPAREDNESS PLAN FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEM (updated to June 7, 2007), http://www. health.gov.il/Subjects/emergency/prep aration/DocLib/tora/BIO_TORA_PANDEMIC_FLU.pdf . 3 For information about the Ministry's vision and activities, see About the Ministry, MOH, http://www.health. gov.il/English/About/Pages/default.aspx (last visited Oct. 14, 2014). 4 National Health Insurance Law, 5754-1994, S EFER HAHUKIM [SH] [Book of Laws] 1469 p. 156 (5754-1994). 5 Id. \u00a7 3. 6 Public Health Ordinance No. 40 of 1940, I TON RISHMI [IR] (official gazette during the tenure of the Provisional Council of State) 1st Supp. 191 (1940). 7 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 11-11(A).

Other diseases listed as requiring immediate individual notification similar to that required for diseases of international importance include AIDS and HIV infection; acute hepatitis A, B, and C; West Nile virus; and malaria. 8 The inclusion of a disease in the list of commu nicable diseases empowers health authorities in Israel to resort to special measures, including quarantine, to fight the spread of the disease. 9 B. Declaration of a Serious Health Danger Public Health Ordinance No. 40 of 1940, as ame nded, authorizes the Minister of Health to declare the threat or existence of a serious danger to public heal th in Israel or in neighboring countries. With the publication of the declarati on in the official gazette , the head of health services at the MOH may issue regulations rega rding any person or HIEs activities, such as house-to-house visits, the provision of medical assistance, medications, housing accommodations, ventilation, and other measures to prevent the spread of the disease.10 III. Determination of Pandemics A. Data Collection: Disease Reporting and Monitoring 1. Reporting Under the 1940 Public Health Ordinance, doctors treating infected patient s, patients' relatives, and possessors of property where infected patie nts have stayed must inform the regional government doctors of such cases either immediately or within tw elve hours of learning that the patients have contracted a communicable disease.11 Under the 1994 National Health Law, as amended, HIEs must provide the MOH with medical data necessary for the fulfilment of the Minist ry's obligations under the Law upon the Ministry's request. Noncompliance with such a request ma y cause delay in the provision of governmental subsidies. The Law specifies that medical in formation will be dispensed only to the extent necessary for the implementation of the Ministry's obligations and for the protection of the privacy of the insured and medical confidentiality. 12 8 Public Health Ordinance (Change of List of Communicable Diseases) Decree (5771-2010), K OVETZ HATAKANOT (Subsidiary Legislation) 5771 No. 6951 pp. 262-72. 9 Public Health Ordinance No. 40 of 1940, \u00a7\u00a7 13-19. 10 Id. \u00a7 20.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 102 2. Monitoring The Israel Center for Diseas e Control (ICDC) was established under the MOH in 1994. The ICDC was designed to provide th e Ministry with up-to-date info rmation on health issues. The ICDC deals with a large spectrum of health areas and cooperates closely with other departments in the MOH, the Central Bureau of Statistics, HIEs, other health care providers, as well as with research institutions and universities. 13 According to information posted on the website of the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, [t]he ICDC main objectives are to identify hea lth areas which lack essential data, establish new health-related databases, provide ongoi ng professional support for users of existing databases, undertake applied research in specifi c areas of public health, carry out national health surveys, report on the health status of the population, present policy alternatives to decision-makers in MOH, and carry out unusual morbidity surveillance. . . . The ICDC took active part in monitoring the pandemic influenza in Israel on [sic] winter 2009-2010, including syndromic surveillance, serologic surveillance, distribution of weekly reports, regular updates of the pandemia guidelines according to the WHO and other agencies, distribution of the updated guidelines on a daily basis, and activating a hotline for medical teams. 14 The MOH's 2007 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan for the Health System (the Plan),15 for example, provides for a system of monitoring that relies on information received from the ICDC. According to the Plan, the monitoring of influen za is based on a combination of both laboratory and clinical observations. La boratory monitoring of influen za is conducted in the MOH's Central Laboratory for Viruses. Samples are received from selected monitoring clinics on a weekly basis. All influenza tests among hospita lized patients and during disease breakouts are sent to the ICDC. The results of influenza te sts conducted in two select ed hospitals are also routinely delivered to the ICDC . The 2007 Plan further calls fo r the preparation of additional monitoring clinics and pediatri c screening during influenza season and throughout the year as needed.16 Clinical monitoring is conducted by the MOH Department of Epidemiology, the department for information and digitalization, and the ICDC. The ICDC periodically collects and integrates daily data determin ed to be indicative of influenza.17 The 2007 Plan provides for a specific monitori ng program following the issuance of WHO phase 4 and 5 epidemic alerts, which correlate to both limited and significant human-to-human 13 Israel National Disease Control Center , MOH, http://www.health.gov.il/English/MinistryUnits/HealthDivision/ Icdc/Pages/default.aspx . 14 Israel Center for Disease Control, THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTES , http://www.ianphi.org/membercountrie s/memberinformation/israel.html (last visited Oct. 20, 2014). 15 Pandemic Influenza Preparedne ss Plan for the Health System, supra note 2. 16 Id. at 19-28. 17 Id. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 103 contagiousness. The program calls for the operati on of additional monitori ng clinics, distributed geographically, and for the testing of a higher number of samples from persons meeting the disease case definition as determined by WHO. In addition, during phases 4 and 5 of the epidemic, a comprehensive epidemiological inves tigation will be conducted in every case in order to identify all relevant contacts and consider treatm ent by medication, isolation, and quarantine, as needed.18 According to the 2007 Plan, during a pandemic, when contamination is spread worldwide, there is no need for additional monitoring. Samples will be transferred only to the ICDC, which will conduct weekly integration of all the data it receives and dissemi nate its report to the MOH, health clinics, hospital doctor s, and the community at large. 19 3. Declaration of a Crisis The 1940 Public Health Ordinance aut horizes the Minister of Health to declare in Israel's official gazette that public health is severely threaten ed by the existence of a communicable disease in Israel or in neighboring countries. The authorization applies \"if it seems that part of the country is subject to a danger of a terrible epidemic dis ease, local or communicable, or is infected with such a disease, such as the plague, cholera, ye llow fever, smallpox, t yphus, or another disease declared by the Minister of Health in publica tion in the official gazette, as a dangerous communicable disease.\" 20 The Ordinance does not describe the decision-making process to be followed by the Minister prior to declaring a disease communicable. In the case of H1N1 influenza, several cases ha ve been identified in Israel. The declaration concerning H1N1 influenza, 21 however, followed alert announcements by the WHO. Such a declaration forms the basis of the extensive power s granted to the Minister of Health and the Ministry's designees.22 IV. Powers of Public Health Authorities A.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 104 inspect and decontaminate areas susp ected of being contaminated with communicable diseases; examine persons found in suspected contaminated areas; and quarantine or transfer inf ected persons to a hospital.23 Specific powers are provided to the Head of Medical Services and to government doctors to order the decontamination, reconstruction, repair, or closure of all ho me water supplies; the purification or protection of all private or public water supplies; and the removal and destruction of all garb age from private or public premises. 24 Additional powers include the vaccination of residents of an area suspected of being contaminated in order to st op the spread of the disease.25 Any person under an obligation to report communicable diseases, including relatives who stay with the infected perso n, building managers, and treating physic ians, is authorized to carry out temporary quarantine actions ordered by the government doctor. 26 B. Quarantine Powers Under the Quarantine Ordinance (New Versi on) 5741-1981 the General Manager of the MOH is authorized to order a \"quarantine service to prev ent the penetration of diseases into Israel via land, sea or air, and their transfer from Israel to other countries.\"27 In accordance with the Quarantine Regulations, 28 the MOH is authorized to require a medical examination of every vessel in Israel's waters, to prohibit its contact with the shore or any other vessel, and to impose quarantine and sanitary measures to be followed upon arrival.29 Vessels suspected of being infected may port only in the ports of Haifa and Tel-Aviv, while those confirmed infected, only in the Haifa port.30 23 Public Health Ordinance No. 40 of 1940, \u00a7\u00a7 13-16. 24 Id. 25 Id. \u00a7 19. 26 Id. \u00a7 13. 27 Quarantine Ordinance (New INEI MEDINAT YISRAEL (NUSACH CHADASH ) (the revised, updated, and binding Hebrew text of legislation enacted before the establishment of the State of Israel) p. 747 (translated by author, R.L.). 28 Quarantine Regulations, 3 H UKE ERETZ ISRAEL [HEI] [Laws of Palestine] 2170, as amended . 29 Id. \u00a7 5. 30 Id. \u00a7 6. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 105 The Quarantine Regulations specify the procedures to be taken when a vessel arrives at an Israeli port, including the requirement that a health ce rtificate filled out by the vessel's doctor be submitted. The health certificate must include in formation on events that occurred during travel that are related to public health. The health cer tificate should specify the health status of the ship's country of origin and all the ports it visited, especially if these places were infected with the diseases listed in the Regulations.31 Vessels arriving without a health certificate or with an inappropriate health certificate wi ll be subjected to quarantine.32 Goods and passenger luggage may be subjected to decontaminati on and possible elimination by burning.33 Passengers in vessels confirmed as infected will be subjected to quarantine.34 Although the Regulations specificall y deal with vessels, it is reasonable that similar procedures are applicable to other modes of transportation, such as airplanes, under the general authorization by the Quarantine Ordinance (New Version) 5741-1981. C. Forced Hospitalization and Seclusion The 1940 Public Health Ordinance authorizes the head of the MOH or a gove rnment physician to force the hospitalization or seclusion of ever y person who is infected with a communicable disease. This may be done when the conditions of the residence are not suitable for prevention of the spread of the disease. Every person who was in contact with the infected person during the disease's incubation period may also be subjected to forced hospitalization. 35 D. Powers During Periods of Emergency As discussed above, the Minister of Health is authori zed to publish a declar ation that recognizes a dangerous communicable disease as existing or threatening public health. Once such a declaration has been pub lished, the Head of Medi cal Services is authorized to order, by decrees, directives, or other means, any measures fo und necessary for preventing or containing the disease, including home visits; the provision of me dical help; the distribu tion of medication; and the provision of clean, ventilated, a nd decontaminated places of residence.36 The authorization encompasses the entire country, or designated parts, and applies to all vessels within the territorial waters of Israel.37 The Head of Medical Services is further authoriz ed, following the publicati on of a declaration, to remove or arrest infected persons and subjec t them to supervision, medical examination, or treatment. Persons in touch with the infected person may also be subjected to this authority. 31 Id. \u00a7 8. 32 Id. \u00a7 9. 33 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 17-19. 34 Id. \u00a7 12. 35 Public Health Ordinance No. 40 of 1940, \u00a7 15. 36 Id. \u00a7 20. 37 Id. \u00a7 23. An extension to airplanes could be interpreted as applying to territorial air space as well. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 106 Similarly, the Head of Medi cal Services is also authorized to perform all acts re quired to obtain samples from such persons fo r laboratory exam, such as entering any private or public premises; establishing sanitary supervision; seizing, decontaminating, or destroying ar ticles subjected to contamination; burying or disposing of the dead; taking possession of buildings or land (subject to compensation) to establish temporary hospitals; and taking possession of trans portation vehicles (subject to comp ensation) needed to prevent the spread of the disease.38 The Head of Medical Services or a government doctor may also order the destruction of any building or shelter used by humans or animals that may provide a center for disseminating disease because of poor sanitary conditions. The owner may be reimbursed, depending on the owner's liability for th e unsanitary conditions. 39 In the case of a disease outbreak in a limited area, an order may be made not to allow any pers on to exit the place. The police may be called upon to assist in enforcing such an order.40 E. Enforcement All legal instruments regulating the handling of a public health crisis prov ide authorized persons with the power to sanction viola tions of law and violations of their orders. For example, the failure to inform the government regional doctor of an infected person may result in a one-month term of imprisonment or a fine. Any person u nder obligation to provide critical information must also carry out the temporary qua rantine orders imposed by the regional government doctor.41 Certain expenses related to quara ntine and decontamination of an infected vessel wi ll be paid by its captain. 42 In addition, penalties are imposed unde r the Public Health Ordinance on anyone infected with a communicable disease who knowingly exposes himself in a manner that endangers public health or sells or loans clothe s and sheets. Persons w ho transport an infected person without decontaminating the transport vehicle afterward are likewise subject to penalties. Similarly, the parents of a child or a depe ndent infected with a communicable disease specifically listed in the third a ppendix of the Ordinance who know ingly or neglig ently allow the child to visit his school without a medical certificate permitting such a visit ar e subject to a criminal penalty and a fine. A teacher who kno wingly permits such a child to attend school is 38 Id. \u00a7 20(2). 39 Id. \u00a7 20(4)(a). 40 Id. \u00a7 Id. \u00a7 12(2). 42 See Quarantine Regulations, supra note 28, \u00a7 14. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 107 also subject to penalties. Fines are also imposed on infect ed persons for engaging in any occupation related to food supply or any other occupation without taking the proper precautions against spreading the disease.43 F. Impact on the Protect ion of Human Rights The powers exercised by authorities in public health crises appear to conflict with patients' rights guaranteed by the Protection of Patients' Rights Law, 5756-1996,44 as well as those prescribed by Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom.45 For example, the delivery of information on infected patients contradicts the rights of patients to medical c onfidentiality. The Protection of Patients' Rights Law, 5756-1996, however, provides th at caretakers or medical institutions may provide medical information to others if they are under a legal obligation to do so.46 T h e provision of medical information in cases invol ving communicable diseas es is mandatory under the 1940 Public Health Ordinance a nd, therefore, not in violation of the Protection of Patients' Rights Law. Removal of persons, forced decontamination, and ot her measures taken to prevent the spread of disease appear to be in viola tion of the principle of protecti ng the life, body, and dignity of a person, guaranteed by Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom. Such infringement, however, may be legal under the conditions enumerat ed in section 8\u2014namely, relevancy and proportionality. The law states that \"[t]here sha ll be no violation of righ ts under this Basic Law except by a law befitting the values of the State of Israel, enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required.\" 47 It is reasonable to assume that the author ity bestowed upon the Health Minister and his designees, specifically those permitting forced entry and quarantine, is one that can be viewed as an authority that is provided \"for a proper purpos e\" in fighting the spread of infectious diseases. Accordingly, orders for forced entry and qua rantine that are limite d in duration may be considered to meet the requirement that any viol ation of rights be \"to an extent no greater than is required.\" V. Actions for Preparedness an d Prevention of Pandemics The MOH issues instructions on preparedness fo r and the prevention of pandemic diseases as necessary. The following sections provide exam ples of actions taken by the MOH regarding preparedness for and the prevention of Ebola and pandemic influenza. 43 Public Health Ordinance No. 40 of 1940, \u00a7 22. 44 Protection of Patients' Rights Law, 5756-1996, SH 327 (5756-1996). 45 Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom, SH 1391 (9752-1992). 46 Protection of Patients' Rights Law \u00a7 20(a)(2). 47 Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom \u00a7 8, SH 5752 No. 1391 p. 150. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 108 A. Preparedness for and Prevention of Ebola No Ebola cases had been identified in Israel at the time this re port was prepared. On August 7, 2014, however, the MOH, issued a recommendation to avoid visiting infected countries to the extent possible. Travelers visiting Guinea, Liberi a, and Sierra Leone are required to refrain from having contact with Ebola patients, their excreta, and their personal items. Among other things, they are advised to refrain from visiting health institutions or obtaining medical care in those countries to the extent possible.48 According to guidelines issu ed by the Ministry, a patient who develops a temperature of 100.4\u00b0F ( 38\u00b0C) within twenty-one days of returning to Israel from any of these three countries must immediately inform hospital authorities prior to their arrival at the hospital in order to receive proper protection instructions.49 A memorandum titled The Ebola Outbreak in West Africa issued by the MOH on August 7, 2014, provides information on the virus's epidem iologic and microbiologi c origin, clinical symptoms, and incubation period and treatment. 50 The Memorandum outlines procedures for the prevention of the spread of Ebola by requiring hea lth care institutions to increase awareness of the potential spread of the virus, identify suspic ious cases, and give advance notice to emergency and other health personnel rega rding admission and treatment of Ebola patients. Additional requirements on health care inst itutions introduced by the Memo randum include the duties of issuing emergency alerts for health care personnel,51 issuing instructions regarding patients' admission, and following the memorandum's guide lines regarding case reporting management and the treatment of patients.52 At a minimum, the Memorandum requires th e implementation of transmission-based precautions\u2014specifically, regarding contact , droplet, and airborne protections. 53 The following is a summary of relevant proce dures and instructions that we re issued on the basis of the Memorandum at an exercise conducted in Oct ober 2014 at the Tel-Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport. 1. Identification a. Ebola Patients Arriving at the Airport According to instructions given at the exercise, a person returning to Isra el from the infected countries should be screened. The screening is to include a medical interview and taking the person's temperature. Anyone found to have temperature above 100.4\u00b0F is to be immediately 48 Press Release, MOH, Guidelines and Preparedness of th e Health System Following the Outbreak of the Ebola Virus in West Africa (Aug. 7, 2014), http://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEve nts/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/ 07082014_2.aspx . 49 Id. 50 Memorandum No. 13/14 by Head of Public Health Services, supra note 1. 51 Id. \u00a7 1. 52 Id. at 4-9. 53 Id. \u00a7 1. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 109 transferred to isolation in a hospital. During the transfer to a protected ambulance, the patient is to be placed on a protected stretcher.54 b. Patients' Arrival at Health Facility Following Advance Notice According to the Memorandum issued by the MOH, every hospital must assign a physician on every shift to answer telephone calls concerning suspicion of E bola infection. Any patient who has visited a country where the Ebola virus has sp read and reports a high fever upon return is to be instructed to appear for an examination at the Emergency Room. The patient must be instructed to minimize risk to others while on route by adopting such measures as covering his/her face, refraining from using public transp ortation, meeting a health team member who is wearing protective gear, and arrivi ng directly at a secluded ar ea in the admissions department designated ahead of time for this purpose. 55 c. Patients' Arrival at Health Facility with No Advance Notice The Memorandum requires the posti ng of signs at admissions areas instructing patients who have stayed in an Ebola-infected country twenty-one days prior to admission and developed a high fever to immediately report these facts to the receptionist. The r eceptionist must instruct these patients and people accompanying th em to wear protective masks and wait in an isolated area. 56 The admissions office must immediately report a ny such cases to the me dical team assigned to conduct a brief interview of the patient to determin e if it is required that he/she be isolated. While conducting the interview the team will wear an N-95 protective mask, face/eyes protector, a robe, and gloves. 57 When a patient, who is already be ing treated either at the ER or at another hospital unit is diagnosed with Ebola, he/she must immediately be transferred to a suitabl e isolation room. The patient and the treatment team pr oviding care to the pa tient must wear a surgical mask, and the team must wear protective gear.58 2. Treatment Management of Suspicious Cases The Memorandum requires that the physician and the nurse responsible for managing a suspected case of Ebola will a ppoint a treatment team that will treat the patient exclusively. Team members must wear full protective gear. 59 Upon admission the patient must be transferred to an isolation room that will be under full supe rvision to ensure that entry and exit from the 54 Itai Gal, First Publication: This Is How Ebola Patients Will Be Treated in Israel , YNET (Oct. 20, 2014), http://www.ynet.co. il/articles/0,7340,L-4581372,00.html . 55 Memorandum No. 13/14 by Head of Public Health Services, supra note 1, \u00a7 2.1. 56 Id. \u00a7 2.2.1.1. 57 Id. \u00a7 2.2.1.2. 58 Id. \u00a7 2.2.2. 59 A detailed description of the gear requirements is provided.

The Memorandum requires the f illing out of a special form documenting all persons who were in either direct or indirect contact with the patient prior to the patient's entry into the room.60 The Memorandum limits the number of visitors that can be in touch with the patient and requires that they use the same protective g ear required of the treatment team. 61 It further provides that after complying with all require d measures for preventing cont amination, the patient must be diagnosed and treated for any addi tional dangerous diseases he/she might have, particularly those \"common among travelers returning from Africa\"\u2014di seases whose symptoms may be similar to those of Ebola, including mala ria, typhoid, and hepatitis A.62 The Memorandum requires preventing the contam ination of material s and equipment as appropriate, by full isolation or by sterilization and fumigation. 63 It also provides specific guidelines for handling and transferring blood and other bodily fluids, for conducting activities that may create aerosols, for procedures involvin g the use of contained centrifuges, and for the transfer of samples for diagnosing contamina tion from a patient suspected of having Ebola.64 3. Notice Requirement The Memorandum imposes on the MOH regional phys ician the duty of immediately reporting by phone every suspicious case of Ebola. The re gional physician must immediately transmit the information to the heads of the Ministry's departments of epidemiology and public health services. The Memorandum requires that all announcements be made exclusively via the Ministry's Press Release office. 65 4. Determination of Treatment Location Patients must be treated only at hospitals that provide suitable isolation conditions and whose personnel possess the required training and abilitie s. The MOH management may decide to transfer a patient to another hos pital as needed. Such a transf er will be conducted in accordance with the protocol on \"Encountering an U nusual Biological Event\u2014the First Hours.\" 66 60 3.3.3. 62 Id. \u00a7 3.3.6. 63 Id. \u00a7 3.10. 64 Id. \u00a7 5. 65 Id. \u00a7 6. 66 Id. \u00a7 7; MOH EMERGENCY UNIT, ENCOUNTERING AN UNUSUAL BIOLOGICAL EVENT - THE FIRST HOURS (Aug. 2008), http://www.health.gov.il/Subjects/emergency/prepar ation/DocLib/tora/BIO_TORA_BIO_EVENT_HOURS. pdf (in Hebrew). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 111 5. Epidemiological Inves tigation and Follow-Up of Patients and Their Contacts An epidemiological questionnaire must be filled out for every case where Ebola is suspected. The questionnaire, a co py of which is appended to the Memorandum, includes information identifying the patient and his/her residence addr ess, insurance, treatin g physician and hospital, clinical symptoms, laboratory results, history of travel, and meetings with any person who returned from a foreign country in the twenty-one days before the onset of symptoms (including meetings to medically treat such a person).67 B. Preparedness for and Prevention of Pandemic Influenza As indicated above, in 2007 Israel's MOH issued its Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan for the Health System .68 The Plan provides a list of measures to be employed by HIEs and local and district medical facilities. The Plan also pr ovides special instructions for the Magen David Adom, Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service.69 The Plan lists the following actions to be ta ken in the community to prevent the spread of disease: 1. Public Health Guidelines Guidelines regarding the cleanliness of surfaces , personal and respiratory hygiene, and other relevant information related to disease transmi ssion and prevention must be easily accessible to the public via the MOH's websit e and influenza pandemic site, and through leaflets titled Hygiene Rules . 70 2. Restrictions on Social Gathering Restrictions on social gathering may be impos ed, depending on the scope and duration of the contamination and the conditions of the area where it occurs (open or closed). Schools, day-care centers, and nursery schools may be closed; restricti ons may be imposed on the use of public transportation; employees may be encouraged to work from home by phone , fax, computer, etc.; cultural and sports events may be cancelle d; and patients may be voluntarily secluded. 71 3. Limitations on Freedom of Movement Recommendations to avoid unnecessary travel and restrictions on local a nd international travel may be issued. In the event of pandemic in fluenza occurrences involving transmission from human to human, the recommendations of the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and 67 Memorandum No. 13/14 by Head of Public Health Services, supra note 1, \u00a7 10. 68 Pandemic Influenza Preparedne ss Plan for the Health System, supra note 2. 69 Id. ch.

The Plan also provides for preparing control measures for closed or semiclosed facilities, including elderly homes, military facilities, and prisons. To reduce the spread of disease in medical facilities through contact between medical teams, the Plan, among other measures, authorizes the organization of labor teams that work in shifts without meeting each other. The Plan re quires the adoption of personal hygiene measures, such as the use of face masks by patients, medical teams, and the public at large.72 VI. Transparency of Public Heal th Crisis Management System The Department of Epidemiology of the MOH prep ares a weekly report based on data received on communicable diseases in the country. The reports have been available to the public in paper or digital form since the year 2000. 73 Israel cooperates with the WHO and provides the organization with data on contagio us diseases. Israel protects freedom of the press, and the public may obtain information thr ough any means of communication. VII. Response to Threats of Ch emical and Biological Attacks Preparing for chemical, biological or radiologi cal attacks is the res ponsibility of both the Ministry of Defense Home Front Command and the MOH. Thes e Ministries have prepared working procedures; stockpiled vaccines, antibiotic s, and other medications; and trained health providers for crisis events. Specific informa tion on such attacks and instructions on how to protect against chemical, biologica l, and radiological attacks ar e provided on the website of the Home Front Command.74 Information on the state's preparedness for chemi cal, biological, and radi ological attacks is not easily accessible. A 2002 report prepared by the Knesset Information and Research Center in anticipation of the 2003 Iraq War states that the re luctance of the Israeli defense system and its MOH to disclose information on the state's prep aredness stems from the concern that this will expose the extent of the state's vulnerability to such attacks. 75 The following is a summary of relevant portions of the report. 72 Id. ch.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Israel The Law Library of Congress 113 A. General Preparedness The general health system has been reportedly prepared, potential threats identified, and operating procedures formalized for hospitals, hea lth clinics, and localities, including procedures for cooperation among the different bodies. An inte nsive instruction of t housands of doctors and nurses began at the time the report was issued. 76 B. Anthrax Preparedness A health system plan for the treatment of anthra x victims has been prepared. While most of the treatment would be provided by the HIEs, the h ealth system plan includes immunizations and preventive antibiotic treatments for affected pers ons. The report stated that the authorities had a sufficient supply of antibiotic medications for the treatment of anthrax. The report further recommended not vaccinating the entire population against anthrax because of possible serious side effects.77 C. Smallpox Preparedness It was decided at the time not to vaccinate th e entire public against smallpox. Instead, fifteen thousand medical and security personnel were to be vaccinated, some of whom would be among the first teams to come in contact with future patients. Approximately six thousand five hundred persons had been vaccinated by October 2002. Thes e teams would also serv e as first reactors from whom antibodies would be ex tracted to enable countering comp lications and side effects of the disease.78 The report concluded that there was enough vaccine for the country's population. The vaccines and antibiotics are not available at the HIEs, but are kept by the Homeland Command and the MOH. There were several plans for vaccinati ng the population that were expected to be implemented on the basis of government deci sions or the consequences of an event. 79 At the time of the report, the MOH had requeste d the Ministry of Edu cation to prepare three hundred schools around the country to serve as sm allpox vaccination centers if the need arose. 80 76 Id. \u00a7 4(B). 77 Id. \u00a7 4(C). 78 \u00a7 4(D)(2). 80 Id. \u00a7 4(D)(3). The Law Library of Congress 114 Italy Dante Figueroa Senior Legal Information Analyst* SUMMARY Italy's Constitution recognizes the protection of health as a fundamental individual right and public interest, and also enshrines the pr inciple of respect for the human personality. Within this constitutional framework, the Cons olidated Health Laws and various other legal and regulatory provisions assign respons ibility for confronting health crises to national and regional authorities, authorize measures to address infectious and communicable diseases, establish a reporting syst em, and grant authority for the issuance of special orders when the nation is threatened with an epidemic. The Minister of Health and the National Health Service play leading rol es in this field. Freedom of information, including access to public health information, is constitutionally guaranteed. Italy actively cooperates with the World Health Organi zation, European institutions, and other international organizations. Given Italy's geographic proximity to Africa, recent parliamentary debates about the Ebola epidemic in Africa have centered on the count ry's immigration policies. The Health Ministry has now updated its protocols and guidelines concerning preventative and response measures vis-\u00e0-vis Ebola. These guidelines set forth measures addressing the treatment of suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of Ebola; sanitation and decontamination; the disposal of waste; and the handling of corpses. Most regions follow the Ebola protocols established at the national level. I. Government Structure Italy is a democratic republic whose president is the Head of State. The executive power resides in the Council of Ministers, which is headed by the Prime Minister (officially referred to as the President of the Council of Ministers). Legislative power is exercised jointly by the Chamber of Deputies and by the Senate. The j udicial branch is an autonom ous order independent from any other power. The territory of the Republic is divided into twenty regions and further into provinces and municipalities. II. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management System Health protection and the handling of public health crises in Italy are regu lated by statutory and regulatory provisions based on the constitutional principle of th e protection of health as a fundamental individual right and a public interest . The Constitution further states that health * This report updates a report originally prepared by fo rmer Senior Legal Specialist Giovanni Salvo in 2003, which was previously updated in 2009 by Senior Legal Research Analyst Constance A. Johnson. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Italy The Law Library of Congress 115 treatments may be imposed by law only if they do not violate the principle of respect for the human personality.1 Italy's National Health Service, under the Ministry of Health, aims at ensuring the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the whole population. It assures the coordi nation of all activities and interventions of agencies, institutions, and services that perform any duty concerning individual and colle ctive health. The central and local governments ar e jointly responsible for the implementation of the National Health Service. The law provides health authorities with the necessary powers to perform mandatory health controls and treatments. 2 The Consolidated Health Laws contains specific provisions concerning infectious diseases. It establishes that the Minister of Health may, on the advice of the Superior Council of Health, issue a list of infectious and communicable dise ases subject to special procedures and measures. 3 The Act imposes a system of reporting such diseas es through the various levels of responsible authorities up to the Minister of Health. It provides for preventative measures, necessary assistance, and disinfection interventions for such diseases. It further grants the Minister of Health, when the nation is threatened with an infectious disease epidemic, the authority to issue special orders for the inspection and disinfection of premises, the organization of special services and medical assistance, and the adoption of protective measures against the spread of such diseases. The ordinances of th e Minister are published in the Official Gazette. Under the provisions concerning veterina ry regulations, the Act requi res coordination between the Municipal Veterinary Office and the Municipal Health Office for the reporting of animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans. 4 Preventing, monitoring, and responding to public h ealth emergencies incl uding epidemics, even when caused by terrorists, is the responsibility of government officials and civil servants at the central, regional, and municipal le vels. The Minister of Health assesses and makes decisions concerning situations of national crisis, and issues the ordinance that triggers th e response to a specific emergency. 5 The Civil Protection Department, under the supervision of the Prime Minister or the duly delegated In terior Minister, deals with emergencies that are the result of natural disasters or the consequen ce of human activities, as well as other events that, because of 1 CONSTITUTION OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC art. 32, https://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/istituzione/ costituzione_ inglese.pdf (English version published by the Parliamentary Information, Archives and Publications Office of the Senate Service for Official Reports and Co mmunication of the Senato della Repubblica, Apr. 2009). 2 nazionale [Law No. 833 23, 1978, National Health Service Institution], G AZZETTA UFFICIALE DELLA REPUBBLICA ITALIANA [G.U.] No. 360, Dec. 28, 1979, http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:1978-12-23;833 . 3 Id. arts. 9 & 62. 4 Royal Decree No. 1265 of July 27, 1934, as amended , approving the Consolidated Health Law, in CODICE DELLA SANITA ' (Torino, UTET 1999). 5 Law No. 833.

The interven tion of the central government authorities takes precedence according to the relevan ce and the magnitude of the emergency.8 The Prime Minister may appoint a special commissioner when a state of emergency has been declared.9 III. Powers of Public Health Authorities Article 32 of the Italian Constitution states that no one may be forced to receive medical treatment unless provided for by law, and that th e law may not violate limits imposed by respect for the human personality. The powers granted to public health authorities to adopt a range of protective measures against the sp read of disease in a health crisis, such as mandatory medical treatments, are limited by the constitutional guarant ee of respect for the human personality and, 6 In addition to the existing body of laws on Civil Protec tion (Codice della Protezione Ci vile, Piacenza, La Tribuna, 2002), see Decree of the President of the Republic, Mar. 27, 1992, Course of Action and Coordination for the Regions for the Purpose of Determining Levels of Health Assistance During Emergencies, G.U.

Inte rnational preventive measures and public hygiene measures concerni ng imported goods, travelers, and migrants are carried out by the health authorit ies set up by the Ministry of Health at the territorial borders, ports, and airports. 12 Italy's public health laws provide for the imposition of administrative and penal sanctions, including terms of imprisonment, for noncomplianc e. Punishable conduc t includes failure to provide assistance in emergency hea lth situations, especially for he alth professionals; violations of reporting procedures; and failure to abide by a la wful order of the authority in a health crisis. 13 In addition, the Italian Pena l Code makes causing an epidemic by spreading noxious germs a crime punishable by life imprisonment.14 IV. Transparency of Public He alth Crisis Management System The right of the public to access official informati on is a fundamental right provided in article 21 of the Italian Constitution. Decisions by the Italian Cons titutional Court under article 21 have emphasized not only the freedom to provide and divulge news, opinions, and comments, but also the right to obtain information. This interest implies a plurality of sources of information, free access to them, and the absence of unjustified legal obstacles, even temporary ones, to the circulation of news and ideas. 15 10 Legge 31 dicembre 1996, n. 675, of December 31 , 1996, Protection of the Person and othe r Subjects Concerning the Treatment of Personal Data], G.U.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Italy The Law Library of Congress 118 The Consolidated Health Laws reserves to th e central government the administrative duties and responsibilities concerning the f unctioning of the national Hea lth Information System. The central government is also required to coordi nate (1) the regional information systems in cooperation with public and private entities, (2) statistical analysis of the data disseminated, (3) information to be provided to Parliament, a nd (4) any other reporting of national relevance.16 Especially during a public health crisis, the Minist er of Health issues directives and disseminates information through any appropriate means, including its website.17 Health information is further disseminated by newspapers and public and private radio a nd television stations. V. Cooperation with the WHO The Italian government works cl osely with the WHO in meeti ng public health crises. The Ministry of Health, thro ugh its website, keep s the public informed of in ternational developments and of WHO standards and guidelines.18 Italy enacted legislation implem enting the International Health Regulations of 1969 as amended in 1973. 19 Italy is also a party to the In ternational Health Regulations of 2005.20 VI. Response to Ebola Virus Epidemic in West Africa A. National Measures In response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the Italian Minist ry of Health issued a Circular on April 4, 2014, recommending the \"adoption of all useful surv eillance actions related to indirect arrivals\" from Guinea and other borderi ng countries where symp toms of Ebola have been found.21 While the Circular seeks to minimize th e danger of Ebola sp reading in Italy, key government ministries and agencies have none theless been alerted, including the Italian Red Cross.22 16 Consolidated Health Laws art. 118. 17 MINISTERO DELLA SALUTE , http://www.sanita.it (last visited Nov. 5, 2014). 18 Id. 19 Legge 9 febbraio 1982, n. 106 Approvazione ed esecuzion e del regolamento sanitario internazionale, adottato adottato a Ginevra il 23 maggio 1973 [Law No. 106 of February 9, 1982, G.U. 87 of Mar. 30, 1982, Approval and Implementation of the International Sanitary Regulations Adopted at Boston on July 25, 1969, Amended by the Additional Regulations Adopted in Geneva on May 23, 1973], G.U.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Italy The Law Library of Congress 119 On May 14, 2014, the Italian Chamber of Deputies he ld a parliamentary debate to review the preparedness of Italy's health sy stem to prevent and fight Ebola.23 The debate highlighted the fact that during the months pr ior to May 2014, Italy witnesse d a growing influx across its southern border of thousands of illegal African immigrants, many of whom came from the Ebola-affected areas of West Africa. During the debates, many participants argued this situation required action from the National Government, in pa rticular from the Health Ministry, to address illegal immigration, as well as to provide the p ublic with transparent and prompt information, especially to protect school ch ildren. Some participants in this session proposed that the government impose a sanitary cordon throughout the country to protect the population, but the government has not adopted this proposal. The Health Ministry responded to the parliament ary inquiry by requiring immigrants arriving at coastal areas of Italy to undergo thorough clinical evaluations to ex clude the presence of signs or symptoms of Ebola before they reach immigration centers. 24 Isolation measures are implemented when necessary.25 Immigration centers are also staffed with sanitary personnel whose function is to ensure the adequate flow of information to and from the Health Ministry, and to adopt immediate measures when specifi c dangers to public health are involved.26 While parliamentary debate has generated ne w regulations, no specific legislative bills containing extraordinary measures to address the Ebola epidemic have yet been introduced in Italy. On October 14, 2014, the National Institute for Inf ectious Diseases (Istituto nazionale per le malattie infettive, Lazzaro Spalla nzani), updated its Operational Procedures for the Management of Suspected, Probable, or Confirmed Cases and Contacts of the Ebola Virus Disease in Western Africa (the Procedure). 27 The Procedure contains three parts: the first describes the Ebola virus disease; the second regulates the tr eatment of Ebola patients; and th e third deals with other stages in the treatment of the disease, including disinf ection and sanitation, wast e treatment, disposal corps, and surveillance of health personnel. 23 Camera dei deputati, Session No. 228 (May 14, 2014), Mi sure sanitarie per tutelare i cittadini in aree dell'Africa [Sanitary Measures to Protect Citizens with Relation to the Influx of Immigrants Coming from the Mediterranean, with Particular Reference to the Dissemination of the Ebola Virus in Several Areas of maggio 2014 [XVII Legislature, Transcript of Assembly Session No. 228, of May 14, 2014], http://www.camera.it/leg17/ 410?idSeduta=0228&tipo=stenografico# . 24 Id.

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the primary agency in charge of responding to infectious disease outbreaks and other health crises, has issued guidelines for h ealth crisis management. Japan's Infectious Diseases Prevention Act of 1998 provides the legislative framework for the country's response to a potential health crisis caused by infectious disease. The Act classifies infectious diseases covered by the Act into several categories, depending on infectiousness and the severity of symptoms. Under the Act, the Ministry of Health, local governments, and the institutions under them monitor and report on the outbreak of infectious diseases and coordinate their roles to prevent more in fections. Medical doctors report incidences of infectious disease to governors through local h ealth centers. Those health centers have broad jurisdiction over health-related issues and play an important role in health crisis management. Japan has designated hospitals with special f acilities to deal with patients who are infected with serious and highly infectious diseases. A governor may order the hospitalization of patients in certain cases. A quarantine syst em is activated when the outbreak of an infectious disease overseas becomes a threat to the Japanese people. When the system is activated quarantine officers may ask questions of incoming passengers and take their temperatures. When the head of a quarantin e station finds or suspects that a person is infected with one of several specified disease s, he or she may isolate the person in an appropriate place. The Special Measures Act on New Influen za was also enacted in 2012, creating an emergency system specifically for influenza. I. Government Structure In Japan executive power is vested in the Cabinet, which consists of the Prime Minister and other ministers. The Prime Minister is designated from among the memb ers of the Diet (Parliament) by a resolution of the Diet. He then appoints th e other ministers. Localities are divided into prefectures and municipalities . II. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System A. National Health Crisis Management The Cabinet has a Deputy Chief Cabinet Secr etary for Crisis Management who manages emergency measures when a situation causing signi ficant damage to Japanese people's lives or Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Japan The Law Library of Congress 123 assets occurs or is likely to occur.1 As stated below, the Deput y Chief Cabinet Secretary for Crisis Management chairs the conf erence of relevant ministries and agencies on Ebola, which is preparing to take coordinated measures among gove rnment agencies in case Japanese nationals are infected with Ebola abroad or persons infected with Ebola are found within Japan. The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) is the primary agency in charge of responding to infectious disease outbr eaks and other health crises in Japan. 2 In 1997, the MHLW published the Basic Guidelines in Health Crisis Management3 and four management implementation guidelines for health crises cau sed by medicine, infecti ous diseases, drinking water contamination, and food poisoning.4 The MHLW has established an electronic health crisis management information system and has also issued guidelines for municipal governments, instructing them to make preparations and develop plans for emergency situations.5 The Health Risk Management Office of MHLW is continually gathering domestic and overseas information from related departments and from national research and de velopment institutes. Departments within MHLW exchange information at the Health Risk Ma nagement Coordination Meeting held two times per month. 6 A Coordination Meeting can also be convened in an emergency and members may act to establish em ergency management headquarters, dispatch staff and experts to the affected areas, and provide citizens w ith information on health risks.7 B. Local Public Health Crisis System Prefectures are in charge of conducting various on- the-spot measures during a health crisis. In Japan, local government health centers play an im portant role in local health care management.8 Prefectures and designated cities have establishe d at least one health center in each of their jurisdictions,9 resulting in the creation of approximate ly five hundred health centers throughout 1 Naikaku h [Cabinet Act], Act No. 5 of 2010, amended by Act No. 108 of 2013, art. 15. 2 Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare Establishment Act, Act No. 97 of 1999, art. 4, para. 1, items 4 and 19. 3 MHLW, Kosei r d sh kenk in Health Crisis Management], http://www.mhlw.go.jp/general/seido/kousei/kenkou/sisin/index.html (last visited Oct. 8, 2014). 4 The four health crisis management implementa tion outlines are available on the MHLW website, http://www.mhlw.go.jp/general/seido/kousei/kenkou/index.html (last visited Oct. 8, 2014). 5 Chiiki ni okeru kenko kikikanri ni tsuite [Regarding (Mar. 2001), http://www.mhlw.go.jp/general/seido/kousei/kenkou/guideline/index.html . 6 MHLW, ANNUAL HEALTH , LABOUR AND WELFARE pt. 2, ch. 1, \u00a7 9, http://www.mhlw.go.jp/ english/wp/wp-hw4/dl/honbun/2_1_9.pdf . 7 Regarding MHLW , MHLW, http://www.mhlw.go.jp/ seisaku/2010/03/01.html (in No. 17 (Mar. 30, 2001), I, http://www.mhlw.go.jp/general/seido/kousei/kenkou/guideline/index.html . 9 Chiiki hoken h [Local Health Act], Act No. 101 of 1947, last amended by Law No. 83 of 2014, art. 5.

Health ce nters are to respond to emergency information twenty-four hours a day, seve n days a week. Health centers ar e expected to coordinate services provide d by medical service providers.14 C. Pandemic Influenza Special Measures Japan established a system to deal with new in fluenza when avian flu (H5N1) threatened its citizens. In 2004, the government established the Conference of Relevant Mi nistries and Agencies to Counter New Influenza and Avian Influenza.15 The Action Plan to Counter Influenza was approved by the Conference in November 2005,16 and revised in February 2009.17 When a new influenza outbreak occurs, the Prime Minister and all Ministers form the Headquarters Against New Influenza, which in turn forms the New Influenza Countermeasures Expert Advisory Committee. 18 10 Jichitai betsu hokenjo secchi s no suii [Changes of Numbers of Health Centers by Local Governments], as of April 1, 2014, Zenkoku hoken sho ch kai [Japanese Association of Public Health Center Directors], http://www.phcd.jp/03/HCsuii/index.html . 11 Local Health Act art. 6. 12 Basic Guidelines Regarding Promotion of Measures to Improve Local Health Issues Based on Local Health Act Article 4, Paragraph 1, MHW Notification No. 374 (Dec. 1, 1994), last amended by MHLW Notification No. 464 (July 31, 2012), http://www.mhlw.go.jp/file/06-Seisakuj ouhou-10900000-Kenkoukyoku/0000049526.pdf (in Japanese). 13 Id. 14 Local Health Crisis Management Guidelines, supra note 8, II tsuite [Regarding Establishment of Conference of Relevant Ministries and Agencies to Counter New Flu and Avian Flu], Agreement Among Relevant Ministries (Mar. 2, 2004), http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/ful/konkyo.pdf . 16 Press Release, MHLW, Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Action Plan of the Japanese Government (Summary), (Nov. 2005), http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/topics/influenza/pandemic01.html . 17 Shingata Infuruenza to Counter Influe nza], Conference of Relevant Ministries and Agencies to Counter New Influenza and Avian Influenza (Feb, 2009), http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/ ful/kettei/090217keikaku.pdf . 18 Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Pandemic Influenza (Phase 4), Introduction, Conference of Relevant Ministries and Agencies to Counter New Influenza and Avian Influenza (Mar. 26, 2009), http://www.mhlw.go.jp/ bunya/kenkou/kekkaku-kansenshou04/pdf/09-e01.pdf . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Japan The Law Library of Congress 125 To improve the system, the Special Measures Act on New Influenza was enacted in May 2012.19 Under the new Act, the government's action plan20 and guidelines21 were updated.22 When an influenza outbreak involving a new strain of infl uenza occurs, the Prime Minister establishes the New Influenza Countermeasures Headquarters upon a Cabinet decision, unless symptoms of the new influenza are no graver than usual seasonal influenza.23 The Prime Minister is in charge of the Headquarters24 and, as such, can declare an emergenc y when the infection route of the new influenza is not determined by th e local governments' investigations or when such investigations reveal that the activities of the person infected or suspected of being infected pose a great risk of widely spreading the disease.25 When an emergency is declared, emergency measur es can be implemented for up to two years, with the possibility of a one-year extension. The area of the emergency mu st also be specified. 26 Authorized emergency measures include requesting residents to refrain from going outside and requesti ng entertainment businesses to limit or close their business or events, 27 vaccinating residents,28 opening emergency medical facilities,29 and requesting the sale of speci fied goods to the government.30 19 Shingata infuruenza t tokubetsu sochi h [Special Measures Act on New Influenza], Act No. 31 of 20 Shingata infuruenza t taisaku seihu kodo keikaku [National Action Plan for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases] (June 7, 2013), English transl ation available on the Cabinet Secretariat website, 21 Shingata infuruenza to taisaku gaidorain [Guidelines on Countermeasures Against Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases], Conference of Relevant Ministri es and Agencies to Counter New Influenza and Avian Influenza (June 26, 2013), http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/ful/keikaku/pdf/gl_guideline.pdf . 22 Government plans are available on the Cabinet Secretariat's website, at http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/ ful/keikaku.html (last visited Oct. 24, 2014). 23 Special Measures Act on New Influenza art. 15. 24 Id. art. 16. 25 Id. art. 32; Enforcement Order of Special Measures Act on New Influenza, Order No. 122 of 2013, art. 6. 26 Special Measures Act on New Influenza art. 32. 27 Id. art. 45. 28 Id. art. 46. 29 Id. art. 48. 30 Id. art. 55.

Surveillance Japan conducts nationwide surveillance of in fectious diseases on an ongoing basis. The Infectious Diseases Prevention Law classifies infectious diseases into the following eight categories based on their infectiousness, the serious ness of the symptoms, and types of diseases: Category I: Ebola hemorrhagic feve r, plague, smallpox, and others. Category II: Tuberculosis, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), H5N1 avian influenza, and others. Category III: Cholera, bacillus dysentery, E. coli O157 infection, typho id, and paratyphoid. Category IV: Hepatitis E, hepa titis A, yellow fever, anth rax, infantile botulism, avian influenza (excluding H5N1) and others. An inf ectious disease can be added to this category by Cabinet order. Category V: Influenza (excludi ng avian flu and new influen za), viral hepatitis (excluding hepatitis E and A), AIDS, MRSA (methicillin-res istant Staphylococcus aureus), and others. An infectious disease can be newly added to this category by MHLW ordinance. New Influenza. Designated Infectious Disease. New Infectious Disease.31 When physicians make a diagnosis or suspect the incidence of symptoms of one of the diseases in Categories I through IV, or a New Infectious Disease, they must immediately report the incidences to the governors throug h health centers. In the cas e of incidences of Category V diseases, physicians have seven days to make such reports. 32 Veterinarians must do the same when they make a diagnosis in monkeys or other designated animal s of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and other infectious diseases in Categories I through IV that are designated by a Cabinet order because they are re garded as being infectious to humans as well.33 The governors must forward such re ports to the Minister of MHLW.34 Governors designate hospitals and clinics to m onitor incidences of (1) specified Category V infectious diseases; and (2) inci dences of fever and respiratory problems, and fevers and rashes that are similar to symptoms of diseases in Ca tegories II to IV and so me Category V infectious 31 Kansen sh no yob oyobi kansensh [Act on Preven tion of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients of Infectious Dise ases] (Infectious Diseases Pr evention Act), Act No. 114 of 1998, last amended by Act No. 30 of 2008, art. 6, para. 2, items 2-9. 32 Id. art. 12, para. 1. 33 Id. art. 13, para. 1. 34 Id. art. 12, para. 2 & art. 13, para. 3.

Managers of designated hospitals must report cases treated by their physicians to the governors, and the governors must in turn forw ard the reports to the Minister of MHLW.35 Governors may question doctors an d conduct investigations of inci dences and suspected cases of infectious diseases in Categories I to V and New Diseases if necessary to determine the cause of the incidences. In an emergency, th e Minister of MHLW can do the same. 36 The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (N IID), under the supervision of the Health Science Division of the MHLW, 37 collects reports of the detection of infectious agents from prefectural public health institutes and those of incidents of infectious diseases from selected clinics.38 The NIID also maintains and distributes reference ma terials on matters such as microbial pathogens, antigens, and antisera.39 In the case of an epidemic or outbr eak of an infectious disease, NIID carries out epidemiological inve stigations and exchanges inform ation with infectious disease surveillance organizations in ot her countries. To make these activities more efficient, the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center (IDSC) was organized within NIID.40 IDSC publishes the Infectious Disease Weekly Report and other publications a nd makes them available online.41 B. Infectious Disease Control A prefectural governor may advise a person who is reasonably suspected of being infected with a Category I, II, or III disease, or New In fluenza, to undergo a medical examination.42 I f t h e person does not voluntarily undergo an examinati on, the governor may dispatch an officer to examine the person.43 Except in emergencies, however, the governor must gi ve notice to the person before issuing a medical examination recommendation or disp atching an officer.44 When a governor receives a report th at a person is infected with a Category I through III disease or New Influenza from a medical doctor, the g overnor sends a notice to the person prohibiting him or her from engaging in specified jobs, such as chef and waiter positions at a restaurant, for a period of time that depends on the disease. 45 35 Id. art. 14; Infectious Diseases Pr evention Act Enforcement Ordinance, MHLW Ordinance No. 99 of 2008, arts. 6 & 7. 36 Infectious Diseases Prevention Act art. 15. 37 MHLW Organization Order, Order No. 252 of 2000, art. 26. 38 Outline - Organization: History , NIID, http://www.niid.go.jp/niid /en/aboutniid-2.html (last visited Oct. 10, 2014). 39 40 Outline - Organization: Functions , NIID, http://www.niid.go.jp/niid /en/aboutniid-2.html (last visited Oct. 10, 2014). 41 Infectious Disease Weekly Report , NIID, http://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/idwr.html (in Japanese; last visited Oct. 11, 2014).

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Japan The Law Library of Congress 128 A system of recommended or fo rced medical diagnosis and hos pitalization may be activated when a person is suspected of being infected wi th certain infectious di seases. A governor may advise a person infected with a Category I or II disease or New In fluenza to be hospitalized in a designated hospital. If the person does not follo w the advice, the prefectural governor may force the person to stay in a designated hospital.46 The term of the hospitaliz ation must be seventy-two hours or less initially.47 If the governor finds during the initia l hospitalization that it is necessary to continue to hospitalize the person to preven t the spread of a Category I or II disease or New Influenza, the governor may recommend hospitaliza tion for up to an additional ten days, with the possibility of two ten-day extensions, if necessary.48 If the person does not follow the advice, the governor may force the hospitalization,49 but must give the patient an d/or his or her guardian an opportunity to state their opinions.50 The Infectious Diseases Prevention Act contains provisions aimed at protecting the rights of patients. All measures taken agai nst individuals who are infected or suspected of being infected with certain infectious diseases must be at the minimally required level. 51 A person must be released from the hospital when it is determined that he or she does not have a pathogen. The hospitalized person can request release from ho spitalization, whereupon th e governor must test the person to determine whether he or she has a pathogen. 52 The governor may seek the opinion of experts before making a decision. Such an opinion is provided by an infectious disease examination council that each health center maintains. When a governor issues a notice that restricts the infected person fr om engaging in certain jobs, a dvises hospitalization, and extends the period of hospitaliz ation, as stated above, the council gives its op inion to the governor. 53 A hospitalized person can appeal the governor's decision to the Minist er of the MHLW. The Minister then makes a decision in cons ultation with the MH LW experts' council.54 In addition to the examination a nd hospitalization of persons infected with certain infectious diseases, prefectural governors may take various measures when necessary to prevent incidences or the spread of particular infect ious diseases. In order to prev ent incidences or the spread of Category I through IV infectious diseases and Ne w Influenza, a governor may order the infected person, the guardian of the person, or the person or organization that manages the place affected to disinfect that place. If such disinfection is not eff ective, the governor may order a municipality that has control of the site where the patient was or other contaminated places to sterilize such places. 55 A governor may also order a person or organization that manages the site 46 Id. art. 19, paras. 1-3 & art. 26. 47 Id. art. 19, para. 4 & art. 26. 48 Id. art. 20, para. 4 & art. 26. 49 Id. art. 20, paras. 1-3 & art. 26. 50 Id. art 20, para. 6 & art. 26. 51 Id. art. 22-2. 52 Id. art. 22. 53 Id. art. 24. 54 Id. arts. 25 & 26. 55 Id. art. 27.

If such extermination is not effec tive, the governor may order municipalities to exterminate them.56 Further, a governor may order holders of possibly contaminated food, clothing, bedding, and other items to restrict the movement of, sterili ze, or dispose of the items. A governor may also dispatch pref ectural officials or order a m unicipal government to sterilize or dispose of such items.57 To prevent incidences or the spread of Cate gory I through III infectious diseases and New Influenza, a governor may restrict the movement of an infected co rpse, or require a permit for the burial of an infected corpse. Generally, an infected corpse must be cremated, but with sterilization treatment and a pe rmit, the body can be buried. 58 T o p r e v e n t i n c i d e n c e s o r t h e spread of Category I through III infectious diseases , a governor may restrict the use of water or a water supply that is suspected of being contaminated. In such cases, municipalities must provide clean water for residents.59 To prevent incidences or the spread of Category I infectious diseases, stronger measures may be taken. A governor may restrict access to buildings that are contaminated or suspected of being contaminated with a Category I infectious disease, 60 and may also restri ct traffic for up to seventy-two hours around the place where the patient is located or the place suspected of being contaminated. 61 C. New Infectious Diseases or New Threats by Known Infectious Diseases The Infectious Diseases Prevention Act has provisi ons to combat new infec tious diseases or new threats by known infectious diseases. Where thr eats of new influenza, or known influenza that poses renewed threats to public health, are recogn ized, a governor may seek a report of the health conditions, including body temperature, of the pe rson suspected of being infected for a period that is determined after consid ering the incubation period of the influenza. A governor may also request that such person not go ou tside of his or her residence, and take other actions that are necessary to confine the disease. In such cases, the governor may provide meals and other necessities for the infected person.62 Where the influenza is vi rulent and it is especially necessary to prevent its incide nce or spread, the national govern ment can restrict access to a building and control traffic, as stated in the prev ious section\u2014measures th at are normally applied to Category I infectious diseases.63 56 Id. art. 28. 57 Id. art. 29. 58 Id. art. 30. 59 Id. art. 31. 60 Id. art. 32. 61 Id. art. 33. 62 Id. art. 44-3. 63 Id. art. 44-4. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Japan The Law Library of Congress 130 In the case of a new disease other than infl uenza, the governor may recommend that a person who is suspected of being inf ected receive a medical examin ation. If the person does not voluntarily undergo a medical examin ation, the governor may have a prefectural official examine the person.64 Other measures used for other categories of infectious diseases under the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act can be used, including ma ndatory hospitalization and sterilization of the affected building.65 The governor must consult with the Minister of the MHLW prior to taking these actions, however,66 and the Minister must give the governor technical advice.67 When the MHLW has devised effective measures to prevent the spread of a new infectious disease, the government issues an order to ma ke available all measures for Ca tegory I infectious diseases under the Act for up to a year in order to prevent the spread of the new disease.68 Designated Infectious Disease is a category for a known infectious disease (other than Category I through III infectious diseases and New Influenza) that newly becomes a threat to the Japanese people. The government makes this designation by issuing an order that makes all measures under the Act available for the newly designated disease for up to a year. 69 For example, severe acute respiratory syndrom e (SARS) was designated as a New Infectious Disease on April 3, 2003, and then named a Designated Infectious Disease on June 20, 2003. 70 Later, at the time of the 2006 am endment to the Infectious Dis eases Prevention Act, SARS was added to Category II infectious diseases.71 H5N1 avian influenza was designated as a Designated Infectious Disease on June 2, 2006.72 Later, at the time of the 2008 amendment to the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, H5N1 avian influenza was added to Category II infectious diseases.73 D.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Japan The Law Library of Congress 131 A Designated Specified Infectious Disease Medical Institution is designated by the Minister of the MHLW upon the institution's consent, and tr eats patients stricken with New Infectious Diseases, Category I and II infecti ous diseases, and New Influenza.74 A Designated Category I Infectious Disease Medi cal Institution is designated by a governor upon the institution's consent and treats patients w ith Category I and II infectious diseases and New Influenza.75 A Designated Category II Infecti ous Disease Medical Institution is designated by a governor upon the institution's consent and tr eats patients with Category II infectious diseases and New Influenza.76 These Designated Medical Institutions must accep t patients with the specified diseases for hospitalization, and follow inst ructions from the Minister of MHLW or the governor. 77 The MHLW has issued standards for Designated Category I and II Infectious Disease Medical Institutions. The standards fo r the designated hospital for Cate gory I diseases is significantly higher than the one for Category II diseases. Fo r example, the hospital standards for Category I diseases require that the patient's room have air pre ssure that is lower than the su rrounding area so that pathogens will not exit the room; there must be a room between the patient's room and hall or other area; there must be an independent ventilati on system for the patient's room; and there must be equipment that sanitizes drained water from the room or the area where the room is located.78 As of April 2014, Japan had three Designated Specified Infectious Disease Medical Institutions, forty-four Designated Category I Infectious Disease Medical Institutions, and 335 Designated Category II Infectious Dis ease Medical Institutions. 79 74 Infectious Diseases Prevention Act art. 6, para. 13 & art. 38, para. 1. 75 Id. art. 6, para. 14 & art. 38, para. 2. 76 Id. art. 6, para. 15 & art. 38, para. 2. 77 Id. art. 38, para. 3. 78 Kansensh no yob oyobi taisuru iry ni kansuru h ritsu dai 38 j dai 2 k no kitei ni motoduku k sei rd iry kikan no kijun [Standards for Designated Infectious Disease Medical Institutions Set by the Minister of MH LW, Based on the Infectious Disease Prevention Law, Article 38, Paragraph 2], MHLW Notif ication No. 43 (Mar. 19, 1999). shitei iry kikan no shitei j ky [Statistics of Designated Infectious Disease Medical Institutions], MHLW (Apr. 1, 2014), http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/kenkou /kekkaku-kansenshou15/02-02.html . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Japan The Law Library of Congress 132 E. Quarantine Two ministries have jurisdicti on over quarantines. Human a nd food quarantine is under the MHLW's jurisdiction. Plant and animal quarantine falls under the ju risdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery. Under the Quarantine Law, vessels or aircraft that originated from or visi ted a foreign country, or encountered and received persons or material from a forei gn country, must obtain a Free Pratique, or a Provisory Free Pratique before they enter into ports in Japan, except when they enter into designated quarantine areas. 80 The captains of vessels or aircraft must inform the Chief of the Quarantine Station in advance of ma tters prescribed in the MHLW ordinances, such as whether patients suffering from or who have died from quaran tine infectious diseases have been on board.81 \"Quarantine infectious diseases\" refers to Category I infectious diseases, New Influenza under the Infectious Diseases Preventi on Act, and other infectious diseases specified by Cabinet order.82 People on board vessels and aircraft must not leav e the designated area until a Free Pratique or a Provisory Free Pratique is issued unless the Chief of the Quarantine Station has confirmed that persons or materials on board are not contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms causing infectious diseas es that are subject to quarantine.83 When vessels and aircraft enter into the design ated quarantine areas, the head of a quarantine office may order quarantine officers to ask questi ons of the passengers of vessels and aircraft from foreign countries. 84 Quarantine officers may also exam ine passengers, vessels, and aircraft in order to determine the existence of a pathogen.85 When swine influenza spread in Mexico, the US, and Canada in 2009, internatio nal airports in Japan strengthene d their quaranti ne measures. Quarantine officers went into airplanes arriving from these three countries, distributed health condition questionnaires, and examined body te mperatures. Where a passenger was found to have symptoms of swine influenza infection, an instant infection test kit was used for the person.86 When a vessel leaves or passes areas where there was a case of a quarantined disease, when a passenger of a vessel was infected with a quarantined disease, or when the existence of mice that were likely infected with plague is confirmed in a vessel, the head of the quarantine office may take the following measures, am ong others, if necessary: 80 Ken-eki h [Quarantine Act], Act No. 201 of 1951, last amended by Act No. 69 of 2014, art. 4. 81 Id. art. 6. 82 Id. art. 2. 83 Id. art. 5. 84 Id. art. 12. 85 Id. art. 13. 86 Measures Against New Influenza at Narita Airport Quarantine Office , 30 I NFECTIOUS AGENTS SURVEILLANCE REPORT 257 (Oct. 2009), http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/30/356/dj3561.html (in Japanese). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Japan The Law Library of Congress 133 Isolate the person infected with a Cate gory I disease or New Influenza; Force the person suspected of being infected w ith a Category I disease or New Influenza to stay at the designated facility or on the vesse l, provided that this is necessary to prevent entrance of the pathogen into Japan, and that the infection is recognized in the relevant foreign country and would seriously threaten people's health and lives in Japan; Sanitize items and places that are suspected of being contaminated, or discard items if they are not sanitized effectively; and Vaccinate people.87 Persons who are infected with Cate gory I infectious diseases or New Influenza are isolated at an appropriate, designated medical institution.88 Persons suspected of being infected with a Category I disease or New Influenza are also kept in appropriate designated medical institutions, but can be kept in other medical institutions or onboard the ve ssel on which they arrived under special circumstances.89 Persons suspected of being infected with New Influenza can be kept at a designated medical institution, other medical in stitutions, hotels, or the vessel on which they arrived.90 Persons who were isolated or kept at a designated place will be released when a medical professional confirms that the person does not have a pathogen.91 Other than Category I infectious diseases and New Influenza, when the incidences of other know n infectious diseases or a new infectious disease is recognized in a foreign country and the government recognizes the necessity of quarantine to preven t the entry and spread of the di sease, the government may apply these measures of isolation and forced stay.92 F. Tracking Persons The head of a quarantine office must report specified information concerning a quarantined person who is infected with a Category II throu gh IV disease, or a Desi gnated or New Infectious Disease, to the governor who has juri sdiction over the person's residence.93 In addition, when the head of a quarantine office decides not to keep in quarantine a person who might be infected with a Category I disease or Ne w Influenza, the head of the quarantine office must collect information on the person, such as name, address, or place of stay in Japan, and the schedule of his or her travels in Japan, and notify the governor who has jurisdiction over the address or place of stay of this information. 94 The governor who receives such a report may monitor the 87 Quarantine Act art. 14. 88 Id. art. 15. 89 Id. art. 16, para. 1. 90 Id. art. 16, para. 2. 91 Id. art. 15, para. 2 & art. 16, para. 4. 92 Id. arts. 34-2, 34-3, 34-4. 93 Id. art. 26-3. 94 Id. art. 18, paras. 4 & 5.

Animal Quarantine To prevent infectious diseases of animal origi n, the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act provides for animal quarantines and bans.96 For example, the import of m onkeys from Africa is basically prohibited. To import them, special permissi on from the MHLW and the MAFF are needed,97 in order to prevent the incursion into Japan of Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Marburg viral disease.98 In addition, the Rabies Prevention Law pr ovides that dogs, cats, raccoons, foxes, and skunks imported into the count ry must be quarantined.99 The Livestock Infectious Diseases Prevention Act also has quarantine provisions for imported livestock.100 IV. Transparency of the Public He alth Crisis Management System The MHLW Basic Guidelines makes the administrati on of health care crises transparent. The guidelines also direct the MHLW to provide and publicize various pieces of information it holds about a given crisis.101 Health care crisis management by local governments is based on the MHLW's Local Health Crisis Management Guid elines, which identify pr oviding information to the public as one important ta sk of local health centers.102 The Infectious Diseases Prevention Act also has provisions to ensure the transparency of public health crisis management information. The Act provides that the nationa l and local governments must educate people with correct information on infectious diseases and provide analytical information on infectious disease trends. 103 V. Cooperation with WHO Japan is a member of the Wo rld Health Organization (WHO)104 and complies with the International Health Regulations (IHR).105 When the MHLW recognizes an incidence of an 95 Infectious Diseases Prev ention Act arts. 15-2 & 15-3. 96 Id. ch. 10. 97 Id. art. 54; Ordinance to Set Areas from Which Imports Are Banned Based on Infectious Diseases Prevention Act Article 54, Item 1, MHLW & MAFF Ordinance No. 2 of 1999, art. 1. 98 What Is Animal Quarantine? , ANIMAL QUARANTINE SERVICE , MAFF, http://www.maff.go.jp/aqs/english/ (last visited 19, 2014). 99 Kykenby yob h [Rabies Prevention Act], Act No. 247 of 1950, last amended by Act No. 160 of 1999, art. 2; Kykenby yob h shik rei [Rabies Prevention Act Implementation Order], Order No. 236 of 1953, art. 1. 100 Kachiku densenby yobo h [Livestock Infectious Diseases Prevention Act], Act No. 166 of 1951. 101 Basic Guidelines in Health Crisis Management, supra note 3. 102 Local Health Crisis Management Guidelines, supra note 8. 103 Infectious Diseases Prevention Act art. 3, para. 1 & art. 16, para. 1. 104 Countries , WHO, http://www.who.int/countries/en/ (last visited Oct. 20, 2014).

Recent Developments As discussed in Part II(C), the Special Measur es Act on New Influen za was enacted in 2012. That Act created an influenza emergency system. More recently, a bill to amend the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act was submitted to the Diet in October 2014. Pursuant to the bill, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) would be added to Category II infectious diseases. Avian flu (H7N9), which was temporarily added to Category II by Cabinet order design ation, would also be added to Category II on a permanent basis. In addition, the bill contains provision s that would enable the governor to collect specimens from persons infected w ith specified infectious diseases. 108 In response to the Ebola outbreak in West Af rica in 2014, the Japanese government decided to allow the use of a drug approved for in fluenza treatment in certain situations 109 for Ebola treatment, and to enhance detection and examinati on of people who arrive at airports in Japan and have been in four African countries where E bola has spread (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria).110 Yasuhisa Shiozaki, Minister of MHLW , said that Japan stockpiles the drug sufficient to treat 20,000 people.111 On October 27, 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Minister Shiozaki and directed him to set up a meeting of relevant Cabinet members on responses to Ebola.112 The meeting was approved by the Cabinet on October 28, and the first 105 See About IRH (International Health Regulations) , WHO, http://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/ (last visited Oct. kiki kanri jisshi y ry Management Implementation Manual], Health Div., MHLW, Mar. 2007, last amended Oct. 2013, ko, i/kenkou/kansen/index.html . 107 Outline - Organization: Functions , supra note 40. 108 Bill to Amend the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act (submitted Oct. 14, 2014), available at http://www.mhlw. go.jp/topics/bukyoku/soumu/houritu/187.html (in Japanese). 109 Press Release, Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., The New Dr ug Application Approval of \"AVIGAN\u00ae Tablet 200mg\" in Japan for the Anti-influenza Virus Drug (Mar. 24, 2014), https://www.toyama-chemical.co.jp/eng/news/ news140324e.html Relevant Cabinet Members on Responses to the Ebola Virus Disease . . .

The Law Library of Congress 137 Kenya Hanibal Goitom Foreign Law Specialist* SUMMARY Kenyan officials enjoy broad legal authority to impose various forms of restrictions during public health crises. The Constitution authori zes the head of state to declare a state of emergency and put in place wide-ranging public security preservation measures, including restrictions on movement and assembly, a ppropriation of private property and labor, and restrictions on entry into the country. However, in order for actions under this authority to remain in place for an extended period of time, they need legislative approval. Similarly, the Public Health Act (PHA), the primary legislation applicable to matters of public health crises, authorizes public health authorities, particularly the Minister of Health, to take various ac tions during public health cr ises, including declaring an infectious disease a \"notifiable infectious disease\" or a \"formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious disease,\" and taking the necessary pr evention and suppression measures to fight the disease. Specific powers acco rded to health authorities for the purpose of prevention and suppression of an infectious disease include search, seizure, and detention powers; the power to designate any place as a quarantine area, including ships and aircraft; and the power to restrict or ban immigration into the country. Kenyan and international laws impose certai n transparency requirements on the country's government. Chief among these are the requirement under the PHA to periodically publish information regarding infectious diseases in Kenya, neighboring countries, and around the world, and the obligation under the International Health Regulations to report any public health emergency to the World Health Organization (WHO). Although Kenya is geographically far from the Ebola-stricken West African region and to this day remains infection-free, the WHO recently declared the country at high risk for an Ebola infection given that it is a transportation hub in East Africa. As a result, the Kenyan government has taken various measures to prep are for an outbreak, including putting in place a contingency plan; establishing an Ebola response advisory task force; partially closing border crossings with Uganda, where there was a recent suspected Ebola death; and instituting a travel ban on persons traveling from the Ebola-stricken countries. I. Government Structure Kenya previously had a unitary sy stem of government but recently introduced a system akin to a federation with the adoption of the 2010 Kenya Constitution, which established a two-tiered system of government involving the national and county levels.1 * This report updates a report originally prepared in 20 03 by Charles Mwalimu, former Senior Legal Specialist. 1 CONSTITUTION art. 1 (2010), available on the Kenya Law website, at http://www.kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/ kenyalex/actview.xql?actid=Const2010 . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 138 A. National Government In adherence to the principle of separation of powers, government power at the national level is shared by three branches tasked with constitutionally delimited powers and obligations: the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. 2 1. The Executive The national executive consists of the President, the Deputy President, and the rest of the Cabinet, which includes the Attorney-General , who is the principal legal advisor to the government among other functions, and fourt een to twenty-two Cabinet Secretaries.3 2. The Legislature Another new feature in the count ry's government structure is th e establishment of a bicameral legislative body consisting of a 349-member National Assembly and a sixty-seven-member Senate.4 The National Assembly enjoys broad le gislative and supervisory powers, enacting legislation on any matter over which the na tional government has jurisdiction under the Constitution, determining revenue allocation between the different tiers of government, appropriating funds for government spending , and exercising oversight over government spending and the conduct of the executive branch of government.5 The role of the Senate, both in terms of legislative and supervisory powers, is by and large limited to matters that affect the interests of the counties. 6 3. The Judiciary The Kenyan judiciary consists of what are known as superior courts (the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Cour t) and subordinate c ourts (magistrates' courts, kadhis' courts, the courts marshal, and tribunals).7 While all of these courts have distinct jurisdictional mandates, for the purposes of this report it is sufficient to point out that the High Court's subject matter jurisdiction includes matters of constitutional interpretation in relation to \"constitutional powers of State organs in respect to county go vernments\" and \"the constitutional relationship between levels of government,\" and questions relating to conflic ts between national and county- issued laws. 8 This may be significant given that the national and county governments share legislative jurisdiction on public health issues (see below).9 Decisions of the High Court on 2 Id. 3 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 130, 152 & 156. 4 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 93, 97 & 98. 5 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 95 & 109. 6 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 96, 109-113. 7 Id. \u00a7 162; The Courts , REPUBLIC OF KENYA , THE JUDICIARY , http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/page/courts (last visited Oct. 21, 2014). 8 CONSTITUTION \u00a7 165. 9 Id. \u00a7 186.

County Governments Kenya has forty-seven counties, including Nairobi (t he capital), which have their own legislative (county assembly) and executive (county executive) organs.11 The functions of the county assemblies include making laws on matters within their legislativ e jurisdiction (matters specified under the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution); exercising oversight over county executive bodies (for instance the county assembly approves the appointments of the governor to the county executive committee, which is the cabinet of the county government); and approving management and exploitation plan s for the counties' resources, and the development and management of co unty institutions and infrastructure. 12 The executive branch of the county government, th e county executive committee, consists of the county governor, the deputy county gove rnor, and county executive members. 13 II. Structure of the Public Health Management System Ordinarily the national and county governments enjoy concurrent legi slative jurisdiction on health-related matters. The na tional government enjoys legi slative jurisdiction on matters relating to \"[h]ealth policy\" an d \"[n]ational referral health facilities,\" while the county governments may legislate on issues relating to c ounty health services, in cluding county health facilities and cemeteries, funeral parlors, and crematoria.14 While the health issues over which the county governments are accord ed jurisdiction appear local in nature, the ongoi ng Ebola crisis in Liberia reveals that rules on i ssues such as burial r ituals during public hea lth crises may have great ramifications for the prevention and s uppression of an infectious disease outbreak.15 As noted below, in times of pub lic health cris es, the national government has broad, unfettered powers to impose nationally applicable response measures regardless of whether a county government has jurisdiction over the matter. 10 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 163 & 164. 11 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 6 & 176. 12 Id. \u00a7 185; County Governments Act, No. 17 of 2012, \u00a7\u00a7 5 & 8 (July 24, 2012), available on the Kenya Law website, at http://www.kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/kenyalex/actview.xql?actid=NO.%2017%20of%202012 . 13 CONSTITUTION \u00a7 179; County Governments Act \u00a7 30. 14 CONSTITUTION \u00a7 186. 15 Ebola Cremation Ruling Prompts Secret Burials in Liberia , THE GUARDIAN (Oct. 24, 2014), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/eb ola-cremation-ruling-se cret-burials-liberia . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 140 III. Powers of National Public Health Authorities A. Declaration of a State of Emergency Under the Constitution One of the ways that the nationa l government may respond to a publ ic health crisis is through the application of constitutional power s of the executive body. Subject to certain limitations, the President has the power to declare a state of emergency, including when the country is under threat from a \"natural disaster or other public emergenc y\" and doing so \"is ne cessary to meet the circumstances for which the emergency is declared.\"16 Any law issued under a state of emergency can impose limitations on the rights and fundamental fr eedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights, so long as the emergency requires the limitation and it is in ke eping with applicable international law.17 However, the declaration of an emergency and any laws issued or actions taken by the President are effective for only four teen days unless extended by the National Assembly. 18 The National Assembly can extend the declaration of a state of emergency by a maximum of two months at a time.19 While a first extension can be adopted with the support of at leas t two-thirds of all members of the National Assembly, all subseque nt extensions require the support of three- quarters of all members of the National Assembly.20 The President is authorized under the Constitution to bring into ope ration Part III of the Public Preservation Security Act 21 and issue regulations for the pu rpose of \"preservation of public security,\" including \"the securing of the safety of persons and property, . . . [and] the provision of administrative and remedial measures during periods of actu al apprehensible national danger or calamity.\"22 These regulations may make provisions for . . . B. the registration, restriction of movement (into, out of or within Kenya), and compulsory movement of persons, including the imposition of curfews: Provided that no person shall be restricted on account of his political beliefs or activities; C. the control of aliens, including the removal of diplomatic privileges; D. the censorship, control or prohibition of the communication of any information, or of any means of communicating or of recordi ng ideas or information, including any publication or document, and the prevention of the dissemination of false reports; 16 CONSTITUTION \u00a7\u00a7 58, 132. 17 Id. 18 Id. \u00a7 58. 19 Id. 20 Id. 21 Preservation of Public S ecurity Act of 1960, 16 L AWS OF KENYA , Cap. 57 (rev. ed. 2012), available on the Kenya Law website, at http://www.kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/k enyalex/actview.xql?actid=CAP.%2057 . 22 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 2 & 4.

It appears that in orde r for a special public security meas ure to be put in place, the only thing required is the classification of an event as a threat or an act that threatens the security of Kenya. B. Statutory Regime 1. Powers of Authorities in a Public Health Crisis Although there are various laws applicable to pub lic health matters, the P ublic Health Act (PHA) of 1921, including its subsidiary le gislation, is the primary law th at governs matters of public health crises in Kenya. 24 This law established and regulat es the functions and powers of a number of health authorities that deal with public h ealth crises. The PHA requires that health authorities take al l the necessary, lawful actions imposed on them under any law to prevent or deal with an outbreak or the prevalence of \"any infectious, 23 Id. \u00a7 4. 24 Public Health Act of 1921, 16 L AWS OF KENYA , Cap. 242 (rev. ed. 2012), http://www.kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/ kenyalex/actview.xql?actid=CAP.%20242 . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 142 communicable or preventable disease, to safeguard and promote the public he alth and to exercise the powers and perform the duties in respect of th e public health.\"25 2. Central Board of Health The PHA envisages what is called the Central Board of Health (the Board), to be based in Nairobi, which is composed of the Director of Me dical Services, a sanitary engineer, a secretary, and up to six additional members, at least th ree of whom must be medical practitioners.26 The main function of the Board is to advise the Mini ster of Health on \"all matters affecting public health,\" including on the prevention of infectious diseases from reaching Kenyan borders and the \"prevention, limitation or suppressi on of infectious, communicable or preventable disease within Kenya.\"27 However, sources consulted for this re port indicated that the Board has yet to be established.28 3. The Medical Department The PHA also established the Medical Depa rtment, which is tasked with a host of responsibilities to prevent and/or play a key role in managing public health crises. The functions of the Department are to prevent and guard against the introducti on of infectious disease into Kenya from outside; to promote the public health and the prevention, limitation or suppression of infectious, communicable or preventable disease within Kenya; to advise and direct local authorities in regard to matters affecting th e public health; to promote or carry out researches [sic] and investigations in conne xion with the prevention or treatment of human diseases; to prepare and publish repor ts and statistical or other information relative to the public health; and generally to carry out in accordance with directions the powers and duties in relation to the public health conferred or imposed by this Act.29 The Department is required by law to \"obtain a nd publish periodically\" information concerning infectious disease in Kenya and similar informa tion regarding neighboring or other countries, as required by the interests of public health.30 25 Id. \u00a7 13. 26 Id. \u00a7 3. 27 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 8 & 10. 28 David I.

Minister of Health and Ge neral Delegated Authority The Minister may, on the advice of the Board or the Department, order an inquiry regarding any public health matter.31 A person authorized by the Minister to conduct an inquiry is accorded broad powers under the Public Health Act, which states as follows: When an inquiry is directed to be made by the Minister, the person directed to make the same shall have free access to all books, plans, maps, documents and other things relevant to the inquiry, and shall have in relation to witnesses and their examination and the production of documents similar powers to those conferred upon magistrates by the Criminal Procedure Code . . . , and may enter and inspect any building, premises or place the entry or inspection whereof appears to him requisite for the purpose of such inquiry.32 5. Notifiable Infectious Diseases (NIDs) The manner in which the Kenyan health authorit ies responded to the HIV/AIDS epidemic is illustrative of the process of declaring a disease to be an NID. HIV/AIDS has impacted Kenya grea tly since the first diagnosis of a case of AIDS in Kenya was made in 1984. By August 1993, the Kenya Nati onal Aids Control Program estimated that 841,700 persons were infected with HIV. 33 By 2003, there were 1.2 million adults and children living with HIV/AIDS in Kenya.34 Of these, 1.1 million were adu lts between the ages of fifteen and forty-nine with an adult rate of 6.7%.35 Adult women age fifteen to forty-nine accounted for 750,000 of the total number, while 100,000 of the people living with HIV/AIDS were children under the age of fifteen.36 In the same year, an estima ted 150,000 people (including adults and children) are said to have di ed of AIDS and 650,000 children under the age of seventeen lost one or two of their parents to AIDS in the country.37 In response to this health crisis, in July 1987, the Minister declared AIDS an NID under section 17(1) of the Public Health Act.38 With such a declaration AIDS joined the ranks of other diseases already on the NID list. A disease can be added to this list in one of two ways: by legislative action or ministerial notice. 31 Id. \u00a7 11. 32 Id. \u00a7 12. 33 CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS , WOMEN OF THE WORLD : LAWS AND POLICIES AFFECTING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE LIVES.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 144 Diseases already listed as NIDs under the PHA are smallpox, plague, cholera, scarlatina or scar let fever, typhus fever, diphtheria measles, pelvic cellulitis or other serious septic condition occurring during the puerperal state), enteric or t yphoid fever (including para-typhoid cerebro-spinal or cerebro -spinal fever, acute poliomyelitis, leprosy, anthrax, glanders, rabies, Malta fever, sleep ing sickness or human trypanosomiasis, beri- beri, yaws and all forms of tuberculosis which are clinically recognizable apart from reaction to the tuberculin test.39 In addition, the PHA accords the Minister broad power s to list a disease as an NID, designate the geographic area to which the cate gorization will apply, and dictat e the response to the disease.40 In addition to the 1987 declaration of AIDS as an NID, the Minist er has used this authority to add to the list of NID the following diseases: Influenza Relapsing fever Blackwater fever Encephalitis lethargica Yellow fever diagnosed the m unicipality of Kitale Bacillary dysentery and amoebic dysentery (within the municipality of Nairobi) SARS 41 6. Prevention and Suppression of Infectious Disease Declaration of a disease as an NID triggers reporting as well as prevention and suppression measures whenever the disease is detected or its presence suspecte d. A person who comes across a case of an NID is required to repo rt it to the nearest medical practitioner. 42 A medical practitioner who comes across such a disease or is notified of its suspected presence is required to inform the nearest medical officer of health and to inform those who live in proximity to or looked after the patient of the in fectious nature of the disease and the precautions they need to 39 Public Health Act \u00a7 17. 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 Id. \u00a7 18. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 145 take in order to prevent it from spreading.43 Failure to provide such notice as required by the PHA is an offense.44 In addition to the reporting requirements, the su spicion or detection of any infectious disease triggers the application of cer tain broad powers resembling thos e accorded to the executive for purposes of preservation of public security. Fo r instance, a medical officer is authorized to search a premises or medically examine any pe rson found there if \"he has reason to believe\" a person exposed to or suffering from an inf ectious disease is or was on the premises. 45 I n addition, the medical officer may cause other actions to be taken, including having the premises exposed to infec tious disease cleaned and disinfected; having a building, bedding, or other articles exposed to an infection destroyed; removing an infected person to a hospital; or putting an exposed person in isola tion by an order of a magistrate.46 The PHA states that the health authority may bear certain cost associated with the suppression or prevention of an infectious disease, including compensating a person for destroyed property and paying for disinfecting premises or other articles.47 The cost of isolating an infected person is born by the local authority where the person resides.48 The PHA criminalizes certain acts that spread infec tious diseases. Any infected person who, without proper precautions, willfully exposes hi mself \"in any street, public place, shop, inn or public conveyance, or enters a ny public conveyance without prev iously notifying the owner, conductor or driver thereof\" commits an offense and is, on conviction, subject to a fine of up to KES 30,000 (about US$337) and/or up to a three-year prison term. 49 The same applies to a person tasked with caring for an infected pers on who exposes anyone to such person, and to a person who \"gives, lends, sells, transmits or expos es\" anything exposed to infection without first disinfecting the item.50 In addition, failure to properly di sinfect any mode of transportation or dwelling exposed to an infection before transpor ting or leasing it to othe r people is an offense.51 43 Id. 44 Id. 45 Id. \u00a7 21. 46 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 26 & 27. 47 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 23 & 24. 48 Id. \u00a7 27. 49 Id. \u00a7 28. 50 Id. 51 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 29 & 30.

Formidable Epidemic, Endemi c or Infectious Disease A number of infectious diseases are categorized as formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious diseases (FEEIDs). These are sm allpox, plague, Asiatic cholera, yellow fever; sleeping sickness, and human trypanosomiasis.52 In addition, the Minister is aut horized to declare any infectious disease an FEEID.53 Whenever any part of the country is under the threat of an FEEID, the Minister is authorized to issue rules on a variety of measures, including quarantining infected areas and preventing anyone from leaving the area without first going through the applicable precautionary measures put in place, including a medical examination, disinfection, or spending time in an observation camp/station; removing infected persons and anyone w ith whom they have been in contact; removing corpses; and destroying or disinfecting buildi ngs and any other articles that may have been exposed to an FEEID. 54 The Minister is also authorized to issue rules specifying which areas in the country or vessels within the country's territory are considered infected areas.55 In addition, the Director or his representatives are accorded broad powers to deal with FEEIDs. The PHA gives the Director or his representative s the power to enter any premises in order to enforce any rules the Minister issues fo r the purpose of dealing with an FEEID. 56 The Director also has the power to requisition land, equipmen t, or any other item for the purpose of dealing with an FEEID in return for reasonable compensation.57 The PHA imposes reporting and other requirement s on residents and health authorities of a locality during an outbreak of an FEEID. Any one aware of \"any unusual sickness or mortality among rats, mice, cats, dogs, or other animals su sceptible to plague\" or another FEEID is required to report the matter to the closest medical officer of health; failure to do so is a crime. 58 The medical officer of health in any part of Kenya is bound by law to promptly report to the Director \"every notification received\" with regard to a suspected case of an FEEID.59 I n 52 Id. \u00a7 35. 53 Id. 54 Id. \u00a7 36. 55 Id. 56 Id. \u00a7 38. 57 Id. \u00a7 42. 58 Id. \u00a7 40. 59 Id. \u00a7 41.

Ports and Borders Unless it is in danger, the master or anyone on board a vessel arriving in Kenya is prohibited from communicating with the shore or other vessels or boats except via a si gnal until it is granted pratique.61 When necessary, the Minister may appl y this or any other requirement under the PHA to aircraft arriving in Kenya.62 However, this restriction does not affect the right of any authorized person to approach or board the vessel or aircraft.63 As a matter of procedure, pratique is granted to an arri ving vessel or aircraft via radio communication if the appropriate health officer, based on the information provided by the vessel or aircraft is satisfied that clearing the vessel or aircraft will not result in the in troduction of a quarantinable disease (plague, cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, t yphus, and relapsing fever) into Kenya.64 Notification requirements regarding the detection or suspici on of infectious disease discussed above are applicable to vessels or ai rcraft arriving in Kenya. Kenyan health authorities are accorded broad powers in dealing with vessels seeking entry into the country. For instance, the port health officer is authorized to board a vessel, inspect any of its sections, and examine and/or ask any pe rson on board any question for the purpose of establishing the existence of an infectious disease. 65 If the health officer suspects the existence of an infectious disease on board a vessel, he may grant conditional pratique or deny pratique and quarantine the vessel.66 He may have any infected person on a ship, aircraft, vehicle, or train removed and isolated on arrival to Kenya.67 He may also put anyone exposed to an infectious disease under surveillance and subject the person to medical testing.68 In addition, he may require a person in charge of a ve ssel or aircraft suspected of ca rrying an infectio us disease to provide a passenger and cargo manife st as well as a crew list.69 The Minister's authority includes regulating im migration into the country for the purpose of preventing the introduction of infectious dis eases.

Transparency of the Pub lic Health Management System As noted above, the Department is mandated to collect and periodical ly publish information regarding infectious dis eases and other matters of public he alth concern in Kenya, contagious countries, or any other part of the world.72 In addition, categorization of a particular infectious disease as an NID via a ministerial order re quires publication of a notice in the Gazette.73 Any medical practitioner who becomes aware that a patient has an NID must inform those people who, due to their prox imity to the patient, may have been exposed to the infection.74 Similarly, the terms or summary of every agreement w ith another country c oncerning reciprocal notification of infectious disease outbreaks must be published in the Gazette.75 In addition, Kenya is required to notify the WHO of any even t in its territory that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within twenty-four hours of dete ction (see discussion, Part V, below). V. Cooperation with the Wo rld Health Organization Kenya cooperates with the WHO a great deal with regard to matters relating to public health crises. As a member state to both the WHO a nd the International Health Regulations (IHR), Kenya is bound by the requirements under the 2005 IHR, an international le gal instrument aimed at preventing the spread of disease.76 Among other things, the IHR require that Kenya \"develop, strengthen and maintain . . . the capacity to detect, assess, notify and report\" outbreaks of infectious diseases.77 Accordingly, Kenya has put in plac e systems for early detection through 70 Public Health Act \u00a7 63; see also id. \u00a7 71. 71 Public Health Act \u00a7 72. 72 Id. \u00a7 10. 73 Id. \u00a7 17. 74 Id. \u00a7 18. 75 Id. \u00a7 72. 76 WHO, INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (2005): A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO IMPLEMENTATION IN NATIONAL LEGISLATION 1 (Jan. 2009), http://www.who.int/ihr/Intro_legislative_implementation.pdf?ua=1 ; WHO, International Health Regulations (IHR) app. 1 (2d ed. 2005), http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241 580410_eng.pdf?ua=1 ; Countries , WHO, http://www.who.int/countries/en/ (last visited Oct. 24, 2014). 77 IHR, supra note 76, \u00a7 5. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 149 what is known as an Integrated Diseas e, Surveillance and Response Strategy (IDSR).78 T h e objectives of this strategy are to Strengthen capacity for effective capacity[;] Improve use of surveillance information[; and] Improve laboratory involvemen t in epidemic detention.79 According to the WHO, the IDSR is \"the b ackbone for communicable disease prevention and control in Kenya\" and the WHO provides technical support in its deve lopment and expansion.80 For instance, the WHO is currently assisting in the training of healthcare workers in Kenya in preparation for a possible Ebola outbreak (see discussion, Part VI, below). Similarly, by simply being a member state of th e WHO and IHR, Kenya has agreed to fulfill its obligation under the IHR to notify the WHO of any event that constitutes a public health emergency within twenty-four hour s of assessment of such event. 81 Significantly, the WHO-Kenya 2008-2013 cooperatio n strategy indicat es that providing technical assistance in strengthening Kenya's abil ity for early detection, diagnosis, management, and control of communicable dis eases, including strengthening the country's capacity to prevent and respond to major epidemics and pandemic- prone disease, is one of the main areas of cooperation. 82 VI. Recent Developments The Ebola outbreak in West Africa, specifically in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, is the most recent public health crisis of global concern. Although Kenya is thousands of miles away from the Ebola-stricken countri es in West Africa, in August 2014, the WHO cla ssified the country as a high-risk country for Ebola transmi ssion (level two) due to the fact that it is a transportation hub in East Africa. 83 78 WHO, WHO COUNTRY COOPERATION STRATEGY 2008-2013: K ENYA 9 (2009), http://www.who.int/country focus/cooperation_strategy/ccs_ken_en.pdf . 79 Kenya National Council for Science and Technology, Disease Surveillance and Response in Kenya , available on the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG) website, at http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28http Assets%29/BFC81C5C68522575C12576460049B118/$file/BWC_MSP_2009_MX-Poster-Kenya.pdf (last visited Oct. 24, 2014). 80 WHO COUNTRY COOPERATION STRATEGY , supra note 78, at 24. 81 IHR, supra note 76, art. 6. 82 WHO C OUNTRY COOPERATION STRATEGY , supra note 78, at 33. 83 WHO: Kenya at High Risk for Transmission of Ebola , VOICE OF AMERICA (Aug. 12, 2014), http://www.voanews. com/content/germany-guin ea-bissau-react-to-ebola- outbreak/2411822.html . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 150 According to reports, Kenya has put in place a contingency plan (the Plan) to guide health institutions in the event of an Ebol a outbreak following the WHO declaration.84 The Plan, which is intended to serve as a roadma p for preparing and responding to an Ebola outbreak, calls for the establishment of a reference and response inform ation center to \"provide accurate information for health workers and the community, provide guidance on key actions to be taken during different phases of the outbreak, prepare clinic ians for appropriate action, and identify and mobilise resources for response.\"85 As part of the Plan, the Minist ry of Health has put together a taskforce, including representatives from va rious, relevant governmental and nongovernmental organizations, to advise on how to respond to the outbreak.86 The taskforce is currently coordinating and implementing surveillance through the screening of travelers at entry points, which has been intensified following the WHO declaration.87 The Plan also calls for training of various healthcare workers in dealing with an Ebola outbreak. 88 The Kenyan government recently announced plans to train thirty-thousand health care workers on Ebola screening, prevention, control, and case management.89 This training will take place in all forty-seven coun ties in the country (it calls for counties to be involved in its implementation) and will target 60% of all h ealth care workers in the country, including clinicians, epidemiologists, health promotion experts, and health workers stationed at airports and border crossings. 90 The government has allocated KES 350 million (about US$3.9 million) for the purpose of implementing the Plan,91 a large percentage of which will likely be used for the training program. The WHO ha s deployed training experts to help facilitate the training.92 The Plan puts in place procedures for dealing with a person susp ected of exposur e to Ebola. Those procedures call for isol ating persons exposed to Ebola, limiting the number of medical workers that have direct contact with the pe rson, and reserving contiguous rooms for medical personnel to change in to protective gear. 93 84 Action Plan over Ebola Risk , HEALTH RIGHTS ADVOCACY FORUM (HERAF) (Aug. 21, 2014), http://www.heraf. or.ke/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id= 1352&catid=24?option=com_content&view=article&id=1 352&catid=24 . 85 Id. 86 Id. 87 Press Release, WHO Regional Office for Africa, Kenya Steps Up its EBOLA Contingency Plan with Training of Trainers (Sept. 26, 2014), http://www.afro.who.int/fr/keny a/press-materials/item/7053- kenya-steps-up-its-ebola- contingency-plan-with-trainings-of-trainers/7053-kenya -steps-up-its-ebola-contingency-plan-with-trainings-of- trainers.html ; Kenya Intensifies Surveillance Outbreak , XINHUA (Oct. 24, 2014), http://news. xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2014-08/13/c_133553824.htm . 88 Press Release, WHO Regional Office for Africa, supra note 87. 89 Kenya to Train 30,000 Health Workers on Ebola , XINHUA (Oct. 23, 2014), http://news.xinhuanet.com/ english/africa/2014-10/23/c_133735637.htm . 90 Press Release, WHO Regional Office for Africa, supra note 87; HERAF, supra note 84. 91 Id. 92 Press Release, WHO Regional Office for Africa, supra note 87. 93 HERAF, supra note 84.

Although th ere have been a number of cases in which Ebola infection was su spected, all were ruled out after testing. 96 In one of the cases, where the person suspected of having contra cted Ebola arrived in an aircraft from West Africa, it appears that the prot ocols required under th e PHA were properly followed. According to Nicolas Muraguri, the Director of Medical Services, the fli ght crew alerted Kenyan health authorities that one of the passengers was ill, as required by the PHA.97 The health authorities immediately quarantined the airc raft and screened everyone on boa rd, also in accordance with the provisions of the PHA,98 and released everyone only afte r discovering that the suspected person was in fact suffering from other, noncommunicable ailments.99 94 Flight Bans from Ebola-hit Countries Will Stay in Effect, Kenya Tells AU , SABAHI (Sept. 17, 2014), http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/ar ticles/newsbriefs/2014/09/17/newsbrief-04 ; Travel Restrictions, Flight Operations and Screening, INTERNATIONAL SOS (Nov. 3, 2014), https://www.internationalsos.com/ebola/index. cfm?content_id=435& . 95 Kenya Closes Border with Uganda over Ebola Fear , XINHUA (Oct. 11, 2014), http://news.xinhuanet.com/ english/africa/2014-10/11/c_133706916.htm . 96 Kenya Rules Out Ebola After Two Tested Negative , THE NEW INDIAN EXPRESS (Sept. 5, 2014), http://www.new indianexpress.com/world/Kenya-Rules-out-Ebola-Afte r-Two-Tested-Negative/2014/09/05/article2415768.ece ; Kenya Rules Out Ebola Case Following Scare at Airport , XINHUANET (Aug. 2, 2014), http://news.xinhuanet. com/english/health/2014-08/02/c_133525986.htm ; Press Release, WHO Regi onal Office for supra note 87. 97 XINHUANET , supra note 96; Public Health Act \u00a7\u00a7 59 & 71; Public Health (Port, Airport, and Frontier Health) Rule \u00a7 5. 98 Public Health Act \u00a7 62; Public Health (Por t, Airport, and Frontier Health) Rule \u00a7 8. 99 XINHUANET , supra note 96. The Law Library of Congress 152 Lebanon Issam M. Saliba Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY In Lebanon the executive power is vested in a Council of Ministers, of which the Ministry of Public Health is the ultimate authority on matters related to responses to public health crises. The law provides that where such cr ises are so severe that the capabilities of the Ministry of Public Health are insufficient, that Ministry may seek assistance by proposing the issuance of a presidential decree that defines the assistance needed, the entities involved, and the measures to be taken by each. The Ministry has taken several measures to address the Ebola threat, and thus far has not seen a need to request a presidential decree. I. Government Structure Lebanon is a republic that has a centralized parliamentary fo rm of government, with the executive power vested in a Council of Ministers.1 The Ministry of Public Health is the ultimate authority in charge of all public health matters, including responses to public health crises. The main mission of the Ministry is to protect and improve the status of public health.2 The Ministry defines its mission as follows: To Improve the health status of the popula tion by ensuring an equitable accessibility to high quality health services through a fairly financed universal coverage. And by addressing economic and social determinants of health through trans-sectoral policies.3 II. Public Health Crises Public health crises are generally associated wi th threats to the health of the population of a geographic area or areas caused by the spread of communicable diseases. Lebanon has enacted a special law, the Law of Communicable Diseases, to deal with these situations when they arise.4 This law assigns certain duties and responsibilit ies relating to individua l cases of communicable diseases and provides a general fr amework for the response needed to deal with any outbreak of such diseases that might endanger public health. 1 LEBANESE CONSTITUTION arts. 1, 17, http://www.lp.gov.lb/CustomPage.aspx?id=26&masterId=1 (in Arabic). 2 Presidential Decree 8 377 of 1961, art 2, http://www.moph.gov.lb/Rules%20and%20Regulations/Marsoum8377- 1961.pdf (in Arabic). 3 MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH , http://www.moph.gov.lb/ AboutUs/pages/missionandvision.aspx (last visited Nov. 5, 2014). 4 Law of Communicable Diseases, Dec. 31, 1957, http://ar.jurispedia.org/index.php/%D9%82%D8%A7%D9 %86%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6_%D8%A7%D9%8 4%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9_(lb) (in Arabic). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Lebanon The Law Library of Congress 153 Article 3 of the law provides for combatting co mmunicable diseases by one or more of the following means: reporting or informing about th e disease, quarantinin g or isolating those infected, isolating those who ca me in contact with those aff ected and providing them with preventive treatment, disinfection, investigating the source of the disease, making environmental adjustments, and providing general health education.5 Treating physicians are required by the law to convey information on cases of listed communicable diseases to the aut hority designated by an order of th e Minister of Public Health. 6 Family heads, guardians, the Mukhtar (an elected local official), and managers of industrial or commercial enterprises (such as a plant, hotel, etc.) and of any public or private organization involved in health or social matte rs are required to call a physic ian whenever they suspect they have someone who might be affected by a communi cable disease, report th e incident, facilitate the reporting of it by the physicia n, and not hide the incident. 7 The law gives the Minister of Public Health the power pursuant to a recommendation by the Director General of the Ministry to modify the list of the diseases considered contagious or communicable and for which those affected shall be quarantined. 8 The law empowers the Ministry at any time to enter and search any place that might be suspected of harboring a case of communicable disease. 9 All the other means mentioned in article three sha ll be implemented in accor dance with orders of the Minister of Public H ealth issued separately for each contagious disease. 10 The measures listed in article three employed in accordance with such orders can be used by the Ministry of Public Health to respond to public h ealth crises. But there are instances where that Ministry might also need outside assistance to deal with a crisis when the spread or the threat of spreading of a contagious di sease among the populat ion is overwhelming. To address such instances, the law establishes a ge neral framework for the Ministry to seek needed assistance by proposing a plan to be adopted by a presidenti al decree. The law sp ecifically provides the following: If an epidemic disease threatened all or a part of the territories of the Republic or started to spread within such territories without the local measures being sufficient [to deal with it] the Ministry of Health shall ask for a presidential decree to be issued which shall designate the measures that shall be taken to prevent the spread of the epidemic.11 5 Id. art. 3. 6 Id. art. 4. 7 Id. art. 5. 8 Id. art. 11. 9 Id. art. 12. 10 Id. arts. 6, 7, 8. 11 Id. art. 9. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Lebanon The Law Library of Congress 154 Such a decree shall designate th e role of each authority and body which have been appointed to deal with the crisis, along with the manner by whic h they are to be established, the limitations on their authority, and the time accorded to them to carry out their duties. The funding cost of such plans shall be borne by the central government paying three-fourths of the cost and the municipalities paying the remaining one-fourth.12 It is clear from the foregoing that while the legislature in Lebanon has provided a legal framework to create plans to respon d to public health crises, the ac tual creation of such plans and their attendant details is left to the executive branch of governme nt, to be decided on a crisis-by- crisis basis. III. The Ebola Threat Lebanon recognizes the threat cause d by the Ebola outbreak in cert ain foreign countries. The Ministry of Public Health has taken a number of measures to pr event the disease from entering the country, and apparently feels capable to deal with the situation with out devising a special plan requiring the issuance of a presidential de cree. Among the measures taken by the Ministry of Public Health in this regard are the following: Dissiminating information about the history, sy mptoms, and how to avoid contracting the disease. The sources of most of this info rmation are the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 13 Requiring hospitals in Lebanon to create special units equipped to deal with Ebola cases.14 Requiring all passengers entering the country to fill specially designed cards that allow the Ministry to monitor individual situations and take necessary measures when such measures are warranted.15 Requiring the Airport Authority to advise airlines on how to deal with suspected cases of Ebola on planes.16 The Ministry has also decided to assist Le banese citizens living ab road who might have contracted the Ebola virus or any other co mmunicable disease by providing them with 12 Id. 13 This information is posted on the Minist ry website and can be accessed individually, at http://www.moph.gov.lb/ Prevention/Pages/EbolaOutbreak.aspx (last visited Nov. 5, 2014). 14 Letter of the Minister of Public Health No. 33150/1/14 (Oct. 23, 2014), http://www.moph.gov.lb/Prevention/ Documents/2014-1-33150.pdf ; Letter of the General Director of the Ministry of Public Health No. 31703/1/14 (Oct. 13, 2014), http://www.moph.gov.lb/Prevention/Documents/Letter14-1-31703.pdf . 15 Letter of the Minister of Public Health No. 33153/1/14 (Oct. 23, 2014), http://www.moph.gov.lb/Prevention/ Documents/2014-1-33153.pdf ; Letter of the Minister of Public Health No. 33148/1/14 (Oct. 23, 2014), http://www.moph.gov.lb/Preventi on/Documents/2014-1-33148.pdf . 16 Letter of the Minister of Public Health (July 31, 2014), http://www.moph.gov.lb/Prevention/Documents/ Procedures.pdf.

The Law Library of Congress 156 Mexico Gustavo Guerra Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY Mexico's system for managing public health emergencies is mainly administered by the nation's General Health Council (GHC) and th e federal Department of Health (DOH). The GHC has the authority to issue orders th at classify communicable diseases that may cause a health emergency as serious threat s and subject them to epidemiological monitoring, prevention, and control mechan isms. The DOH has the responsibility to monitor serious communicable diseases listed by law, as well as diseases classified as serious threats by the GHC, to detect and contro l outbreaks. In cases of actual or potential grave outbreaks of communicable diseases, th e DOH has the power to order immediate and appropriate measures to prevent and contai n damages to public health, with approval from Mexico's President. Furthermore, the DOH must notify to the World Health Organization of all measures taken in order to address matters related to international health and of any incidence of diseases that may cause an outbreak. Mexico recently signed a Declaration of Intent with the US and Canada on how these countries will exchange public information in times of a health emergency of common interest. I. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management System Mexico is a federal republic formed by thirty-one states and a Federal Dist rict. Mexico's system for managing public health emergencies is prim arily managed by the nation's General Health Council (GHC) and federal Departme nt of Health (DOH), with suppor t from state governments. The GHC reports directly to Mexico's Presid ent and has broad powers on health matters of national importance, including the au thority to issue orders that classify communicable diseases that may cause a health emergency as serious threats and subject them to epidemiological monitoring, prevention, and control mechanisms. 1 The GHC is headed by the Secretary of the DOH, and is comprised of high-ranking government officials (including secretaries and executives from federal and state government departments) and executives from private health in stitutions, nongovermental organizations, and industry associations. 2 The DOH has responsibility for establishi ng and operating the National System for Epidemiological Surveillance (S istema Nacional de Vigilancia de Salubridad Genera l [Regulation of the General Health Council ] arts. 1, 9(XVII), D IARIO OFICIAL DE LA FEDERACI\u00d3N [D.O.], Dec. de Salubridad mediante el cual se dispuesto po r el art\u00edculo 134, fracci\u00f3n XIV, de la Ley General de Salud [Order that Determines that the Ebol a Virus Must Be Subject to Epidemiological Surveillance, as well as to Prevention and Contro l Measures], D.O., Oct. 23, 2014. 2 Reglamento Interior del Consejo de Salubridad General, supra note 1, arts. 3, 4. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Mexico The Law Library of Congress 157 which monitors serious communicable diseases listed by law, as well as diseases classified as serious threats by the GHC, in orde r to detect and control outbreaks.3 SINAVE is comprised of an extensive national network of health surv eillance units (over 20,000 as of May 2014) operating in all public and private health institutions, which monitor and report relevant information on health developments to a central unit managed by DOH's Directorate of Epidemiology (DOE). 4 The DOE processes this information and prepares reports and health alerts as necessary, which are used to plan and implement appropriate responses. 5 II. Powers of Public Health Authorities A. Powers to Control Communicable Diseases Mexico's General Law on Health provides that certain communicable diseases listed in the law (such as epidemic influenza, viral hepatitis, and AI DS), as well as diseases classified as serious threats by the GHC (such as the Ebol a virus, as explained in Part V of this report), are subject to prevention and control measures executed by th e DOH and state government s in their respective jurisdictions, with support from ot her federal government agencies and private health institutions and individuals. 6 Outbreaks of these diseases must be notified imme diately to the DOH, which has at its disposal a number of powers to monitor and control such outbreaks, including confirmation of the disease by available clinical means; temporary isolation of sick individuals, as well as those who are expected to become sick; administration of vaccines and other pr eventive and therapeutic resources; decontamination of areas, living quarters, cl othing, utensils, and ot her objects exposed to viral, parasitic, or microbial contamination; inspection of travelers suspect ed of being infected, as we ll as their luggage and other belongings that may be contaminated; 3 Ley General de Salud [General Law of Health], as amended through June 2014, arts. 133(II), 134, D.O., Feb. 7, 1984, available on the website of Mexico's House of Representatives, at http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/ pdf/142_040614.pdf , DIRECTORATE OF EPIDEMIOLOGY ], http://www.epidemiologia.salud. gob.mx/dgae/infoepid/intd_informacion.html (last updated May 2014).

Department of Health Po wers in Health Emergencies In cases of actual or potential grave outbreaks of communi cable diseases, the DOH has the power to order immediate and appropriate measur es to prevent and cont ain damage to public health, including issuing sanitary measures governing depart ures and arrivals of individuals from population centers; regulating ground, maritime, and air traffic; instructing federal, state, and local authorities and health pr ofessionals to support emergency measures, and requiring cooperation from privat e entities and individual s as necessary; using, freely and with priority, radio and tele vision air time, as well as telephone, mail, and telegraphic services. 8 These urgent measures must ratified by Mexico's President thereafter. 9 In addition, the President may issue an executive order indicating the speci fic regions that are subject to emergency measures to protect public health.10 When the health emergency is controlled, the President must order the end of the emergency measures.11 III. Transparency of Public He alth Crisis Management System Pursuant to applicable re gulations, information generated by Mexico's DOH through the National System for Epidemiological Surveill ance (which, as explained above, monitors developments concerning communicable diseas es) must be disseminated through reports available electronically and in print in a way that facilitates accessibility to the data contained therein.12 Consistent with this requirement, a wide variety of data concer ning events related to communicable diseases is publicly availabl e on the website of the DOH's Directorate of Epidemiology.13 7 Ley General de Salud arts. 139, 147, 151, 152. 8 Id. arts. 181, 184. 9 Id. art. 181. 10 Id. art. 183. 11 Id. 12 SECRETAR\u00cdA DE SALUD , DIRECCION GENERAL DE EPIDEMIOLOGIA Norma Oficial Mexicana 4, \u00a7 GENERAL DE , supra note 4. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Mexico The Law Library of Congress 159 With respect to recent measures adopted by the Mexican government concerning the Ebola virus, the DOH provides comprehensive information on th is topic on a website that includes general information for citizens and technical information for experts.14 At the international level, Mexico recently signed a Declaration of Intent with the United States and Canada that provides principles and gui delines concerning how these countries will exchange public information in the event of a health emergency of common interest. 15 Specifically, the Declaration provi des that these countries intend to share with each other plans and statements concerning health emergenc ies prior to their release to the public.16 IV. Cooperation with the WHO Mexico is signatory to the 2005 International Health Regulati ons (IHR), which are aimed at helping the international community respond to a nd prevent severe global public health risks, and provide that signatory countries must re port to the World Health Organization (WHO) information concerning certain public health events and outbreaks. 17 Consistent with the IHR, Mexi co's General Law on Health pr ovides that the DOH must notify the WHO about all measures taken in order to a ddress matters related to international health (particularly measures aimed at restricting the transit of persons or cargo due to sanitary reasons), and must also provide information on a ny case of diseases listed in the IHR that may cause an outbreak. 18 V. Recent Developments As of mid-November 2014, no cases of individuals infected with the Ebola virus have been reported in Mexico. However, th e Mexican government recently issued guidelin es applicable to the treatment of this disease.

The Law Library of Congress 161 Nigeria Hanibal Goitom Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY The legal authority of the Nigerian federa l government to take extraordinary measures during public health crises is based on th e emergency powers of the president and the legislature under the 1999 Constitution and the authority accorded to the executive body, specifically the health authorities, under the 1926 Quarantine Act. The Quarantine Act gives the president and the country's health au thorities broad powers to deal with public health crises. The President is authorized, among other things, to declare any infectious disease a dangerous infectious disease, declare any area in or outside of Nigeria an infected area, and issue regulations to prevent the spr ead of any dangerous infectious disease. It appears that the power to issue regulations h as been exercised only once, with the issuing of the Quarantine (Ships) Regulations, which authorize or require port health officers to take a host of measures to prevent the importa tion into and spread of infectious diseases within Nigeria. A bill (SB 210) aimed at replacing the Quarantin e Act is currently being considered by the upper chamber of Nigeria's legislature. Among other things, SB 210 seeks to streamline the public health response by establishing a commission that will prepare a plan for prevention and containment of public health emer gencies, including ensuring that all tiers of government are duly prepared for such events. It also seeks to introduce transparency in the way that the Nigerian government handles public health crises by requiring the constant dissemination of a specific set of information to the public. In addition, it aims to provide certain protections to persons su bjected to isolation or quarantine. Nigeria's ability to effectively deal with p ublic health crises was tested with a recent outbreak of Ebola in Lagos and Port Harcourt. Nigeria immediately mobilized the relevant government institutions and allocated the necessary funds to take prevention and suppression measures, particularly to conduct wi de contact-tracing investigations. This and other factors enabled the country to contain the outbreak quickly with only nineteen infections and seven deaths. As of the date of this report, Nigeria was Ebola free. I. Government Structure Nigeria, with an estimated population of over 168 million and a population density of 182.8 people per square mile, is by far the most populous country in Africa.1 A federation, Nigeria has a three-tiered government structure including the federal government, thirty-six states2 and a federal capital (Abuja), as well as 768 lo cal government areas within the states.3 1 Nigeria , UNITED NATIONS DATA, https://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=NIGERIA (last visited Oct. 28, 2014). and Zamfara. C ONSTITUTION OF NIGERIA (1999), Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Nigeria The Law Library of Congress 162 Legislative power at the federa l level is vested in a bica meral legislative body with a 360- member House of Representatives and a 109-member Senate.4 At the state level, this power is vested in house assemblies whose seats range from twenty-four to fort y members depending on the population of a particular state.5 The federal executive power is vested in the pr esident, vice-president, and members of the cabinet, whereas at the state level the same po wer is exercised by the governor, deputy governor, and commissioners of the government of the state. 6 The judiciary consists of cons titutionally formed courts and other courts. The Nigerian Constitution established what are known as the superior courts of record: the Supreme Court of Nigeria, the Court of Appeal, the Federal High Court, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja), the Sharia C ourt of Appeal of the Federal Capital Territory, the Customary Court of Appeal of the Federal Capital Territor y, a High Court of a Stat e, a Sharia Court of Appeal of a State, and a Custom ary Court of Appeal of a State. 7 The Constitution permits the federal and state legislatures to esta blish additional, subordinate courts.8 This report focuses on the powers of the federal government in times of public health crises. However, it is important to note that state and local governments do play a key role in matters of public health crisis management. This is particularly true with regard to the issues of disease surveillance and notification systems. Nigeria's National Policy on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (ISDR) states that th e country's surveillance structure involves the active participation of the three tiers of govern ment and assigns each a specific role in the process of identifying and reporting epidemic-prone diseases (including cholera, meningitis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, and human influenza) and notifiable diseases. 9 For instance, it requires local and state governments to report data collected on epidemic-prone dis eases on a weekly basis.10 II. Applicable Law Two sources of legal au thority authorize the fe deral government to take preventative and suppression measures in anticipation of, or dur ing, a public health crisis.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Nigeria The Law Library of Congress 163 (including the right to personal liberty and prope rty) is one source of authority (see discussion, Part III, below). The second is the statutory regime. The 1926 federal Quarantine Act, which remains in force today, is the pr imary law governing matters concer ning public health crises in Nigeria.11 It is based on the exclusiv e legislative jurisdiction accord ed to the federal government under the Constitution on issues of \"quarantine\" a nd \"[a]ny matter incidental or supplementary\" to it.12 The current statutory legal regime is likely to change soon. The upper chamber of the country's legislative body is currently considering a bill, the Nigerian Public He alth Bill (SB 210), aimed at replacing the Quarantine Act (see discussion, Pa rt VI, below). 13 SB 210, having passed first and second readings in the Chamber on Octobe r 2012 and April 2013, respect ively, was referred to the Health and Agriculture Committee.14 Before it can become law, the bill will need to pass a third reading in the Senate, be passed by the House of Representatives, and be signed by the country's President.15 III. Powers of National Public Authorities A. Constitutional Powers 1. Executive Powers The President is authorized to unilaterally or at the request of a state governor declare a state of emergency in certain instances, including when . . . (c) there is actual breakdown of public order and public safety in the Federation or any part thereof to such extent as to require extraordinary measures to restore peace and security; (d) there is a clear and present danger of an actual breakdown of public order and public safety in the Federation or any part thereo f requiring extraordinary measures to avert such danger; 11 Quarantine Act of 1926, 14 L AWS OF THE FEDERATION OF NIGERIA , Cap.

First, the country's legislature may adopt la ws that curtail certa in fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution (see discussion, Part III(A)(2), below). It may also allow the executive to take certain actions that restrict such constitutional rights. For instance, the Constitution appears to permit the executive to temporarily suspend th e constitutional protecti on against forced or compulsory labor \"in the event of any emergenc y or calamity threatening the life or well-being of the community.\"19 It is conceivable that this authority could be used to ensure that hospitals and health centers are properly staffed during an outbreak of a deadly infectious disease like Ebola. President Goodluck Jonathan recently exercise d his authority to de clare the control and containment of the Ebola virus a national em ergency, following the confirmation of seven infections in the country. 20 President Jonathan directed all re levant federal and state authorities to work in concert to make sure that all nece ssary steps were taken to suppress the spread of Ebola.21 In addition, he a pproved a Special Intervention Plan and the immediate release of NGN 1.9 billion (about US$11.5 million) to fight the virus, fast-tracking the disbursement of funds for 16 CONSTITUTION OF NIGERIA \u00a7 305. 17 Id. 18 Id. 19 Id. \u00a7 34. 20 Nigeria's Jonathan Declares State of Emergency over Ebola , REUTERS (Aug. 8, 2014), http://www.reuters.com/ article/2014/08/08/us-health-ebola-nigeria-jonathan-idUSKBN0G81WB20140808 ; Ebola: Jonathan Declares National Emergency, Approves N2BN Special Intervention Fund , EMBASSY OF NIGERIA , SEOUL SOUTH KOREA (Aug. 21, 2014), http://www.nigerianembassy.or.kr /ebola-jonathan-declares-natio nal-emergency-approves-n2bn- special-intervention-fund-2/ . 21 EMBASSY OF NIGERIA , SEOUL SOUTH KOREA , supra note 20.

Legislative Powers As noted above, the declaration of a state of emer gency permits the legislature to pass laws that may otherwise be unconstitutional. The Constitution permits the adoption of a law limiting certain constitutionally guaranteed fundamental right s if it is \"reasonably justifiable\" and done \"in the interest of . . . public health.\" 23 Such a law may impose limitations on the right to privacy; the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religi on; the right to freedom of expression and the press; the right to peaceful asse mbly and association; and the right to freedom of movement.24 Similarly, the Constitution allows the adoption of a law for the compulsory acquisition of movable or immovable property \"that is in a dange rous state or is injurious to the health of human beings.\" 25 In addition, the Constitution perm its the adoption of a law imposing restrictions on a person's personal liberty if the person is \"suffering from infectious or contagious disease . . . [,] for the purpose of [the person's] care or treatment or the protection of the community.\"26 These constitutional provisions provide the auth ority for the imposition of statutory limitations on rights otherwise protected under the Constitution during public health crises. This justifies the restrictions imposed on any of the above-stipulate d, constitutionally guaranteed rights by the current statutory regime, the Quarantine Act, or any other similar law that may be enacted in the future. B. Statutory Regime 1. General Provisions As noted above, the Quarantine Act (the Act) is the primary law governing the prevention and suppression of dangerous infectious diseases. The Act states that it is intended to regulate \"the imposition of quarantine and to make other prov isions for preventing the introduction into and spread in Nigeria, and the transmission from Nigeria, of dangerous infectious diseases.\" 27 This includes \"cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox and typhus.\"28 In addition, the Act authorizes the President to declare any infectious or contagi ous disease as a dangerous infectious disease, an 22 Id. 23 CONSTITUTION OF NIGERIA \u00a7 45(1)(a). 24 Id. 25 Id. \u00a7 44(2)(f). 26 Id. \u00a7 35(1)(e). 27 Quarantine Act of 1926, pmbl., 14 L AWS OF THE FEDERATION OF NIGERIA , Cap.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Nigeria The Law Library of Congress 167 2. Quarantine of Ships The Quarantine (Ships) Regulations authorize a por t health officer to take a number of measures for the purpose of prevention and suppression of in fectious diseases. Whenever a person in a ship34 approaching Nigeria is suffering from an inf ectious disease or there is suspicion of the presence of an infectious dise ase onboard, the master must cont act the port health authority and provide a specific list of information necessary for the officer to determine, among others, the gravity and origin of an infection, if any.35 The officer may clear the ship to proceed to its intended destination if, on the basis of the informa tion provided by the master, he is satisfied that the arrival of the ship will not result in the spread of an infectious disease.36 Until and unless the ship is given clearance, no one may board or l eave the ship without the permission of the officer except the pilot.37 While the port health officer is authorized to inspect any ship already in the port or on arrival, he is required to inspect all ships that contacted the port health authority about the possible presence of an infectious disease onboard or any other ship present that he has reasonable grounds to believe is carrying a \"quarantinable disease.\" 38 The master of the ship is required to fully cooperate with the officer, including by answeri ng all questions regarding health conditions on board the ship and notifying him of anything that may lead to an infection or the spread of a quarantinable disease.39 A ship, which before its arrival ha d called at a foreign port, is subj ect to additional requirements. Such ship must submit what is known as the ma ritime declaration of health (MDH), in a form specified by World Health Organization (WHO) Regulation No. 2, which must be countersigned by the ship's surgeon if it has one.40 The form requires the listing of all ports of call and contains a number of questions including whether, during the voyage, there were suspected cases of an infectious disease or nonaccidental death.41 In addition to completing the MDH, the master must submit a Deratting Certificate or Deratting Exemp tion Certificate, issued under the International Sanitation Regulations.42 Failure to produce either certificat e leads to an inspection by the port health officer.43 34 A ship includes any \"sea-going or . . . inland navigation vessel making an international voyage.\" Quarantine (Ships) Regulations \u00a7 2, Quarantine Act-Subsidiary Legislation. 35 Quarantine (Ships) Regulations \u00a7 10, Quarantine Act-Subsidiary Legislation. 36 Id. \u00a7 9. 37 Id. \u00a7 14. 38 Id. \u00a7 3.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Nigeria The Law Library of Congress 169 If the Minister of Health notifies the port health officer of a \"grave dang er to public health\" due to an outbreak of an infectious disease in an ar ea where a ship is docked, the officer is authorized to require anyone disembarking fr om the ship to provide his pe rsonal information and the areas he intends to visit.52 In addition to quarantinable diseases, the Regulations require that additional measures (measures stipulated under Schedule Five of the Regulations) be applied to the following: (a) any infected or suspected ships; (b) any ship on which there is a case of typhus or relapsing fever; (c) any ship which has during its voyage been in a local area infected with cholera, plague or yellow fever; (d) any suspect for smallpox on a ship other than an infected ship; (e) any person on any ship which has come fro m an area infected with typhus or relapsing fever; (f) any ship or any person on board, when the port health officer is satisfied that, notwithstanding the application of sanitary measures to that ship or person at a previous port, an incident has occurred si nce such previous application which makes it necessary again to apply additional measur es, or when the medical officer has definite evidence that the previous measures applied were not substantially effective. 53 In addition, the Regulations im pose a number of requirements a nd procedures relating to the prevention and suppression of infectious diseases in relation to outgoing ships.54 IV. Transparency of the Pub lic Health Management System Under the current public health regulatory regime, transparency requirements are minimal. Only two types of transparency requirements were lo cated. One mandates that the President (with regard to the declaration of a state of emergency) or the Minister of Health (with regard to the declaration of a particular locat ion as an infected area) issue a public notice via the Official Gazette.55 The other, which forms part of the c ountry's obligation as a WHO member state, requires that Nigeria notify the WHO of any ev ent that constitutes a pu blic health emergency within twenty-four hours of the assessment of such event.56 If the recent Ebola outbreak is a ny indication, the question of tran sparency is not a problem in Nigeria. The country's Ministry of Health created a web page dedicated to informing the public about Ebola, including what the virus is, how it spreads, and signs and symptoms of infection. 57 52 Id. \u00a7 19. 53 Id. \u00a7 20. 54 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 21 & 22. 55 CONSTITUTION OF NIGERIA \u00a7 305; Quarantine Act of 1926 \u00a7 22, 14 L AWS OF THE FEDERATION OF NIGERIA , Cap.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Nigeria The Law Library of Congress 170 In addition, the Ministry issued multiple press re leases to inform the public about the status of the virus in the country.58 In fact, a successful information campaign by the government, intended both to educate the public about the disease and inform the public of actions the government was taking for its suppression, is said to have contributed to th e country's success in curbing the outbreak.59 It is important to note that, if adopted in its current form, SB 210 would require the development of guidelines on mechanisms to communicate with and inform the public during public health crises (see discussion, Part VI, be low). It would also mandate th at the public health authority provide information to the public regarding the declaration or termination of a state of public health emergency, the precautions that members of the public need to take in order to protect themselves from the prevailing danger that caused the emergency, and the actions that the relevant authoritie s are taking to address the emergency. 60 In addition, it would require that the information be disseminated via all of the available modes of communication and language s accessible to the general publ ic, including to individuals with disabilities. 61 V. Cooperation with the Worl d Health Organization (WHO) Nigeria is a member country of both the WHO and the Interna tional Health Regulations (IHR).62 As such, Nigeria is bound by the requirements unde r the International Hea lth Regulations (IHR) (2005), an international legal instrument ai med at preventing the spread of disease.63 Among others, the IHR require Nigeria \"to develop, strengt hen and maintain . . . the capacity to detect, assess, notify ad report\" outbr eaks of infectious diseases.64 According to the WHO Country Cooperation Strategy 2008-2013 , strengthening Nigeria's integrated disease surveillance and response and building the capacity of public health facilities for disease control and eradication efforts are among the main focus areas of cooperation with Nigeria.65 58 Press Releases , FEDERAL MINISTRY OF HEALTH , http://www.health.gov.ng/index.php/news-media/press-releases (last visited Nov. 3, 2014). 59 Nigeria Is Now Free of Ebola Virus Transmission , WHO (Oct. 20, 2014), http://www.who.int/m ediacentre/news/ ebola/20-october-2014/en/ . 60 Public Health Bill \u00a7 29, available at http://www.nassnig.org/nass/legislation.php?id=1316 . 61 Id. 62 Alphabetical List of WHO Member States , WHO, http://www.who.int/choice/demography/by_country/en/ (last visited Oct. 31, 2014); IHR, supra note 56, App. 1. 63 WHO, INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (2005): A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO IMPLEMENTATION IN NATIONAL LEGISLATION 1 (Jan. 2009), http://www.who.int/ihr/Intro_legislative_implementation.pdf?ua=1 ; IHR, supra note 56, App. 1; Countries , WHO, http://www.who.int/countries/en/ (last visited Oct. 24, 2014). 64 IHR, supra note 56, \u00a7 5. 65 WHO, WHO COUNTRY COOPERATION STRATEGY 2008-2013: N IGERIA 6 & 24 (2009), http://www.who.int/ countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccs_nga_en.pdf .

Recent Developments A. Legislative Reform Nigeria is in the process of refo rming its public health crisis le gal framework, which is currently governed under a 1926 law. As indicated above , the Public Health Bill (SB 210), aimed at replacing the current health crisis manageme nt regulatory regime, is pending in the upper chamber of the country's National Assembly. A notable provision of SB 210 would establish a public health emergency planning body, the Public Health Emergency Pla nning Commission. Staffed through presidential appointments, the Commission would prepare a plan for the preven tion and suppression of a host of public health emergencies. 67 Its plan would include require ments or guidelines, including on communication with and notification of th e public during a public health crisis; coordinating responses of the different tiers of government during a public health crisis; the evacuation and temporary relocation of communities during a public health crisis; providing training to public hea lth workers to diagnose and tr eat infectious diseases; and ensuring that all levels of government have ma de adequate preparations for public health crises, including identifying isolation or qua rantine locations, loca tions for housing and feeding health workers, locations for distribut ing food to the public, and routes and means of public and material transportation.68 Another notable provision seeks to impose a strict reporting re quirement, including on all health care providers,69 coroners, pathologists, and medical exam iners, with regard to any disease or illness that may cause a public health emergency.70 It mandates that any one of the listed professionals who comes across any disease or illn ess that could possibly cause a public health emergency report it to the public health authority in a prescribed format either electronically or 66 IHR, supra note 56, art. 6. 67 Public Health Bill \u00a7\u00a7 5 & 6, available at http://www.nassnig.org/nass/legislation.php?id=1316 . 68 Id. \u00a7 6. 69 A health care provider is \"any pers on or entity who provides health care services including, but not limited to, hospitals, medical clinics and offices, special care facilities, medical laboratories, physicians, pharmacists, dentists, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, registered and ot her nurses, paramedics, emergency medical or laboratory technicians, and ambulance and emergency medical workers.\" Id. \u00a7 3. 70 Id. \u00a7 7. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Nigeria The Law Library of Congress 172 in writing.71 The same requirements apply to indivi duals who deal with animals, including veterinarians, livestock owne rs, and laboratory technicians.72 Also notable is part IV of SB 210, which deals wi th the power of the pres ident to declare a public health emergency, including the mechanics for a nd consequences of such action. The president may declare a public health emergency whenever th ere is \"an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition that . . . is believ at poses a \"high probability\" of harm to the public. 73 In such instances, the President ma y declare a public health emergency for a thirty-day period, which he may renew for an i ndefinite number of thirty-day terms; however, the legislature may terminate the declaration at any time with a simple major ity vote if convinced that the underlying threat to public health no longer exists.74 A declaration of a public health emergency ac cords the president certain emergency powers, including the power to suspend laws imposing pr ocedures for the normal functioning of state bodies, and to mobilize \"any part of the organized forces.\" 75 It also authorizes the public health authorities to take certain measures with rega rd to management of pr operty and protection of persons.76 For instance, the public authorit y would have the power to isolate77 or quarantine78 individuals or groups, and the failure to follow isolation or quarantine orders would constitute a crime.79 The provisions on isolation or quarantine include language for the protecti on of subjects of such actions. These include the requirement that isola tion or quarantine must be imposed in the least restrictive manner and that it must automatica lly end upon the determina tion that the person or persons no longer pose a risk of transmission. 80 While SB 210 would allow the public health authority to unilaterally impose a temporary isolat ion or quarantine in situations in which delay would \"significantly jeopardize . . .

Ebola Outbreak The most recent public health crisis in Nigeria came in the form of an Ebola outbreak in two sites in the country. The primary (i ndex) outbreak occurred in Lagos when on July 20, 2014, a person who had contracted the virus in Liberia ar rived at the Lagos International Airport. 82 T h i s primary patient was suspected of having po tentially exposed seve nty-two individuals.83 T h e second outbreak occurred in Port Harcourt when the close contact of the primary patient who was under quarantine in Lagos tr avelled to seek medical atten tion from a private physician in August 1, 2014.84 By the time the WHO officially decl ared Nigeria Ebola free on October 20, 2014, a total of nineteen individuals had been infected with the disease, seven (40%) of whom died.85 This was potentially catastrophic in large part be cause Lagos is far from being an ideal place to contain an infectious disease. Home to tw enty-one million people, most of whom live in crowded and unsanitary slums, Lagos is the largest city in Africa. 86 Lagos's population is as large as the total combined populations of Guin ea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the three West African countries hardest hit by the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the region.87 In addition, with its air, land, and sea ports of entry, Lagos is the region's transit hub.88 According to commentators, these factors make th e swift containment of th e spread of Ebola in Nigeria with only a few victims a great success st ory. Sources indicate that this was possible because Nigeria mobilized its resources and took the necessary suppression measures quickly and efficiently.

The Law Library of Congress 175 Portugal Eduardo Soares Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY Constitutional principles guarantee the rights to health protection and protection of personal data in Portugal. A national health system provides healthcare to the population, while a national commission is charged with the power to supervise and monitor compliance with the laws and regula tions on personal data protection. A 1990 law provides the general principles and po licies that guide the health sector in the country, the sanitary protection of its borders, and the powers granted to the Minister of Health to manage serious pub lic health emergencies. Working under the authority of the Ministry of Health are the General Board of Health, which is in charge, inter alia, of regulating, guiding and coordinating the activities of health promotion and disease prevention in the count ry, including epidemiologic surveillance at national level; and the National Institute of Em ergency Medicine, which is responsible for, among other things, collaborating in national ci vil emergency planning and the development and implementation of specific plans regarding emergencies or disasters. A system of public health surveillance mon itors the health status of the population to determine the risk of transmission of diseases, and a national council performs advisory functions in prevention and control of transmissible diseases. Additional laws compose the legal framewor k available to the government to manage public health crises, such as the government's ability to issue compulsory licenses for a patent for public interest reasons; to impos e criminal sanctions on persons who spread contagious diseases; and, the adoption, in 20 08, of the International Health Regulations. To respond to a possible Ebola virus outbreak, Portugal is implementing contingency plans. I. Constitutional Principle - Health According to the Portuguese Constitution, everyone has the right to health pr otection and the duty to defend and promote health. 1 The Constitution states that the right to health protection shall be fulfilled (a) through a universal nationa l health service that, taking into account th e economic and social conditions of citizen s, will generally be free of charge; 2 [and] 1 CONSTITUI\u00c7\u00c3O 64(2)(a). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Portugal The Law Library of Congress 176 (b) by creating economic, social, cultural and environmental conditions that will particularly protect childhood, youth and ol d age; by systematically improving the conditions of life and work and promoting physical fitness and sport at school and among the people; and by developi ng the people's sanitary education and practices of healthy living.3 II. National Health System A National Health System (Sistema Nacional de Sa\u00fade, SNS) was created in 1979 by Law No. 56 of September 15, 1979, through which the government guarantees the right under the Constitution to health protection. 4 The SNS is composed of the organs and services listed in Law No. 56. Its purpose is to provide comprehe nsive health care to the entire population.5 The SNS involves all integrated heal th care, including health promo tion, public health surveillance, disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment of patients, and patients' medical and social rehabilitation.6 A. Basis of the Health Sector On August 24, 1990, Law No. 48, the Basic Health Law, was enacted to es tablish the basis and structure of the health sector in Portugal.7 Law No. 48 provides the general principles8 and policies9 that must guide the country in this area. Failure to comply with the Basic Health Law entails criminal, civil and disciplinary liability.10 The Portuguese government promotes the sanitary protection of its borders, in compliance with general rules issued by the competent bodies. 11 The appropriate bodies are charged with studying, proposing, implementing and enforcing necessary measures to prevent the import or export of diseases subject to inte rnational health regula tions; responding to th reats of the spread of transmissible diseases; and promoting all necessary sanitary actions required by the international community. 12 3 Id. art. 64(2)(b). 4 Lei No. 56/79, de 15 de Setembro, art. 1, http://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao /Paginas/Leis_area_saude.aspx .

The Law Library of Congress 187 Russian Federation Peter Roudik Director of Legal Research* SUMMARY The health crisis management system in Russia is regulated by a number of laws and statutory documents issued by federal and regi onal authorities. The Federal Service for the Surveillance of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being (Rospotrebnadzor) is the leading government agency in the field and coordinates the activities of military and civilian government agencies and social orga nizations whose aim is to protect Russia's population and territory from epidemic outbreaks. This report contains a comprehensive analysis of the legislation in force and its implementation. I. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System The Russian health care system is based on a strong governmental role in ensuring the country's sanitary and epidemiologic well-being. The fight against epidemics and overcoming of emergencies are included in the joint jurisd iction of federal and provincial authorities. 1 Government policy in the area of protection from medical emergencies is formulated in a number of federal and provincial legislative acts, pres idential decrees, govern ment regulations, and government programs. There is no special legislation aimed at the regulation of issu es related to public health emergencies and epidemics. Th e outbreak of epidemics is considered an emergency situation, and all rules prescribed by the Federal Constitutional Law on Emergency Situations apply. 2 Also, these issues are regulated by the following legislative acts: Federal Law on the Protection of the Population and Territories from Emergency Situations of Natural and Technogenic Character3 Federal Law on Civil Defense4 Federal Law on the Sanitary and Epidem iological Welfare of the Population5 Federal Law on the Immunoprophylaxis of Infectious Diseases6 * This report was prepared with the assistance of Nerses Isajanyan, Foreign Law Consultant. 1 CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION art. 72, available at http://www.constitution. ru/en/10003000-01.htm . 2 Federal Constitutional Law No. 3 OBRANIE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIISKOI FEDERATSII [SZ RF] [R 2001, No. 23, Item 2277, available at http://base.garant.ru/12123122/ (in Russian). 3 Federal Law No. 68 of Dec. 21, 1994 on the Protection of the Population and Territories from Emergency Situations of Natural and Technogenic Character, SZ RF 1994, No. 35, Item 3648, http://base.garant.ru/10107960/ (in Russian). 4 Federal Law No. 28 of Feb. 12, 1998 on Civil Defense, SZ RF 1998, No. 7, Item 799, http://base.garant.ru/178160/ (in Russian). 5 Federal Law No. 52 of Mar. 30, 1999 on the Sanitary an d Epidemiological Welfare of the Population, SZ RF 1999, No. 14, Item 1650, http://base.garant.ru/12115118/ (in Russian). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 188 Government Regulation on the Unified State Sy stem for the Prevention and Elimination of Emergency Situations7 These pieces of legislation determine the powers of Russian authorities in the event of health care emergencies. The President of the Russian Federation defines public policy and makes the most important decisions related to protecting th e population and territory from em ergencies. He leads Russia's Security Council and makes decisions regarding the involvement of troops and other militarized units in eliminating the consequences of emer gencies. According to the Law on Emergency Situations, the President has the power to declar e a state of emergency for thirty days for the entire nation or for sixty days for a particular region when a threat to the health of population exists. Approval of the upper house of the legisl ature is needed to de clare or extend a state of emergency. 8 Russia's Federal Assembly (the legislature) pr ovides for unified legislation and approves budget allocations to finance activities necessary to mana ge a health crisis. Parliamentary hearings on related issues can be conducted. 9 Implementing laws and federal programs aimed at protecting the population from epidemics is the duty of the Russian Federation government. Collecting related information, preparing for emergencies, and managing activities to eliminat e crises, on the other hand, are included in the sphere of responsibility of regional executive authorities, who must also make decisions regarding the evacuation or isolation of the popu lation. Each region has its own set of laws on related issues. 10 The Federal Service for the Surveillance of C onsumer Rights Protectio n and Human Well-Being (Rospotrebnadzor) is the leading government institution in the area of epidemiological security. It reports directly to the govern ment of the Russian Federation and coordinates the efforts of various departments and agencies (t he Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Federal Security Service, etc.) to prevent and e liminate the consequences of mass epidemics. 11 T h e Federal Civil Defense Medical Service and the Medical Service Used for Catastrophes were established under the Ministry of Health Protec tion. They are used depending on the situation\u2014 for example, a war, the consequences of an emerge ncy, or the outbreak of an infectious disease. 6 Federal Law No. 157 of Sept. 17, 1998 on the Immunoprophylaxis of Infectious Diseases, SZ RF 1998, No. 38, Item 4236, http://base.garant.ru/12113020/ (in Russian). 7 Government Regulation No. 794 on the Unified State System for the Prevention and Elimination of Emergency Situations of Dec. 30, 2003 (amended Nov. 19, 2012), R OSSIISKAIA GAZETA [RG], No. 271, Nov. 23, 2012, http://base.garant. ru/186620/ (in Russian). 8 Law on Emergency Situations arts. 4, 7, 9. 9 Constitution of the Russian Federation art. 105. 10 Law on Emergency Situations arts. 24, 25. 11 Statute on Rospotrebnadzor, approved by Government Regulation No. 322 of June 30, 2004, available on the Rospotrebnadzor website, at http://64.rospo\u00a7trebnadzor.ru/309 (in Russian). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 189 These services provide medical and sanitation services to the populatio n during epidemics and work to prevent adverse consequences.12 The Rospotrebnadzor includes administrative offices in the constituent provinces, centers of hygiene and epidemiology, research institutes, a nd antiplague facilities, and cooperates with sanitary and epidemiological services within th e following government agen cies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Federa l Security Service, Federal Protection Service, Directorate of Special Programs Un der the President, Federal Penitentiary Service, and Federal Biomedical Agency. 13 II. Implementation of the Emerge ncy/Crisis Response System The management of antiepidemic measures is one of the duties of Ro spotrebnadzor. These measures may include organizing and conducting sanitary a nd epidemiological monitoring; preventing infectious diseases from entering an emergency zone; locating, mandatorily isolating, and evacuati ng patients with infectious diseases; locating and monitoring persons with chr onic forms of infectious diseases; maintaining an antiepidemic regi me during medical evacuations; disinfection measures; preventive and urgent immunization; and sanitary education and psychological a ssistance to the population and responders.14 Rospotrebnadzor is in charge of conducting planning and training exercises, which are considered the major actions aimed at pr eventing emergencies and eliminating their consequences. The main purpose of these pla nning and training exercise s is to ensure the sufficiency and full use of existing resources. Th e elimination of an emergency's consequences must be conducted by the author ities of Russia's constituent components and the territorial branches of the federal agencies where the emergency has occurred. If necessary, federal resources can be used. 15 To ensure that all resources are gathered in on e place in order to provide the most efficient response, the federal Ministry of Health Protection has desi gnated one hospital in each of Russia's constituent components to respond in case of an infectious disease outbreak. These 12 Statute on Medical Service Used for Catastrophes, approved by Government Regulation No. 734 of Aug. 26, 2013, available on the Ministry of Health Protection website, at http://static-1.rosminzdrav.ru/system/attachments/ attaches/000/012/778/original/Ob_utverzhdenii_Polozheniya.pdf?1389715517 (in Russian) . 13 Statute on Rospotrebnadzor \u00a7 8. 14 Id. \u00a7 5. 15 Id. \u00a7 4. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 190 hospitals focus on treating patients who have been diagnosed with diseases as a consequence of a health crisis. Support is provided to these hos pitals by the National Institute of Emergency Medical Services, which conducts research in the field of emergency medical services and supplementary professional educat ion of medical staff. Servic es of other state and private medical establishments can be enlisted for the duration of an emergency situation.16 A quarantine regime can be introduced where da nger of an epidemic out break appears. The quarantine of a particular territory incurs trav el restrictions, mandatory vaccinations, and the cancellation of all mass events. Special procedures are prescribed for the distribution or sale of food and basic commodities, and local authorities can restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages. During the quarantine period, police have extende d authority to take quarantine violators into custody. 17 Implementation mechanisms are prescribed by fe deral target-program documents, which define means for conducting practical he alth care activities. Severa l federal target programs for preventing health care emergencies have been approved, financed, and imp lemented, including emergency measures to ensure the public's sanitary and epidemio logic well-being; prevention of the most prevalent diseases; disaster medicine; protecting the territory from th e influence of especially dangerous human, animal, and plant diseases and toxic chemicals; and a vaccination program. 18 Within the vaccination program framework, a one-hundred-million-dose stockpile of vaccines for all major known infectious diseases has b een established, and federal control over the vaccines' quality introduced.19 The federal registration of th e producers of products potentially dangerous to humans, the registration of specifi c kinds of products bei ng imported into Russia for the first time, and the registration of all potentially dangerous ch emical and biological substances has been in force since June 2001.20 The legal basis for the vaccination against major communicable diseases is determined by the Law on the Immunoprophylaxis of Infectious 16 Order No. 220 of Sept. 17, 1993 of the Russian Federation Health Protection Ministry on the Development and Improvement of the Infectious Disease Service in the Russian Federation, available at http://www.consultant.ru/ document/cons_doc_law_100796/?frame=3 (in Russian). 17 Government Regulation No. 529 of Aug. 19, 2005 on Organization and Control for Introducing and Cancelling Quarantine Measures, http://base.garant.ru/12141665/ (in Russian). 18 Information about ongoing Federal Target Programs is available on the Russian Government web portal at http://www.programs-gov.ru/ (in Russian; last visited Nov. 20, 2014). 19 V.

It provides for federal budget funding of all preventive vaccin ation and states that those who become incapacitated because of postvaccination complications are subject to social security protection. The National Calendar of Preventive Vaccinati on and deadlines for vaccinating different categories of the population agains t particular diseases were de veloped following the adoption of this Law. Enforcement measures can be applie d to those who refuse vaccination. These may include a prohibition on traveli ng abroad, an employment hiring ban, and university admission restrictions. In order to in crease incentives, all firms speci alizing in the research on and production of medical and veterina ry vaccines for the purpose of fighting epidemics are exempt from federal property taxes.22 All activities re lated to fighting epidemics are financed by the federal budget from a special reserve fund. In 2000, Russia's Supreme Court c onfirmed that all services provided by the National Sanitary Service (prede cessor of Rospotrebnadzor) to th e population are to be free of charge. 23 Budget appropriations for fighting epidemics can be spent on special measures aimed at eliminating outbreaks of epidemic illnesses. One quarter of these funds can be appropriated for unscheduled antiepidemic measures in the even t of a threat of an ep idemic or increase in morbidity. These funds can be spent by local governments for the creation of temporary inf ectious hospitals, according to a regional executive government resolution if the existing regular hos pital network cannot satisfy needs; the organization and activities of tempor ary antiepidemic teams and creation of isolation points; the payment of salaries to de tailed medical personnel; related transportation and comm unication expenditures; and the organization and activities of temporary antiepide mic laboratories. In 2006, the Government Reserve Fund was used to finance measures aimed at preventing the expansion of the SARS epidemic in Russia. According to a government resolution, an amount equal to US$3 million was allocated for this pur pose. This money was divided between the Ministry of Health Protection and the Ministry of Defense. 24 After the Chernobyl catastrophe when information about radioactive contamination was concealed by Soviet leaders, the management of health- and safety-related information became a sensitive issue regulated by legislative acts. Information on protecting the population from health emergencies consists of data on previous ly occurring or forecasted emergencies and their 21 Federal Law No. 157 of Sept. 17, 1998 on the Immunoprophylaxis of Infectious Diseases art. 4, SZ RF 1998, No. 38, Item 4236, http://base.garant.ru/12113020/ . 22 Id. arts. 5.2, 6. 23 Ruling of the Russian Federation Supreme Court No. GKPI2000-1453 of Feb. 5, 2001, available at http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_31907/ . 24 Rospotrebnadzor Letter No. 0100/1828 of Feb. 20, 2006 on the Accounting of Expenses Related to Fighting Epidemics, available at http://www.businesspravo.ru/Docum/DocumShow_DocumID_113411.html (in Russian).

Information about gove rnment activities in this area must be open to public acce ss and cannot be classified.25 The concealment or distortion of information about developments, facts, or events endangering human life or health, or the environment, by a pe rson whose duty is to provide such information to the population is a crime punishable by a fine or deprivation of freedom for a term of up to two years, with or without dis qualification to hold specified o ffices or engage in specified activities for a term of up to th ree years. Stricter punishments ar e prescribed for the same acts committed by a person holding a post at any level of government. 26 III. Responsibilities for Failure to Co mply with Sanitary Requirements Russian criminal legislation considers the viola tion of sanitary rules and creation of health emergencies as attempts on human life regardless of th e consequences and puni shes the criminal according to the act committed, whether it was a murder or intentionally inflicting harm on health. 27 The violation of sanitary and epidemiological rule s that results in the sp read of a disease or poisoning of people is a crime under Russian criminal law. This al so applies to individuals who violate quarantine requirements. Such actions are punishable by a fine, disqualification to hold specified offices or engage in sp ecific activities for a term of up to three years, corrective labor for a term of up to one year, or imprisonment fo r one year. If the death of a person was the consequence, the term of imprisonment extends up to five years. 28 Also, individuals whose negligence in dealing with dangerous biological agents has inflicted harm on human health are held criminally re sponsible. Individual s who violate safety regulations for handling microbiolog ical or other biological agents or toxins and thereby cause harm to human health or the spread of an epid emic or disease or other grave consequences are punishable by a fine, compulsory labor for a term of up to two years, or imprisonment for a term of up to two years. 29 Russian law provides for the possibility of impo sing some restrictive measures on foreigners suspected of being infect ed with a communicable disease. Ar ticle 7 of the Law of June 21, 2002 on the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the Ru ssian Federation allows authorities to reject a petition or annul previous ly issued permission for a foreigner to take up temporary residence in Russia if he/she is a drug addi ct, does not have a document certifyi ng that he/she does not have a 25 Federal Law on Information, Information Technologies, and the Protection of Information No. 149 of July 27, 2006, SZ RF 2006, No. 31(1), Item 3448, http://base.garant.ru/12148555/ (in Russian). 26 CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION art. 237, SZ RF 1996, No. 25, Item 2954 (in Russian). 27 A.B.

The li st of these diseases and the procedure for medical evaluation of a person suspected of being infected has b een established by the federal government.30 IV. Cooperation with the World Health Organization Russia is a member of the World Health Orga nization (WHO) and has accep ted the obligation to bring its health crisis management procedures in line with WHO requirements. In 2009, the Framework Cooperation Agreement was signed betw een the WHO and the Ministry of Health Protection,31 and ongoing developments in the Russian health care sector are tied to WHO strategic goals.32 The Ministry of Health Protecti on has set a goal of bringing Federa l Target Programs in line with WHO requirements33 and, in 2014, the Ministry of Health Protection reported that systemic changes recommended by the WHO had been implemented.34 Existing Russian rules and procedures for sanitation and epid emiological control do not contradict the requirements of the International Health and Sanitary Regulations of 2005, which were adopted by Russia without reservations, and are follow ed in case of emergencies.35 V. Response to the Outbre ak of Infectious Diseases Recently, Russian authorities have undertaken preventive epidemiologic measures in response to two global health crises, the SA RS epidemic in 2006 and the swine flu epidemic in 2009. When the WHO issued an emergency alert in April 2 009 because of the spread of the swine flu, the Russian government formed an executive commi ssion on preventing the introduction and spread in Russian territory of diseases caused by flu viru ses. The Commission consisted of heads of all relevant government executive agencies. The government decree defined its duty as the coordination and supervision of the activities of federal and regional author ities in this regard. 36 30 Federal Law No. 115 of July 25, 2002 on the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the Russian Federation, SZ RF 2002, No. 26, Item 2513, http://base.garant.ru/184755/ (in Russian). 31 Russia and WHO Sign Framework Cooperation Agreement , MEDLINKS .RU (Jan. 21, 2009), available at http://www.medlinks.ru/article.php?sid=34871 (in Russian). 32 Natalia Valkina, Cooperation Strategy Between Russia and WHO Is Signed , ARGUMENTY I FAKTY (July 24, 2014), http://www.aif.ru/health/life/1214975 (in Russian). 33 Id. 34 Press Release, Russian Federation Ministry of Health Protection, Minister Skvotsova Participates in World Healthcare Assembly (May 19, 2014), http://www.rosminzdrav.ru/news/2014/05/19/1839-ministr-veronika- skvortsova-prinyala-uchastie-vo-vsemirnoy-assamblee-zdravoohraneniya (in Russian). 35 Rospotrebnadzor Order No. 39 of Nov. 29, 2007, available at http://www.mossanexpert.ru/view_info.php?id=38 (in Russian). 36 Government Regulation No. 367 of April 27, 2009, on the Government Commission on Preventing the Spread of Highly Pathogenic Flu in Russia, RG, May 5, 2009, http://www.rg.ru/2009/05/05/virus-dok.html (in Russian). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 194 The Commission ordered the surveillance of passengers coming from Mexico and other countries where cases of swine flu had been reported; the mandatory checking of the body temperature of all arriving traveler s and the creation of quarantine points at the ports of entry; the monitoring of disease reporting by regional institutions; the allocation of increased funds for select major national resear ch institutes; and the stockpiling of antiviral medicines. In addition, the import of pork from the count ries affected by the epidemic was stopped for several days. 37 In 2006, in order to prevent the spread of the SARS virus, th e government ordered the Federal Border Service to close certain checkpoints on the Russian border with Mongolia and China. Airlines were ordered to reduce th e number of flights to infectio n-affected regions, and eleven medical groups consisting of physicia ns and sanitary control specialis ts were formed. Placed on trains traveling between Russi a and China, these groups conduc ted medical examinations of more than one thousand suspicious passengers a nd railroad personnel. A network of federal medical centers was set up in major Russian regi onal centers with the ta sk of diagnosing the disease and identifying the presence of the virus. Airport terminals in Moscow were equipped with infrared detectors able to determine any trav eler's temperature at a di stance of fifty yards. In order to protect the capital city, public tran sport and open markets were disinfected daily, and one million respiratory masks were acquired for public use. 38 VI. Response to the Ebola Virus Outbreak Russia's Foreign Ministry announced it had allocat ed the equivalent of US$3.8 million to help the country prepare for a possible outbreak of Ebola and the equivalent of US$3.95 million for research work.39 Russia also set aside the equivalent of US$5.2 million in hu manitarian aid for the West African countries hit hardest by the outbreak.40 37 Id. 38 Dmitri Vladimirov, Cabinet of Ministers Decide to Be Proactive in Fighting Bird Flu , RG (Apr. 11, 2007), http://www.rg.ru/2007/04/11/medvedev.html (in Russian). 39 More Than 3 Million Travelers Checke d for Ebola at Russian Airports , MOSCOW TIMES (Oct. 24, 2014), http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/a rticle/more-than-3-million-travel ers-checked-for-ebola-at-russian- airports/510021.html . 40 Russia Allocated 779 Million Rubles to Fight Ebola , LENTA .RU (Oct. 16, 2014), http://lenta.ru/news/2014/10/16/ dorogoivirus/ (in Russian).

This vaccine will be sent to Africa for efficacy tests.46 The Russian Ministry of Education and Scien ce recommended that universities postpone the academic year for students from Af rica because of the Ebola virus.47 It is estimated that Russia has about two thousand students from the Ebola-affected countries.48 About five hundred students from West Africa were tested for the virus and placed under observation.49 They were not isolated, but doctors checked their temperature and other vital signs.50 No Ebola case was confirmed.51 The initiative to check al l African residents in Russia for Ebol a was discussed by the legislature; however, the Ministry of Health Protection deemed this measur e excessive because Africans who already live in Russia do not need to be checked for Ebola, as control border controls are sufficient to keep the disease out of the country. 52 41 Russia's Putin Vows Closer Cooperation with WHO in Ebola Fight , SPUTNIK (Oct. 13, 2014), http://en.ria.ru/ russia/20141013/194031322/Russias-Putin-Vows-Closer-Cooperation-with-WHO-in-Ebola-Fight.html . 42 Russia Offers to Send More Experts to Tackle Ebola in West Africa , MOSCOW TIMES (Oct. 8, Id. 45 Irina Nevinnaia, Russian Federation and Guinea Will Sign a Memorandum on Ebola Fight , RG (Oct. 24, 2014), http://www.rg.ru/2014/10/ 24/golodec-site.html (in Russian). 46 Russia Ready to Introduce New Ebola Vaccines in Six Months: Russian Health Minister , SPUTNIK Russian.html . 47 Gleb Fedorov, Chances of Ebola Epidemic Reaching Russia Are Slim, Say Researchers , RUSSIA BEYOND THE HEADLINES (Oct. 13, 2014), http://rbth.co.uk/science_and_tech/2014/10/13/chances_of_ebola_epidemic_reaching_ russia_are_slim_say_resea_40553.html . 48 Id. 49 MOSCOW TIMES , supra note 42. 50 Id. 51 African Students Hospitalized in Russia Do Not Have Ebola: Russia's Health Watchdog, SPUTNIK (Oct. 23, 2014), http://en.ria.ru/russia/20141018/194264877/African-Students-Hospitalized-in-Russia-Do-Not-Have-Ebola.html . 52 Ebola Checks for African Residents in Russia Unnecessary: Health Ministry , SPUTNIK (Oct. 23, 2014), http://en.ria.ru/russia/20141023/194495826/Ebola-Chec ks-for-African-Residents-in-Russia-Unnecessary- Health.html .

The Law Library of Congress 197 Senegal Nicolas Boring Foreign Law Specialist* SUMMARY Senegal has contained many disease outbreaks and has been particularly credited for keeping its HIV/AIDS epidemics and, recently, the Ebola pandemic at bay. Keys to this success include the involvement of government authorities from the national level to the local level, through a decentralized public health structure; measures aimed at early detection; an extensive use of the medi a and public information campaigns; and collaboration with the WHO and health-relate d NGOs for surveillance, immunization, and crisis management. I. Introduction Senegal, a West African nation, became independe nt from France in 1960 and inherited a legal and institutional system that was almost identical to the system prevailing in France. Senegal is a republic with a democratic govern ment. It is regarded as one of the most politically stable countries in Africa.1 A new Constitution was adopted on January 22, 2001, which guarantees the right to health.2 II. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System A. The Ministry of Health Two directorates of the Minist ry of Health are primarily involved in the fight against communicable diseases. The Directorate of Hea lth has the task of formulating, implementing, and monitoring health policy and programs. To this end, it is responsible, among others, for the control of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. The Directorate of Prevention formulates, implements, and monitors prevention policy. It is responsi ble for immunization, monitoring and managing of epidemics, and communicating with the public.3 In addition, the * This is a revised and updated version of a 2003 report authored by Senior Foreign Law Specialist Nicole Atwill (retired). 1 Senegal , CIA WORLD FACTBOOK , https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html (accessed on Oct. 30, 2014). 2 CONSTITUTION DE LA R\u00c9PUBLIQUE DU S\u00c9N\u00c9GAL DU 22 JANVIER 2001 (CONSTITUTION ) art.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Senegal The Law Library of Congress 198 Ministry of Health maintains partnerships with several international or foreign organizations including the World Health Organiza tion (WHO), USAID, and the World Bank.4 B. Medical Regions Senegal has eleven medical regions,5 each divided into sanitary di stricts, which are operational zones comprising at least one health center around which seve ral health post s have been established. The districts' bounda ries do not necessarily coincide with the boundaries of other territorial entities such as municipalities or d\u00e9partements .6 Each district is supposed to cover a population of between 100,000 and 150,000.7 Each medical region is headed by a doctor and has several bureaus, one of which is specifically in charge of imm unization for and the management of epidemics.8 C. National Service of Sanitary Information The National Service of Sanitary Information, attached to the Health Minist er's cabinet , collects and analyzes sanitary informati on. It centralizes and updates all information concerning the sanitary system of Senegal and compiles health statistics. These data are available to other services, researchers, and the Mi nistry of Health's partners.9 D. Notification Requirements The Public Health Code requires that doctors report to the public health authorities any case that they may come across of a disease listed in a re gulation established by the Ministry of Health.10 Additionally, the head of family, spouse, nearest relative, or any other person residing with or taking care of a sick person is requi red to report the illne ss to the public health authorities if they are aware that the patient is suffering from one of the listed diseases.11 Failure to notify 4 Partenaires [Partners ], M INIST\u00c8RE DE LA SANT\u00c9 ET DE L 'ACTION SOCIALE [MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL ACTION ] (Aug. 2013), http://www.sante.gouv.sn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1298& Itemid=764 . 5 Les R\u00e9gions M\u00e9dicales [The Medical Regions DE L 'ACTION SOCIALE , [RADIOSCOPY OF AN AFRICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM : SENEGAL ] 67, 74 (2013). 7 COL.

Powers of Public Health Authorities A. Mandatory Immunization of Health Care Personnel All personnel working in public or private health establishments in a capacity where they risk being exposed to certain specified diseases ar e required to get vaccinated. The Ministry of Health sets forth the list of these estab lishments and the conditions under which this immunization takes place. The di seases in question are tuberculos is, diphtheria, tetanus, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, and poliomyelitis.13 B. Disinfection Measures Disinfection measures are mandatory for any of the diseases that must be reported. The Ministry of Health decides which measures should be implemented. The National Hygiene Service carries out the disinfection process.14 It is unlawful to oppose such measures. The penalties for failing to take such measures are identical to the penalties set forth for failing to notify authorities of a listed disease.15 C. Sanitary Controls at the Borders Sanitary controls at the bor ders are governed by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations, and any bila teral or multilateral agreement and national regulations in this field, aimed at preventing the spread of co mmunicable diseases by air, sea, or land.16 Violations of these provis ions are recorded either by pub lic health docto rs, doctors or officers from the National Hygiene Service, or by other agents specifically commissioned for such a task.17 If a civil servant, public agent, or commanding officer of a ship or airplane falsifies or voluntarily conceals information that may compromi se the health of the population, he may be punished by a fine of 20,000 to 260,000 Fran cs CFA (approximately US$39 to US$500), imprisonment from two months to two years, or both. 18 Senegal, for example, stepped up its vigilanc e against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and took special measures to protect itself when the WHO i ssued its alerts.

Airport personnel were trained and given the necessary knowledge to be able to identify suspected SARS cases.19 IV. Transparency of Public Health Crisis Management System The Constitution of Senegal recognizes a right to a pluralit y of information.20 The government of Senegal has extensively used the media to fight public health crises. In 2003, it launched a radio campaign to heighten public awareness of SARS.21 Currently, the Senegalese Ministry of Health provides information on the Ebola virus on its website and through a toll-free number.22 V. Cooperation with the WHO Senegal is a member of the W HO. As noted above, it abides by the WHO International Health Regulations dealing with notification of certain communicable diseases and measures to be taken at entry points to avoid the spread of such diseases. Senegal worked with the WHO on precautionary measures to protect its people from SARS. Through the years, the WHO has provided epidemiological, clinical, and logis tical support to Senegal. The WHO and the Ministry of Health have worked together in the areas of surveilla nce, immunization, and coordination with respect to yellow fever. 23 VI. Recent Crises A. HIV/AIDS Senegal also stands as one of the few countries in the region to have succeeded thus far in containing the spread of HIV/AIDS, thanks to a strong surveillance system; an aggressive focus on treatment and support of high-risk groups; extens ive information to the general public; and a high level of involvement of local authorities, teachers, soldiers, religious leaders, nongovernmental organizations, and the media to achieve a greater mobilization of the community. Its long democratic experience and the rela tive freedom of its national press have also resulting in freely debating the probl em and publishing information concerning the disease.24 Senegal has also scaled up access to anti-retroviral treatment and encouraged 19 Africa Steps Up Vigilance After Continent's First Probable SARS Case Dies, A GENCE FRANCE PRESSE (Apr. 30, 2003), available at Lexis, News Group File. 20 CONSTITUTION art. 8, http://www.gouv.sn/-Constitution-du-Senegal-.html .

Yellow Fever Due to its climate, Senegal is prone to periodic yellow fever epidemics. One such epidemic caused twelve deaths in 2002. 26 In response, the Senegalese authorities organized mass vaccination campaigns, gradually covering the entirety of the country over the next several years. Since 2007, inoculation agains t yellow fever is routinely given throughout Senegal.27 C. Ebola Virus Senegal has largely been spared by the current Ebola pandemic, despit e sharing a border with Guinea, one of the hardest-hit countries. 28 Senegal's response to the Ebola threat has focused on four types of measures: quick te sting of individuals suspected of being infected, identifying and monitoring anyone who has been in contact with infected patient s, increased monitoring at the country's entry points, and natio nal public awareness campaigns.29 After Senegalese authorities identified a young man who had arrived from Gu inea as being infected, they tracked down seventy-four people with whom he had had contact and screened them for the virus.30 Additionally, Senegal closed its border with Guinea, and has prohi bited aircraft and ships from Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberi a from landing in the country.31 From early on, the Senegalese government has been working closely with the WHO and NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, both of which have provided Senegal with teams of doctors and epidemiologists to help deal stave off the pandemic. 32 25 Senegal: A Success Story of AIDS Investments and Impact , UNAIDS (Oct. 27 Id.; Senegal to Launch Pan West-Africa n Campaign to Prevent Yellow Fever , supra note 23. 28 Karen Weintraub, From Senegal and Nigeria, 4 Lessons on How to Stop Ebola , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC (Oct. 24, 2014), http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/1410 24-ebola-nigeria-outbreak-lessons-virus-health/ . 29 Press Release, WHO, WHO Congratulates Senegal on Ending Ebola Transmission (Oct. 31 Jacque Wilson, Borders Closing Over Ebola Fears , CNN (Aug. 22, 2014), http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/22/ health/ebola-outbreak/ . 32 Ebola: rouge de l'OMS [Ebola: Senegal Comes Off the WHO's Red List ], ECHOS (Oct. 17, 2014), http://m.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/ebola-l e-senegal-sort-de-la- liste-rouge-de-l-oms- 0203868882831.htm . The Law Library of Congress 202 South Korea Sayuri Umeda Foreign Law Specialist* SUMMARY The Ministry of Health and Welfare is the government agency responsible for responding to health crises in South Korea. The Kor ea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) was established by the relevant Mini ster who delegated certain powers to the KCDC to address infectious disease emergencies. The aims of the Infectious Diseases Cont rol and Prevention Act include preventing the occurrence and prevalence of infectious diseases and prescribing the necessary measures for their prevention and control. The Qu arantine Act provides measures for preventing infectious diseases from spreading inside South Korea and outside its borders. South Korea has an infectious disease surveillan ce system. When a person is infected with a specified infectious disease, the person may be treated and hospitalized in designated hospitals. I. Structure of the Public Heal th Crisis Management System The Minister of Health and Welfare is responsib le for the administration of affairs related to health, sanitation, and the prevention of epidemics, among other things.1 The Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act was enacted in 2009 \"to contribute to the improvement and maintenance of citizens' health by preventin g the occurrence and prevalence of infectious diseases hazardous to citizens' health, and prescribing necessar y matters for the prevention and control thereof.\"2 The Act confers upon the Minister of Health and Welfare various powers and obligations. The authority of the Minister of He alth and Welfare stipulated under the Act may be partially delegated to the Director of the Korea Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).3 The Minister of Health and Welfare formulat es and implements a \"master plan\" for the prevention and control of infecti ous diseases every five years. The master plan must include the following: * At present there are no Law Library of Congress research staff members versed in Korean.

Schemes to train experts and enhance emergency preparedness capability for infectious diseases; 4. Schemes to manage statistics and info rmation on infectious diseases . . . [.]4 An Infectious Disease Contro l Committee was established under the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) to deliberate on major polic ies concerning the prev ention and control of infectious diseases, including th e formulation of a master plan and crisis control measures.5 The Vice Minister of Health and Welfare chairs the Committee.6 The Minister of Health and Welfare formulates and implements crisis control meas ures against infectious diseases following Committee deliberations on these matters.7 The crisis control measures include the following: 1. A response system and roles of each agency at emergency scenes; 2. A determination and decision-maki ng system of emergencies; 3. Schemes of stockpiling and supplying medical supplies . . . ; 4. Education and training schemes, such as citizens' codes of conduct in each case of emergency . . . [.]8 The Minister of Health and Welfare may es tablish organizations consisting of private professionals to support infectious disease contro l projects, the implementation of master plans and implementation plans, and internat ional cooperation in health affairs.9 The KCDC is one such organization,10 and contains the following divisions: In fectious Disease Control, Quarantine Support, Infectious Disease Surveillance, Ep idemic Intelligence Service, Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response, and Public Health Crisis Response.11 The Division of Public Health Crisis Response \"is in charge of the planning and running of the national emerging disease response, response and management of avian infl uenza human infection and pandemic influenza, education and training of public health officials, research and developm ent of public health crisis, and international cooperation.\"12 The Management Team fo r Public Health Crisis 4 Id. art. 7(1).

Surveillance The Infectious Diseases Contro l and Prevention Act classifies infectious diseases in groups, depending on the speed of transmissi on or degree of danger and harm: Group 1: infectious diseases spread via dri nking water or food, with a high risk of mass outbreak, requiring immediate control measures upon their outbreak or prevalence. These diseases include cholera, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, bact erial dysentery, colon bacillus infection with enterorrhagia and viral hepatitis A. Group 2: infectious diseases that can be prevented and controlle d by vaccinations, subject to national vaccination programs. These diseases include diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, poliomyelitis, viral he patitis B, Japanese en cephalitis, varicella, and haemophilus influenza type B. Group 3: infectious diseases requiring contin uous surveillance and the establishment of control measures against their outbreak. Th ese diseases include malaria, tuberculosis, Hansen's disease, scarlet fever, meningococcal meningitis, legionellosis, vibrio typhus, leptospirosis, brucellosis, anthrax, rabies, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, influenza, AIDS, syphilis and Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease. Group 4: infectious diseases, as designated by Ordinance of the MOHW, that have newly broken out or are likely to break out in Korea, or that are epid emics overseas with a risk of transmission to Korea. Group 5: infectious diseases that are spread by parasite infection and are designated by Ordinance of the MOHW as requiring surv eillance through regular investigations. Designated infectious diseases: infectious diseas es designated by the Minister of Health and Welfare, other than infectious diseases in Groups 1-5, requiring surv eillance to investigate whether they are epidemic. Infectious diseases under surveillance of th e World Health Organiza tion (WHO): infectious diseases being monitored to prepare for in ternational public health emergencies, as announced by the MOHW. Infectious diseases spread th rough bioterrorism: in fectious diseases pu blicly announced by the MOHW as being among those spread by pathogens through deliberate use or for terrorism. Sexually transmitted infectious diseases: infect ious diseases announced by the Minister of Health and Welfare as being transmitted by sexual contact. Zoonoses: infectious diseases spread by pathog ens transmittable from animals to humans and vice versa, announced as requiri ng surveillance by the MOHW. 13 Id. \u00a7 4.3. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: South Korea The Law Library of Congress 205 Nosocomial infectious diseases: infectious di seases contracted by pe ople involved in medical activities or undergoing medi cal procedures, announced as requiring surveillance by the MOHW.14 No specific information was located concerning the classification of Ebola in one of the abovementioned infectious disease groups, but it appears that Ebola could be included under \"Infectious diseases under surveillance of the WHO\" or several other categories. Under the Infectious Diseases Control and Pr evention Act, a medical doctor must report the following infectious disease situations to the head of the medical institution to which he/she belongs or to a competent public he alth clinic if he/she does not be long to a medical institution: A doctor diagnoses a patient as being infected with a disease belonging to any of the groups listed above, or examines the corpse of such a patient. A patient infected with a disease from Groups 1-4 dies. 15 The medical institution that receives such a repor t from a doctor must forward it to the competent public health clinic. 16 The Infectious Diseases Control and Preventi on Act obligates anyone who becomes aware of a person that he/she suspects is infe cted with or has died from a disease belonging to any of the groups listed above to inform the head of a competent pub lic health clinic. 17 A definite or suspected case of a Group 1 infectious diseas e, or a death resulting from a Group 1 disease, obligates the following people either to pursue a medical examinati on or diagnosis, or to make a report to the public health clin ic in their jurisdiction: In the case of a family, the head of the hous ehold or, in the absence of the head of the household, another member of the household. In the case of a school, hospita l, government office, compa ny, place of entertainment or worship, vessel, place of business, restaurant , inn, or other place of gathering, the head, manager, proprietor, or repres entative of the establishment.18 Violation of the Act's provisions regarding re quired medical examinations or reports is punishable by a fine not to exceed 2 million (approximately US$1,890). 19 The head of a public health clinic on receipt of an infectious disease notif ication must report the details \"to the Governor of the competent Specia l Self-Governing Province or the head of the 14 Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act art. 2. 15 Id. art. 11(1). 16 Id. art. 11(2). 17 Id. art. 12(2). 18 Id. art. 12(1). 19 Id. art. 81.

Powers of Public Health Authorities A local government may designate a medical in stitution as an infectious disease control institution. The MOHW Ordina nce requires the head of a de signated medical institution to establish necessary facilities for preventing inf ectious diseases and fo r examining and treating infected patients.23 The expenses incurred for the establishm ent of such facilities are subsidized by the local government.24 In the case of mass infections or difficulty in accommodating all infected patients, the Minister of Health and Welfare and heads of local governments can designate other medical instituti ons as infectious disease contro l institutions for a certain period, as well as establish and operate isolat ion wards, sanatoriums, and clinics.25 In August 2014, \"the Health Ministry designated a total of 17 hospitals w ith quarantine units as official facilities to treat patients should Ebola occur in South Korea.\" 26 However, one expert on infectious disease epidemiology has stated that [a]lthough there are 17 government-designated hospitals with quarantine units, these units were constructed for airborne infecti ous diseases like influenza. As such, currently no hospitals in South Korea are designed to provide one-stop testi ng and treatment for diseases like Ebola that are transmitted through body fluids.27 A person who has contracted a disease specifie d by the Minister of Health and Welfare as infectious must be hospitalized at the designated infectious disease control institution. If such an institution is full, the Minister of Health and Welfare or the head of the local government may 20 Id. art. 13(1). 21 Byungguk Yang, PowerPoint Presentation, Infectious Di sease Surveillance System in Korea, Thirty-first Asia- Pacific Advanced Network Meeting, slides 7-15 (Feb. 2011), http://www.apan.net/meetings/ HongKong2011/ Session/Slides/Medical/6-6.pdf . 22 Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act art. 18. 23 An English translation of the Ordinance is not available. 24 Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act art. 36(1) & (2). 25 Id. art. 37(1). 26 South Korea Ill-Prepared for Possible Ebola Outbreak, Say Health Experts , STRAITS TIMES (Oct. 20, 2014), http://www.straitstimes.com/news/asia/ east-asia/story/south-kore a-ill-prepared-possible-eb ola-outbreak-say-health- experts-201410 . 27 Moran Ki, What Do We Really Fear?

When a medical diagnosis identifies an infected person, the relevant public official may escort the patient to undergo required medical treatment or hospitalization. 31 The head of the local go vernment may require any of the fo llowing persons to undergo a medical examination or receive a vaccination necessary fo r the prevention of an infectious disease: 1. Family members of a patient, etc. infected by an infectious disease, or his/her cohabitants; 2. A person suspected of being infected by an infectious disease, who lives in or frequents an area where an infectious disease has occurred; 3. A person suspected of being infected by an infectious disease, as he/she has come into contact with a patient, etc. infected by an infectious disease.32 In order to prevent the further spread of an infe ctious disease once it has broken out, the head of the local government is obligated to take all or some of th e following measures: 1. To isolate traffic to places where patients, et c. infected by an infectious disease exist or to the places deemed to have been inf ected by the pathogen of an infectious disease for a certain period; 2. To keep persons suspected of being infected by the pathogen of an infectious disease hospitalized or in quarantine at an appropriate place for a certain period; 3. To prohibit the use, receipt, transfer, abandonm ent, or washing of articles infected or suspected of being infected by the pathogen of an infectious disease, or to incinerate or destroy such articles; 4. To order the disinfection of or other necessary measures for places infected by the pathogen of an infectious disease; 5. To prohibit laundry at a specified place, or to order the disposal of waste at a specified place.33 28 Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act art. 41(1) & (2). 29 Id. art. 43. 30 Id. art. 80(2). 31 Id. art. 42. 32 Id. art. 46. 33 Id. art. 47.

Quarantine Act Means of transport (ships, aircraft, trains, or au tomobiles), people, or cargo entering or departing from the Republic of Korea must undergo quarantine inspections.34 No one besides public officials in charge of quarantine is permitted to em bark or board a means of transport subject to a quarantine inspection before a quaran tine certificate has been issued.35 Under the Quarantine Act, diseases subject to quarantine are cholera, pest and yellow fever, SARS, avian influenza, pandemic influenza, and ot her infectious diseases that break out abroad and are likely to spread within the Republic of Korea, or break out within the Republic of Korea and are likely to spread abroad, and that the Minister of Health a nd Welfare designates. 36 The director of the quarantine station condu cts quarantine inspections related to any of the following: 1. Progress and current status of health and sanitary conditions of the means of transport; 2. Matters concerning the control and mana gement of quarantinable communicable diseases for passengers, crew members and . . . [pedestrians]; 3. The storage status of food and the status of the cargo loaded in the means of transport; [and] 4. Whether vehicles for communicable diseases inhabit [sic] and the state of their breeding.37 The director of the quarantine station can take all or some of the following measures: 1. Isolate a patient infected with a quarantinable communicable disease or a patient suspected of being infected with a qua rantinable communicable disease . . . ; 2. Supervising or isolating a person who has ha d contact with patients infected with a quarantinable communicable disease, etc. or who is exposed to the pathogen of a quarantinable communicable disease without any symptom . . . but to whom the quarantinable communicable disease is suspected to break out . . . ; 3. Disinfecting, destructing or prohibiting the movement of cargo contaminated with or suspected of being contaminated with the pathogen of a quarantinable communicable disease; 4.

After the meeting, a special travel adviso ry was issued, which urged Kor eans residing in these Ebola- affected countries to return to Korea and Ko reans elsewhere to cancel or postpone nonessential trips to Ebola-affected countri es. In addition, the government of South Korea announced that inbound travelers from Nigeria and from the three Ebola-affected countries would be quarantined, undergo thermal screening at the tim e of entry, and be closely monitored over a certain period of time (for up to twenty-one days) for any Ebola infection. Inbound travelers on direct or transit flights from the four Ebola-affe cted countries would be quarantined at deplaning gates instead of at general qua rantine zones. The government would identify people entering the country after traveling from or through the E bola-affected countries in advance, through cooperation with the airlines, im migration offices, and embassies in those four Ebola-affected countries, and through vol untary reporting by traveler s. Transit passengers from the four Ebola- affected countries would also go through the quarantine proces s when they enter Korea. Passengers on direct flights from Africa or on flights through a third country from Africa would also undergo enhanced screening.44 43 Press Release, WHO, Statement on the First Meeti ng of the IHR Emergency Committee on the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (Aug. 8, 2014), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/ news/statements/ 2014/ebola- 20140808/en/ . 44 Government Steps Up Measures to Prevent Ebola from Entering Korea , MOHW (Sept. 1, 2014), http://english. mw.go.kr/front_eng/al/sal0101vw.jsp?PAR_MEN U_ID=1002&MENU_ID=100201&page=1&CONT_SEQ =304721 Law Library of Congress 211 Spain Graciela Rodriguez-Ferrand Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY The Spanish Constitution recognizes the right to public health and divides such matters between the state and the autonomous co mmunities. Based on this constitutional framework Spain has created an integrated and coordinated network of agencies and institutions to address public health crises and also closely follows World Health Organization standards, alerts, and directives. In cases of public health emergencies, the Ministry of Public Health, Social Services and Equality is the aut hority in charge of maintaining health and hygiene control over th e international transit of people and goods at Spanish ports of entry. The state has the aut hority to monitor and coordinate public health services with all other local authorities when ther e is a risk to public health with domestic or international consequences. The National Network of Epidemiological Surveillance and the Carlos III Health Institute are the entiti es in charge of epidemiological planning, coordination, and research. Information of a pe rsonal nature in cases of the declaration of an epidemic remains mainly confidential. The most recent case of a health crisis impacting Spain was caused by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In spite of all the preventiv e measures taken by the health care authorities, Spain had the first confirmed case of Ebola virus contracted outside Africa after a Spanish nurse came into contact with two Spanish nati onals who were infected in Africa. The nurse has now fully recovered. I. Government Structure Spain is a parliamentary monarchy 1 with a bicameral Parliament (C ortes Generales) composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies.2 The Constitution recognizes and guarantees the right to autonomy of the regions that comprise the state.3 Bordering provinces with common historical, cultural, and economic characteri stics may accede to self-government and form autonomous communities ( comunidades aut\u00f3nomas ).4 The country's fifty-two provinces have been grouped into autonomous communities since adoption of the 1978 Constitution. 1 CONSTITUCI\u00d3N ESPANOLA art. 1(3), Dec. 27, 1978, B OLET\u00cdN OFICIAL [B.O.E.], English translation available at http://www.boe.es/legislacion/ do cumentos/ConstitucionINGLES.pdf . 2 Id. art. 66(1). 3 Id. art. 2. 4 Id. art 143(1). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Spain The Law Library of Congress 212 II. Structure of Public Heal th Crisis Management System Spain's Constitution expressly recognizes the right to the protection of public health, stating that it is incumbent upon the authorities to safeguard public health through pr eventive measures and necessary care and services , which are regulated by law.5 The Constitution determines which health matters are reserved for the stat e and which are to be delegated. The autonomous communities are respons ible for regulating soci al assistance matters and health and hygiene, 6 while the state reserves the ex clusive right to regulate matters pertaining to the structure and coordination of th e public health system, and to enact legislation on pharmaceuticals.7 The state is also responsible for re gulating matters pertaining to the basic legislation and economic structure of the social security system, even when the services are rendered through the autonomous communities.8 Based on the constitutional mandate, Law 14/1986 on General Public Health 9 created a National Health System (NHS) that inte grates and coordinates all hea lth services of the autonomous communities, including those rendered at centers and hospitals managed by the municipalities.10 The Law expressly provides that the state is th e exclusive authority over international health relations and agreements a nd over external health.11 It further states that matters of external health are those related to vigi lance over and control of potential health risks imported and/or exported through the internationa l transit of people or goods.12 The Ministry of Public Health, Social Servic es and Equality (MPH) was recently reorganized under Royal Decree 200/2012, 13 under which the central administra tion is given the authority to uphold the powers assigned to the state in health matters and to guarantee the population's constitutional right to health protection.14 The MPH cooperates with other government departments to ensure that the inspection and control of external health matters is coordinated within the government in order to simplify and e xpedite international transit, in compliance with international agreements.15 The regulatory directive of Law 14/1986 has been implemented by 5 Id. art. 43. 6 Id. art. 148(1)(xx), (xxi). 7 Id. art. 149(1)(xvi). 8 Id. art. 149(1)(xvii).

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Spain The Law Library of Congress 213 Royal Decree 1418/1986,16 which provides that the MPH has th e power to manage relations with other international he alth and consumer affairs entities through the Mini stry of Foreign Affairs;17 adopt all necessary measures under international agreements on he alth and consumer affairs to which Spain is a party; and maintain health and hygiene control over, and surveillance of, international traffic at Spanish ports, airports , customs ports, and terminals. The MPH also works in conjunction with the Mini stry of Agriculture to oversee the transportation of people, corpses, and human remains, and of animals and an imal derivatives. Together with the Ministry of Economy, it oversees the tran sportation of goods and of any other merchandise that could pose a potential risk to public health.18 In the event of an emergency, the MPH has the aut hority to coordinate inte rnational transit that could affect the health of peopl e or their legitimate interests when they may be affected by the international traffic of goods or services. 19 The Law on General Public Health provides that th e state, without prejudi ce to the authorities assigned to the autonomous communities, is res ponsible for monitoring a nd analyzing epidemics and for coordinating the services of the different public health administrations in situations that may create public health risks with dome stic or international consequences. 20 It also provides that the state is in charge of setting up a health information syst em and preparing statistics of general interest to the autonomous communities.21 The state is also res ponsible for es tablishing a network of information and communication be tween the state and the autonomous communities in health matters.22 III. Powers of Public Health Authorities Health emergencies are declared by the st ate through the MPH, or by the autonomous communities when such power has been delegated by the state. 23 Organic Law 3/86 on Special Meas ures in Matters of Public Health lists the conditions under which the Spanish health authorities may, within their jurisdiction, adopt urgent and necessary public health measures in times of emergencies. 24 16 Real Decreto 1418/1986, June 13, 1986, sobre Funciones Sanidad Exterior [Royal Decree 1418/1986, on the Powers of the Ministry of Public Health and Consumer Affairs in Matters of External Health] (now the MPH), http://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1986-18374 . 17 Id. art. 2(1.1). 18 Id. art. 2(1.4). 19 Id. art. 2(2.4). 20 Id. art. 40(12). 21 Id. art. 40(13), implemented by Decreto 605/2003, May 23, 2003, por el que se el Sistema Nacional de Salud [Decree 605/2003, May 23, 2003, Establishing Measures for the Homogeneous Treatment of Information on the Waiting Lists of the National Health System], http://www.boe.es/buscar/act .php?id=BOE-A-2003-11266 . 22 Id. art. 40(16), implemented by Decreto 605/2003. 23 Id. art. 41. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Spain The Law Library of Congress 214 The government has the authority to declare a stat e of alert in extraordin ary circumstances that make it impossible to keep public order by normal means,25 and in public health crises, such as an epidemic or situation of serious contamination.26 Measures taken under a state of alert must be temporary, restricted to a specific area, and limited to those measures necessary to contain the emergency.27 If the emergency is limited to a specific autonomous community, the community's president may request that the government d eclare a state of alert in that community.28 The state or the president of the affected autonomous co mmunity serves as the competent authority for purposes of the state of alert.29 The declaration of a state of alert is enacted through a decree issued by the Council of Ministries.30 Under a state of alert, the Minist er of Public Health and Consum er Affairs may temporarily order the restriction of the movement of people or mo tor vehicles; search and seizure procedures; the occupation of facilities or indust ries (but not private dwellings) ; the limited consumption or use of necessary food items; and any other measure to fight infectious diseases, protect water and the environment, and protect against forest fires. 31 In these cases, the state may also order the participation of companies and services and the mobilizatio n of their personnel.32 The MPH is in charge of the study and manage ment of epidemics, the promotion of health, preventive measures against epidemics, and the surveillance and control of possible health risks derived from the import or export of goods and the international movement of people. 33 T h e Underdirectorate for the Promotion of Public Health and Epidemiology (Sudireccion General de Promocion de la Salud y Epidemiologia) is in charge of planning, co ordinating, and developing strategies for the National Network of Epidemio logical Surveillance (NNES) (Red Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiologica), in conjunction with th e Carlos III Health Institute (Instituto de Salud Carlos III), a public resear ch institute created in 1986 to provide scientific and technical support to the MPH and the health se rvices of the autonomous communities.34 One of the Carlos 24 Ley Org\u00e1nica 3/1986, on Special Measures in Matters of Public Health] art. 1, Apr. 14, 1986, http://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1986- 10498 . 25 Ley Org\u00e1nica 4/1981, June de Alarma, Excepci\u00f3n y Sitio [Organic Law 4/1981, June 1, 1981, on States of Alert, Ex ception and Siege] art. 1(1), http://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1981-12774 . 26 Id. art. 4(2). 27 Id. art. 1(2). 28 Id. art. 5. 29 Id. art. 7. 30 Id. art. 6. 31 Id. arts. 11, 12(1). 32 Id. art. 12 (2). 33 Ley 14/1986 arts. 8, 38. 34 Id. arts. 111-113, as implemented by Real Decreto 375/2001 por el que se Aprueba el Institute of Health], Apr. 6, 2001, http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2001-8157 . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Spain The Law Library of Congress 215 III Health Institute's specific functions is conduc ting research and studies in epidemiology that are carried out by the Underdirect orate for the Promotion of P ublic Health and Epidemiology.35 The NNES was created by Royal Decree 2210/1995 36 within the NHS to collect and analyze information on epidemics, contribute to the a pplication of individual and collective control measures in cases where a health risk may ha ve national or international consequences, and inform all operational levels about health risks.37 The National Directorate of Public Health (Direcci\u00f3n General de Sanidad P\u00fablica) of the MP H has been established as the Spanish health authority liaison to the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) for tracking and reporting alerts on transmissible diseases.38 The NNES is responsible for $ identifying health problems related to epidemics, endemics, and risks throughout the autonomous communities; $ participating in the individua l and collective control of public health problems throughout the autonomous communities, and ensuring coordi nation between surveillance and decision making by the competent health authorities for the prevention and cont rol of public health problems; $ executing epidemiological analysis to iden tify changes in and the evolution of the abovementioned public health problems, as we ll as any other epidemiological research; $ providing operative information for planning purposes; $ distributing information to all designated operative levels; and $ contributing the development of related statistics for official use. 39 The NNES's surveillance activity involves the systematic collection of epidemiological information, its analysis and interpreta tion, and the distribution of results and recommendations. 40 The NNES is composed of (1) a basic surveillan ce system that includes obligatory notifications about diseases, epidemics, and outbreaks, as we ll as microbiological information; (2) specific systems of epidemic surveillance based on case records, surveys, watch systems, and other methods that could be applicable to the surv eillance of AIDS and ot her preventable immune 35 Decreto 375/2001 Estatuto del Real Decreto 2210/1995 por se Crea la Red Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiol\u00f3gica [Royal Decree 2210/1995, Creating the National Network Surveillance], Dec. 28, 1995, http://www.boe.es/buscar/ act.php? id=BOE-A-1996-1502 . 37 Sanidad y Consumo [Order of the Ministry of Health], SCO 3870/2006, Dec. 15, 2006, art. 1 https://www.boe.es/diario_boe /txt.php?id=BOE-A-2006-22360 . 39 Real Decreto 2210/1995 art. 2. 40 Id. art. 3.

The required report refers to new cases of these listed diseases that appear each week and constitute a concern. Atte nding physicians both from the pub lic and private sector are the agents responsible for the reporting.43 The same procedure is a pplicable at the autonomous communities level, which then transfers all the reported information to the MPH. The information collected must reach the MPH no later than three weeks after the first case is reported.44 All practicing physicians a nd health centers, both public and priv ate, that first detect the outbreak of an epidemic are required to immedi ately report the outbreak to the MPH. 45 An \"outbreak\" is defined as a significant increase in the number of cases; the presence of a case in an area that was free of such disease; the presence of cases of acute, collective poisoni ng due to consumption, handling, or accidental causes; and the presence of any catastrophic incident that may affect the health of the community.46 The NNES may also rely on networks of \"mon itoring physicians,\" and on networks to trace diseases selected by the desi gnated health authorities in predetermined geographic areas.47 Additional regulatory measures have been implem ented to address certain diseases, such as AIDS and SARS, that are consider ed to be or could become an epidemic of serious proportions. Spain created and maintains a national AIDS regi stry for epidemic surveillance purposes. The autonomous communities also keep registries of AIDS cases in their respective territories and have an obligation to report them to the cen tral health authorities every three months. 48 Although no SARS cases were found in Spain, Real Decreto 350/2003,49 now superseded, 41 Id. art. 4. 42 Id., Annex I.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Spain The Law Library of Congress 217 created the Inter-Ministerial Commission for the Surveillance of SARS50 to coordinate the response to the illness throughout the national terr itory. The Decree also required coordinated actions and information sharing in case of an outbreak.51 In addition, the Scientific Committee on SARS52 was created to provide scientific suppor t and to advise the Inter-Ministerial Commission. By 2011 this Commission was no longer operative.53 The NHS is the enforcement authority that manages cases of infectious diseases. 54 Each province and autonomous community has the power to order the isol ation of infected individuals and to impose restrictions on th eir movements to prevent placing ot hers at risk. The same power is assigned to mayors at the municipal leve l if a case falls under their jurisdiction.55 Violations of health safety dire ctives may result in cr iminal charges for provoking a risk to life, physical integrity, and the health of the populatio n or environment\u2014offenses that are punishable by imprisonment of six months to two years, a fi ne, and the inability to hold public office or practice a profession for three to six years. 56 IV. Transparency of Public He alth Crisis Management System The MPH and National Center on Epidemiology,57 together with the competent provincial councils, are the authorities in ch arge of declaring an epidemic.58 The MPH is the enforcement authority of the NNES , ensuring the coordina tion and uniformity of information, as well as its evaluation and anal ysis, throughout the coun try. Information of a personal nature, managed as a consequence of th e application of the NNES, is otherwise to remain confidential. 59 Personal data in databases may be used without the owner's consent only when the information is required in urgent ca ses or to carry out epidemiological studies.60 The 50 Id. art. 2. 51 Id. art. 3. 52 Orden Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo [Order of the Ministry of Health], SCO/1134/2003, May 6, 2003, B.O.E., May 10, 2003. 53 Real Decreto 776/2011, Annex, B.O.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Spain The Law Library of Congress 218 MPH also coordinates such information with the European Union (EU), the WHO, and other international organizations.61 The MPH is required to immediately inform the autonomous communities of any epidemic outbreak so that pertinen t controls and preventive measures may be set up. 62 Reporting such data also ensures compliance with intern ational health standards, such as the international reporting of diseases subject to quarantine and those su bject to special surveillance by the WHO and the EU.63 The MPH issues updated press rel eases to keep the population informed of any health threat. During the latest health epidem ic alerts, such as the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the recent Ebola virus outbreak, the MPH, through the Center for the Coordination of Health Warnings and Emergencies (Centro de Coordinaci\u00f3n de Al ertas y Emergencias Sanitarias), issued recommendations to the population via the Internet and all other major media, as requested by the WHO. 64 V. Current Crisis The MPH, in cooperation with the health aut horities of the autono mous communities, the Institute of Health Carlos III (Instituto de Sa lud Carlos III), and scientific societies, has established a protocol to deal with the Ebola virus. 65 The protocol reflects the recommendations of international organizations a nd experts to ensure the early de tection and diagnosis of possible Ebola cases and to adopt immediate control measures.66 The MPH has also established a pr ocedure applicable to all points of entry into the country to make sure that all airplanes and ships coming fr om Ebola-affected areas meet the applicable health standards. 67 Information pamphlets for passengers coming from these areas, and for any passenger arriving in Spain, have been published and made available online.68 61 Real Decreto 2210/1995 art. 6(1), (2). 62 Id. art. 19. 63 Id. art. 6(3). 64 Centro Update: Outbreaks of the Ebola [Measures by the Government of ], OBIERNO , COMIT\u00c9 66 67 Id. 68 Informaci\u00f3n para los Ciudadanos/Viajeros [Information on the Outbreak of the Ebola Viru s, Information for Citizens and Travelers], Nov. 17, 2014). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Spain The Law Library of Congress 219 In spite of all the preventive measures, Spai n had the first confirmed case of Ebola virus contracted outside Africa. The infected woman, a nurse named Teresa Ro mero, was treated in a Madrid hospital. She had been part of a medical team treati ng two Spanish missionaries with Ebola, who had been brought back to Spain from Sierra Leone and Liberia. Both died in the hospital in Madrid in August and September 2014. Ro mero is reported to have entered the room of one of the missionaries who later died.69 Six other people were also placed in quarantine, while around fifty other healthcare workers were placed under observa tion because of their interaction with the nurse and the two missionaries who died.70 On October 10, 2014, in response to wh at appears to have been a fail ure in established protocols, the Spanish government created a Special Co mmittee on the Management of Ebola (Comit\u00e9 Especial en la Gesti\u00f3n del \u00c9bol a), headed by the Vice President of the Spanish government, to supervise, coordinate, and manage all actions by and resources from the state necessary for the management of the virus. 71 The Minister of Health, Ana Mat o, informed Congress that the revi sed procedures applicable for the early detection of Ebola w ould include the daily monitoring of anyone known or suspected to have come into contact with Ebola victims, an d that even minor increases in body temperature would be taken as a likely sign of their being infected. 72 At the same time, supervision would be tightened in hospitals when staff remove protective body suits, since Romero appears to have been infected when her glove brushed against her face while she was removing her suit. Closed circuit television cam eras would also likely be installed in isolation units. 73 On November 5, 2014, Romero was released from the hospital free from Ebola.74 69 Elisa Sili\u00f3 & Emilio de Benito, Una por \u00c9bola Fuera de \u00c1frica [A Health Professional in Madrid, First Ebola Infection Outside Africa ], EL PA\u00cdS (Oct. 7, 2014), http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/ 10/06/ciencia/1412611515_352524.html Gesti\u00f3n de la Crisis del \u00c9bola [Santamar\u00eda Will Head a Special Committee for the Management of the Ebola Crisis ], LA VANGUARDIA (Oct. 10, 2014), http://www.lavanguardia. com/politica/20141010/54417805465/santamaria-presid al \u00c9bola [This Afternoon Mato Together with ACs Will Analyze Changes in the Protocols Applicable in \u00c9bola Cases ], LA VANGUARDIA (Oct. 10, 2014), http://www.lavanguardia.co lizara-esta-tarde-con-las-ccaa-los- Ana Mato a Cambiar en los Protocolos [Mistakes in the Romero Case Cause Ana Mato to Change Protocols ], EL PA\u00cdS (Oct. 9, 2014), http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/10/09/ actualidad/1412838533_047257.html Ingreso [Teresa Romero Is Discharged from the Hospital Wednesday Nearly a Month After Admission ], LA VANGUARDIA (Nov. 5, 2014), http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20141105/54418948 378/teresa-romero-recibe-alta-ebola.html?rel=rosEP . The Law Library of Congress 220 Sweden Elin Hofverberg Foreign Law Research Consultant SUMMARY Sweden's response to public health crises is governed by statute. Smittskyddslagen (the Communicable Diseases Act) regulates the response to outbreaks and threats of outbreaks of contagious diseases. Power and respons ibility for the containment of contagious diseases are shared between state and local authorities. Both individual patients and treating physicians have a dut y to report cases of possible contagious disease. Coercive powers such as isolation, quarantine, and restri ctions on work and travel are available to the state but only as specified by law and only if there is a serious threat that a dangerous disease may spread. The intentional and neglig ent spreading of a disease is a crime. The National Board on Health and Welfare is r esponsible for coordinating with the World Health Organization. Sweden has not had to respond to a public health crisis recently. I. Structure of Public Health Crisis Management System A. General Government Structure The national government,1 municipalities, and local county c ouncils share power on issues of public health crisis management. Municipal se lf-governance is fundamental to the Swedish system and is explicitly listed as a right in the Swedish Constitution.2 The municipalities are generally responsible for health care, education, and elder care.3 B. Legislation 1. General Principles Sweden does not have overarching legislation that deals with all public health crises but instead uses individual acts an d regulations that deal with crises in different areas\u2014for instance the Communicable Diseases Act4 deals with protection against infe ctious diseases. This report focuses solely on the infectious disease aspect of public health crises a nd thus only covers the Communicable Diseases Act and its rele vant ordinances, pr ocedures, etc. While Sweden has no overarching legislation it ha s general guiding principl es that apply to all crisis management efforts. These are the pr inciples of responsibility, equal treatment,5 and 1 Note: Swedish authorities and agencies often change names as a result of government changes, and there was such a government change in September of 2014. The names of relevant state authorities used in this report reflect the names in force in October 2014. 2 REGERINGSFORMEN [RF] [CONSTITUTION ] 1:1 para. 2. Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 221 \"geographic closeness\" (whereby authority is determined by proximity to the crisis).6 T h i s means that Sweden also has a general division of responsibility between national and local authorities that is similar in all crisis management situations. 2. Smittskyddslagen (Communicable Diseases Act) The main legislation covering contagious diseas es is the Communicable Diseases Act. The Communicable Diseases Act classifies diseases in to three different categories: (1) contagious diseases, 7 (2) diseases danger ous to public health,8 and (3) diseases da ngerous to society.9 Contagious diseases are diseases that can be transferred between individuals and that pose more than an insignificant threat to the he alth of the indivi dual contracting it.10 Diseases dangerous to public health are contagious diseases that can be \"lif e-threatening, result in continuous illness or difficult suffering or cause other se rious consequences where there is a possibility of preventing the spread of the disease through measures aimed at the infected individual.\"11 Diseases dangerous to society are diseases that are dangerous to public health and can spread in society in a manner that would create a seri ous disruption or imminent risk of a serious disruption of important public functions, and demand extraordinary measures.12 All diseases classified as dangerous to public health or dangerous to soci ety, and some communicable diseases, are subject to mandatory contact tracing.13 These diseases are referred to as \"diseases that must be reported\" or \"contact tracing diseases,\" depending on whethe r the disease must be traced and reported or only traced.14 The government decides how to classify each illne ss. Currently diseases dangerous to public health include: infection with II, cholera, with meth fever, plague, infec tion with pneumococci with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G, polio, rabies, salmonella infection, shigellosi s, smallpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), syphilis, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, an d viral hemorrhagic fevers except Dengue fever nefropathia epidemica. Diseases danger ous to society include smallpox and SARS, 15 and, as of 6 Tre grundprinciper , KRISINFORMATION .SE (translation by author). 15 SMITTSKYDDSLAGEN add. 1. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 222 October 23 2014, Ebola.16 Ebola was added to the list by the Swedish government following a request from the National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW).17 These classifications determine the lawful measures that the national, municipal, and local repr esentatives may take to intervene to stop the spread of the disease and provide treatment.18 3. International Measures Sweden has implemented the World Health Or ganization's (WHO's) 2005 International Health Regulations into law.19 The implementing legislation divides responsibility between the municipalities, which are responsible for anim al protection, the coun ty councils, which are responsible for human protecti on, and the NBHW, which is responsible for coordination.20 All diseases dangerous to society that are liste d in the Communicable Diseases Act are also considered international threats to people's health. Currently this list include s smallpox, SARS, and Ebola.21 The government decides what additional dis eases are considered a serious threat to society.22 All serious diseases are subject to the Communicable Diseases Act.23 International public health threats are mon itored by the NBHW, and all national and local authorities must report any disc overed threat to that Board. 24 The NBHW must in turn inform WHO within twenty-four hours of receiving such reports.25 In addition, the NBHW must cooperate with interna tional organizations and foreign gove rnments to combat international health threats.26 Information provided to the WHO should be submitted even if it is covered by domestic secrecy laws.27 Compliance with the aforementioned legislation is monitored by the Health and Social Care Inspectorate.28 Decisions made relying on the authority of the Act can be appealed to the administrative courts.29 16 Press Release, Regeringskansliet, Regeringsbeslut m\u00f6jligg\u00f6r fler skydds\u00e5tg\u00e4rder mot Ebola [Government Decision Enables Precautions Against Ebola] (Oct. 23, 2014), http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/ 14850/a/248949 . 17 Id. 18 See Part II(D) & (E), below. 19 LAG OM SKYDD MOT INTERNATIONELLA HOT MOT M\u00c4NNISKORS H\u00c4LSA [ACT ON PROTECTION AGAINST INTERNATIONAL THREATS TO PEOPLE 'S HEALTH ] (SFS 2006:1570). 20 Id. 4-5 \u00a7\u00a7. 21 Press Release, Regeringskansliet, supra note 16. 22 2 para. 3 \u00a7 SKYDD MOT INTERNATIONELLA HOT H\u00c4LSA . 23 Id. 2 para. 2 \u00a7. 24 Id. 10 \u00a7. 25 Id. 11 \u00a7. 26 Id. 9 \u00a7. 27 Id. 12 \u00a7. 28 Id. 26 \u00a7.

Preparedness for Extraordinar y Events in Times of Peace Other legislation related to public health cr isis management include s a specific act on how municipalities and county councils should prepar e for extraordinary events during peace time,30 as well as a regulation on emergency pr eparation and heightened preparedness.31 Regarding extraordinary events, each municipality has a re sponsibility to implement a Crisis Management Committee.32 According to the regulation on Em ergency Preparation and Heightened Preparedness, county administrative boards have the overall responsibility for their region's preparedness,33 but all agencies have joint responsi bility to cooperate with each other.34 Each authority is required to continuously monitor the threat le vel and make adjustments to their preparedness levels accordingly.35 The analysis of the thr eat and weakness level should culminate in a \"risk and weakness report\" that is sent to the government and the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.36 C. Responsible National and Local Authorities 1. Responsible National Authorities37 On the national level, public health crisis mana gement is divided between a responsible authority that coordinates with national entities, an expert authority that tracks public health threats and builds a planned response, and loca l authorities that monitor and react to public health threats. 38 The main national actors in public health crisis management ar e the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the National Health and Welf are Agency, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the NBHW. The responsible govern ment department for public health crisis management is the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.39 29 32 \u00a7 L AG OM SKYDD MOT INTERNATIONELLA HOT MOT F\u00d6RH\u00d6JD BEREDSKAP [ACT ON MUNICIPALITIES AND COUNTY COUNCILS MEASURES AHEAD OF AND DURING EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS DURING PEACE TIME AND TIMES OF HEIGHTENED PREPAREDNESS ] (SFS 2006:544). 31 34 Id. 5 \u00a7. 35 Id. 9 \u00a7. 36 Id. 9 para. 2 \u00a7. 37 Note that Sweden underwent a change in government in September of 2014 and that the new government may make changes to the organization of its government agencies responsible for public crises.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 224 The expert authority on public health crises (infectious diseases) is the National Health and Welfare Agency. 40 It is responsible for monitoring global and national developments in communicable diseases, informing the government a nd local health care providers of the current state of threats, and proposing actio ns on how to combat these threats.41 The Public Health Agency of Sweden is also responsible for a ll laboratory testing related to the Communicable Diseases Act.42 The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency is res ponsible for supporting desi gnated agencies with measures and information, and for providing information to the public. 43 Its primary focus is to coordinate efforts and to train personnel in prep aredness for national conti ngencies, as well as to develop better routines for this work.44 The Agency is also responsible for medical research on how to prevent communicable diseases from spreading.45 The NBHW acts with authority from the Ministry of Health and So cial Affairs and is the national coordinating authority on communicable diseas es, whereas the National Health and Welfare Agency is the expert authority. 46 The NBHW or the government may also issue instructions on responding to public health crises.47 In September of 2014 the NBHW issued new (nonbinding) guidelines for how suspected Ebola cases should be treated.48 In addition the NBHW is responsible for reporting pande mic cases to the WHO (IHR).49 On the national level, a special working gr oup, the National Pandemic Group, has been created to focus on pandemic threats. The Group consists of the directors for the NBHW, the National Health and Welfare Agency, the Swedish Work Environment Authorit y, the Medical Products Agency, and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions . It meets at the discretion of the NBHW. 50 40 Ch. 1:7 para. 2 \u00a7 S f\u00f6r samh\u00e4llsskydd och - reviderad version 2014-09-26 [Recommendations for the handling of suspected ebola cases - revised Sept. 26, 2014], http://www.socialstyrelsen. se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/A ttachments/19458/2014-6-7.pdf . information.se/web/Pages/Page____72962.aspx . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 225 2. Responsible Local Authorities: County Councils and County Medical Officers On the local level, public health crises are mana ged by the local health au thorities known as the county councils,51 which are responsible to the municipa lity and county admi nistrative board. Each county council is overseen by a county medical officer (CMO)52 and is responsible for health services in general with in its region. Local health care providers and the CMO are the points of first contact for most public health crises. Although County Councils are normally only responsible for the residents of their own municipality, all C ounty Councils should cooperate among themselves during extraordinary events.53 All county councils must provide for the necessary precautions agains t transmission of disease.54. The county councils must also maintain a contingency plan. The local power to take forc ible measures against individuals to combat a public health crisis is vested in the CMO. The CMO has primary responsibility for the prevention and containm ent of communicable diseases. He or she must \"plan, organize a nd lead the effort and work for efficiency, coordination and consistency.\" 55 This includes ensuring that local residents have access to information on communicable diseases and the response thereto, providing guidelines and support, ensuring that preventative steps are taken to prevent dis eases from spreading, supporting treating physicians, following up on reported illnesses, ensuring that persons who carry a communicable disease get the support and care n eeded, ensuring that measures are taken to prevent the spread of disease, and continuous ly following the local status of communicable diseases in the region.56 CMOs are also required to cooper ate with CMOs from other regions and may transfer cases between themselves.57 D. Specialized Hospitals In addition to national and local authorities that follow and monito r potential contagious threats, Sweden also prescribes by law th at specialized expert ise should be vested in individual public hospitals designated to accept and treat patients from anywhere in Sweden.58 These specialized hospitals are responsible for national expertise in a specific area and are overseen by the NBHW, which grants a hospital the privilege of being a national hospital and issues the conditions that it needs to follow to maintain that status.59 The Board's decisions cannot be appealed.60 51 Ch. 1: \u00a7 , SOCIALSTYRELSEN (last visited Oct. 31, 2014). 59 Id. 9b \u00a7. 60 Id. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 226 Linkoping University Hospital (a public hospital) is the specia lized hospital on infectious diseases with capabilities to care for infecti ous patients in isolation for a prolonged period of time.61 The unit is specifically tailored for high-risk diseases such as Ebola and includes three separate \"treatment rooms.\"62 It also has access to a special ized ambulance as well as airplane transportation.63 Patients suffering from infectious di seases are transferred to Linkoping from other Swedish hospitals and it must be prepared to transport inf ected Swedes from anywhere in the world.64 E. Nordic Cooperation 1. Nordic Public Health Preparedness Agreement Sweden cooperates with other No rdic countries on health care.65 The Nordic Public Health Preparedness Agreement between the Nordic countries signed in Svolv\u00e6r on June 14, 2002, makes treatment in another Nordic country possi ble in cases of nationa l crises when Swedish resources are strained. Likewise, Sweden has an obligation to help its neighbors in their time of need.66 Specifically, the Nordic countries have ag reed to \"provide assi stance to one another upon request\";67 \"promptly inform of measures planned or implemented that impact the cooperation\";68 \"promote cooperation and insofar as possible remove obstacles in national legislation, regulations, a nd other rules of law\";69 \"provide opportunities for the exchange of experience, cooperation, and competence-building\";70 \"promote the development of cooperation in this area\";71 and \"inform one another of relevant changes in the countries' preparedness regulations, including amendments to legislation.\"72 The Nordic Public Health Preparedness 61 For information on the operations of the High Risk Unit, see H\u00f6gisoleringsenheten , LANDSTINGET I \u00d6STERG\u00d6TLAND (Oct. 14, 2014), http://www.lio.se/Om-landstinget/Vard-i-varldsklass/Hogisoleringsenheten/ . 62 Id.

General Nordic Cooperation The Nordic countries also coope rate generally in health care. 74 During a meeting in Reykjavik in 2014, fourteen suggestions for deeper cooperati on on health care issues were presented.75 Sweden has general Nordic c ooperation with its neighbors thr ough Nordred, a cooperative civil protection agency among the Nordic countries.76 Only one infectious patient was treated in another Nordic country during the 2005-2007 period.77 3. Baltic Sea Cooperation A special action group against contagious diseas es was set up at the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) meeting in Kolding, Denmark in 2000. Epidemic surveillance, HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, and antibacterial re sistance, as well as primary care, were recognized as the most central issues to the region.78 II. Powers of Public Health Authorities A. General As mentioned above, national and local authoritie s share responsibilities and powers to act in the face of a public health crisis. The NBHW has th e power to seal off and quarantine certain areas and require that individual travelers arriving from certain areas be quarantined.79 The CMO is responsible for the local response to a public hea lth crisis. As such, the CMO investigates the need for mandatory testing of suspected ill individuals;80 petitions the courts for mandatory testing of suspected ill individuals;81 issues, amends, and reviews care instructions for proven ill individuals;82 and petitions courts for the isol ation of infected individuals.83 In urgent situations, 73 Id. art. 3. 74 See, e.g., Nordic Cooperation Following Dramatic Increase in Tick-borne Infections , UNIVERSITY OF GOTHENBURG 76 For additional information see N ORDRED , http://www.nordred.org (last visited Oct. 31, 2014). 77 NORDEN , PATIENT MOBILITY IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES (June 2011), http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_ Publications/Reports/2011/2011_patientMobility_report.pdf . 78 Prop. 2003/04:30 at ch. \u00a7. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 228 the CMO has the power to place a person in tem porary isolation provided that the CMO notifies the court within four days to review the continued isolation.84 Whereas the NBHW is responsible for designating quarantine areas, the County Medical Officer is responsible for the quarantine of people who are thought to be carri ers of an illness and may demand testing of people arriving from abroad. 85 The CMO can also demand info rmation on a patient from other government and local agents who have come in contact with the patient.86 B. National Mandatory No tification Systems The Communicable Diseases Act requires that certain infec tious diseases be reported.87 Reportable diseases include, for example, ch lamydia, HIV, and during the 2009 pandemic the A(H1N1) (swine flu) influenza. 1. Responsibilities of Medical Personnel A treating physician who comes into contact with an infected individual is required to report the disease to the local CMO as well as to the P ublic Health Agency of Sweden without delay. 88 The provision also applies to pat hologists and laboratory physicians.89 The notification should include: 1. the infected or suspected infected patient 's name, Swedish social security number, or government coordination number as well as address; 2. the likely source of the infection; 3. the likely spread of the disease; 4. any and all measures that the physician has taken to prevent the spread of the disease; and 5. other information that will affect the spread of the disease. 90 \"Other information\" includes whether or not the individual was a blood donor.91 83 Id. ch. 5:2 \u00a7. 87 For full list, see Communicable Diseases Act add. 1 & 2. 88 Ch. http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/sosfs/2007-1 (specifically stating in article 3 that A(H1N1) influenza should be reported by treating physicians and a micro-lab technicians, but that pathologists need not report the illness). 90 Ch. 2:6 \u00a7 S MITTSKYDDSLAGEN . 91 Marie J\u00f6nsson, Act LAGSAMLING MED KOMMENTARER Bergman et eds., 16th ed. 2011/2012). Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 229 2. Mandatory Self-reporting and Information A potentially sick person has the obligation to seek medical care to find out whether or not he or she is a carrier for a contagious dis ease covered by Communicable Diseases Act.92 T h e requirement does not include an obligation to undergo treatment for the disease.93 The patient must, however, inform the doctor of potential sour ces of the disease and indicate whether other individuals may have been infected.94 3. International Captains of ships and airplane s are required to inform Swedis h Customs about any potential disease on board and Swedish Customs in turn is required to inform the County Medical Officer.95 C. Powers of Disease Control Once an illness has been diagnosed the local CMO has the power to put in place certain sanctions.96 These sanctions may not go beyond what is required to contain the disease.97 The treating physician must, in conj unction with the patient, work out a treatment plan for the treatment and containment of the disease.98 If this plan is violated the CMO may intervene.99 1. Issuing Individual Formal In structions to Patients After a patient has been diagnosed with a contagi ous disease the treating physician should create individualized, formal instructions for the patien t to follow to minimize th e risk of spreading the disease.100 The instructions may only in clude the following measures: 1. limits on socialization that pertain to wo rk, education, or participation in other activity, 2. prohibition on donating blood or organs, 3. prohibition on lending or otherwi se transferring used injection devices, 4. duty to inform caretakers and others , who perform nonmedical procedures on the patient, of the disease, 5. duty to inform sexual partners that he/she is carrying the disease, 92 Ch. 3:1 \u00a7 S MITTSKYDDSLAGEN . \u00a7 S MITTSKYDDSLAGEN MOT INTERNATIONELLA HOT MOT 100 Id. 4:2 \u00a7. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 230 6. duty, during sexual contacts, to adopt a behavior that minimizes the risk of spreading the disease, 7. duty to practice special hygienic routines, and 8. duty to keep in regular contact with the treating physician. These instructions shall be communicated in writing as soon as possible as well as be included in the patient's health record. Th e treating physician shall as far as possible make sure that these instructions are followed.101 If the formal instructions are not followed the patie nt may be placed in isolation, if the risk to others requires isolation.102 2. Patient Isolation Patients carrying a contagious disease may be pl aced in isolation for up to three months, which may be extended by six months at a time.103 During the isolation peri od the patient has the right to one hour of outside time per day as well as telephone calls.104 The patient also has the right to visitors, if visits ca n be conducted safely.105 Isolation can only be orde red if there is a violation or risk of violation of the form al instructions or if it is ot herwise the only way to contain the disease.106 There must be a \"considerable ri sk that others may be infected.\"107 The European Court of Human Rights has ordered Sweden to pa y damages to an HIV patient who was isolated for years, stating that there was not sufficient cause to keep him isolated.108 3. Extraordinary Measures Testing of individuals for a diseas e at ports of entry is permissi ble when a person shows signs of illness with a disease that is classified as dangero us to society or when the person is coming from a region of the world known to be suffe ring from certain contagious outbreaks.109 In both cases all passengers arriving on the same mode of transportation must undergo testing.110 However, such tests may not result in depriv ation of liberty, or test-taking or other measures that constitute a physical violation.111 101 Id.

Quarantine of Certain Areas, Harbors, and Airports Specific areas may be designated as quarantine areas.116 The government, or the agency appointed by the government, decides which ports and airports should be deemed \"quarantine ports.\"117 However, the government must work together with the county councils and municipalities in this effort.118 While the government ultimately determines the designation as a quarantine harbor, the county councils and munici palities are responsible for ensuring that the airports and ports in their regions have all th e resources they need, as specified by government instruction.119 The local CMO is responsible for the care of patients and containment of the disease at these harbors.120 Aircraft and vessels may not be turned away but should instead relocate to the designated qua rantine harbor or airport.121 D. Powers of Disease Prevention When the new Communicable Diseases Act was a dopted in 2004 its main goal was to emphasize preventing the spread of diseases that are transmitted from human to human.122 Disease prevention includes vaccination programs as well as educational efforts on how disease is spread. 1. National Vaccination Program and Seasonal Flu Vaccinations Sweden has a comprehensive, voluntary vacci nation program for children, which includes vaccinations against Polio, MMR, DT ap, IPV, HiB, PCV, and HPV,123 and administers free seasonal influenza vaccinations for risk groups as well as a general vaccination program for swine flu.124 Most Swedes are vaccinated against these diseases.125 The NBHW oversees the 112 Prop. 2003/04:158 Extraordin\u00e4ra smittskydds\u00e5tg\u00e4rder 105.

For a vaccine to qualify for placement on the vaccination programs list, it mu st be \"effective, socioeconomically cost effective and sustainable from an ethical and humanitarian ground.\"126 These vaccinations are entered into a \"national vaccination database\" that tracks the vaccination of Swedish children.127 The database may be expanded under the supervisi on and direction of the government to include all vaccinations administered in Sweden.128 The NBHW issues recommendations as to who should get a s easonal flu vaccine and has recommended that all pregnant women in thei r second or third trim ester get vaccinated. 129 Other groups who are recommended to get the seasonal flu vaccines include the elderly and those who have underlying conditions, es pecially respiratory ones.130 2. Mandatory Vaccinations Although vaccinations under the national vaccination program and seasonal flu vaccines are not mandatory, the government may mandate vaccina tion during times of war and/or in other extraordinary circumstances.131 Failure to comply with such mandated vaccination may result in a fine as well as a court-mandated vaccination by force backed by the penalty of a fine, which can be reissued. 132 Until 1991 the fine was limited by st atute to between SEK 5 (US$.68) and SEK 50 (US$6.80) (unchanged since its initial adoption in 1952); following 1991 amendments the amount of the fine is no longer established by law.133 125 Id.

Sanctions for Noncompliance Violations of formal instructions138 required by the Communicable Di seases Act are penalized. A person who intentionally transfer s a disease to another can be puni shed with up to six years in prison.139 The negligent spreading of a disease is punishable with a fine or imprisonment of up to one year when the person realizes the danger of the spread and does not take precautions to stop it.140 When no transmission of a disease occurs, the risk alone (if know n by the perpetrator) is punishable as \"creation of danger to ot hers\" with up to two years imprisonment.141 F. Compensation Patients who receive treatment have no separate right to compensa tion for time spent in isolation, etc., but all health care and all medications are free to the patient and not part of the \"maximum payment protection\" limit, under which health car e is only free following the expenditure of a regulated maximum annual fee that a patient may incur.142 All vaccinations carried out under the Communicable Diseases Act are also free of charge to the patient.143 134 Ch.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 234 G. Conflicts with Constitutional Rights of Individuals Treatments for contagious diseases risk crea ting a conflict between fundamental human rights and health-care measures, as these interventions may limit the patient's freedoms, including both the treatments in themselves and the collection of personal information used to track and prevent further spread. 1. Treatment of Personal Information/Data According to the Swedish Personal Information Ac t, personal information may only be gathered and stored when it is necessary in the practice of preventative car e, to make a medical diagnosis, to care for or treat the patient, or to administer health care. 144 The administrator (i.e., the agency that keeps the record of personal information) is required to keep personal information as safe as possible, considering technology, budget, risk s, and the sensitivity of the information.145 When the registration of personal info rmation violates the Personal In formation Act, the individual recorded is entitled to damages.146 Some decisions on the treatment of personal information are appealable to the administrative court system.147 The Swedish government collects data on Swedis h patients through the vaccination program and also through the sharing of information from the patient's health record when he or she seeks medical treatment. The Act on Public Inform ation and Secrecy prescribes secrecy for such health information. 148 A person who has contracted a contagious diseas e is responsible for co operating in finding the source of the disease as well as containing the sp read of the disease a nd informing his or her health provider of other pot ential victims of the disease. 149 This information is classified, and may not be divulged. However, patient informa tion may be shared, rega rdless of secrecy, in international preventative work.150 Moreover, the CMO may, agains t the wishes of a contagious patient, inform his or her family that he or she is a carrier of a disease in efforts to prevent further spread of the disease.151 Individuals have the right to know what person al information about them is stored and may submit a request for this information at least once a year. 152 144 18 \u00a7 P ERSONUPPGIFTSLAGEN [PUL] [PERSONAL INFORMATION \u00a7 146 48 \u00a7 PUL. 147 51, 52, 53 \u00a7\u00a7 PUL. 148 Ch. 1:6 \u00a7 (for provisions, see chapter 25) O FFENTLIGHETS - OCH SEKRETESSLAG [ACT ON PUBLIC INFORMATION AND \u00a7 PUL. Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 235 2. Quarantine and Isolation Quarantine and isolation are infr ingements on human rights. Isol ation requires prior approval by the courts or in cases of emer gency speedy review by the courts.153 Because Sweden has signed on to the European Convention on Human Rights it is the European Court on Human Rights that establishes the case law on infr ingement of human rights. 3. Case Law: Right to Free dom (Enhorn v. Sweden) Isolation of an individual may result in a vi olation of the patient's fundamental rights under article 5 of the Convention. In Enhorn v. Sweden , the European Court of Human Rights found that placing the plaintiff in isolat ion was a breach of his right to liberty and security of person, as guaranteed in article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.154 The case involved an HIV-infected man who, after several breaches of conduct that violated the action plan prescribed by the local CMO, was placed under forced isolation.155 The European Court of Human Rights found that the isolation violated the plaintiff's human rights b ecause no less invasive method of preventing the spread of the disease had been considered.156 Even before Enhorn , in the legislative history of th e 2003 Communicable Diseases Act the Swedish government wrote that the forced isola tion of an HIV-positive person is less likely to conform with human rights because transmission of the disease requires intimate contact. It remains unclear whether forced isolation due to a more contagious disease that spreads \"by casual contact\" 157 is consistent with human rights as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. III. Transparency of Public Health Crisis Management System: Publication and Information-sharing Requirements A. Dissemination of Inform ation to the Public The government has made available an online plat form, Krisinformation.se, that serves as a central clearinghouse for all crisis information.158 153 See 156 Id. beredskapen 2, 2014), http://www.krisinformation.se/web/Pages/Faq/S howFaqWithLeftMenu____75516.aspx?FaqId=0470029& LangID=SV .

Local Contingency Plans Each county council is required to have a public ly available local cris is preparedness plan,159 and to have an official on duty twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week to respond to a potential crisis.160 C. Transmission of Information Sweden has a nationally coordinated communicati ons system called the \"VMA system\" or the \"important message to the public system\"161 and a specialized radio system to communicate heightened preparedness in times of peace. Increased preparedness is communicated by radio and television.162 The highest level of prep aredness is announced through a preparedness alarm. The preparedness alarm is an alarm indicating increased preparedness that is transmitted on facilities for outdoor alarms th rough thirty-second-long signals w ith a fifteen-second interval between the signals, for a total of five minutes.163 IV. Cooperation with the Worl d Health Organization The National Board of Health and Welfare is re sponsible for cooperation with the World Health Organization.164 Sweden also provides support to local initiatives and has pr ovided resources to fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa of SEK 139 million (about US$18.7 million) this year. V. Current Crisis/Recent Developments Sweden has been spared from recent public health crises. The government-run website Krisinformation.se lists events that qualify as recent national crises.165 Most are environmental (storms) or animal related (such as salmonella in animal fodder) but there are also some public health threats that could have developed into p ublic health crises but did not\u2014specifically the swine-flu outbreak in 2009,166 and the bird-flu outbreak in 20 06. In addition, the current Ebola threat has the potential to devel op into a public h ealth crisis. 159 See, e.g., Krishanteringsplan 163 Id. 24 164 11 \u00a7 L OM SKYDD MOT MOT M\u00c4NNISKORS H\u00c4LSA . 165 KRISINFORMATION .SE, http://www.krisinformation.se (last visited Oct. 31, 2014). 166 As determined by the government-run . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 237 A. Swine Flu, 2009 Sweden was first informed of the threat of A(H1 N1) (swine flu) in the spring of 2009. Initially, vaccination was recommended for ri sk groups, but this quickly changed after a pregnant woman died. When the WHO updated the classification of the A(H1N1) to a pandemic (level six on their scale) the pandemic vaccination program au tomatically came into force, requiring county councils to decide how much vaccine they needed.167 A total of eight million doses were ordered for the entire country.168 The infections peaked in October of 2009, with vaccina tions initiated a week later, resultin g in 11,000 laboratory-ver ified cases of A(H1 N1) for all of 2009.169 T h e primary prevention focus was on the national vaccination campaign.170 In its 2011 evaluation report the NBHW and Swedish Conti ngency Agency noted several problems with the swine flu res ponse. First, it found that langua ge barriers proved to be a greater obstacle than expected in portions of the population without Swedish as a primary language.171 Other problems included di fficulties in following the transmission of the disease despite classifying the pandemi c as a disease that requires a report to a CMO under the Communicable Diseases Act.172 Only the Stockholm County C ouncil had a working, automated system for keeping track of the disease.173 Smaller county councils were especially hard hit in meeting the demands of the increased load of patients.174 Also, determining the distribution priorities of the initial doses of vaccine a nd how the public should be informed of it was difficult.175 Reportedly, the NBHW continues to work with how resources should be distributed during the next pandemic.176 Another issue noted in the eval uation report was the lack of c oordination in th e response, as emergency information was transmitted. Probl ems that occurred included certain county councils running out of vaccines and antiviral me dicine and being unaware of where to order more.177 Long-term effects of the pandemic response included an unexpected ly large number of children diagnosed with narcolepsy following the use of the vaccine Pandemrix.

In total, 60% of Sweden's population was vaccinated.182 Thirty-one Swedes reportedly died from the virus.183 Earlier this year (2014) it was di scovered that a mild variant of the swine flu virus (H1N2) had been transmitted between some fa rmers in Sweden and their pigs, the first time this is known to have occurred in Sweden. 184 B. Bird Flu, 2006 Sweden was mildly affected by the bird flu virus in 2006.185 A number of birds but no humans were infected.186 The outbreak did, however, spur the response and intervention of national and local authorities, and its treatment resulted in a short report by the Swedish Contingency Agency.187 Coordinated government responses include d setting up a public information website, Fagelinfluensa.info, and a round-the-clock telephone service for bird-flu related information and questions.188 Overall, the response was considered successful.189 178 Id. at 12. 179 Chart, Number of Specimens Positi ve for Influenza by Subtype - Sweden , WHO . 180 SOCIALSTYRELSEN , supra note 167, at 93. 181 For an overview in English, see Statement on Narcolepsy and Vaccination , WHO (Apr. 21, 2011), http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/influe nza/pandemic/h1n1_safety_assessing/narcolepsy_statem ent/en/ ; see also Francesca Poli et al., Narcolepsy as an Adverse Event Following Immunization: Case Definition and Guidelines for Data Collection, Analysis and Presentation , ELSEVIER (Dec. 16, 2012), http://www.who.int/ vaccine_safety/initiative/BC_Narcol epsy_case_definition.pdf?ua=1 . 182 SOCIALSTYRELSEN , supra note 167, at 64. 183 Id. at 57. 184 Swedish Farmers Contracted Swine Flu , THELOCAL .SE (Oct. 22, 2014), http://m.thelocal.se/20141022/swedish- f\u00e5gelinfluensa se/web/Pages/Page____55168.aspx . 186 K f\u00e5gelinfluensa i Sverige 2006 , KRISBEREDSKAPSMYNDIGHETEN (now the Contingencies (Dec. 7, 2006), http://www.krisinformation.se/web/Upload/ Krisinformation.se/Handelser/F%c3%a5 gelinfluensan/utbrotten_av_fagelinfluensa_2006.pdf . 188 F\u00e5gelinfluens 2011), http://www.krisinformation. se/web/Pages/Page____ 31992.aspx . 189 Id. at 36.

Current Ebola Threat On October 23, 2014, the government declared Ebola a disease dangerous to society.190 Despite declaring itself ready to handle an Ebola patient, the NBHW the same evening refused to admit an international Ebola patient on grounds that it did not know what was needed of it.191 As of yet no Ebola victim has been confirmed in Sweden. The country is increasing its sp ending and preparations for figh ting the Ebola virus, currently recruiting additional personnel to be sent to Liberia. 192 Sweden is allocating equipment and funding totaling SEK 489 million (about US $66 million) for 2014 to combat Ebola.193 E x t r a funding is also being provided as earmarks to the NBHW budget to help coordinate the effort both locally and abroad.194 Municipalities have raised their preparedness by issuing local guidelines for health care workers encountering Ebola patients at local, non-hospital, health- care facilities.195 The Swedish Armed Forces has reported that it is prepared to fly an Ebola patient from Africa to Sweden within twenty-four hours. 196 The transport would incl ude a custom-made ambulance carried inside a Hercules airplane.197 There is no information on how long it would take to get the aircraft from Sweden to Africa. D. National Preparedness and Eff ectiveness of Routines A governmental study conducted follow ing the bird flu outbreak resu lted in recommendations to improve the cooperation between inpatient care, pr imary care, and municipal care, and to focus more heavily on logistical aspects, plans to secure resources, and preparedness within the individual communicable diseases units. 198 Also, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC's) invest igation in 2007 found that lo cal preparedness could be 190 Press Release, Regeringskansliet, supra note 16.

The Law Library of Congress 241 European Union Theresa Papademetriou Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY The European Union (EU) Member States are mainly individually responsible for responding to public health and other major em ergencies within their borders. The EU's role in the field of public health, as establishe d by the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, is limited to complimenting the national policies of the EU Members, coordinating their actions, and facilitating communication and the exchange of data between the European Commission and the EU Members. The most recent health crises in the EU acted as a catalyst for the Commission to reform the 1998 EU legislation. A new decision, Decision No. 1082/2013, expands the type of serious health threats with cross-border impli cations to also include threats of chemical, environmental, or unknown origin. Events th at may constitute public health emergencies of international concern have been added to the list, in compliance with the 2005 revised WHO International Health Regulations, to which EU Members are bound. The Health Security Committee, which acquired formal status by Decision No. 1082/2013, assists the Commission in coordinating public health crises; it also advises the ministers on health of the EU Members and coordinates their acti ons. In implementing Decision No. 1082/2013, the EU Members have designated national au thorities in charge of epidemiological surveillance, alert notification, and ta king measures to protect public health. The European Centre for Disease Prevention an d Control (ECDC) plays a vital role in the surveillance, identification, assessment, and communication of current and/or emerging threats to human health. The ECDC has assumed operation of the Epidemiological Surveillance Network and the Early Warning and Response System, both of which were established in 1998 to enhance the EU's ability to respond to public health emergencies. I. Introduction The European Union (EU), due to its specific natu re as an area with no internal borders and the free circulation of people and goods, faces special cha llenges in the event of public health crises. Primary responsibility for respondin g to public health emergencies fa lls within the domain of the EU Member States. The EU has legal authority in the field of public health based on article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 1 In general, EU action in the field of public health is intended to complement the national policies of the EU Members and to coordinate and support their actions. In this regard, the Commission plays a vital role, both in coordinating and exchanging information between th e EU Member States and in maintaining the structures and mechanisms that operate at the EU level to address public health crises. 2 I n 1 Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) art. 168, 2012 O.J.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: European Union The Law Library of Congress 242 addition to twenty-eight EU Members, three non-E U Member countries that participate in the EU Single Market, Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway,3 also cooperate with the Commission in matters involving public health. At the EU level, several agencies are engaged in preparedness and response planning to combat serious threats to health. Th e European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 4 which was established in 2005 and was modeled af ter the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,5 plays a pivotal role in the field of co mmunicable diseases and other public health crises. Other agencies involve d at the EU level in clude the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA),6 the European Medicines Agency (EMEA),7 and the European Environment Agency (EEA).8 In addition, the European Commission's Health Security Committee, which was established in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US (9/11 attacks), acquired formal status by new EU legislation and has been give n a specific mandate. The EU has also established two committees to assist the Commission when a scientific opinion is needed: (a) the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, and (b) the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks. 9 3 The European Economic Area (EEC) agreement, which en tered into force in January 1994, permits three of the European Free Trade Associati on (EFTA) countries (Iceland, Norway, and Li echtenstein) to participate in the EU single market.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: European Union The Law Library of Congress 243 Past experience with public health crises in the EU have clearly demonstrated that such crises affect numerous sectors, includ ing health, food safety, environm ent, transport, and national security. Thus, the Commission in 2011 initiated new legislation to address the existing deficiencies in tackling health crises.10 A new decision, Deci sion No. 1082/2013 on Serious Cross-Border Threats to Health, expands the list of sources of danger to health to include not only communicable diseases but al so biological, chemical, and environmental events, or events of unknown origin that may pose a risk to EU citizens.11 At the international level, the Commission is en gaged in promoting and improving collaborations on global public health issues by pa rticipating in the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI), an international partnership launched in 2001 by th e Commission, G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and Mexico. 12 Moreover, the Commission, the ECDC and other agencies ha ve established solid cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) through its regional office in Europe (WHO/Europe).13 II. Recent Legislation on Se rious Public Health Crises Article 2 of Decision No. 1082/2013/EU on Serious Cr oss-Border Threats to Health, issued in 2013, recognizes the following categories of serious cross-border threats to health, which may trigger public health measures: (a) threats of a biological origin, consisting of: (i) communicable diseases; (ii) antimicrobial resistance and health care-associated related to communicable diseases . . .; (iii) biotoxins or the other harmful biol ogical agents not related to communicable diseases; (b) threats of chemical origin; (c) threats of environmental origin; (d) threats of unknown origin; (e) events which may constitute public hea lth emergencies of international concern under the IHR, provided that they fall under one of the categories of threats set out in points (a) to (d). 14 10 Press Release, European Commi ssion, Q&A: Health Security in the EU (Dec. 8, 2011), http://europa.eu/ rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-884_en.htm . 11 Decision No. 1082/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 on Serious Cross- border Threats to Health and Repealing Decision No. 2119/98/EC, 2013 O.J.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: European Union The Law Library of Congress 244 In exceptional emergency situations, an EU Member State or the Commission may request response coordination within the Health Security Committee for serious cross-border threats to health other than the ones provided above.15 Decision No. 1082/2013 introduced the possibili ty of joint procurement of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, which could be done through a Joint Procurement Agreement between the EU institutions and those EU Members who wish to participate. 16 EU Members have the right to maintain or introduce additional measures and procedures to tackle serious threats to health due to biological, chemical, e nvironmental, or unknown origin within their borders. 17 In compliance with Decision No. 1082/2013, EU Members have designated the appropriate competent authorities responsible for epidemiological surveillance,for alert notifications, and for taking the necessary measures to protect public health in times of crisis.18 The Commission has prepared a template for the national authorities to be used to provide information on preparedness and respons e planning regarding cr oss-border threats to health.19 III. Overview of Systems Responsible for Crises Management at the EU Level The various health crises that the EU has encountered thus far, such as mad cow disease, the SARS and flu epidemics, and the ash cloud caused by the eruption of a volcano in Iceland, have demonstrated the need for cross- sector preparedness, monitoring, a nd response in or der to tackle such crises effectively. Theref ore, beginning in 1998, the EU established the following critical organizations and systems with the objective of enhancing its own ability and that of its Members to respond to public health emergencies more efficiently. A. Epidemiological Surveillance Network Decision No. 1082/2013 exte nded the scope of the network for the epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases that was initially es tablished in 1998 to include all the additional sources of threats to public health c ontained in article 2 (quoted above).20 This network is operated and coordinated through th e ECDC. The national authoriti es are required to send all authorities connected through th e network certain data, includi ng comparable and compatible data related to the communicable diseases and other threats to publ ic health contained in article 15 Id. art. 2, para. 4. 16 Id. art. 5. 17 Id. art. 2, para. 6. 18 Id. art. 15, para. 1(a) & (b). 19 Commission Implementing Decision 2014/504/EU of 25 July 2014 Implementing Decision No. 1082/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with Regard to the Template for Providing the Information on Preparedness and Response Planning in Relation to Serious Cross-border Threats to Health (Notified Under Document C(2014) 5180) Text with EEA Relevance, 2014 O.J.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: European Union The Law Library of Congress 245 2; updates on the development of epidemic situ ations; and information on unusual epidemics or new communicable diseases of unknown origin, including those that occur outside the EU.21 B. Early Warning and Response System At the EU level, an Early Warning and Respons e System (EWRS) was established in 1998, to be used to notify alerts relating to serious cross-border threats to health.22 Based on this system, the Commission and the national authorities are constantly communicating regarding alerts, assessing public health risks, and deciding on appropriate measures.23 Alert notifications are sent either by the Comm ission or the national au thorities to the EWRS when a serious cross-border threat is unusual or unexpected for the specific place where it originated and has the potential to lead to si gnificant morbidity and mortality in humans (or grows larger), affects more than one Member State, and may re quire a coordinated response at the Union level. 24 C. European Centre for Diseas e Prevention and Control The ECDC is an independent ag ency, located in Stockholm, Swed en, whose chief mission is to \"identify, assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health from communicable diseases.\"25 Specifically, the ECDC has the following tasks: Search for, collect, and disseminate scientific and technical data; Provide scientific opinions and scie ntific and techni cal assistance; Provide information promptly to the Commi ssion, Member States, a nd Community agencies as well as international organizations involved in public health issues; Coordinate the actions of the EU networks deal ing with public health issues together with those networks or contact poi nts designated by the national authorities, the so-called \"dedicated surveillance networks;\" and Exchange information and expertise, and fac ilitate the implementation of joint actions.26 Since it began its functions in 2005, the ECDC ha s assumed responsibility for the operation of the Epidemiological Surveillance Network at the Union level and the EWRS, both of which were established in 1998.27 Since ECDC was established, EU Me mbers have been required to forward to the ECDC any information sent through the EW RS, provide the ECDC w ith timely scientific 21 Id. art. 6, para. 3. 22 Id. art. 8, para. 1. 23 Id. 24 Id. art. 9, para. 1(a)-(c). 25 Regulation (EC) No. 851/2004, supra note 5, art. 3, para. 1. 26 Id. art. 3, para. 2. 27 Decision No. 1082/2013, supra note 11, art 17, para. 1.

Health Security Committee Decision No. 1082/2013 granted formal status to the Health Security Committee (HSC), which was first established as an inform al forum of discussion of public threats in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.29 The HSC is composed of representatives of the EU Members through their designated person and is chaired by a person appointed by the Commission.30 The HSC is tasked with (a) supporting the exchange of information between the Commission and the EU Members on practices regarding implementation of Deci sion No. 1082/2013; and (b) coordinating jointly with the Commission preparedness and response planning, as put together by the EU Members.31 IV. Privacy Concerns Since public health crises often involve the handling and processing of personal data of individuals, EU Members and the Commission are re quired to comply with EU legislation on the protection of privacy and pe rsonal data, as provided for in Directive 95/46/EC,32 which has been implemented by the EU Members, and Regul ation (EC) No. 45/2001 on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to th e Processing of Personal Data by the Community Institutions and Bodies and on the Free Movement of Such Data.33 In compliance with the EU legisl ation, which requires that persona l data must be collected only for a specific purpose and must be eliminated afterwards, Decision No. 1082/2013 provides that the EWRS system must include a \"selective mess aging functionality\" under which personal data of individuals must be communicated only to national competent authorities responsible for tracing measures. 34 The national authorities will forwar d such data only to the other EU Members that are involved in the contact tracing measures.35 28 Regulation (EC) No. 851/2004, supra note 5, art. 4. 29 Decision No. 1082/2013, supra note 11, art. 17, para. 1. 30 Id. art. 17, para. 3. 31 Id. art. 17, para. 2. 32 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data, 1995 O.J.

Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: European Union The Law Library of Congress 247 Any messages that contain personal data can be kept for twelve months and after that period must be automatically erased from the EWRS selective messaging functionality.36 Decision No. 1082/2013 deems the national competent authorities in charge of preparedness and monitoring public health care crises and the Commission as \"controllers\" as define d by EU legislation on privacy. Controllers are either natural or legal persons or public authorities that determine the purposes and means for processing personal data.37 Therefore, they are required to take technical and organizational measures to protect personal da ta against unauthorized access, accidental loss, or illegal destruction.38 V. WHO International Heal th Regulations and the EU The collaboration of the EU an d the World Health Organizati on (WHO) is based on article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which requires the EU and Member States to foster cooperation with international organizations competent in the field of public health.39 T h e Commission and the WHO cooperate by exchangi ng information and sharing experience in assessing health risks, strengthening comm unicable disease surveillance and improving responses, and developing tools for health monitoring.40 The ECDC also collaborates closely with the WHO.41 In 2005, the WHO revised its Interna tional Health Regulations (IHR). 42 The IHR, as an international legal instrument, is legally binding on all states parties, in cluding the twenty-eight EU Members. The revised IHR introduced th e concept of public h ealth emergencies of international concern in order to cover existing, new, and old di seases, including health crises due to noninfectious diseases . It entered into force on June 15, 2007, and requires WHO members to implement the regulations gradually by 2016. The EU itself is not a WHO member, and therefore is not a party to th e IHR. However, article 57(3) of the IHR recognizes the role of the EU as a \"regional economic in tegration organization\" and states that, \"[w]ithout prejudice to their obligations under these Regula tions, States Parties that are members of a regional economic integration organization shall apply in their mutu al relations the common rules in force in that regional economic integr ation organization.\"43 36 Id. art. 16, para. 4. 37 Directive 95/46/EC, supra note 32, art. 2(d). 38 Id. art. 16, para. 1. 39 TFEU, supra note 1, art. 168, para. 3. 40 In 2001, the European Commission and the WHO signed a Memorandum of Understanding to further develop and reinforce their mutual cooperation, an d the WHO has also established an office in Brussels.

If a health emergency, such as pand emic influenza, erupts outside of the EU, the WHO is the organization that identifies the leve l of emergency and prepar edness. The European Commission also has the authority to recognize a pandemic independently of the WHO, based on Decision No. 1082/2013, elaborated above. 45 VI. Ebola Outbreak The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa , like the recent polio outbreak in the EU,46 set in motion the agencies and networks involved in handling such crises, even though, according to EU estimates, the risk of Ebola for EU citizens was low.47 The European Commission is closely working with the EU Member States within the Health Security Committee to keep them informed about the latest developments and to coordinate approaches on prevention and preparation for Ebola. The Commission's Health and Consumers Directorate-General has been closely monitoring the event in cooperation with the ECDC and the WHO since March 2014, when news of the outbreak first appeared. The ECDC is producing risk assessments, epidemiological updates, and other information. The risk of importa tion to the EU is considered very low, in particular if returning travelers an d health care providers are properly informed and are aware of the risk. 48 Only a few EU health care workers ha ve been infected and have returned to the EU for medical care.49 The European Food Safety Agency played an ac tive role in monitoring the Ebola epidemics due to reports of a potential link between Ebola virus found in bushm eat, coming from wild animals native to African forests, and possible transmi ssion to humans. The EFSA experts concluded that the risk from bushmeat consumption and po ssible infection with E bola virus is low. Meanwhile, however, the EU has prohibited the import of bushmeat into the EU. 50 44 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council, on the International Health Regulations , COM (2006) 552 final (Sept. 26, 2006), http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_international/ documents / comm_ihr_552_2006_en.pdf . 45 Decision No. 1082/2003, supra note 11, art. 12. 46 See ECDC, TECHNICAL REPORT , DETECTION AND CONTROL OF POLIOVIRUS TRANSMISSION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (Feb. 2014), http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/polio- detection-control-EU.pdf . 47 Press Release, European Commission, Memo, The EU's Response to Help Fight the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (Sept. 5, 2014), http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-520_en.htm . 48 Outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in Western Africa , EUROPEAN COMMISSION , DIRECTORATE -GENERAL FOR HEALTH AND CONSUMERS (Oct. 28, 2014; updated Nov. 12, 2014), http://ec.europa.eu/health/ebola/index_en.htm . 49 Id. 50 EFSA Assesses the Risk of Transmission of Ebola Through Bushmeat , EUROPEAN FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY (Nov. 4, 2014), http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/1 41104a.htm?utm_source=feed&utm_medium= rss&utm_campaign=comb . Legal Responses to Health Emergencies: European Union The Law Library of Congress 249 From the outset of the Ebola crisis, the Europ ean Commission has been active with humanitarian aid, expertise, and international coordination. In addition, diplomatic outreach is being done via the Delegations of the EU and other channels in order to facilitate the humanitarian response in the countries concerned and to se nsitize governments not to overreact to the crisis with regard to travel restrictions, tr ade impediments, etc. As early as March 2014 the European Commis sion gave \u20ac1.9 million (about US$2.4 million) to help contain the Ebola epidemics and to ensu re immediate health care for the affected populations. Since then, the Commission has boosted its humanitarian assistance on two occasions, bringing it to a current total of \u20ac11.9 million (about US$14.84 million). 51 On September 5, 2014, the European Commissi on announced \u20ac140 million of funding (about US$175 million) for the countries affected by the Ebola virus in West Africa: Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria.52 51 Press Release, European Commission, supra note 47. 52 Id. The Law Library of Congress 250 World Health Organization Wendy Zeldin Senior Legal Research Analyst* SUMMARY A global approach to addressing health issues and emergencies is provided by the United Nation's World Health Organization (WHO), which was established in 1946. The WHO has a Constitution and issues International Health Regulations (IHR). Its membership is open to all Members of the United Nations and Associate Members. The WHO's objective is the attainment by all peoples of the highest level of health. Following a severe acute respiratory syndrom e (SARS) pandemic in 2003, the WHO and its Member States updated the WHO mech anisms for preventing and controlling pandemics. In 2005, the WHO commenced a Pandemic Preparedness Program that requires the Member States to create national pr eparedness plans. Also in 2005, the World Health Assembly agreed on new IHR that create an international pandemic risk management system by requiring the Member States to report on an expanded list of diseases and public emergencies, to control th e entry and exit of travelers and goods, and to take other precautionary measures in accordance with WHO recommendations. The system was put to the test in the A(H1N1) viru s influenza that emerged in Mexico in April 2009 and quickly reached global dimensions. Since that time, the WHO has instituted the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework to improve preparedness for and response to pandemic influenza and has re placed the 2009 guidance with the 2013 Pandemic Influenza Risk Manage ment WHO Interim Guidance. I. Structure of the World Health Organization The World Health Organization (WHO), establishe d on July 22, 1946, is an ag ency of the United Nations (UN) responsible for handling global health issues.1 Any Member State of the UN may become a WHO member by accepting its Constitution.2 Territories may be admitted to the WHO as Associate Members if an application is made on their behalf by the Member State or * Most of this report was originally prepared by George E. Glos, former Special Gr oup Leader, July 2003; it was supplemented in 2009 by Edith Palmer, former Senior Foreign Law Specialist, and was again updated for the purposes of the present report. 1 World Health Organization (WHO), Su mmary Report on Proceedings Minutes and Final Acts of the International Health Conference Held in New York from 19 June to 22 July 22 1946, Official R ecords of the World Health Organization No. 2, 9 U.N.T.S. 3 (June 1948), http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85573/1/Official_record2_ eng.pdf?ua=1 . 2 CONSTITUTION OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION , http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/constitution- en.pdf?ua=1 (last visited Oct. 29, 2014).

World Health Assembly The World Health Assembly (WHA), the WH O's supreme decision-making body, is composed of delegates representing the Member States.6 The WHA meets in a regular annual session and special sessions, as necessary.7 The WHA is responsible for the WHO's policy-making programs and budget. The WHA has the authority to adopt regulations concerni ng sanitary and quarantine requirements and other procedures designed to pr event the international spread of disease; nomenclatures for disease, causes of death, and public health practices; standards for international diagnostic procedur es; standards for the safety, pur ity, and potency of biological, pharmaceutical, and similar products moving in inte rnational commerce; a nd the advertising and labeling of biological, pharmaceutical, and sim ilar products moving in international commerce. 8 Regulations come into force for all Members af ter due notice of their adoption has been given, except for such Members that have notified th e Director-General of their rejection or reservations within the pe riod stated in the notice.9 The WHA also has the authority to make recomm endations to Members on any matter within the competence of the WHO. 10 B. Executive Board The Executive Board is the executive organ of the WHA.11 It is composed of thirty-four health experts designated by, but not representing, their governments.12 The Executive Board forwards 3 Countries , WHO, http://www.who.int/countries/en/ (last visited Oct. 30, 2014). 4 Id. 5 For additional information, see About WHO , http://www.who.int/about/en (last visited Oct. 28, 2014), and Governance , WHO, http:www.who.int/governance/en (last visited Oct. 28, 2014).

It is also empowered to take emergency measures in case of epidemics or disasters.14 C. Secretariat The Secretariat comprises the Director-General and roughly eight thousa nd other technical and administrative staff.15 The Director-General appoints the staff of the Secretariat,16 and prepares and submits to the Executive Board the fina ncial statements and budget estimates of the organization.17 D. Regional Offices The WHO has six geographical regions: Africa, the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific.18 Each has its own organiza tion consisting of a regional committee representing the Member States and A ssociate Members in the region concerned, and a regional office staffed by expert s in various fields of health.19 II. WHO Departments The WHO departments most directly concerne d with responding to health emergencies, including infectious disease epidemics or pandemics, are described below. The Health Security and Envi ronment (HSE) Department works within the WHO and with partners and countries to streng then national and global capacitie s necessary for detecting, being prepared for, preventing, and responding to hea lth security risks and emergencies; to enhance national and global readiness for health security emergencies; and \"to provide global leadership and guidance when major infectious disease out breaks and other health security emergencies occur.\" 20 The HSE's strategic priorities for 2014 -2017 include mounting an effective response to any major new epidemic, pandemic, or food-rela ted health security risk; attaining the core capacities set forth in the Intern ational Health Regulations (IHR ) by all countries; developing \"a global strategic plan for antimicr obial drug resistance with clearly defined roles for all major sectors and WHO and implementing the key roles for WHO\"; implementing the Codex Alimentarius and the Pandemic Influenza Pr eparedness (PIP) Framework; and adopting \"a 13 Id. arts. 26 & 28. 14 Id. art. 28; see also WHO, Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board of the World Health Organization as at April 2014, http://www.who.int/governance/EB_rul es_of_procedure_rev2014-en.pdf?ua=1 . 15 WHO C ONSTITUTION art. 30; Governance , supra note 5. 16 WHO C ONSTITUTION art. 35. 17 Id. art. 34. 18 Regional Offices , WHO, http://www.who.int/about/structure/en/ (last visited Oct. 30, 2014). 19 WHO C ONSTITUTION arts. 45-47. 20 Health Security (HSE) , WHO, http://www.who.int/about/structure/organigram/hse/en/ (last visited Nov. 5, 2014).

Areas of Priority The WHO has six main priorities for providing leadership. Th ese include universal health coverage; health-related Mille nnium Development Goals; nonco mmunicable diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and mental health di sorders; social, economic, and environmental determinants; access to medical products; and the International Heal th Regulations (2005).32 IV. International Heal th Regulations (2005) The International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR),33 which the 194 WHO Member States have agreed to implement, were adopted by the W HA under the authority of the WHO Constitution, which gives the WHA the power to adopt regulat ions \"designed to prevent the international spread of disease,\" and that th ereupon \"enter into force for all WHO Member States that do not affirmatively opt out of them within a specified time period.\"34 The IHR are a binding instrument of law devel oped in response to the exponential \"growth in international travel and trade, and the emergence or re-emergence of international disease threats 28 Id. 29 Id. 30 Id. 31 Id. 32 Leadership Priorities, WHO (undated), http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/WHO_GPW12_ leadership_priorities.pdf?ua=1 (last visited Oct. 29, 2014); Danielle Renwick & Toni Johnson, The World Health Organization (WHO) , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS , http://www.cfr.org/public-health-threats-and- pandemics/world-health-organization-/p20003 (last updated Oct. 7, 2014). 33 WHO, International Health Regulations of 1969, amended in 1973 and 1981, http://whqlibdoc.who.int/ publications/1983/9241580070.pdf?ua=1 ; WHO, International Health Regulations (2d ed. 2005) (in force on June 15, 2007), http://www.who.int/ihr/pub lications/9789241596664/en/ ; see also Alert, Response, and Capacity Building Under the International Health Regulations (IHR) , WHO, http://www.who.int/ csr/ihr/current/en/ (last visited Oct. 15, 2014). 34 WHO, Foreword to International Health Regulations (2005), supra note 33, at 1; see also WHO C ONSTITUTION arts. 21(a) & 22.

In addition, they provide for a series of health documents, such as ship sanitation certificates and an in ternational certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis for travelers.37 V. Monitoring and Alert Systems The WHO has a monitoring and response system for influenza that, since the adoption of the PIP Framework in May 2011 (described in Part VI(A), below) has been called the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). (This system was formerly known as the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (G ISN), which dates back to 1952.)38 The system operates through a network of National Influenza Centres, \"national institutions designated by national Ministries of Health and recognized by WHO.\"39 The GISRS keeps track of the evolution of influenza viruses and offers recommendations on such matters as \"l aboratory diagnostics, vaccines, antiviral susceptibility and risk assessment,\" and \"al so serves as a global alert mechanism for the emergence of influe nza viruses with pandemic potential.\"40 In 1997, the WHO established an Outbreak Verifi cation System to gather information, verify reports of, and track inf ectious disease outbreaks.41 In addition, the WHO regularly distributes to certain public health officials and scientists an Outbreak Ve rification List as a means of following up on reports of vari ous outbreaks of disease.42 In 2000, the WHO established the Global Outbr eak Alert and Respon se Network (GOARN), which is a network of surveillance systems that \"includes a number of formal and informal 35 International Health Regulations (2d ed. 2005), supra note 33. 36 Id. 37 Id. 38 Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) , WHO, http://www.who.int/influenza/ gisrs_laboratory/en/ (last visited Oct. 29, 2014); T HE GLOBAL INFORMATION SURVEILLANCE NETWORK , WHO (undated), available at http://www.paho.org/hq/images/stori es/AD/HSD/CD/INFLUENZA/gisn.pdf (last visited Oct. 29, 2014). 39 National Influenza Centres , WHO, http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/national_ influenza_centres/en/ (last visited Oct. 29, 2014). 40 GLOBAL INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE SYSTEM (GISRS), supra note 38. 41 Thomas W.

Outbreaks and Responses A. Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan At the Fifty-sixth Annual Meet ing of the World Health Asse mbly in Geneva on May 28, 2003, the WHO adopted two resolutions concerning SARS and infectious diseases control. Member states were urged to take action to enhance, support, and strengthen national, regional, and international efforts to address the SARS outbreak. The Director-G eneral was requested to take measures falling within the infectious diseases group and take into account reports from sources other than official notification; to alert the in ternational community to the presence of a public threat that may constitute a serious threat to neighboring countries or to internati onal health; and to collaborate with national authorities in assessi ng the severity of the threat and the adequacy of control measures, and, when necessary, in cond ucting on-the-spot studies by a WHO team, with the purpose of ensuring that appropriate co ntrol measures were being employed. The first global conference on SARS, held June 18-19, 2003, in Kuala Lu mpur, Malaysia, was convened by the WHO to provide technical gu idance for the ongoing and long-term response to SARS. At the time, an adequate point-of-care diagnostic test wa s still not available for SARS and remained a top priority. 49 Even now, although research is being done to develop laboratory 43 Id. 44 Event Verification , WHO, http://www.who.int/csr/alertresponse/verification/en/ (last visited Oct. 28, 2014).

In 2005, the WHO commenced a Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan that required the Member St ates to devise a national pandemic plan and submit it to the WHO. This plan was last revised in 2009 51 and contains the WHO phases of pandemic alert.52 They progress from level 1, characterized by animal infections and only a few human infections, to levels 5 a nd 6, characterized by widespread hum an infection that, in level 6, reaches global proportions.53 The system was put to the test in the A(H1N1) influenza virus that emerged in Mexico in April 2009 and quickly reached global dimensions.54 On May 24, 2011, the WHA adopted the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework. 55 The stated objective of the PIP Framework is to improve pandemic influenza preparedness and response, and strengthen the protection against the pandemic influenza by im proving and strengthening the WHO global influenza surveillance and response system (\"W HO GISRS\"), with the objective of a fair, transparent, equitable, efficient, eff ective system for, on an equal footing: (i) the sharing of H5N1 and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential; and (ii) access to vaccines and sharing of other benefits. 56 50 Clinical Guidance on the Identifica tion and Evaluation of Possible SARS-CoV Disease among Persons Presenting with Community-Acquired Illness (Version 2) (last updated July 7, 2012), http://www.cdc.gov/sars/clinical/ guidance.html ; see also James McIntosh, What Is SARS?

Legal Responses to Health Emergenc ies: World Health Organization The Law Library of Congress 258 The PIP Framework applies to influenza viruses with human pandemic potential, such as H5N1; it does not apply to seasonal flu vi ruses, noninfluenza pat hogens, or other biol ogical material that may be contained in clinical speci mens shared under the Framework.57 In 2013, the Pandemic Influenza Risk Management WHO Interim Guidance replaced the 2009 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response guidance document. 58 Key features of the new guidance include the following: Focus upon risk assessment at national level to guide national level actions Revised approach to global phases Flexibility through uncoupling of national actions from global phases Inclusion of principles of emergency risk management for health New and updated annexes on planning assumpti ons, ethical considerations, whole-of- society approach, business continuity pla nning, representative parameters for core severity indicators, and containment measures.59 As a result of lessons learned from the infl uenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic, the 2013 Guidance revises WHO's approach to global phases of pandemic events.60 The phases include the interpandemic phase (the period between influen za pandemics); the alert phase (when influenza caused by a new subtype has been identified in humans); the pandemic phase (the period of global spread); and the transition phase (the de-escalation phase). 61 These global phases are to be used to describe a new influenza subtype's spread, \"taking account of the disease it causes, around the world,\" and are \"clearly uncoupled from risk management deci sions and actions at the country level.\"62 The Guidance points out that \"[t]he global phases and their application in risk management are distinct from (1) the determination of a PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern] under the IHR (2005) and (2 ) the declaration of a pandemic.\" 63 The WHO Director- General is responsible for determining a PHEIC, under article 12 of the IHR; that determination leads to the communication of temporary recommendations.64 The Director-General may also declare a pandemic \"during the period of spread of human influenza caused by a new subtype, and appropriate to the situation.\"65 57 Id. at 7. 58 PANDEMIC INFLUENZA RISK MANAGEMENT : WHO INTERIM GUIDANCE (June 10, 2013), http://www.who.int/ influenza/preparedness/pandemic /influenza_risk_management/en/ . 59 Id. 60 Id. at 2. 61 Id. at 7. 62 Id. at 2. 63 Id. at 7. 64 Id. 65 Id. Legal Responses to Health Emergenc ies: World Health Organization The Law Library of Congress 259 The Guidance is based on \"all-hazards emergency risk management for health\" (ERMH) principles, \"thereby aligning pandemic risk manage ment with the strategic approach adopted by WHO, in accordance with World Health As sembly resolution 64.10,\" to strengthen national health emergency and disast er management capabilities.66 The Resolution, among other measures, urges Member States to (1) stre ngthen health emergency and disaster risk- management programs as part of their nationa l and subnational health systems, supported by related legislation and its effective enforcement; (2) integrate such progra ms (including disaster risk reduction) into national or subnational health plans and \"institutionalize capacities for coordinated health and multisectoral action to asse ss risks, proactively reduce risks, and prepare for, respond to, and recover from, emergencies, disasters and other crises; and (3) develop programs \"on safe and prepared hospitals that ensu re: that new hospitals and health facilities are located and built safely so as to withstand local hazards; that th e safety of existing facilities is assessed and remedial action is ta ken; and that all health facili ties are prepared to respond to internal and external emergencies.\"67 B. Recent Developments and Concerns In 2013, humans were found for the first time to ha ve been infected with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. Since providing the first notifica tion of such an infection in late March 2013, China has been reporting to the WHO on cases of subsequent human infection with the virus.68 The virus is a subgroup of H7 viruses, normally found among birds. Previous reports of human infections with other H7 s ubgroups (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) have come from Australia, Canada, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, th e United Kingdom, and the United States.69 On October 22, 2014, the WHO Emergency Co mmittee, convened by the WHO Director- General under the IHR, held its third meeting on th e Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, in advance of the thre e-month date of expiration of te mporary recommendations the WHO had issued on August 8, 2014, and their extension on September 22.70 The meeting was held because of the increase in the number of cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and the incidence of new cases in Spain and the United States.71 As of the date of the meeting, the number of total cases stood at 9,936, with 4,877 deat hs, and \"[c]ases continue to increase exponentially in 66 Id. at 3. A PHEIC is defined under the IHR as \"an extrao rdinary event which is determined, as provided in these Regulations: (i) to constitute a public health risk to other St ates through the international spread of disease and (ii) to potentially require a coordinated international response.\" IHR art. 1(1). Article 12 of the IHR pertains to determining PHEICs. 67 Strengthening National Health Emergency and Disast er Management Capacities and Resilience of Health Systems, WHA64.10 (May 24, 2011), at 2-3, http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA64/A64_R10-en.pdf . 68 WHO, B ACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF HUMAN INFECTION WITH AVIAN INFLUENZA A(H7N9) VIRUS - AS OF 31 JANUARY 2014, at 1, http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/20140131_background_and_summary_ H7N9_v1.pdf?ua=1 . 69 Id. 70 Press Release, WHO, Statement on the 3rd Meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (Oct. 23, 2014), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news /statements/2014/ebola-3rd-ihr- meeting/en/ . 71 Id.

WHO, UN part ners, and the international community have scaled up their support in these three countries.\"73 At the same time, the Committee noted that the Ebola outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal ha d been declared over as of October 20 and 17, respectively. On October 23, 2014, the WHO convened a meeti ng of high-ranking government representatives from countries affected by the Ebola virus alon g with representatives from their development partners, civil society, regulat ory agencies, vaccine manufactur ers, and funding agencies \"to discuss and agree on how to fast-track testing and deployment of vaccines in sufficient numbers to impact the Ebola epidemic.\"74 The government representatives included officials from the ministries of health and of foreign affairs fr om Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, Guinea, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.75 The meeting reached consensus on a number of key commitments\u2014namely, (1) results from phase 1 clinical trials of most advanced vaccines are expected to be ava ilable in December 2014, and efficacy trials are to begin in the affected countries during this timeframe; (2) phar maceutical companies developing the vaccines will increase production capacity so th at millions of doses will be available in 2015, and regulatory authorities in the countries wher e the vaccines are manufactured and in Africa will support this goal by working under very short deadlines; and (3) community engagement \"should be scaled up urgently in partnership between local communities, national governments, NGOs and international organizations.\"76 At the same time, The New York Times reported that \"WHO has been badly weakened by budget cuts in recent years, hobbling its ability to res pond in parts of the world that need it most. Its outbreak and emergency response units have been slashed, vete rans who led previous fights against Ebola and other diseases have left, and scores of positions have been eliminated. . . .\"77 The unit specializing in pandemic and epidemic diseases now \"has only 52 regular employees,\" although the number can be increased during out breaks, and the WHO's regional emergency outbreak experts, who were experienced in fighting Ebola, \"wer e cut from more than a dozen to three.\"78 Moreover, a separate WHO section that handles emergency response \"was whittled 'to the bone' during the budge t cuts\u2014to 34 staff members from about 94.\"79 A s a r e s u l t , D r . 72 Id. 73 Id. 74 Press Release, WHO, WHO Convenes Industry Leaders an d Key Partners to Discuss Trials and Production of Ebola Vaccine (Oct. 24, 2014), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/rele ases/2014/ebola-vaccines-production/en/ . 75 Id. 76 Id. 77 Sheri Fink, Cuts at WHO Hurt Response to Ebola Crisis , NY TIMES (Sept. 3, 2014), http://www.nytimes.com/ 2014/09/04/world/africa/cu ts-at-who-hurt-response-t o-ebola-crisis.html?_r=1 . 78 Id. 79 Id.
