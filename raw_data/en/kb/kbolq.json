Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) has also long been used to support the liver. The main bioactive compound in milk thistle, known as [silymarin](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/metagenics-silymarin-80/), has been shown in numerous studies to enhance liver function, protect from\u2014and even [reverse\u2014liver damage](https://centrespringmd.com/how-to-prevent-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-with-functional-medicine/), and support overall detox pathways in the liver (3). Liposomal glutathione. The most powerful antioxidant in the human body, glutathione promotes the removal of toxins and helps the body regulate oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Due to the body's poor absorption of glutathione orally, [liposomal glutathione](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/liposomal-glutathione/) undergoes a special process to encapsulate the glutathione molecule inside of a lipid. Doing this dramatically enhances absorption, resulting in benefits in as little as a week of use (4). N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) [recharges glutathione](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/metagenics-glutaclear/) and is one of the antioxidant's main precursors. It is important for phase II liver detoxification, helping to neutralize and package up toxins for excretion that were created in phase I. NAC may even help prevent side effects from environmental toxins, such as exposure to heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, lead and arsenic (5).

Signs you could benefit from a digestive system detox: - Constipation or loose stools - Frequent sugar cravings - Brain fog or trouble concentrating, especially after meals - Hormone imbalance - Frequent indigestion - Skin irritation, eczema - Autoimmune flares Your gut works with the gallbladder, liver, and intestines to detox, but if not functioning optimally, harmful toxins get stuck in a pattern of \"recirculation\". To avoid recirculation and prepare toxins like heavy metals for excretion, we can use what are called \"binders\". Toxins should first be processed by the liver, \"bound\" in the intestines, and then passed with our stool. But if they're not, they're reabsorbed into the liver, and this places immense stress on the body. Binders include fulvic or humic minerals, activated charcoal, or [certain clay powders. ](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/bio-botanical-g-i-detox/) Support digestive detox with: - Addressing underlying digestive issues like sensitivity to gluten or dairy, leaky gut, or intestinal inflammation - Detox binders, like [certain clays](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/bio-botanical-g-i-detox/), to absorb toxins along the digestive tract - Fiber to add bulk to stool and encourage bowel regularity - Prebiotic fiber and probiotic bacteria to [balance gut health](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/eastwest-belly-fix/?attribute_amount=1+Bottle) in the long term Liver detox Your liver is a detox powerhouse. It's the largest internal organ, and is responsible for filtering toxins, fats, proteins, blood, and more. Detoxification in our liver happens in a two-stage process\u2014Phase 1 and Phase 2\u2014and each phase has different requirements (6,7). To support phase one: - Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, etc.) - Green tea - Milk thistle - Rosemary - Garlic - Astaxanthin - [Turmeric](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/gaia-herbs-turmeric-supreme-extra-strength/) - Dandelion root - N-Acetyl phase two: - Milk thistle - Turmeric - Essential Amino Acids such as glycine, glutamine, cysteine, Read: [The Nutrition Supplement Guide: Benefits, Dosages, and Facts](https://centrespringmd.com/the-nutrition-supplement-guide-health-benefits-dosages-and-facts/) There are many enzymes and specific cofactors necessary for optimizing liver detoxification.

It works by improving circulation of the lymphatic system and can help mobilize toxins from cells so that they can be eliminated. Lymphatic massage is a gentle form of massage that helps your body move lymph fluid more effectively, which can help to rid the body of toxins. Infrared saunas are a great way to sweat out toxins and stimulate circulation. The infrared technology used in these saunas penetrates deeper into the skin than traditional saunas, allowing for better detoxification at a cellular level, reduced inflammation, and may help lower your risk of cardiovascular disease (8). Boost natural detox function at home - Get adequate sleep. During sleep, your brain activates the glymphatic system which is responsible for clearing metabolic waste that could cause cellular damage (9). Aim for seven to nine hours. - Eat a diet rich in antioxidants from fruits and vegetables, which have been shown to support the healthy function of your body's existing detoxification pathways. - Eliminate ultra-processed foods or avoid them as much as is practical. - Increase your intake of healthy fat from omega-3s and quality protein. This can help reduce systemic inflammation which interferes with detox function. - Participate in moderate intensity exercise and/or strength training 3-5 times per week.
