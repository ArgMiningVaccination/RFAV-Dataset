The Medical School's 221 graduates will be honored in a commencement cere - mony at 11 a.m., Thursday, May 11 in the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center. A commencement recog - nizing the Graduate School's 114 degree recipients will be at 7 p.m., Thursday, May 18 in Tom and Lula Gooch Auditorium. Both events will be available to watch live online and will be recorded for later viewing. Officials at both schools said they were elated to move past the days early in the pandemic when modified learning environ - ments due to COVID-19 were necessary and are proud of the perseverance of their students. \"This Class demonstrated incredible adapt - ability and resilience through this challenge as well as the modifications that needed to be made,\" said Angela Mihalic, M.D., Dean of Medical Students, Associate Dean of Student Affairs, and a Distinguished Teaching Professor. \"We are excited to celebrate this remarkable milestone in their educational journey and trust that they will use these lessons to improve countless lives in the future.\" \"It has been a true pleasure to witness the remarkable transformation of the Class of 2023,\" added W. P. Andrew Lee, M.D., Execu - tive Vice President for Academic Affairs, Provost, and Dean of the Medical School. \"Based on their ability to adapt, their passion for addressing ongoing challenges facing health care practice, and their positive approach to change, I have no doubt that they will make their mark on their future residency programs, their patients, and society as a whole.\" \"Our graduate students dealt with the challenge of limited labora - tory access and isolation from their peers and mentors,\" said Andrew Zinn, M.D., Ph.D., Dean of the Graduate School. \"The fact that they continued to flourish and do impressive work speaks volumes about their tenacity and pros - pects for the future.\" This year's Medical School Class includes 12 students who are also earning a Ph.D. Almost half - 104 students - are women; 29 are Hispanic; and 12 are African American. The class also includes 19 first-generation college students; a student who speaks three languages; an orchestra violinist and a flutist; a female former Navy submariner; a student who By Deborah Wormser The field of ophthalmology imme- diately hooked Whitney Stuard, M.D., Ph.D., as she found that her passions for patient care and research fused seamlessly into a specialty with unlimited potential for impact. \"As a physician-scientist, I will have the opportunity to effect change,\" Dr. Stuard said. \"The eye's value and importance in every - thing we do attracted me to the core mission of the profession.\" Beyond Dr. Stuard's devotion to research and clinical care focused on the eyes, she also has spent the past four years of medical school at UT Southwestern getting involved in every way imaginable. She excelled in community service, leadership, and clinical care, leading to her selection for the Ho Din Award, UT South - western Medical School's most prestigious honor. The award, bestowed annually by the Southwestern Medical Foundation to a recip - ient with the skills of a great physician, was established in 1943 and comes with a medal, certificate, and $10,000 scholarship. \"Whitney Stuard is a tremendous choice for the Ho Din Award,\" said Michael McMahan, President and CEO of Southwestern Medical Foundation. \"She has lived the values of wisdom and compassion that this Award repre -sents through her dedication to deep academic accomplishment and community service. We will be delighted to follow her life and career as she continues to lead and serve in medicine during the years to come.\" \"Dr. Stuard has a lengthy record of excel- lence in academics, service, and scholarship. She developed an interest in research early in By Jan Jarvis As a child in Beirut, Lebanon, Ahmad Anouti, M.D., endured dozens of medical procedures, hundreds of medications, and numerous setbacks before a liver transplant at age 17 saved his life. The obstacles he faced made him deter - mined to become a physician and help others, Dr. Anouti said. \"My sickness has been my biggest blessing,\" said Dr. Anouti, a postdoctoral fellow in the Divi - sion of Digestive and Liver Diseases at UT South - western. \"It gave me direction in my life, and now as a physician, has put me in a unique position to really be an advocate for my patients.\" At 11 weeks old, Dr. Anouti was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a congenital condition in which the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder fail to form correctly, resulting in a blockage. He was treated at the American Univer - sity of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), where he was believed to be the first AUBMC patient to undergo the Kasai procedure in which the blocked bile ducts and gallbladder are removed and replaced with the small intestine. Biliary atresia is a rare disease, and without surgery, chil -dren usually do not live past age 2. While his health stabilized, when Dr. Anouti entered his teens he was weak and often short of breath or prone to fainting. He was then diag - nosed with hepatopulmonary syndrome, an uncommon condition that affects the lungs of those with advanced liver disease. (Hepato - pulmonary syndrome is a late complication of Please see COMMENCEMENT on page 16 Please see HO DIN AWARD on page 12 Please see POSTDOC on page 2CEO of AMA is keynote for Medical School graduation; Dean of Basic Research to speak at Graduate School event How a postdoctoral researcher's health journey led him to become a specialist and advocate for liver transplantation Whitney Stuard, M.D., Ph.D.By Deborah Wormser UT Southwestern Ph.D., famously identified the cGAS enzyme pathway that alerts the human immune system to disease-causing invaders like viruses. Since then, researchers have found that cGAS signaling is an ancient, conserved defense strategy stretching from bacteria to mammals. A recent study from the Chen lab published in Nature reports a novel mechanism bacteria use to enhance the effectiveness of the cGAS-mediated immune response. \"This work shows that the antiviral func - tion of the human cGAS pathway is highly conserved in bacteria and reveals a new mecha - nism in the arms race between bacteria and the viruses that infect them, called bacteriophages or 'phages' for short,\" said Dr. Chen, Professor of Molecular Biology. Dr. Chen, also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and Director of the Center for Inflammation Research at UTSW, won a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2019 for his cGAS discoveries. Those advances include identifying cGAS as the enzyme that alerts the human immune system to invasion by microbes as well as several key steps in that signaling pathway. His work solved a century-old mystery and opened the door for the development of drugs designed to modulate the immune response to fight diseases such as lupus and cancer. Long before its role as a genetic material was understood, DNA was known to activate the immune system. Dr. Chen's investigation of the cGAS signaling pathway revealed the mecha - nism underlying the immune response to DNA. \"The conservation of cGAS signaling across Please see IMMUNE on page 14UT Southwestern researchers report new mechanism in ancient pathway to immune response THE 2023 COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES Ahmad Anouti, M.D.Page 2 April/May 2023 biliary atresia in patients who have developed liver cirrhosis.) Dr. Anouti's hepatopulmonary syndrome became very severe at age 16, requiring continuous oxygen therapy. Driven to succeed despite the obstacles, Dr. Anouti received a liver transplant days before his 17th birthday. Soon after, he developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, a condition that occurs because of infection. It can sometimes progress to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which happened in Dr. Anouti's case. He under - went immunotherapy in Beirut and, as soon as he was able, the determined young man returned to finish high school. Once again, he would recover and fiercely pursue his education, ultimately graduating from medical school at American University in Beirut in May 2022. Today, he is a postdoctoral research fellow specializing in hepatology, which is the study of the liver - and a field that he is intimately familiar with. He's also an advocate for organ transplantation and strives to raise awareness of UT Southwestern. Strength and determination When he was strong enough, Dr. Anouti enrolled at the American University of Beirut to study biology. Some people discouraged him from becoming a physician because he would be taking immunosuppressants for the rest of his life as a result of his liver transplant, and this could put his health at risk when coming into contact with ill patients. But he refused to give up his dream. \"Once I got sick, I started seeing all these gaps in the medical field and wanted to do something about it,\" he said. \"I understand patients and the pain they are going through with all the tests and procedures and unanswered questions.\" Determination to be a researcher and clinician led Dr. Anouti to UT Southwestern, where his story has inspired both patients and faculty. Dr. Anouti is in a unique position to help patients facing transplantation, said Lisa VanWagner, M.D., M.Sc., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in the Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases.\"He can bridge the gap between physician- scientists and patients, given his own personal experiences as both a patient and a provider,\" Dr. VanWagner said. \"His passion for helping others live well with a liver transplant and for helping patients and families navigate the emotions of needing and receiving a liver transplant make him a unique asset for transplant medicine.\" Dr. Anouti's journey from liver failure as a teenager to transplantation and post-transplant complications as an adult mirrors the experience of so many transplant patients, said William M. Lee, M.D., Professor of Internal Medicine and a renowned specialist in liver disease. \"That makes him a great spokesperson for transplant recipients - he will be a fantastic guide/advocate for so many in the future as well,\" Dr. Lee said. Giving hope to others Dr. Anouti's message to patients is borne out of his struggle to succeed when many told him he should consider another profession due to his health issues. \"I wanted to show that I could do it despite being sick,\" he said. \"I was always hard- headed and stubborn.\"Surviving so many health challenges moti - vated Dr. Anouti to seek out ways to give hope to others with biliary atresia. \"I want people to be aware of organ dona - tion and rush to donate to save lives,\" he said. \"I want people to fund our research more to be able to help the hundreds of thousands of patients on the waitlist, waiting for a liver and not knowing if they will receive it.\" In 2022, Dr. Anouti moved to Dallas to become a postdoctoral research fellow in hepatology. He applied to UTSW because of its excellent liver transplant program, he said. \"The liver transplant program is not just phenomenal; many breakthrough techniques are being done at UTSW such as living donor liver transplants and machine perfusion of livers,\" he said. As soon as he arrived, Dr. Anouti got involved with advocacy work on behalf of UT Southwestern and other organizations in his effort to encourage transplant donation. He is a member of the Amer - ican Liver Foundation (ALF), a committee member of the ALF Biliary Atresia board, a member of the Global Liver Institute, and a member of Biliary Atresia Research and Education. \"I want people to realize that giving an organ is such a noble thing to do after someone dies,\" he said. Dr. Anouti will finish his postdoctoral research fellowship in 2024. He then plans to apply for a residency in internal medicine, followed by a gastrointestinal fellowship and then a transplant hepatology fellowship. His ultimate goal is to become a transplant hepatologist, and he remains optimistic that he can achieve his goals. \"I'm doing very well and living life fully,\" he said. \"I just appreciate life so much.\" Dr. Lee holds the Meredith Mosle Chair in Liver Disease in Honor of Dr. William M. Lee. Dr. Anouti poses with his wife, Aya Sukkar, on their wedding day in 2022. Dr. Anouti celebrates his 2022 graduation from medical school. Six days after undergoing a liver transplant at age 17, Ahmad Anouti enjoyed his first meal post-surgery.From Staff Reports To commemorate a researcher who kept the institution at the fore - front of her field, UT Southwestern has announced the establishment of the Beth Levine, M.D. Prize in Autophagy Research. The award honors Beth Levine, M.D., who died of breast cancer in 2020. Internationally revered, Dr. Levine pioneered research on autophagy, a housekeeping mechanism that cells use to get rid of damaged components and maintain cellular health. \"Dr. Levine was an exemplar of excellence in research. She has left a legacy through her fundamental discoveries as well as her trainees who were steeped in science through her mentorship,\" said Daniel K. Podolsky, M.D., President of UT Southwestern. \"This prize honors her work and career that led to novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy and their broad implica - tions for basic cellular biology and many prevalent diseases.\" With tremendous support from Dr. Levine's husband, Milton Packer, M.D., and their children, Rachel and Benjamin, UT Southwestern launched a campaign and raised $500,000 from colleagues, former trainees, corpora - tions, family, and friends of Dr. Levine to establish an endowment to support the Levine Prize. Distributions from the endowment will support an annual award and lecture. Ellen S. Vitetta, Ph.D., Professor of Immunology and Microbiology and a Distinguished Teaching Professor, chaired the campaign steering committee.

His classmates say that fits his personality precisely since he has a servant's heart. For his selfless efforts, Dr. Aymard was selected by his classmates for the Iatros Award based on attributes that embody the ideal physi - cian, including patient care, clinical ability, leader - ship, and community service. What the Iatros Award means: When I was announced as the winner of this award at our Senior Banquet, I was completely speechless. For the past four years, I have been surrounded by the most brilliant and kind classmates I could have ever asked for. To be selected by them is a feeling I can't put into words. Class of 2023 student comments: Jeremy is excep - tionally kind, respectful, and thoughtful to both his peers and patients. He is the core of what it means to be a physician who genuinely cares and wants to give back to his community. ... Always very thoughtful of patients and other students, he is as kind, hardworking, and intelligent as a future physician could be expected to be. ... I knew from the first interaction that he is a naturally empa - thetic and brilliant student dedicated to fostering a warm sense of support in every interaction he has with people. He listens with his full attention and empathizes with his whole heart. What the Ross Award means: The faculty in the Department of Family and Community Medicine have been phenomenal mentors to me. They have been my role models since I was a first-year medical student. I'm honored that they chose me for this award among many of my deserving classmates.Mentor comment: Jeremy truly has a servant's heart. Like other students, he was determined not to let COVID-19 stop him from finding a way to partici - pate and make an impact in the community and the school. Wherever Jeremy lands in residency and afterward will be a place that will be impacted by his involvement and wonderful caring attitude. - Cathy Day, Community Action Research Track Program Coordinator, Department of Family and Community Medicine Background and family: I grew up in San Francisco, California, raised by my loving mother and father. I would not be where I am today if it weren't for them. My dad is a software engineer, and my mom is a kindergarten teacher's aide. My little brother, Ryan, is a corporate attorney in Los Angeles. I married the love of my life, Maddie, in April 2022. She is an executive assistant at a recruiting firm in Dallas. What led to your career path: Growing up, I never thought I would become a physician. With the help of mentors in college, I realized that medicine was a field that would allow me to serve others in a very meaningful way. After graduating from Abilene Christian University (ACU), I worked as a medical assistant at a pediatric clinic. When I was a first-year medical student, I met the inspiring upperclassmen and faculty advisers of the Family Medicine Interest Group, where I quickly discovered that family medicine was the best path for me. College: I graduated summa cum laude from ACU and majored in biology. I loved being active in the biology department, serving as a teaching assistant and tutor. The biology faculty and staff graciously nominated me for the Honor Man Award, which I received at graduation. I also loved being a part of the men's social club Gamma Sigma Phi, where I formed some of the most amazing memories and friendships. UTSW activities: I took on several leadership roles within the Family Medicine Interest Group (Presi - dent, Vice President, and Procedures Manager). I also served as President of Southwestern Christian Fellowship. Other activities I enjoyed included the Lymph Notes (our school's a cappella group), the MS0 Weekend Planning Committee, and student panels for medical school interview weekends. Surprising fact: I like to sing and play the acoustic guitar. Ultimate career goal: My ultimate goal is to build rela - tionships with patients that last a lifetime. I want my patients to know me as their trusted primary care physician. Future plans: I hope to practice full-scope family medicine, which is a style of family medicine resembling that of the old general practitioner - seeing adults and children in the clinic, taking care of them in the hospital, and providing mater - nity care. I can see myself being really happy in academic medicine, teaching medical students and residents. I'm excited to train at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, known for training family doctors who do it all.Jeremy Aymard, M.D. Iatros Award and William F. Ross, M.D., Scholarship Award in Family Medicine Yawar Ali, M.D., and Jason Lin, M.D. Class of 2023 Leadership Award Jeremy Aymard, M.D.STUDENT AWARDS Health care resources for adolescents and young adults undergoing key brain devel - opment are often overlooked, according to Dr. Yawar Ali. That is something he wants to change, with his mission to eventually return to his hometown of Brownsville, Texas, to serve these vulnerable patients. What this award means: Serving the Class of 2023 has been one of the most meaningful and enjoyable activities of my UTSW experience. It is an honor to be recognized for serving as co-President of the Class. Mentor comment: Yawar set a tone of collegiality, partnership, and constructive feedback that allowed us to address any concerns that arose during the difficult challenges that impacted the 2023 Class' education during the pandemic. He also was a strong advocate for student issues systemwide through his role on the UT System Student Advisory Council. His leadership skills and passion for mentoring and service were also displayed through his founding of a pro bono tutoring service matching medical student mentors with middle and high school mentees whose education was disrupted by the pandemic. - Angela Mihalic, M.D., Dean of Medical Students and Associate Dean for Student Affairs Background and family: My dad has worked as a pediatrician in Brownsville for the past 25 years - his example taught me the importance of integ - rity and empathy. Indeed, witnessing community members excitedly greet him as \"Dr. Ali\" when - ever we would go shopping at the grocery store taught me the impact a physician can have on the lives of his or her patients. My mom has been my biggest supporter throughout medical school; some people may call me a \"mama's boy\" for calling her every day, but I like to say that I look to her for support. What led to your career path: I was born and raised in Brownsville. My city has the singular distinc - tion of being the poorest city in the nation. We have the highest proportion of uninsured patients, and half of our children live in poverty. As these children become adults, they lose the benefits of CHIP and may not qualify for Medicaid. Many of our clinics in Brownsville are not well-equipped to care for young adults who may present with chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, ADHD, intellectual disability, and cerebral palsy. Interacting with my community members and learning about the need for effec - tive primary care led me to pursue a career in medicine. It is my mission to come back home and serve my community. College: I am grateful to Ms. Cristina Gonzalez- Boles, Ms. Cheryl Janes, and Dr. Richard Scotch for believing in my potential and admitting me to the UT-PACT Program. All three of them supported me as I attended UT Dallas for three years to earn my Bachelor of Arts in biology. UTSW activities: I worked on a pro bono tutoring program called Learn4Free and conducted ethics workshops for the Pediatrics Clerkship. I also completed research throughout medical school in cardiothoracic surgery. Ultimate career goal: I hope to build an adolescent and adult medicine clinic next to a local high school. I will try my best to provide holistic care for each patient, and I will work to inspire their sense of ambition whenever they visit my clinic. Future plans: I am excited to continue my medical training through a residency in internal medicine at Washington University in St. Louis!Dr. Jason Lin finished college in three years to enter medical school early. His eagerness to begin his medical education naturally extended to community service and leadership, with him helping to organize volunteer efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now a graduate, his next challenge will be completing an internal medi - cine residency at UT Medical School in Houston. What this award means: I'm thankful to have had the chance to lead such an amazing class of medical students. Working with each and every one of my peers has been rewarding, and I can confidently say that I am a better person today thanks to my classmates. I'm honored to be recog - nized for the hundreds of hours I have dedicated to making UT Southwestern a better place for students and patients. Mentor comment: Not only did Jason serve his Class well during their time in medical school as a strong advocate and leader, but he also went above and beyond organizing volunteer activities at William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital, including COVID-19 vaccine clinics during the height of the pandemic when students played an important role to support the front-line workers. His initiative, organizational skills, passion for service, and dedication to improving the lives of the community demonstrate why he is a perfect candidate for this award. - Angela Mihalic, M.D., Dean of Medical Students and Associate Dean for Student Affairs Background and family: My family is originally from China and Taiwan.What led to your career path: From a curiosity in biology, I had the chance to volunteer over 1,000 hospital and senior living center hours before college to confirm my decision to pursue medi- cine. Without any relatives in the medical field, I reached out to many physicians for mentorship and shadowing opportunities. College: I majored in biology at UT Dallas, gradu - ating with honors. Activities included Family Chair of the Chinese Student Association and team captain of numerous intramural sports teams. UTSW activities: I was a Pritchard College Senator, founder and Chair of the Medical Literacy Access Project, and Agape Musculoskeletal Free Clinic Manager. I developed UT Southwestern's first hip database, with over 1,500 patients, and published four peer-reviewed articles. I also served as a volunteer and then an Agape free clinic manager, coordinating care for our low-income patients and training for our medical students. Surprising fact: I've had the opportunity to first attend School in Sugar Land, Texas, so then train here at William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital. Ultimate career goal: To do right by my patients and always have an answer to any medical question that family or friends may ask me. Future plans: I'm thrilled to be headed back home to Houston to reunite with family and explore the Texas Medical Center. There's so much I'm looking forward to in this next stage of my journey! Yawar Ali, M.D. Jason Lin, M.D.About the awards: The Iatros Award was estab - lished by the UT Southwestern Medical School Class of 1984 to honor a graduate who most emulates the complete qualities of a physician. The Iatros Award carries a cash prize provided by the Alumni Associa - tion. Named after the Chair of Family and Community Medicine at UT Southwestern from 1984 to 1993, the Ross Award includes a $1,000 scholarship from the Dallas Chapter of the Texas Academy of Family Physi-cians Foundation.

Her goal is eventually to work with medically complex, underserved populations and interventions for difficult-to-treat infections. What this award means: I'm so grateful to have been selected for this award. As I reflect on my four years of medical school, I remember the many faculty and residents who embodied the ethos of medicine through their dedication to lifelong learning and compassionate care. Their examples will continue to inspire me as I begin training as a resident physician. Mentor comment: Lucy is passionate about under - standing normal physiology, the pathophysiology of disease processes, the mechanisms of various medications, and how they treat the pathology of illness. She uses a deeper understanding of patho - physiology to make intelligent, well-thought-out management plans. - Kehinde Odedosu, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine Background and family: My parents emigrated from Wuhan, China. They are passionate about history and anthropology and would often tell me stories about ancient societies and historical events. The stories always helped me keep life in perspective. What led to your career path: I grew up in Plano, Texas, and attended the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science for high school, where I found a passion for biology and chemistry. I witnessed how family members struggled with different illnesses and made enormous strides after receiving empathic and holistic medical care. Later, I witnessed the consequences of when care was not evidence-based, which highlighted the difference that quality medical care can make. These experiences affirmed for me that health is the foundation for our well-being and encouraged me to pursue a career as a physician. College: I graduated from UT Austin in 2018 with bachelor's degrees in biochemistry and psychology. I completed a public health intern - ship along the border, where I studied factors that predict medication adherence in patients with diabetes. I also worked as a reporter for UT Austin's newspaper, The Daily Texan . UTSW activities: I served as a peer mentor for first- year medical students and volunteered at hepa - titis B-free clinics and fairs. I worked as a contact tracer early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was an eye-opening experience, and I've also been involved in research on intranasal vaccines and phage therapy. Surprising fact: I love horseback riding and working with horses - they have such unique personalities and interesting group dynamics. Ultimate career goal: Illness can be a lonely and vulnerable experience. As a physician, I hope to guide and support my patients through these difficult periods with clinical acumen, humility, and compassion. Future plans: I will be pursuing a residency in internal medicine at Scripps Green Hospital in California. Currently, I plan on completing an infectious diseases fellowship after residency. I would like to work with medically complex and underserved populations as well as continue my work on interventions for difficult-to- treat infections. After receiving numerous awards in college, Dr. Jordan Franklin took on inborn errors of metabo - lism and breast imaging research at UTSW. She now aspires to work in internal medicine, eventu - ally pursuing a cardiology fellowship. What this award means: I am deeply honored to receive this award, especially from faculty I greatly respect. I appreciate that it embodies both clinical excellence and compassionate care, core traits of the incredible physicians I have worked with and learned from. Mentor comment: Jordan is an independent thinker with a passion for knowledge. Her steadfast commitment to research has earned her numerous accolades both at the undergraduate level and in medical school. Jordan's future in academic medicine is bright, impelled by her unfettered enthusiasm for learning and her enduring work ethic. - Ahmad Anshasi, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine Background and family: I grew up in The Wood - lands, Texas. My main influences and support were my mother and brother, who is now an inter - ventional and structural cardiologist. What led to your career path: I was always drawn to medicine from personal experiences with illness and through my research, appreciating the crit - ical thinking, opportunities for innovation, and ability to make an immediate positive difference in patients' lives. I found my experiences with the Department of Internal Medicine and the Divi - sion of Cardiology deeply fulfilling and knew that pursuing a career path in these fields would sustain and excite me for the rest of my life. College: I graduated magna cum laude with a Bach- elor of Arts in human developmental and regen - erative biology from Harvard College. I worked in labs at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute all four years, completing a thesis on cancer epigenetics in the laboratory of Alex Meissner, Ph.D. I was awarded several of the most prestigious academic and research prizes at Harvard, including the Hoopes Prize, John Harvard Scholar distinc - tion, Harvard Stem Cell Institute Internship, and Harvard College Research Program awards. I was also the co-Director of a social services initiative at MGH Revere Pediatrics. UTSW activities: I was extremely fortunate to work in the laboratory of Ralph DeBerardinis, M.D., Ph.D., where I investigated inborn errors of metabolism in a cohort of 27 children and was able to diagnose two children with L-2-hydroxy - glutaric aciduria. I also worked on breast imaging research, with my most recent project proposing new screening guidelines for breast cancer survi - vors. I am graduating with an M.D. with Distinc - tion in Research. Additionally, I was co-President of the Radiology Interest Group and a member of Women in Radiology. Surprising fact: I really enjoy basketball and rap/hip-hop music. Ultimate career goal: I am passionate about contin - ually enhancing my knowledge base and clinical acumen but also take great pride in being an advocate for my patients, educating them on their conditions, and supporting them through their journeys. I also hope to contribute to advance - ment in medicine through teaching, mentorship, and meaningful research output. Future plans: I am excited to start my resi- dency in internal medicine at Duke University Medical Center and plan to pursue a fellow - ship in cardiology.Doing right by his patients - no matter what - is Dr. Ishwar Chuckaree's ultimate goal as a new physician. As a native of Trinidad and Tobago, he witnessed firsthand how health care access, literacy, and care for chronic diseases were chal - lenges for many in his community. These experi - ences ultimately inspired him to become a doctor and uplift his community. What this award means: I am extremely honored and humbled to receive this award. The excellence I have observed at UTSW from faculty, mentors, staff, peers, and my own friends continues to inspire me to become the best physician I can be. Mentor comment: Ishwar began his core internal medicine clerkship with a solid foundation in all the basic, entrustable professional activities necessary to excel. His teams enjoyed working with him, his patients thought of him as their doctor, and his attendings clearly recognized his strong performance. - Trey Sertich, M.D., former UTSW Hospitalist Background and family: I consider myself blessed to have grown up in the beautiful islands of Trinidad and Tobago, a land of many cultures and people. Because of this, I learned to celebrate diversity from a young age and appreciated the opportunity to not only share my culture but learn from others when my family moved to America. What led to your career path: Like most developing countries, health care access and literacy in Trin - idad and Tobago were not the most ideal, and from a young age, I noticed how chronic diseases affected those in my community. I ultimately decided to pursue internal medicine, as it fits perfectly with what I had envisioned myself being able to do as a future physician - helping others combat common health conditions to get back to doing the things they enjoy with the people they love. College: I attended UT Dallas, where I majored in biochemistry. I discovered my passion for mentor - ship and teaching as a peer tutor, teaching assis - tant, and the freshman mentor. I also developed a curiosity for research during my involvement in a molecular and cell biology lab studying carbon nanotubes and macrophage interactions. I gradu - ated with my degree in three years to afford myself a gap year, which I spent working at a golf course to save toward my medical school tuition. UTSW activities: When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I co-founded a free online advising service to help premedical students and alleviate the anxiety that surrounds the medical school appli- cation process. I am most proud of this accom - plishment as we have been able to provide more than 500 hours of free quality advising to over 200 premedical students across Texas, signifi - cantly increasing accessibility to an otherwise scarce and costly resource. I also helped admin - ister COVID-19 vaccines to the underserved in the Dallas community. Future plans: I am excited to complete my internal medicine training at Emory University School of Medicine. Moving forward, I strive to become the most competent, confident, and compassionate physician I could possibly be. I want to give my patients the highest quality of care possible while connecting with them on a deeper level. I would also like to further pursue my passion for mentor - ship and teaching in the future through academic medicine. I am excited to begin this new chapter with my beautiful fianc\u00e9e, Veena, who will also be completing her internal medicine residency. Few medical students can claim the honor of working in the lab of two Nobel Laureates, but Dr. Michael Trinh has benefited from that exact experience. His thirst for knowledge and drive to succeed, rooted in part by his family's escape as refugees of the Vietnam War, shaped the person he is today. What this award means: It is a great honor to be a student recognized by the Department of Internal Medicine. Mentor comment: Completing his Ph.D. in a remarkable two years, Michael's work has led to many first-author publications. He also builds excellent rapport with his patients by using a humble curiosity to explore their perspec - tives and practical daily challenges. Truly an outstanding scholar, Michael will undoubtedly be an academic leader in his field and will succeed at the most competitive and rigorous programs in the country. - Reeni Abraham, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine What led to your career path: My parents and their huge families had fled Saigon in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. At the helm of the family was my grandfather, who had been separated from his wife and five children - two of whom were imprisoned in communist \"re-education\" camps - for 10 years before reuniting with the family in Austin, Texas. It was my grandfather's mentorship and untimely death from cancer that affirmed my aspiration to study medicine and science. College: I majored in biology at UT Dallas as part of the UT-PACT Program - a joint B.A./M.D. program that allowed me to matriculate at UT South- western after three years of college. As an under - graduate, I worked in the UTSW laboratory of Michael Brown, M.D., and Joseph Goldstein, M.D., whose 1985 Nobel Prize-winning discov - eries revealed new information about choles - terol metabolism. Working with Drs. Brown and Goldstein and seeing how their research made such a big difference in the world inspired me. UTSW activities: For my Ph.D. research in the Brown/Goldstein laboratory, I used CRISPR gene-editing technology to find genes required for cholesterol to move from one membrane to another in human cells. Genetic defects in this movement can cause fatal human diseases such as atherosclerosis (common) and Niemann- Pick disease, type C (rare). I discovered that this movement requires another lipid named phos - phatidylserine, a discovery with implications for membrane biology and cardiovascular science. This work earned me the Merton Bernfield Memo - rial Award from the American Society for Cell Biology, the William F. and Grace H. Kirkpatrick Award from the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. To bridge my clinical and research interests, I was also Presi - dent of the Medical Genetics Interest Group and the Seldin Society for Internal Medicine. Future plans: I will be headed to an internal medi - cine residency (Stanbury Physician-Scientist Pathway) at Massachusetts General Hospital, followed by a clinical and postdoctoral fellowship, then become an academic physician-scientist.

Reynolds Pathology AwardAs a teenager, Dr. Ashley Ciosek became very ill, which became increasingly difficult to manage. She learned that health was a gift, not a guarantee. That experience and others taught her the value of understanding the entire patient, drawing her toward a career as a physician. What the Smith Award means: I am truly humbled to have received the Smith Award, and I'm incred - ibly excited to continue my training in a field as dynamic as internal medicine. Mentor comment: Ashley clearly distinguished herself in the internal medicine clerkship and during her sub-internship as a professional, hardworking student with advanced clinical and communication skills capable of forging authentic patient connections. Initially drawn to the sciences as a biochemistry major, she wanted a career where she could make a difference every day. - Stephanie Brinker, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine What the Goldings Award means: I have had a wonderful experience working with numerous faculty and residents within the Division of Rheu - matic Diseases over the last four years. Our hospi - tals see an incredible array of advanced and new- onset rheumatic diseases, and the faculty strongly prioritize case-by-case teaching and student-led research initiatives - both of which have been gratifying experiences. Mentor comment: Ashley has shown enthusiasm, determination, and hard work as a researcher, clinical learner, and educator. She worked with one of our Rheumatology fellows and several faculty members on a project to understand the patient factors that predict successful transition from pediatric to adult rheumatology care. She is a first author on one paper and co-author on another from this work. - David Karp, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Division of Rheumatic Diseases and Professor of Internal MedicineBackground and family: I grew up in Austin, Texas, and was fortunate to be raised by two supportive, caring, and flexible parents. I played volleyball from fourth through 12th grade and loved the team atmosphere and action-packed weekends that came along with the sport. I switched school zoning districts at elementary, middle, and high school, witnessing how ZIP codes affect education. What led to your career path: At age 19, I became very sick and was introduced to \"life as a patient,\" which was more challenging to navigate than I had ever imagined. Simultaneously, my grandparents struggled with end-of-life care - balancing medical interventions with the power and grace of \"letting go.\" These experiences taught me the value of having a physician who cares for the entire patient and drew me toward this challenging, yet incredibly meaningful and rewarding career. College: I attended UT Austin where I majored in biochemistry. While at UT, I worked as a pharmacy technician, played on several sand volleyball teams, coached an elementary school running team, and volunteered through a local hospice agency. I was also privileged to work throughout college alongside members of Dr. Shelley Payne's lab to elucidate the mechanisms by which cholera induces toxicity in the human gut - a project that taught me the value of basic science and the tenacity required to elucidate scientific and medical knowledge.UTSW activities: During the second year of medical school, our team aimed to uncover the barriers to continuity of care among patients with childhood-onset lupus. Our work specifi - cally focused on health literacy, coping mecha - nisms, and patient activation among a cohort of uninsured and publicly insured patients, many of whom faced severe disease. I have also enjoyed getting involved in various school activities such as United to Serve, mentoring incoming medical students, and co-teaching a Resilience in Medi - cine elective during the COVID-19 lockdown. Future plans: I plan to remain in academic medi - cine so that I may continue to work with patients from varied backgrounds while also benefiting from a learning environment. I am open to many career paths, including (in no particular order) rheumatology, gastroenterology, hospitalist medicine, and cardiology. First up though is a resi - dency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The time that mentors invested in Dr. Sarah Cao inspired her to pay it forward. For someone who thrives on learning, the desire to teach is ingrained. Mentoring is a skill she hopes to continue nurturing in her career, as she would like to even - tually work as a surgeon in an academic setting. What this award means: Throughout my education, I have been fortunate to have had teachers and mentors who were really invested and passionate. That made me want to pass on the same investment to others. I knew that I wanted to stay involved in teaching in some form during medical school, and Student Academic Support Services (SASS) provided me with a perfect avenue for this. Knowing that I was able to make some impact as a tutor has been very rewarding. Mentor comment: Sarah was chosen for the posi - tive feedback we received and her willingness to always go the extra mile. Her calm and confident manner allows students to fully engage in her tutoring sessions. Her goal is to ensure her students understand the course material, apply their knowledge, and succeed. - Rosemary Meredith, Ed.D., Associate Director of Student Academic Support ServicesBackground and family: I am originally from upstate New York around Albany, then made the move to Texas eight years ago. What led to your career path: Growing up, I knew that I wanted to be a surgeon. I decided to pursue bioengineering during my undergraduate training and was very fortunate to be able to work on some surgical instrumentation projects and get in the operating room early. Growing in that sort of academic environment of both my college and the Texas Medical Center in Houston, I was really interested in the sense of discovery and education that was always around. This affirmed for me that I want to practice in an academic setting and be involved in medical education in the future. College: I graduated magna cum laude from Rice University in Houston, Texas, with a Bachelor of Science in bioengineering and a certificate in German. I was very involved in the Bioen- gineering Department, tutoring, and teaching small sessions for younger classes in introductory coding and engineering fundamentals. UTSW activities: One of the most meaningful activ - ities has been tutoring with SASS. Additionally, I have been involved in research that has utilized my engineering background, both working on neuroimaging analysis as well as some surgical laparoscopic video projects. Surprising fact: I think people are always surprised about how much I read. It has given me a lot of random, very topically specific knowledge that seems to surprise people. Last year, I set a goal for myself to read a book every week, and I was able to beat that goal by about five books. Ultimate career goal: Going into residency, the priority for me is to learn as much as I can, both in surgical and soft skills. I think that the opportunity to be in a new place exposes you to a lot of different ways people do things and allows you to decide how to incorporate that into your own practice. Future plans: I am headed for a residency in general surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai/Hospital in New York. As far as a subspecialty, I am still in an exploration phase but am inter - ested in colorectal surgery. I plan to practice in an academic setting as I am interested in working with trainees as a medical educator.Dr. Alexa Ciarolla's background touches on areas considered unique for a medical school graduate: military service following graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy aboard a submarine and competition as a member of Team USA in the 2013 Student Yachting World Cup. But her experience all led her to UT Southwestern and graduation as a new physician specializing in neurology. What the Excellence in Neurology Prize means: I have found many wonderful mentors and friends via the Neurology Department faculty and residents who have guided me throughout medical school, and I owe them for where I am now. I am truly grateful for their dedication and support and am honored to be chosen for this award. Mentor comment: Alexa particularly shone on the Neurocritical Care service, where she sought out the sickest, most complex patients and completely owned their care. She spent extra time getting to know patients and families and was always avail - able to counsel them as needed. She will undoubt - edly be a top performer and leader during resi - dency and in her career. - Stephen Figueroa, M.D., Associate Professor of Neurology and Neurological Surgery and Fellowship Director, Neurocritical Care What the Reynolds Award means: The Pathology Department's dedication to teaching and students was ever-present throughout our time in medical school and had a great impact on helping myself and classmates understand the role pathology plays in understanding and treating disease. I am honored to be selected for this award and humbled to be recognized for service amongst many colleagues who have done amazing things as medical students. Mentor comment: Alexa has demonstrated a career of service from the time she was a student in the U.S. Naval Academy. During medical school, her extensive community service has included the Equest therapeutic riding program, The Monday Clinic, and Meals on Wheels. With her humani - tarian attributes, she will be an outstanding physician and a credit to our institution. - Kathleen Wilson, M.D., Professor of Pathology and in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development Background and family : I was born and raised in Palos Verdes, California. My father is a medical oncologist, and my mother worked as a nurse in a critical care unit and cardiac catheterization lab before leaving her job to take care of my older brother, who has special needs. What led to your career path: Both of my parents are in health care (my father is a physician and my mother is a nurse) so growing up I assumed I would follow in their footsteps. I ultimately decided to go to the Naval Academy for the opportunity to serve and challenge myself. Along the way, I had envisioned that my post-Navy career plans would involve law or something that seemed like a more natural segue from military service. However, I came back to the idea of medicine. College: I graduated from the Naval Academy in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in history and a Russian minor. There, I was a four-year member of the Varsity Offshore Sailing Team and worked as a member of Honor Staff for two years. Upon graduation, I completed nuclear power training in Charleston, South Carolina, and Ballston Spa, New York, before serving as a junior officer onboard a submarine stationed out of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. UTSW activities: As a pre-clerkship student, I was involved in several student interest groups and was selected as a Medical Student Representative of the Women in Science and Medicine Advisory Committee. I tutored in immunology, microbi - ology, pulmonology, and microanatomy. By third year, I contributed to research in neuroimaging in subjects with psychosis and planned and imple - mented a curriculum for a leadership elective for pre-clerkship students. Surprising fact: While on the USNA offshore sailing team, I had the opportunity to sail as a member of Team USA, competing in the 2013 Student Yachting World Cup in Pornic, France. We finished in third place against some very competitive international teams! Future plans: After my neurology residency at UCLA Medical Center, I hope to specialize in neurocritical care. My ultimate goal is to pursue academic medicine so that I can continue to stay involved in research and medical education.

His research and publications demon - strate academic achievement. - Kathleen Wilson, M.D., Professor of Pathology and in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development Background and family: I'm from the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and my parents are both public school teachers who instilled in me a love of learning and teaching. My father is a coach and had hopes I would be an athlete, but I naturally gravitated toward science. I'm the first member of my family to go into medicine. What led to your career path: In college, I was guided by my advisers to pursue basic scientific research and had spectacular physician-scientist mentors and others in the medical school who inspired me. Everyone told me I had to come to UT South- western to continue learning from the best. As a graduate student here in the lab of Duojia Pan, Ph.D., Chair and Professor of Physiology, I studied a rare vascular cancer and spent a lot of time gener - ating genetically engineered mice and poring over mouse tissue slides looking for cancer at the microscopic level. By the time I graduated with my Ph.D., I knew pathology would be the best specialty to pursue my interest in cancer research. College: I graduated from the University of Penn- sylvania with a Bachelor of Arts in biochemistry and biophysics and a Master of Science in chemistry. UTSW activities: I completed the Perot Family Scholars Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) and served as an MSTP delegate for the Vertically Integrated Programs-Cancer. I also served as a Colleges' peer mentor and Micro - anatomy teaching assistant. Future plans: I matched to a residency in anatom- ical pathology at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City as part of its Physician Scientist Training Program, where I will learn how to diagnose cancer and continue my research in cancer biology. My goal is to run my own laboratory at an academic medical center one day, combining my unique clinical and scien - tific expertise in a subset of cancers that will hope - fully lead to the development of new therapeutics. Pursuit and achievement of a dual M.D./Ph.D. degree make perfect sense to Dr. Andrew Chung, who finds surgical intervention similar to science in that both often attempt to solve a problem underlying a disease. What this award means: The leadership, mentor - ship, excellent clinical care, and genuine love for teaching that our faculty display are why I decided to become a surgeon. To be chosen by them for this award is an exceptional honor. Mentor comment: Andrew is one of the most exceptional medical students I have worked with during my tenure at UT Southwestern. His academic excellence is the result of a unique combination of talents: having an inquisitive scientific mind, good surgical skills, and, most importantly, being a very caring individual. I anticipate that Andrew will have a very successful academic career as a surgeon-scientist and will make us all proud. - Patricio Polanco, M.D., Associate Professor of Surgery Background and family: I grew up in Yorba Linda, California. My dad has been a Professor of Finance at the University of California, Riverside, for the past 33 years. What led to your career path: I earned my Ph.D. in the lab of Associate Professor Hao Zhu, M.D., studying preventive immunotherapy and meta - bolic zonation in liver cancer. When I returned to medical school, I found many similarities between surgery and science. I also love the novelty of learning and honing new skills every time I'm in the operating room. These character - istics pushed me toward a career in surgery. College: I attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where I majored in neuroscience. I was president of my college fraternity, and I also worked in the lab of Marie-Francoise Chesselet, M.D., Ph.D., studying Parkinson's disease. After college, I worked in the lab of Theo Palmer, Ph.D., at Stanford University studying adult hippo - campal neurogenesis. UTSW activities: I served on the Student Executive Committee of the Perot Family Scholars Medical Scientist Training Program and the Retreat Plan - ning Committee for the Genetics, Development, and Disease Ph.D. Program. Surprising fact: Now an unabashed evangelist for Texas staples such as Buc-ee's and H-E-B. Ultimate career goal: My goal is to learn to provide the best clinical care for my patients, supported by the newest biomedical science and technolo - gies available. I want to continue to hone my investigative skills as well, likely studying cancer in a translational research setting. Future plans: After completing a residency in general surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, my goal is to pursue a fellowship in surgical oncology. This training, combined with my research background in cancer biology and genetics, will enable me to bridge the clinical and scientific domains as a surgeon-scientist. I hope to use discoveries in the lab to advance the surgical care of patients with cancer.Growing up, Dr. I-Chun Lin loved logic puzzles, visual art, and team sports. For her, plastic surgery is a perfect combination of those interests. She aims to pursue microsurgery, breast reconstruc - tion, or peripheral nerve surgery, and up next will be staying at UT Southwestern for her residency. What this award means: Plastic surgery, to me, is a continuous pursuit of excellence, and the mentors I have in the field embody that sentiment. As medical students, we struggle to feel as though we truly belong - impostor syndrome, in short. This award is affirmation that my efforts during rota - tions were seen and appreciated, and that, despite my having an infinite amount to learn, I have found my people. Mentor comment: I-Chun has traits that will not only make her an excellent surgeon but also colleague: dedicated, driven, and humble. She integrates so well with her teams and is passionate and caring for her patients. These qualities shine on her best days and after working long hours and exhausting days. She has the curiosity and drive for learning to become a leader in plastic surgery. - Abby Culver, M.D., Assistant Professor of Plastic Surgery Background and family: I was born in Boston and grew up in Plano, Texas. My parents are immi - grants from Taiwan who came here for graduate school and are among my biggest inspirations in life. I have a brother and sister who both attended Berkeley and are incredible support. What led to your career path: My parents taught me to explore everything and to strive for excellence in every pursuit. I had a particular affinity for logic puzzles, visual art, and team-based sports. Plastic surgery is that perfect combination - a culmination of challenge, work ethic, artistry, and teamwork. College: I majored in biology at UT Dallas and was active in volleyball as well as volunteering with outreach organizations. UTSW activities: I served with United to Serve, the UTSW Texas Medical Association Student Chapter, as a student mentor for the UTSW Amer - ican Medical Women's Association, and as Clinic Manager for the Agape Musculoskeletal Specialty Clinic. I was also active as a mentor and peer facili- tator through various organizations. Surprising fact: I foster small mammals - cats and rabbits - through the SPCA. It is incredibly rewarding to see animals' personalities blossom and to see them placed in loving \"fur-ever\" homes. Ultimate career goal: To fully occupy this space in which we push, learn, and innovate - during resi - dency and beyond - so that I can consistently offer my best to our patients. Future plans: I hope to attend a fellowship outside of Texas, likely for microsurgery with an additional fellowship. In plastic surgery, I am currently inter - ested in microsurgery, breast reconstruction, and peripheral nerve. I love teaching and have research interests in medical education and outcomes-based and public health-facing research, so I would love to be in academia. When Dr. Priya Garigipati started medical school, she did not consider radiology top of mind as a specialty. But after rotating through radiology specialties, she was amazed by the breadth of knowledge and dedication to teaching that she witnessed. She wanted to be just like her mentors one day, and now she will be. What this award means: I distinctly remember thinking how difficult radiology was when I was tasked with dictating reports on my pediatric radiology rotation and how little I knew even after four years. However, I continued to immerse myself within the field and am fortunate to have mentors who supported me along the way, espe - cially in a field with few women historically. It's such an honor to be recognized for this award, as it shows the trust my mentors have in me succeeding within radiology. Mentor comment: Priya stands out for her excel - lent academic work, her long history of commu - nity service, and for her leadership within Radi - ology, consistently making time for mentoring junior medical students and increasing interest in our specialty. - Kristen Bishop, M.D., Associate Professor of Radiology Background and family: I grew up as an only child in Plano, Texas, of Indian immigrant parents, and I am the first doctor in the family. What led to your career path: I've been interested in a little bit of everything since college; I even switched my major six times. That curiosity about how things work and wanting to learn about various topics continued throughout medical school. During my clerkships, I enjoyed every rotation - from surgery to psychiatry to internal medicine - and knew that whatever specialty I chose, I wanted a breadth of pathology. I also wanted to find ways to incorporate my interests in education, mentorship, and global health into my career. Coming from a family of engineers, the intersection of medicine and technology always fascinated me, and radiology offered me the perfect avenue to invest in these interests. College: I attended Northwestern University, majoring in biology with a minor in global health. After college, I worked as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant (ETA) in Taiwan and also as a community health fellow in rural Alabama at a nonprofit called Project Horseshoe Farm. UTSW activities: I was involved in United to Serve and the Student Simulation Interest Group, worked as an anatomy TA, and served as a free clinic manager and as co-President of the Inter - ventional Radiology Interest Group. Ultimate career goal: I want to be known to my patients as a doctor who cares about them as people and strives to provide them and their fami-lies with the best care. I hope to continue keeping my skills sharp and learning from anyone who is willing to teach me. Future plans: I will be finishing my intern year at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and moving on to my diagnostic radiology residency at UCSF!

We then moved to Austin, Texas, when I was 10. My father is a software engineer, my mother is a teacher, and my sister is a first-year resident in family medicine. What led to your career path: Since high school, I knew I wanted a career in medicine, as I liked the idea of using science to heal others. My interests became more specific to improving patient function after several family members suffered musculoskeletal injuries and severe pain, which impaired their ability to work and do the things they love. This interest led me to physical medicine and rehabilitation, a field in which our training and expertise are so well-aligned with each patient's specific goals. College: I graduated summa cum laude from UT Dallas with a degree in biology and a minor in public health. I served as a Student Ambassador representing the Office of the President, worked as an MCAT tutor and spokesman for a national test prep company, and conducted research in a basic science lab in the Department of Biology. UTSW activities: I worked as a medical student researcher in the UTSW Spine Center with publica - tions analyzing health and disability outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment in patients with diverse spine conditions. I also served as a UTSW peer mentor to help first-year students transi - tion to medical school. Surprising fact: I love to dance! I began taking classes to learn Bhangra, a traditional dance originating from Punjab, at the age of 7. I enjoy choreographing team performances and teaching Bhangra to medical students and children in the community. Ultimate career goal: My ultimate goal is to make a profound impact toward improving my patients' functional ability and to empower them to keep doing the things they love for the rest of their lives. Future plans: I am excited to start residency at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. I then hope to work in an academic setting as a clinician-scientist so that I can treat patients in the clinical setting while also helping to advance the field of musculoskeletal and rehabilitation medicine. Dr. Avni Shah's first influence to go into medicine was her mother, a pharmacist. Then in college, she shadowed an anesthesiologist and became fascinated with the skill of the physician and the complex human physiology involved. She appre - ciated how the physician made patients feel safe and comfortable before surgery and now wants to do the same. What this award means: I fell in love with anesthe - siology very early in medical school and am so grateful to the UT Southwestern Anesthesiology and Pain Management Department for the excel - lent mentorship, guidance, and education they have provided me over the years. Mentor comment: One of Dr. Pepper Jenkins' mantras was: \"Put the patients first; teach when you can, and research with whatever is left.\" Avni embodies this perfectly. She is a caring clinician, motivated mentor, and critical thinker. We wish her well, knowing her future is very bright! - Amy Powers Woods, M.D., Associate Professor of Anes - thesiology and Pain Management Background and family: My parents are the most hardworking people I know and my biggest supporters. I have a younger brother who is a senior in high school and is heading to college next year to study artificial intelligence and computer science. My significant other is in medical school as well and is pursuing general surgery. What led to your career path: I had an early interest in the medical field from watching my mom work as a pharmacist. After exploring many facets of the medical field through shadowing and volun - teering, I realized I wanted to become a physi - cian. As an undergraduate at UT Dallas, I worked on research in cardiac anesthesiology with Ravi Joshi, M.D., Associate Professor of Anesthesiology and Pain Management. I was fascinated by the complex principles of human physiology at play and in awe of the incredible skill of the anesthesi - ologists I shadowed. I especially appreciated how they were able to make their patients feel safe and comfortable before surgery, which might be the scariest moment of their lives. College: I was part of a B.A./M.D. program at UT Dallas. I majored in biology with a minor in economics and graduated summa cum laude. UTSW activities: I have been involved with ASIG, our Anesthesiology Student Interest Group, SPARC, a patient advocacy organization, and AMWA, UT Southwestern's chapter of the American Medical Women's Association. Future plans: After residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, I hope to pursue fellowship training. I'm interested in either cardiothoracic or regional anesthesiology but am keeping an open mind. Ravinderjit Singh, M.D. Avni Shah, M.D.About the award: Started in 2011, the award is named in honor of the Department's past Chair, Dr. Kowalske. Fawwad Khan, M.D. North Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians Award for Outstanding Medical Student in Psychiatry Dr. Fawwad Khan entered medical school already focused on psychiatry, so it was important for him to not only explore this specialty but also find a way to make an impact and help fellow students. He did just that, volunteering as a peer advocate to promote student mental health and working with faculty on an update to the Psychiatry Clerk - ship curriculum. What this award means: I feel privileged and honored to be recognized for my efforts in pursuing my interest in psychiatry and trying my best to utilize it in a meaningful way. Mentor comment: Fawwad has been recognized by his peers as a role model for compassionate care. He has been involved in multiple volunteering activities and has shown great leadership in helping the Psychiatry Clerkship faculty revi - talize a reflection activity for the students. We look forward to seeing all that he accomplishes in his career. - Sarah E. Baker, M.D., M.A., Assistant Professor of Psychiatry Background and family: My identity as a Pakistani American Muslim is central to who I am today, and I recognize the privilege and opportunity that blossomed from the struggles of immi- gration endured by my parents. The support I have received from my friends and family has been a consistent foundation for me to rely on throughout the ups and downs that come with medical school. What led to your career path: Behavioral and mental health were always areas of interest for me. I found the stigma around mental illness, as well as the profound impact it can have on the lives of those affected and their loved ones, as important areas of need. Working in a neuropsy - chiatric lab in college confirmed my interest in medicine, and specifically psychiatry, as an ideal career path for me. College: I attended UC Berkeley, majoring in molecular and cell biology with a minor in peace and conflict studies. Two of my most mean - ingful involvements were volunteering as a basketball coach for children in under-resourced Oakland and Berkeley school districts and serving as a student mentor for students in local elementary schools. UTSW activities: I had the opportunity to explore my interest through my work with Carol Tamminga, M.D., Chair of Psychiatry, on a project studying the effects of psychotropic medication use on brain-based biomarkers. Additionally, I was elected as a student officer in the Psychiatry Student Interest Group, joined the Peer Advocate program, and served on the Ethics Curriculum Committee of the Gold Humanism Honor Society. Future plans: I look forward to entering the next stage of my career at the University of Illinois at Chicago to begin my psychiatry residency training. I'm excited to be moving closer to my fianc\u00e9e and to be given the opportunity to train at an institution with a dedicated focus on addressing the mental health needs of the city's underserved communities. Fawwad Khan, M.D. About the award: The award honors a student for excellent work in psychiatry and mental health.Blake Ferguson, M.D. John D.

UTSW activities: I served on the board of the PRIDE organization to build a home for LGBTQ+ students at UTSW. I also created the elective, Basic Spanish for Healthcare Providers, where in conjunction with the Latino Medical Student Association, we taught 30 UTSW students to conduct a history of present illness (HPI) in Spanish. I volunteered as a vaccine administrator when the COVID-19 vaccine first became available and volunteered to mentor high school students through the Health Professions Recruitment and Exposure Program. Surprising fact: Immersing myself in the language and the culture to better my proficiency. I am currently reading The Alchemist in Spanish. Ultimate career goal: In addition to providing the best possible care for my patients, my goal is to foster an environment of learning, inclusion, and collaboration on my teams. Blake Ferguson, M.D. About the award: The award honors Dr. McConnell, a former UTSW faculty member who led Urology from a Division into a Department. He is now Executive Director of Wake Forest Healthcare Ventures in North Carolina, which develops and commercial - izes health care products and services. About the award: The award recognizes students seeking careers in anesthesiology who excelled at UTSW Medical School, take an empathetic approach to patient care, and exhibit the characteristics of leader - ship, scholarship, and thirst for knowledge exemplified by the late Dr. Jenkins, who established and served as Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management from 1948 to 1981.Page 8 April/May 2023 COMMENCEMENT CELEBRATION Avery Young, M.D. Texas College of Emergency Physicians Award Henry W. Chen, M.D., and Hunter J. Pyle, M.D. Award for Excellence in DermatologyChristopher Joseph, M.D. Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Award As a child, Dr. Avery Young always seemed to be in and out of emergency rooms, from visits for a broken arm to a cut on her scalp. She always felt safe, a sentiment that drew her to the field. Now she hopes to pay it forward, providing excel - lent care to future patients in need of emer - gency treatment. What this award means: The faculty and residents who staff the Emergency Department at UT South- western are witty, flexible, and approachable. It feels incredibly promising to know that a group of physicians that I personally hold in high esteem also reciprocate the warm sentiment. Mentor comment: Avery represents the giving spirit of the emergency medicine physician.

She has excellent clinical skills and an upbeat and friendly demeanor that will continue to serve her and her patients well. - Mary McHugh, M.D., Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine Background and family: I was born and raised in Plano, Texas, with an older sister. I am closest with my father, who relocated to Maryland nearly a decade ago. Additionally, I am the proud owner of a 13-year-old dog named Louie, who is simultane - ously the highest maintenance relationship of my personal life and my greatest source of daily joy. What led to your career path: Long before I became an EM-bound medical student, I was just a kid with a proclivity for impulsive choices and bad luck. As an infant, I experienced febrile seizures; as a toddler, I required stitches on my scalp; in elementary school, I discovered how easy it is to break your arm while skiing. I can think of nearly a dozen instances where I have required emer - gency medical attention, and in hindsight, I am sure of two things: The first is my parents never had trouble meeting their insurance deductible, and the second is I have felt safe and reassured in the company of emergency medicine physicians since I was a child. It's a feeling I hope to recreate for my own patients. College: I graduated summa cum laude from Texas A&M University, where I majored in molecular and cellular biology. I split my time between research in a bacterial genetics lab and discovered a passion for teaching as a microbiology TA. UTSW activities: I was a student course director for four enrichment electives as well as an anatomy TA for first-year students. I was honored to be chosen as a member of the Gold Humanism Society, but I am most proud of the volunteer work I did for the local domestic violence women's shelter, Brighter Tomorrows. Future plans: I will be headed to an emergency medi- cine residency at McGaw Medical Center of North - western University. I plan on simply remaining curious and enthusiastic during my time in resi - dency, and I am open to wherever my career as an emergency medicine physician leads me. In high school, Dr. Henry Chen competed in computer programming contests, which led to his interest in combining technology and medicine. Once in medical school, he gravitated toward the specialties dermatology and rheumatology. Dr. Chen hopes to leverage his computational back - ground to advance our understanding of dermato - logical disease and develop new patient therapies. What this award means: Receipt of this award reflects the culture of mentorship that is prevalent throughout the Department of Dermatology and a vote of confidence in my potential as a physi - cian-scientist within the field of dermatology. Mentor comment: Henry has a stellar publica - tion record, with seven first-author publica - tions and seven co-author publications. He also obtained two grants to support his research year in dermatology. Given his relentless commitment to pursuing various research questions, Henry has the rare potential to become a superstar in our field. - Benjamin Chong, M.D., Associate Professor of Dermatology Background and family: I was raised in Cypress, Texas, by my first-generation immigrant parents who embodied self-sacrifice and unfettered support. My strong Christian faith is the founda -tion of my compassion for each patient I meet. What led to your career path: In high school, I spent a lot of time competing in Java programming contests, which catalyzed my interest in computer science. Since then, I have been fascinated by the intersection of technology and medicine. I became interested in dermatology through initial exposure at the Agape Clinic, and I confirmed this interest through caring for patients with rheuma - tologic-dermatologic diseases such as cutaneous lupus and morphea. College: I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry - systems and synthetic biology from UT Austin. I was a peer mentor and researcher in the Freshman Research Initiative and an undergraduate Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas fellow. I volunteered at the University Health Services and Dell Children's Medical Center. I also was a recipient of the Welch Foundation Scholarship. UTSW activities: I served as an Agape Dermatology Clinic Manager, United to Serve event co-Director and volunteer Chair, and AOA Research Committee co-Chair. I extended my research training through a yearlong translational and clinical research fellowship under Drs. Heidi Jacobe and Benjamin Chong, supported by grant funding from the Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance and Rheumatology Research Foundation. Surprising fact: I enjoy kitchen chemistry (i.e., baking) with my wife. Our favorite treat to make is macarons. Ultimate career goal: I aim to not only leverage my computational background in bioinfor - matics and epidemiology to advance our under - standing of dermatological disease and ultimately contribute to the development of novel therapies to treat patients, but I also plan to foster the next generation of dermatologists just as my mentors have done for me. Future plans: As an academic dermatologist, I hope to continue answering questions related to improving patient care from the population to the cellular level using big data while providing personalized, clinical excellence for my future patients. My immediate next step is a derma - tology residency right here at UT Southwestern.Dr. Christopher Joseph had the rare opportu - nity to complete medical school and also work at SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by the billionaire Elon Musk. That expe - rience influenced his career choice in emergency medicine and innovation research, two passions he hopes to combine.

Mentor comment: Christopher has already made significant contributions to scientific literature with dozens of publications and research presen - tations on esophageal cooling and atrial fibrilla - tion. He has also volunteered with the Commu - nities Foundation of Texas, coordinated a vaccine drive, and acted as a peer mentor. Chris displays excellent early-clinician skills, and we expect him to have a bright future in emergency medi - cine. - Mary McHugh, M.D., Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine Background and family: Despite having parents from Malaysia and Peru, I was born in New Zealand. I immigrated to the United States with my parents and older brother as a child and grew up in the South. I now live in Dallas along with my girlfriend, Julie, and our dog, Maya. What led to your career path: I've known since high school that I would pursue a career in medicine. Although I always had an interest in innovation, I never thought it would play a role in my future career. However, in college I had the opportunity to work at Blockit, a medical software startup, where I discovered my desire to work at the crossroads of health care and technology. This experience and my time working at SpaceX led me to a career in emergency medicine and inno - vation research. College: I went to UT Dallas and majored in biology. As part of the UT-PACT combined B.A./M.D. program, I was accepted to medical school when I was 17. UTSW activities: I served with the Academic Colleges as a peer mentor and often volunteered for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. I also took a research year working at Attune Medical with Erik Kulstad, M.D., Professor of Emergency Medicine at UTSW and an emergency medicine physician at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Surprising fact: I worked at SpaceX on research and planning for spaceflight missions and deploy - ment of Starlink internet into health care settings.Ultimate career goal: My ultimate goal would be to apply the skills I've learned in medical innova - tion to issues faced by underprivileged and under - insured patients.Future plans: I matched at UT Southwestern for my emergency medicine residency. In the future, I hope to practice as an academic emergency medi - cine physician with a focus on innovation both within my academic institution and with startups. The transition from riding horses in a small Texas town as a boy to caring for patients as a derma - tologist seems like a major culture shift, but for Dr. Hunter J. Pyle, the work ethic he was taught growing up on a ranch shaped his determined nature. He aspires to work in academic medicine as a dermatologist, combining his passions for patient care and research. What this award means: As the first physician in my family, I've felt a special gratitude for the privi - lege of medical training. I found a natural outlet for this gratitude in teaching and mentoring and doing my absolute best every single day to provide excellent patient care and advance medical knowledge through research. For me, this award is a recognition of those efforts. Mentor comment: Hunter dedicated a year to devel - oping a skill set in vulvar dermatoses, an under - studied area of dermatology with very few experts nationally. Under the guidance of Dr. Mauskar, Hunter provided compassionate care to women with vulvar lichen sclerosus, a condition that causes pain and disfigurement. Hunter continues to excel broadly, pushing himself to be the best physician he can be. - Tamia Harris-Tryon, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Dermatology and Immunology, and Melissa Mauskar, M.D., Associate Professor of Dermatology and Obstet - rics and Gynecology Background and family: I grew up in Blue Ridge, Texas, and have a younger brother and sister. I'm incredibly proud of my family, who taught me the importance of hard work and always caring for those around you. What led to your career path: Growing up on a ranch taught me that I needed to work hard and take things into my own hands to go where I wanted in life. Shadowing at Parkland Memorial Hospital during college showed me the incredible difference that compassionate clinical care and comprehensive education can make in patient lives and convinced me to pursue medicine. I fell in love with dermatology, a specialty that satisfied both my passion for patient education and coun - seling and also my basic science and investiga - tive curiosities. College: I completed my premedical studies at Johns Hopkins University after graduating with honors from Southern Methodist University. UTSW activities: I volunteered for UTSW Carnaval de Salud and founded the rural initiative of Learn - 4Free tutoring, which provides free math and science tutoring and mentoring to middle and high school students in Texas.

I grew up in many different places - Cali - fornia, Illinois, and Massachusetts - before ulti -mately settling in Texas. That upbringing not only broadened my worldview but also helped me recog - nize the growth that comes from experiencing different ways of living and the value in appreci - ating the richness of cultures beyond my own. What led to your career path: My mom was the first physician in our family, and her dedication to her patients inspired me. I felt my personal values aligned most with those of family medicine. Social justice is embedded in the philosophy of this specialty, and it trains you to see your patients holistically in the context of the systemic factors that influence their ability to be well. College: I majored in biology at UT Dallas. I was a peer health educator in our Student Wellness Center and a peer-led team-learning tutor for students in General Chemistry I and II, which sparked my interest in mentorship. I was also Presi - dent of the Intersectional Feminist Alliance. UTSW activities: Between my third and fourth years of medical school, I graduated with a Master of Public Health degree from Emory University. One of the activities that's brought me the most joy is being in the Lymph Notes, our campus a cappella group! I also performed in The Vagina Monologues , which was so fun. I've been involved with Medical Students for Choice and served in leadership roles for the Healthy Living and Medical Humanities Interest Group as a pre-clerkship student. Surprising fact: I'm a huge sci-fi nerd. My mom and I both grew up on Star Trek . Ultimate career goal: My ultimate goal is to make my patients feel seen, heard, and respected every day, and to work to transform the system to make it better. Future plans: My immediate next step is the University of Washington Family Medicine Residency Program.The son of a rural family physician, Dr. Nathan Liddle came to medical school fully prepared for the rigors of training.

What this award means: This award is mean - ingful to me personally because it's a little bit of proof to me that I'm trying to be the best physi - cian that I can be. Mentor comment: Nathan is always the student who has done the reading and arrives prepared, while his keen sense of humor brings fun to each session while still remaining on task. Residents who worked with him were impressed with his emotional intelligence, empathy, and clinical skill. Nathan is guaranteed to be a valued and trusted physician. - Stephanie Brinker, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine Background and family: I grew up in Utah, where my mom and two younger brothers still live. My father passed away from cancer about nine years ago, and I like to think that I'm helping preserve his legacy by becoming a doctor myself.What led to your career path: Growing up, my dad was a family physician, so that definitely influenced my career choice. After starting at UT Southwestern, this became even more apparent to me when I found out I liked each of my rotations and the breadth of knowledge they gave me. I didn't want to \"give up\" anything I was learning - I wanted to somehow involve all of it in my future practice. College: I attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where I graduated summa cum laude in microbiology. UTSW activities: I've been involved with the Family Medicine Interest Group since I've been here. It's a great group of people with similar commitments to full-spectrum, patient-centered care and faculty who really care about us and our goals.

Surprising fact: My first time in Texas was for medical school interviews, but I fell in love with it soon after. Ultimate career goal: My ultimate goal as a doctor is to be a friend to my patients. I want to be someone they can go to for not only their once-in-a-life - time problems, but the everyday stuff as well. Future plans: Right now, I plan to complete a resi - dency in family medicine at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth and probably return to the area where I grew up to practice. I envision having a full-scope practice involving pediatrics and obstetrics in addition to general adult medicine. Community service has been woven into Dr. Courtney Newman's educational journey since college, from service-learning trips in Peru to United to Serve volunteer duties at UT South - western. Up next for an Ob/Gyn residency, she is considering several different avenues following her training. What this award means: An individual's health cannot be adequately examined without the context of their surroundings and socioeconomic circumstances, a perspective that was confirmed through my coursework and clinical experiences. This award recognizes my volunteer efforts and research projects as attempts to tackle pervasive social inequities in public health outcomes by improving the education of health professionals to better educate patients and engage in more informed shared decision-making. Mentor comment: Courtney demonstrates the ideal of what we hope a combined medical and public health student can do to advance the health of our communities by understanding barriers to care. In our work together, she consistently brought flex - ibility, adaptability, and tenacity - not giving up when the work got messy and hard. She is devoted to bringing about meaningful change that uplifts communities. - Jaclyn Albin, M.D., Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine Background and family: I was born and raised in Dallas. My family members are engineers or computer science majors, so I am the first physi - cian in the family. What led to your career path: A close friend became very sick in high school, and seeing how her mental health diagnosis, menstrual cycles, and inflammatory bowel disease affected each other ignited an interest in Ob/Gyn that persisted throughout medical school. College: I graduated summa cum laude from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science in biomedical sciences and minors in neuro - science and music. I completed the Maroon & White Leadership Fellows and University Honors programs and was awarded the Margaret Rudder Community Service Award in 2018. I volunteered on service-learning trips in Cuzco and Lima, Peru, and served in various leadership positions for the university's Women's Chorus. UTSW activities: With United to Serve, I was a booth coordinator and later an education Chair for the Health Fair. I helped distribute COVID-19 vaccinations and antibody results to Dallas resi - dents, and incentives to participants of the DFW COVID-19 Prevalence Study. Surprising fact: Every year for 14 years, I partici- pated in a choir or a cappella group. The most memorable venue I sang in was Notre Dame in Paris, France, with my high school choir. Future plans: I plan to continue my education as an Ob/Gyn resident at Methodist Hospital in Houston. I am potentially interested in pursuing fellowships in maternal-fetal medicine or pedi - atric and adolescent gynecology, but I could also be fulfilled as a generalist.

Sparked by her intellectual curiosity and interest in the health of aging patients, she pursued research in geriatric dermatology and rheumatology and plans to pursue a career in rheumatology. What this award means: Whenever I think about the doctor I want to be, my greatest goal is to be able to diagnose, treat, and support patients through any issue they may be facing. Internal medicine is the specialty that will allow me to continue to strive toward this goal throughout my career as a lifelong learner. Mentor comment: Curious by nature, Pooja was noted to be reading extensively on all her cases. She is motivated by the challenge of managing the complex care of older patients and is sustained by the relationships forged in the continuous care of these patients. A career in rheumatology will suit her intellectual curiosity and deep interest in her patients. We envision Pooja will be a leader in her future residency program and beyond. - Stephanie Brinker, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal MedicineBackground and family: I am Indian-American and a proud Texan. My parents are both soft - ware engineers. I am the first person to become a doctor in my family. I also have a younger sister and brother who are hoping to become physi - cians, while my husband is an internal medicine resident in Boston. What led to your career path: I grew up in Coppell, Texas. My biggest role models growing up were physicians in my community who helped take care of my family and friends. They helped me realize that doctors find deep satisfaction and meaning in their careers, which sparked my interest in medicine. Moreover, I was a voracious reader in middle school. I loved reading novels about mystery and detective work, and the process of gathering evidence to support or disprove a hypothesis. As I entered medical school, I real-ized that becoming a physician was the best of both worlds: I was able to become the detective I always wanted to be, and I could also help people in my community. College: I graduated in three years from UT Dallas, summa cum laude, with a Bachelor of Arts in biology. I made the Dean's List, Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, and Golden Key International Honour Society. I also worked as a peer-led team leader to help students learn college physics. UTSW activities: I served as a United to Serve Volun- teer Committee Chair for all four years of medical school. During my first and second years, I served as a Clinic Project Manager at the Union Gospel Mission, an experience that piqued my interest in internal medicine. Ultimate career goal: I want to learn as much as I can to help my future patients. You never really stop learning new things in your career as there's always something to learn from each patient. Future plans: Foremost, I hope to become an excel - lent internist and am headed to a residency at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School in Massachu - setts. Afterward, I am considering specializing in rheumatology, geriatrics, or allergy/immunology.Dr. Daniel Galvan's journey to medicine is connected to his aim of giving back to the community where he grew up. Initially intending to pursue a career in chemical engineering, he switched gears in college to pursue medicine - a career with more human interaction and direct impact on people's lives. What this award means: This award has further confirmed internal medicine was the right choice for me. Mentors' comment: Daniel has a knack for putting patients at ease and making them feel heard even while delicately weaving through complex conversations. He is self-motivated and driven; his involvement in multiple longitudinal research projects is a testament to his thirst for knowledge and his eagerness to contribute. Daniel has the makings of an accomplished physician. - Ahmad Anshasi, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine, and Reeni Abraham, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine Background and family: I was born and raised in Mission, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley. I am a first-generation student whose father works in the oil fields and whose mother is a stay-at-home mom. My wife, a UTSW medical student, and I got married during medical school but have been together since high school. What led to your career path: I decided I wanted to go into medicine late into my sophomore year of college. Although I enjoyed chemical engi - neering, I desired different things from a career. I found that medicine offered all the similar critical thinking and problem-solving that engi - neering had but also offered more human inter - action and the opportunity to directly impact people's lives every day. College: I graduated summa cum laude from Texas A&M University and majored in chemical engineering. I also received the Academic Excel - lence Award from the Department of Chem - ical Engineering. UTSW activities: I held leadership roles in the Future Doctors Pipeline Program, Cardiology Interest Group, and Latino Medical Student Asso - ciation. I participated in various research projects on topics including cardiomyopathy in muscular dystrophy patients, IBD, skin cancer risk knowl - edge in transplant patients, and GLP-1 agonists. Ultimate career goal: My wife and I plan to return to the Rio Grande Valley, practice medicine there, and give back to our community. Ideally, I would like to get involved in teaching medical students and residents. Future plans: I am going into residency at the University of Colorado School of Medicine with an open mind, but I am currently interested in either hospital medicine or potentially pursuing a fellowship in gastroenterology. Pooja Marella Achanta, M.D. Daniel Galvan, M.D. About the award: The award, presented to one or more top medical students in internal medicine, was established by Ross H. and Anne Seymour Hemphill in honor of their son and daughter-in-law, Dr. and Mrs. Seymour Hemphill; their daughter and son-in-law, Dr. and Mrs. Bernard Gojer; and Anne Hemphill's parents, E.

I grew up alongside my older sister, Tara, who is also my role model and best friend. My grandmother, a family medicine prac - titioner; mom, a neurologist; and dad, a cardiolo - gist; all serve as role models for a career in medi - cine. As a third-generation female physician, I hope to make them all proud. What led to your career path: During my undergrad - uate training, I discovered a passion for reproduc - tive health advocacy and basic sciences that led me to pursue medicine. At UTSW, I fell in love with the clinical challenges of internal medicine in combination with the purpose I felt working alongside patients to understand their diagnoses. When thinking about my future career, I envision not only challenging myself academically but also serving a larger purpose of advocating for people. College: I received my Bachelor of Arts in medi - cine, health, and society from Vanderbilt Univer - sity, graduating with honors.UTSW activities: I helped lead the Women's Health Enrichment elective and volunteered with the Health Professions Recruitment and Exposure Program. I also worked on gender-affirming care research. During my last year of medical school, I served as a peer mentor and worked on the Gold Humanism Honor Society Humans of Parkland Committee. Surprising fact: I was a competitive gymnast for over 10 years. I am so thankful to the sport for teaching me invaluable lessons in discipline, determination, and dedication. Future plans: This summer, I will start my resi - dency in internal medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. I plan to pursue my interests in cardiology, women's health, and gender-affirming care.While attending college, Dr. Sydney Mulqueen volunteered at a local hospital and nursing homes. One experience that left a lasting impression on her involved visiting with a man who lived to be 100, as she became captivated by his stories. That inspired her interest in geriatric medicine and helping older adults live long, fulfilling lives. What this award means: My interest in geriatric medicine was sparked when volunteering with the Hospital Elder Life Program at UTSW. I learned the importance of providing geriatric-specific medical care. I utilized my Scholarly Activity block to implement a geriatric medicine pre-clerk - ship elective. In this elective, students are paired with older adults to learn about geriatric medicine in the context of seeing seniors as individuals with unique backgrounds and interests. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to expand the geri - atric-specific medical school curriculum at UTSW and am honored to be the recipient of this award. Mentor comment: Sydney created and then helped lead a geriatric enrichment elective for four semes - ters, providing students with opportunities to learn and discuss the intricacies of providing age- friendly care. She is a champion for age-friendly care. Her future patients are fortunate to have her caring and advocating for them. - Jessica Voit, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine Background and family: I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, and moved to Dallas after I gradu - ated from college. What led to your career path: I grew up in a family that placed great value on service. I spent a lot of time in college volunteering at the local hospital and nursing homes. One of the most special opportunities I had involved reading to an older adult who became a centenarian during my time there. Talking with him and learning more about his past became something I looked forward to each week, and this experience certainly shaped my career path. College: I attended the University of Notre Dame, earning a bachelor's degree in neuroscience and behavior. I graduated magna cum laude and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. UTSW activities: After my first year, I served on the UTSW PRE+OP Committee, helping to design and organize the orientation week for incoming medical students. I have also enjoyed helping with MS0 Weekend for the past four years, specifically leading the Community and Service breakout session. I have also loved spending time as a peer mentor, providing guidance to first- and second-year medical students. Surprising fact: I am a classically trained pianist. Future plans: I will be pursuing a residency in emer - gency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Massachusetts. I hope to become more involved in geriatric emergency medicine, focusing on how to tailor my care to the older adults in my community. Ava Wilson, M.D. Sydney Mulqueen, M.D. About the award: The award recognizes a medical student who demonstrates excel - lence in internal medicine. It is named after Dr. Salomon, who graduated from UTSW in 1967 and died shortly thereafter.About the award: The Sulkin-Schein Award recognizes a medical student who has demonstrated compassion, keen interest, and commitment to the care of older adults. The award is named in honor of Mrs. Schein, a longtime supporter of UT Southwestern who bequeathed funds to promote geriatrics as a career path for medical students. She died in 2007 at the age of 89.Page 11 April/May 2023 COMMENCEMENT CELEBRATION Lisa Thiele, M.D., M.P.H. Southwestern Gynecologic Assembly AwardHolt Garner, M.D. Annelle M. Ahmed, M.D. Women's Health Care Award In college, Dr. Lisa Thiele spent time shadowing an Ob/Gyn and was entranced by that physi - cian's work. This experience led her to the same specialty as a career choice, with a focus on advo - cating for women's rights. What this award means: I am incredibly grateful to receive this award. It was wonderful to work with residents and faculty in the Department during research and throughout my rotations. Being recognized for my work is an honor. Mentor comment: Lisa's passion for obstetrics and gynecology was evident early in medical school. She actively participated in educational activities for students as well as research projects focused on anemia and the inclusion of pregnant and lactating women. Her first-author plenary presentation at this year's Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, an international meeting, won the overall award for best research on Diversity/ Disparity in Health Outcomes. - Catherine Spong, M.D., Chair and Professor of Obstet - rics and Gynecology Background and family: I grew up in Coventry, Rhode Island, as the youngest of four siblings. After participating in a fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in the fifth grade, I knew that I wanted to be a doctor. I am the first person in my family to go to medical school. What led to your career path: As an undergraduate, I shadowed an Ob/Gyn in the operating room and became instantly hooked. Throughout medical school and during my classes for my Master of Public Health degree, I realized that I wanted to center advocacy in my career. In my clerkships and my research projects, I saw all the ways that a career in Ob/Gyn would allow me to advocate for women's rights, both on a legislative level and in my daily clinical duties. College: I majored in health and exercise science at Wake Forest University. I was heavily involved in One Thousand Schools, an organization focused on raising money to build schools in Honduras and increase access to education for girls. I also tutored for general and organic chemistry. UTSW activities: As co-President for the American Medical Women's Association Chapter in my first and second year of medical school, I was able to help organize mentorship opportunities for medical students. I also participated in the Patient Navigator Program, which connects people expe - riencing homelessness with a team of health professions students who aid them in navigating barriers to health care. Surprising fact: I foster animals for the SPCA. To date, I have fostered over 20 cats and dogs through the SPCA of Texas. Ultimate career goal: My ultimate goal is to make patients feel understood while advocating for my patients to have autonomy over their health decisions. Future plans: I am headed to a residency in Ob/ Gyn here at UT Southwestern next year, and I ultimately hope to pursue a career in maternal- fetal medicine.Influenced by exceptional teachers growing up, Dr. Holt Garner developed a passion for learning and service. His initial pull toward business shifted to medicine after working as a volun - teer accountant. What this award means: I'm inspired by the example of Dr. Ahmed and honored that her legacy of care and service will guide me through the transition of becoming an obstetrician/ gynecologist. Mentor comment: Holt's passion for women's health was evident in his first year and continued throughout medical school. He has demonstrated a devotion to the school, the community, and to women's health. I have personally witnessed his clinical care, and patients have pulled me aside to comment on his compassion, knowledge, and professionalism. - Catherine Spong, M.D., Chair and Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Background and family: I grew up in Decatur, Texas. My parents worked in my public school system. My father is a retired basketball coach and math teacher, while my mother works in the adminis - tration office. My older sister, Kelsey, is a teacher. They taught me to strive for excellence and the values of compassion, honesty, and service.What led to your career path: I was surrounded by exceptional teachers who instilled in me a love of learning and conversation. I expected to translate those experiences into a career in business but was tugged toward medicine by the stories I heard during my volunteer accounting work. Through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, an organiza - tion that delivers free tax preparation services to members of the community with limited access to tax resources, I was exposed to the consequences of our health care and insurance systems and felt I could contribute more to my community as a physician. I learned of the inspiring work that Parkland Memorial Hospital was doing to improve access and costs of health care and knew from that moment on that I wanted to train at UT Southwestern. College: I attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude with degrees in accounting and biology and a minor in chemistry. I also worked as a resident assistant, admissions ambassador, and teaching assistant on our Center for Presidential History's World War II study abroad experience in England and France. UTSW activities: I am a member of the Gold Humanism Honor Society, and I co-chair the Ethics Lectures Committee, which challenges medical students to think through ethical dilemmas relevant to their rotations. I have additionally been on the leadership teams of our PRIDE student group and the inaugural Anti- Racism Action Subcommittee. Future plans: I am looking forward to begin - ning my career as a physician in obstetrics and gynecology, staying on at UT Southwestern for my residency. Lisa Thiele, M.D., M.P.H. Holt Garner, M.D. About the award: The award is given annually to an outstanding UT Southwestern Medical School graduate pursuing a career in obstet - rics and gynecology.About the award: The award honors Dr. Ahmed, an Obstetrics and Gynecology faculty member who died of breast cancer at age 39. The recipient demonstrates exem - plary women's health care and epitomizes the clinician that Dr. Ahmed was - caring, intelligent, and involved in her community. Mackenzie Parker, M.D. Kurt Ian Wey, M.D., Senior Pediatric AwardAmanda Marie Galvan, M.D. Pediatric Society of Greater Dallas Award for Excellence in Pediatric Medicine Since high school, Dr. Mackenzie Parker has had a heart for helping children, ranging from assisting kids with special needs to children of refugees and those in foster care. As a pediatri - cian, she wishes to become an advocate for chil - dren and also be part of a team focused on the best outcome for the child. What this award means: It is a great honor to be selected for this prestigious award. It is especially meaningful to receive this award knowing the legacy and memory of Kurt Ian Wey that it honors. Mentor comment: Beyond the grace and humility she brings to the field, Mackenzie has a passion to work with the most vulnerable of children. Her desire to not only lead the care delivery effort, but to do so in a patient-centered way that empha - sizes shared decision-making, has been born out of years of working with special needs kids in high school, refugee children in college, and lately, foster children in medical school. - Soumya Adhikari, M.D., Associate Professor of Pediatrics Background and family: I come from a family who loves science, as both of my parents work in chemistry. I met my husband during college, and we were married during my second year of medical school.What led to your career path: I have always loved interacting with and taking care of children. Pediatrics will allow me to be an advocate for kids and invest in my community to improve the health of children. College: I graduated magna cum laude from Rice University in Houston, Texas, with a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry and cell biology. I had the privilege of being a counselor at a summer camp for children whose parents were diag - nosed with cancer, which sparked my passion for working with kids. UTSW activities: During medical school, I deep - ened my passion for advocating for children and invested in clinical research in pediatric hema - tology. I served as a volunteer Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for children in the foster care system. I also worked closely with my mentor, Ayesha Zia, M.D., Associate Professor of Pediatrics, to produce several research products in pediatric hematology. Surprising fact: I was once a volunteer dog trainer for a guide dog organization. I spent a year and a half training a puppy to work as a Seeing Eye dog. Ultimately, the dog I trained did not make it as a service dog and is now my beloved pet. Ultimate career goal: My goal is to become a compassionate, competent, and thoughtful pedi - atrician who can both come alongside patients and families in their time of need and also be a source of comfort and an advocate for them in promoting healthy growth and development. Future plans: I will start my pediatrics residency this summer at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. I am interested in several areas of pediatrics, including hospital medicine, neona - tology, and hematology/oncology.The compassion of a pediatrician who helped Dr. Amanda Marie Galvan and her mother with a family matter led her to pursue that specialty as a career. Now, Dr. Galvan would like to give back to others, in particular helping other children in the area where she grew up in the Rio Grande Valley. What this award means: The Pediatrics faculty at UT Southwestern are phenomenal, and I am so honored to have been selected for this award. I am inspired and motivated to continue to advocate for children and their families. Mentor comment: As a learner, Mandy was consis - tently commended for her growth mindset. She has a tremendous acumen for the adverse child - hood experiences faced by many in high-risk Latin communities, and I have no doubt she will be a force of change increasing access to medical care for these children. - Soumya Adhikari, M.D., Associate Professor of Pediatrics Background and family: I am originally from the Rio Grande Valley. I am a first-generation college student and medical student. My mom and grandma are both stay-at-home moms and are my role models as strong, independent women. I have a younger sister and brother whom I love very dearly, and they are among the reasons I chose pediatrics. My husband is currently a medical student, and we have a 3-year-old corgi that keeps us both on our toes. What led to your career path: Growing up, I had a wonderful pediatrician who helped my mom and me through a difficult personal family matter. It was my pediatrician's strong compassion and guid - ance that initially drew me to pediatrics. Similarly, after hearing countless stories of people in my life not being able to access care or the lack of educa - tion in their care, I felt inspired to work toward making this less ubiquitous. Even today, I draw on those experiences to continue my journey and know that everything I am working toward is to provide my home community with a better future. College: I graduated from Texas A&M University with a double major in biomedical sciences and English. I was a teaching assistant for medical microbiology and a tutor for various science subjects. I was also on a kickball team and volun - teered at the local food bank and hospital. UTSW activities: I created a Spanish elective for medical students to increase the number of physicians who can communicate with Spanish patients and families. I also was a coordinator for the Future Doctor Pipeline Program, which aims to increase the number of youth going into medi - cine. In addition, I did research on making immi - grant child health care in Dallas more equitable and research that aims to improve outcomes and reduce disparities in Latino children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Surprising fact: I recently rediscovered my love for reading during medical school and have read about 10 books this year! I hope to have read 50 books by the time the year ends. Future plans: I am interested in general pediatrics or hospital medicine, next headed to my residency in pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. I love general medicine and value taking care of the entire patient. Mackenzie Parker, M.D. Amanda Marie Galvan, M.D. About the award: The award recognizes a fourth-year medical student who shows empathy and compassion for sick children, has significant knowledge, and maintains a good sense of humor. Dr. Wey was a 1998 UT Southwestern graduate who died in a car accident. The award was established by family and friends to honor his life. About the award: The award recognizes an outstanding graduate who has the personal character and dedication to serve, as well as be an advocate for, children.Page 12 April/May 2023 Looking back at 80 years of excellence for recipients of the Medical School's top graduate award medical school and was accepted to the Dean's Research Scholar program for 2018-2019, during which she discov - ered a love for basic science research,\" added Blake Barker, M.D., Associate Dean of Students, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, and Chair of the Student Awards Committee. After her third year of medical school, Dr. Stuard joined the Perot Family Scholars Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at UT Southwestern. She received a National Institutes of Health F30 Predoctoral Fellowship grant from the National Eye Institute to study dry eye disease mito - chondrial health. \"After one year of dedicated research, I acquired a passion,\" Dr. Stuard said. As an MSTP student, Dr. Stuard investigated what happens in cells of the cornea during eye disease. Working in the laboratory of Danielle Robertson, O.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology, she published nine first-author papers. Last year, Dr. Stuard successfully defended her Ph.D. and published a study in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology's journal. \"To me, the eyes are the most magical part of the human body: a combination of art, emotion, and science,\" she said. \"I hope to mold this interest I have developed through both my laboratory and clinical experiences to make contributions in restoring sight to those who have lost it.\" She gives credit to outstanding mentors for her success, especially the support she received from Dr. Robertson. \"Dr. Robertson emphasized the importance of eloquently conveying my vision and growing my network, and she helped me prepare for national presentations. Most of all, she gave me the opportunity to cultivate mentor - ship skills of my own,\" Dr. Stuard said, adding that she would like to model herself after Dr. Robertson and physician-scientist Andrew Zinn, M.D., Ph.D., Dean of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and a Professor of Internal Medicine with a secondary appointment in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development. \"Like them, I aspire to work as a research scientist at an academic insti - tution and to be a part of the leadership of that institution,\" she said. As for her immediate post-gradua - tion plans, Dr. Stuard will head off to Johns Hopkins University this summer, where she matched for her residency to pursue her career in ophthalmology. Growing up in Plano, Texas, with two sisters, Dr. Stuard loved math and science from an early age and gradu - ated from the Texas Academy of Math - ematics and Science in Denton. She then enrolled in UT-PACT, a seven-year combined B.A./M.D. program at UT Dallas and UT Southwestern. Her initial attraction to medicine has a family connection. Her mother is a registered nurse in emergency medi - cine, while her father recently retired as an elementary school principal. Another strong influence was Robert Gunby, M.D., who delivered Dr. Stuard when she was born and remains her physician to this day. \"He is a leader in the Texas Medical Association (TMA). One of my favorite memories was being able to work along - side him in the TMA since we were both delegates of the TMA to the American Medical Association,\" she added. Dr. Stuard's dedication to commu - nity service grew from her work in middle and high school in the National Charity League, a mother-daughter philanthropic organization. At UT Southwestern, that devotion continued as she co-founded a student interest group focused on disabilities and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Cradled with Love, which has provided more than 1,000 mothers with baby wraps to allow for \"kangaroo care,\" skin-to-skin contact between a care - giver and child to promote bonding. In addition, she was one of three medical students who co-founded and manages Brother Bill's Helping Hand student-run free clinic - which provides pediatric care and public health education in an underserved community in Oak Lawn. Through an international Schweitzer Fellowship, Dr. Stuard created a STEM Empowerment and Education Course for 250 middle school students and also used a $2,000 TMA Foundation grant for a STEM project that inspired more than 4,000 students to consider careers as aerospace engineers. While at UTSW, Dr. Stuard received the Gold Presiden - tial Service Award for volunteer hours four times and was a finalist for the UTSW Martin Luther King Jr. Scholar - ship Award in 2016. Through it all, she never stopped learning. She said a clinical rotation at a Dallas County hospital taught her how language and cultural barriers can impact patient care. \"In hopes of better relating to my patients, I took Spanish classes through medical school, building on my previous expo - sure during a college semester abroad in Spain,\" she said. \"While not a substi - tute for a medical translator, I found that small conversations and actions were crucial in bringing comfort to a patient's experience. I found this personal touch to be an integral part of my own satisfaction and joy in prac - ticing medicine.\" Anytime she encounters a need, she tries to envision a response. A past Presi - dent of UTSW's TMA student chapter, Dr. Stuard helped lead its selection as the 2022 TMA Student Chapter of the Year, and she helped author more than 30 policies to improve patient care through her volunteer advocacy, she said. Asked how she can do it all, she laughed and said, \"A lot of coffee and a continual hunger to keep pushing forward!\" Medical school also held one more adventure for Dr. Stuard. During a traditional multiday Indian wedding in the Dallas area in April, she married UTSW Medical School graduate Varun Sambhariya, M.D., who was completing his resi - dency in orthopedic surgery at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. \"We first met each other when I was only 15 years old and joined the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science. He was one year ahead of me and went off to the University of Southern Cali - fornia for college. We re-met my first year of medical school when he was an MS2,\" she said. \"We started dating a couple of weeks into my first year of medical school and have been together for the last eight years!\" The couple plans to reunite in Balti- more after Dr. Sambhariya completes a spine fellowship at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle during the next academic year. And although she planned to walk at graduation under her maiden name, once she arrives in Baltimore for her next adventure, she will be known as Dr. Whitney Stuard Sambhariya. Dr. Zinn holds the Rolf Haberecht and Ute Schwarz Haberecht Dean- ship of the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.Ho Din Award Continued from page 1By Carol Marie Cropper For the past 80 years, the Ho Din Award has been bestowed on UT Southwestern Medical School graduates or members of faculty who exemplify the ideals of medicine. Winners have gone on to teach at Harvard, lead major hospitals, make research breakthroughs, and earn presti - gious awards in medicine - including the Nobel Prize. One beloved graduate even had a statue erected in his honor. Michael McMahan, President and CEO of Southwestern Medical Foundation, holds deep respect for Ho Din awardees. \"Students who are truly extraordinary - who manifest the best of what it means to be a caregiver and healer - are the ones chosen to receive this award,\" he explained. \"It makes perfect sense that many of them go on to lead illustrious professional lives.\" The community and campus leaders who established what initially was called Southwestern Medical College in 1943 passed a resolution committing the school to awarding the Ho Din each year to one or two graduating students who best exemplified the medical wisdom and human understanding of a great physician, along with occasional honorary awards given to faculty and administrators. Since then, 92 rising physicians from gradu - ating classes and 15 of the faculty who helped found UT Southwestern or later provided lead - ership have been recognized with the Ho Din Award, which comes with a medal and certificate. Students also receive a scholarship with the award. Among the honorary winners are Charles Cameron Sprague, M.D., UT Southwestern's first President, and Donald W. Seldin, M.D., Chair of Internal Medicine from 1952 through 1988. As for the student winners, many went on to top-ranked medical institutions for their residen-cies or fellowships. Two recent graduates (Priyanka Gaur, M.D., M.P.H., and Natasha Houshmand, M.D., from 2020 and 2021, respectively) headed to residencies at Johns Hopkins Medicine, while a third, Cayenne Price, M.D., 2022, decided to remain UT Southwestern. \"I knew the caliber of training here would make me an exceptionally skilled, well-rounded anesthesiologist and provide me with unique experiences that I wouldn't have elsewhere,\" said Dr. Price. Following their training, many Ho Din winners choose to spend at least part of their careers in academia, teaching future doctors. About 25 past Ho Din student winners either returned to UT Southwestern or gravitated to other top teaching hospitals, determined to leave their mark on the future of medicine. One, Patricia Ashley, M.D., Ph.D. (Class of 1991), became an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine. Another, George N. Papaliodis, M.D. (1995), is an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. \"When I won the Ho Din Award in 1995, I felt incredibly honored and humbled to receive this distinction. Graduating with this award from a world-respected institution opened doors and training programs that would have previously been unattainable,\" said Dr. Papaliodis, now Director of the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Service at Harvard. Physicians who opt for academic medicine often do so because of the intellectual stimulation and desire to form future physicians as well as the additional opportunities of conducting research, many past Ho Din Award recipients say. James B. Cutrell, M.D. (2007), now Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Director of the Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program at UT Southwestern, helped lead the charge to find treatments against COVID-19 after the pandemic struck in 2020 - an effort he probably would not have been part of in a private practice. \"Receiving the Ho Din Award was and still remains one of the highlights of my medical career,\" Dr. Cutrell said. \"To be mentioned among such an esteemed group of UTSW Medical School graduates is humbling and truly a privilege. Now, I am able to give back to the institution by serving as a member of the teaching faculty, which is a way to 'pay forward' the wisdom gained and rich clinical and academic experiences to those I get to train.\" Another Ho Din winner, Barbara Eliza - beth Murray, M.D. (1973), Professor and Infec - tious Disease Researcher at UTHealth Houston McGovern Medical School, became recognized for her expertise in antibiotic resistance. Meanwhile, perhaps the most famous Ho Din winner of all is Joseph Goldstein, M.D. (1966), who made international headlines when he shared the 1985 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery by him and his research partner, Michael Brown, M.D., of the low-density lipopro - tein receptor and their work on how these recep - tors control human cholesterol levels. This line of research laid the groundwork for the later finding on statin drugs as a treatment for high cholesterol and heart disease. Dr. Goldstein is now Chair of the Molecular Genetics Department at UT South- western, where Dr. Brown is a Professor of Molec - ular Genetics and Internal Medicine. \"When I received the Ho Din Award, I was just a young medical student,\" Dr. Goldstein said. \"Now, 57 years later, I guess I am sort of a role model for the younger generation of medical students.\" Two other Ho Din winners also received national and international attention - but for a tragedy. George Thomas Shires, M.D. (1948), and Charles James Carrico, M.D. (1961), were both surgeons at Parkland Memorial Hospital on the November day in 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was rushed there after being shot while riding in a motorcade in downtown Dallas. Dr. Carrico was the first doctor to tend to the stricken President. Dr. Shires, then Parkland's Chief of Surgical Services, flew in from a meeting in Galveston to attend to the President. It was Dr. Shires who later announced that President Kennedy was dead on arrival at the hospital. Despite this traumatic moment, both men went on to major accomplishments in medicine. Dr. Carrico became Chief of Surgery or Chairman of Surgery at various teaching hospitals and was Chairman of the American Board of Surgery and a former President of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Dr. Shires was Dean of the medical college at Cornell University and Surgeon in Chief at New York Hospital. He helped estab - lish major burn centers in Seattle and New York, and his research led to the treatment advance - ment of giving saline solution to surgical and trauma patients. Another from the academic medicine side, George Ellison Hurt Jr., M.D. (1957), founded a urology clinic for spina bifida patients and served as President of the National Society for Pedi - atric Urology as well as being a former Associate Professor at UT Southwestern. Many Ho Din winners who bypassed academic medicine still left their mark - becoming leaders at institutions where they practiced in their commu - nities. Among them are Sherman Tipton Coleman, M.D. (1951), who was Chief of Surgery at a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, as well as President of the Corpus Christi Surgical Society. For such local efforts, some Ho Din winners were clearly beloved by their communities. Billy Paul Kincaid, M.D. (1959), received a Hippo - cratic Award from the local medical society for Lubbock/Crosby/Garza counties. Mary Alice Bone (Adamson), M.D. (1955), the first female Ho Din winner, is well known in the community of Jacksonville, Texas, where she was born and prac - ticed for many years. She retired from volunteering at a clinic in nearby Ballard when she was 90. She had earlier worked with a clinic affiliated with the Jacksonville hospital where her father, then a doctor in town, delivered her as a newborn. A Ho Din winner who followed her, Ruby Elizabeth Andrews Kassanoff, M.D. (1996), recently served as President of the Dallas County Medical Society. But Kent Eugene Rogers, M.D. (1971), may be the best example of such local love. Dr. Rogers served as Chief of Staff of a hospital in Navarro County, Texas, and Medical Director of the Corsi - cana/Navarro County Health Department. He also was a member of the school board and team physi - cian for the Corsicana High School Tigers. In 2019, two years before his death, the town erected a bronze statue in his honor. \"For 80 years, the Ho Din Award has inspired students to lead with compassion and serve their community with deep purpose,\" Mr. McMahan said. \"The ideal this award represents showcases the qualities of students and faculty UT Southwestern produces in service to communi - ties across our state.\" Dr. Brown, a Regental Professor, holds The W. A. (Monty) Moncrief Distinguished Chair in Cholesterol and Arteriosclerosis Research, and the Paul J. Thomas Chair in Medicine. Dr. Goldstein, a Regental Professor, holds the Julie and Louis A. Beecherl, Jr. Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Research, and the Paul J. Thomas Chair in Medicine.Ho Din Award winners: Where are they now? Keeping the Ho Din legacy alive, James B. Cutrell, M.D., in 2022 presented the Ho Din to Cayenne Price, M.D. Today, Dr. Cutrell is an infectious disease specialist at UT Southwestern while Dr. Price is a resident at UTSW in anesthesiology and pain management.Page 13 April/May 2023 Ho Din Award winners through the years Year Name Current or last known position Speciality 2022 Cayenne Price, M.D. Resident, UTSW Anesthesiology 2020 Priyanka Gaur, M.D., M.P.H.Resident, Johns Hopkins Medicine Obstetrics and Gynecology 2019 Bethany Werner, M.D. Physician, Texas Health Presbyterian Obstetrics and Gynecology 2018 Philip D.

All were original department heads and included: Edward H. Cary, M.D., Founder and Presi - dent; Donald H. Slaughter, M.D., Dean; George T. Caldwell, M.D., Pathology; Alfred I. Folsom, M.D., Urology Training Program (and also Director of Parkland Hospital); Hugh L. Moore, M.D., Pediatrics; Jesse Bedford Shelmire Jr., M.D., Dermatology; Henry M. Winans, M.D., Chairman of Medicine; and Guy F. Witt, M.D., Neurology and Psychiatry. In 1943, the Southwestern Medical Foundation created Southwestern Medical College - the precursor to UT Southwestern Medical Center - and established the Ho Din Award the same year. Recognizing those who exem- plify the unique personal qualities embodied in all great physicians - medical wisdom and human understanding - the award has been given annually by the Foun- dation's Board of Trustees to one or two graduating medical students as well as to founding officials and occasional faculty members or administrators. Its name is an acronym for a Greek rendition of \"the spirit of medical wisdom.\" To date, the Ho Din has been bestowed on 92 students, all of whom were nominated by the Medical School and then approved by the Foundation. The award comes with a medal and certificate. The award represents the ideals and aspirations on which the school was built and continues to be the highest honor bestowed on a UT Southwestern medical student today.Medical School Founders: First Ho Din Recipients About the Ho Din Award Mary Alice Bone, M.D., was the first woman to be awarded the Ho Din in 1955. She practiced in her hometown of Jacksonville, Texas, as an Ob/Gyn for many years until she retired from volunteer work at a clinic at the age of 90. She credited her mother with inspiring her to attend medical school, which few women in 1950s did at the time.

The study revealed a new antiviral strategy in bacteria for the enzyme cGAS, which Dr. Chen had found acts as the trigger of a cellular signaling pathway that alerts the human immune system to invasion by disease-causing microbes. (See related story on page 1.) \"Our lab studies mammalian cGAS. I wanted to study bacterial cGAS and how it battles the viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages, so I introduced bacterial systems into our lab here at UT Southwestern,\" Dr. Jenson said. \"I'm very excited and honored to get this award. It's been a long path to get this project to comple - tion, and it took a large collaborative team, including my co-authors and colleagues in the Structural Biology Lab and the Macromolecular Biophysics Resource facilities,\" said Dr. Jenson, lead author of the Nature study. The award honors the contribu - tions that UT Southwestern's first Nobel Laureates, Drs. Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein, made to training the next generation of scientists. Dr. Brown is Director of the Erik Jonsson Center for Research in Molecular Genetics and Human Disease, and Dr. Goldstein is Chair of Molecular Genetics. Both are Professors of Molec - ular Genetics and Internal Medicine.The prize represents the highest recognition that the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences bestows on a postdoctoral researcher. In recogni - tion of his work, Dr. Jenson received a monetary award and the opportunity to deliver a University Lecture. \"Justin is a brilliant biochemist who is destined to do great things. He was fearless in setting up a new system to study anti-phage immunity in bacteria, which is quite a depar - ture from what my lab has been doing in the mammalian system,\" said Dr. Chen, Professor of Molecular Biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Insti - tute (HHMI) Investigator. \"He then followed his data and made a series of novel discoveries concerning the role of bacterial cGAS in anti-phage immune defense. The Brown-Goldstein Award is a wonderful recognition of Justin's talents, creativity, and contribution to research as a young scientist.\" In her nomination letter, Dr. Jenson's graduate school mentor, Amy E. Keating, Ph.D., of Massachusetts Insti - tute of Technology, provided details of his flexibility. \"Justin is fearless and readily able to change fields and learn new things as he did when he joined my group,\" Dr. Keating wrote. \"Finally, he is personally and intellectually generous to his lab mates and to junior students, including undergraduates, and he is able to work with a wide range of people and lead effective teams.\" Dr. Jenson's research, which centers on anti-phage innate immune signaling pathways in bacteria, used host-phage model systems to identify a novel protein modification in the bacteria that enhances their anti-phage response. The team then identified a phage-encoded protein that defends against the bacteria's actions. This then revealed a counterassault that bacteria use to overcome the viral defense. For unrelated research, award finalist Ashley Solmonson, Ph.D., received a Dean's Discretionary Award. Dr. Solmonson is a former postdoc - toral scholar who has since advanced to Assistant Instructor in the laboratory of Ralph DeBerardinis, M.D., Ph.D., Professor in the Children's Medical Center Research Institute at UT South - western, Chief of the Division of Pedi - atric Genetics and Metabolism, and an HHMI Investigator. Dr. Solmonson developed an approach to study metabolic changes during fetal and placental develop - ment for an inborn error of metabo - lism associated with mutations in the lipoyltransferase gene LIPT1 . Through that work, she was lead author of a Nature study that revealed distinct and organ-specific metabolic changes that are developmentally regulated. The insights from that study are being used to inform potential treat - ments for patients with this inborn error of metabolism. Dr. DeBerardinis and Dr. Chen are both members of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. DeBerardinis also has appointments in the McDermott Center for Human Growth and Devel - opment and in Pediatrics. Dr. Jenson was a Cancer Research Institute Irvington Fellow who also is supported by the Dermatology Research Training Program T32 Grant (T32AR065969). Dr. Brown, a Regental Professor, holds The W.A. (Monty) Moncrief Distinguished Chair in Cholesterol and Arteriosclerosis Research, and the Paul J. Thomas Chair in Medicine. Dr. Chen holds the George L. MacGregor Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science. Dr. DeBerardinis holds the Joel B. Steinberg, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Pediatrics, is a Sowell Family Scholar in Medical Research, and is a Robert L. Moody Sr. Faculty Scholar. Dr. Goldstein, a Regental Professor, holds the Julie and Louis A. Beecherl, Jr. Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Research, and the Paul J. Thomas Chair in Medicine.Molecular biologist wins Brown-Goldstein Award for work on immunity defenses that bacteria use species - from bacteria through mammals - indicates the pathway's fundamental importance in the immune system,\" said Dr. Chen, also an investigator in the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense. He explained that the Nature study reveals a mecha - nism that bacteria use to increase cGAS activity to overcome phage counterat - tacks. Viruses can only reproduce if they hijack the replication machinery of the cells they infect, so the bacteria's goal is to keep that from happening. Viruses try to hold off the bacte - ria's defense long enough to replicate - a matter of minutes in some cases - and bacteria try to conquer the phages before the viruses can reproduce, the researchers said. Dr. Chen said he hopes the work leads to a deeper understanding of human immunity at a time when infectious disease is a hot field of investigation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \"This work is not directly related to a specific human disease but addresses a fundamental question of how bacteria fight viral infection,\" he said. \"The study of anti-phage immune defense in bacteria led to the discovery of the CRISPR system that scientists now use for gene editing. We think ongoing studies of other path - ways of anti-phage immunity - such as the cGAS regulatory pathway we uncovered in this study - may also lead to new developments in biotech-nology and medicine.\" The bacterial defensive pathway featuring cGAS exists along with CRISPR and other defensive systems that bacteria have developed, Dr. Chen explained. The redundancy enables bacteria to launch new anti-phage weapons when one line of defense fails. The study represents a new direc - tion for the lab, which previously focused on mammalian cGAS. Lead author Justin Jenson, Ph.D., recently won the University's highest honor for postdoctoral researchers - the Brown-Goldstein Award - on the basis of the experiments in the Nature study. That prize is named for UT South- western's first Nobel Laureates, Michael S. Brown, M.D., and Joseph L. Gold - stein, M.D. (See related story above.)Dr. Jenson and the team identi - fied a novel protein modification that enhances the bacterial defense against phages and works through cGAS, mirroring the enzyme's role in humans. The team then turned to the virus side of the conflict and ran a genetic screen that revealed a phage-encoded protein that fights back against the bacteria's anti-phage response pathway. In both humans and bacteria, cGAS works in a signaling pathway to generate a second messenger, called cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), to fight virus invasion. The Chen lab found that some phages, like the ones in this study, can launch a counterattack to deflect cGAMP. \"Those phages produce an agent that functions like a 'sponge' to bind and sequester the cGAMP,\" said Dr. Chen. When successful, that counter - attack nullifies the bacteria's defense by preventing cGAMP from fighting off phage infection, buying time for the phages to replicate and infect nearby bacteria. But the battle doesn't end there. The researchers found that some bacteria have adapted to retaliate against a phage counterassault by increasing cGAS's enzyme activity, resulting in production of extra cGAMP to over - come the phage \"sponge attack.\" Dr. Jenson added that the battle between bacteria and phages has been evolving through billions of years, with both bacteria and phages contin- ually mutating to create new strategies to defeat one another in an ever-esca - lating back and forth. The interplay of bacterial and phage defense strategies is similar to the human response to disease-causing agents like bacteria and viruses although specific strategies vary. That's why a better understanding of the ancient bacteria-phage interac - tion could lead to insights into human disease and perhaps someday to strate - gies to treat or even prevent them, the researchers said. The work received support from the National Cancer Institute (U54CA244719), The Welch Foun - dation (I-1389), the Cancer Preven - tion and Research Institute of Texas (RP180725), the Cancer Research Institute CRI Irvington Postdoctoral Fellowship program, the Dermatology Research Training Program T32 Grant (T32AR065969), and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Parkey, M.D., Professor of Radi- ology, whose scientific discoveries helped develop nuclear scanning techniques to diag - nose, localize, and measure acute heart attacks noninvasively, has died. He was 84. Dr. Parkey served as the longest-acting Chair of Radiology at UT Southwestern - from 1977 until his retirement in 2010 - and made valuable contributions to nuclear scanning techniques used all over the world. He also was instrumental in developing dynamic blood pool imaging - a technique involving injection of a chemical compound that tagged red blood cells as they circulated throughout the bloodstream - which offered a less invasive, safer, and more accurate imaging option, especially for those who recently had heart attacks. \"Dr. Parkey had a profound impact across all missions of UT Southwestern. His legacy will be valued for many years to come,\" said W. P. Andrew Lee, M.D., Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, Provost, and Dean of UT Southwestern Medical School. Neil Rofsky, M.D., M.H.A, former Chair of Radiology, said receiving the baton from Dr. Parkey to lead the Department was an honor. \"I respected his knowledge and his manage - ment style,\" Dr. Rofsky said of his predecessor. \"The field of cardiac nuclear medicine and the subsequent implications for patient management were transformed by his meticulous, innovative, and collaborative approach.\"After receiving a bachelor's degree in physics from UT Austin, Dr. Parkey pursued his medical degree at UT Southwestern. He completed his residency in diagnostic radiology at Parkland Memorial Hospital and a fellowship in radiolog - ical data processing at the University of Missouri. Dr. Parkey returned to UTSW in 1970 and became Chief of Nuclear Medicine. In 1971, the National Research Council named him a James Picker Foundation Scholar in Radiology Research for his work investigating small computer processing of scintigram data used for diagnostic purposes. In 1977, Dr. Parkey was appointed Chair of Radiology. As Chair, Dr. Parkey embraced the rapid development of medical imaging and contributed to the development of the Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Facility, the Mary Nell and Ralph B. Rogers Magnetic Resonance Imaging Center, Zale Lipshy Pavilion - William P. Clem - ents Jr. University Hospital, and the Bill and Rita Clements Advanced Medical Imaging Building. Diane Twickler, M.D., Professor of Radiology and Obstetrics and Gynecology, called Dr. Parkey an inspirational innovator and leader. \"He brought the first MRI west of the Missis - sippi River and to UT Southwestern 40 years ago. This allowed medical students like me to expe - rience the wonders of imaging and choose the exciting field of radiology,\" Dr. Twickler said. \"His nuclear medicine research was groundbreaking, and his enthusiasm for sharing his passion of imaging among students and trainees was endless. His unconditional support, trust, and loyalty of his fellow faculty were unwavering.\" A committed educator who considered the many students and residents he trained through the years among his greatest accomplishments, Dr. Parkey received top teaching honors from UTSW students several times. He was appointed the Effie and Wofford Cain Distinguished Chair in Diagnostic Imaging in 1994. In 2007, he was honored by Parkland with its Hero of Our Heri - tage Award. He also was recognized with the Life - time Service Award from the American Board of Radiology (2010) and the Gold Medal from the Texas Radiological Society (2012). In 2016, the Department of Radiology established the Robert W. Parkey, M.D. Distinguished Professorship in Radiology in his honor. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be directed to UT Southwestern Medical Center, P.O. Box 910888, Dallas, TX 75391-0888 in memory of Robert W. Parkey. Dr. Lee holds the Atticus James Gill, M.D. Chair in Medical Science. Dr. Twickler holds the Dr. Fred Bonte Profes - sorship in Radiology. By Debbie Bolles Carole Mendelson, Ph.D., a national leader in the field of endocrinology and a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in science, died in February. The UT Southwestern Professor of Biochemistry and Obstetrics and Gynecology was 78. For more than three decades, Dr. Mendelson championed the promotion of women in science as an active member of the Endocrine Society. At UTSW, she was an inaugural member of the Women in Science and Medicine Advisory Committee from its inception in 1994 and co-chaired the committee for the past 12 years. She served as President of the UT Southwestern Faculty Senate from 1992-1993, and as President of the Society for Reproductive Investigation from 2022-2023. Her contributions to the field were recognized with multiple honors that included the Roy O. Greep Award for Outstanding Research and the Sidney H. Ingbar Distinguished Service Award from The Endocrine Society, the Mentoring Award from Women in Endocrinology, and both the President's Distinguished Scientist Award and an Award for Mentorship from the Society for Reproductive Investigation.\"Her death represents a great loss for the entire UT Southwestern community,\" said W. P. Andrew Lee, M.D., Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, Provost, and Dean of UT South- western Medical School. \"Dr. Mendelson's scientific acumen and her pioneering efforts for women's advancement in science have left an enduring imprint at the University.\" After receiving a Bachelor of Science in biology from the City College of New York and a Ph.D. in zoology from Rutgers University, Dr. Mendelson completed postdoctoral research in reproduction and pursued an endocrinology postdoctoral fellowship at the National Insti - tutes of Health. In 1978, she joined the UT Southwestern faculty. Her research into molecular mecha - nisms in developmental and hormonal regula - tion of key genes in perinatal biology and female reproduction won her national recognition. Her research focused on three key areas: transcrip - tional regulation of fetal lung development, placental development, and the function and molecular mechanisms regulating uterine func - tion in pregnancy and parturition. At the time of her death, she had an active National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant and a Burroughs Well - come Fund grant supporting her lab to study the impact of transcriptional regulation on fetal development. \"Carole was strongly committed to mentoring the next generation of scientists and was dedi - cated to fostering the careers of students and postdocs in her lab and in the Department.

We trust you completely,'\" Mr. Kivowitz recalled. Mr. Kivowitz was the founder and Chairman of Regency Post-Acute Healthcare System, which included 33 health care and rehabilitation facili - ties across Texas prior to its sale in 2016. Mutual friends introduced him to Claus Roehrborn, M.D., Professor and Chair of the Department of Urology at UT Southwestern. Over more than 20 years, Mr. Kivowitz and his wife, Stacey, learned about the impact of the Urology Department's research through conver - sations with Dr. Roehrborn and Margaret Pearle, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and the Department's Vice Chair of Academic Affairs. For more than two decades, the Kivowitzes have made gifts to support the William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital Plaza as well as the Department of Urology and urological disease research. With Dr. Roehrborn's encouragement, the couple recently made a gift to endow the Donald and Stacey Kivowitz Fund for the Harry M. Spence, M.D. Visiting Professorship in Urology. Focused on educating the next generation of urology specialists, the visiting professorship honors the late Dr. Spence, who served as Chief of Urology at UT Southwestern and Children's Medical Center Dallas. An international leader in urology, Dr. Spence was one of the first doctors certified by the American Board of Urology and helped develop the subspecialty of pediatric urology. For Mrs. Kivowitz - whose father, Samuel Dorfman Jr., M.D., graduated in 1967 from UT Southwestern Medical School - the couple's philanthropy reflects a hope to make the health care system as accessible for as many as possible. \"If our gift can help advance the visionary work being done at UT Southwestern, we are thrilled to help put a Dallas medical institution on the map,\" she said. The endowment will provide opportunities in perpetuity for the Department to invite promi-nent urologists to UT Southwestern to perform surgeries, attend conferences, and present lectures to residents and faculty. \"The Kivowitzes' gift helps us with our goal of covering a significant portion of the costs, enabling us to bring in some of the world's most elite urologists,\" said Dr. Roehrborn. Dr. Pearle holds the Dr. Ralph C. Smith Distin - guished Chair in Urologic Education. Dr. Roehrborn holds the E.E. Fogelson and Greer Garson Fogelson Distinguished Chair in Urology, and the S.T. Harris Family Chair in Medical Science, in Honor of John D. McConnell, M.D.Gift from Stacey and Don Kivowitz establishes visiting professorship in urology Don and Stacey KivowitzBy Deborah Wormser George Jackson, Ph.D., M.H.A., formerly a Professor at Duke University Medical Center, has joined UT Southwestern's Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health as a Professor of Public Health and founding Director of the Program for Implementation Science and Practice. \"Dr. Jackson will be an integral part of the University's new School of Public Health,\" said Celette Sugg Skinner, Ph.D., Interim Dean of the O'Donnell School of Public Health. The School, created to address health care needs in North Texas and beyond, is the fourth at UT South - western and its first added in 50 years. A Professor of Public Health and former Chair of the Department of Population and Data Sciences, Dr. Skinner is also the inaugural Asso - ciate Director of Population Science in the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. Jackson, who joined UTSW on Feb. 15, is a health care epidemiologist who leads the Imple - mentation Science Laboratory at the Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation in the Durham Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System in North Carolina. He also has an appointment at the VA North Texas Health Care System as he works to grow imple - mentation science and health care delivery research to improve the lives of North Texans. Health care delivery research seeks to deter - mine the best strategies for improving care while implementation science focuses on strategies to provide care innovations across populations.His research interests include the development and evaluation of team-based systems for treating and preventing chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and post-traumatic stress. Dr. Jackson is expected to teach his systems approach to UT Southwestern trainees. That outlook includes identifying factors that speed or slow the delivery of high-quality health care and working to get the most effective, evidence-based care to the highest number of people - the defini - tion of implementation science. \"UT Southwestern's goal is to create a top-tier school of public health. The Program on Imple -mentation and Improvement Science will support that vision as we seek to partner with North Texas health systems to implement clinical innovations to enhance medical care and patient well-being across the region,\" Dr. Jackson said. \"One example of this approach will be continuing to expand the relationship between UT Southwestern and the VA North Texas Health Care System. I hope that partnership will harness the expertise of both the VA and UT Southwestern to address the needs of veterans, and through research-based innova - tions, help people throughout the region. Dr. Jackson added that he looks forward to working with the newly announced O'Donnell School of Public Health Dean Saad Omer, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., an internationally known, results-oriented leader in the field. Dr. Omer, an epidemiologist who currently directs the Yale Institute for Global Health, will join UT Southwestern in June as the inaugural Dean of the O'Donnell School of Public Health. The School, which will admit its first class later this year, launched with a transformative $100 million gift from the O'Donnell Foundation, the largest gift to a school of public health at a public university in the U.S., and matching the third- largest gift supporting any school of public health. The new Program for Implementation Science and Practice within the School aims to develop and enhance education and health systems in North Texas through collaborations between the University and affiliated health systems and community partners. Plans include devel - oping a system to identify potentially successful projects using implementation and improve - ment science - which uses rigorous, data-driven research to expand programs and improve a community's health. \"Dr. Jackson is a leader in implementation science, with demonstrated success creating struc - tures and processes to support health care systems pursuing innovation to achieve the highest quality care,\" said Timothy Hogan, Ph.D., Asso - ciate Professor in the O'Donnell School of Public Health and a Research Health Scientist for the VA who has collaborated with Dr. Jackson on practice change initiatives across the national VA system. The new UTSW program aligns with priori - ties set in the University's Six-Year Plan and has received $1.8 million in funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration to estab - lish a physical home for faculty, educational programs, and other scholarly activities. The program will be based within the O'Donnell School of Public Health and will include participation of UT Southwestern Medical School faculty as well as clinical and operational leaders from UTSW's affiliated health systems: Children's Health, Parkland Health, Texas Health Resources, and VA North Texas.
