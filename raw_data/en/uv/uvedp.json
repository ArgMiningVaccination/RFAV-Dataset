Presenting author email: kpate5@jhmi.edu Introduction : Sensitive assays are needed for detection of residual HIV in patients with undetectable plasma viral loads to determine iferadication strategies are effective. The gold standard quantitativeviral outgrowth assay (QVOA) underestimates the magnitude of the viral reservoir, while sensitive PCR-based assays lack the ability to distinguish replication competent from defective virus. We soughtto determine whether xenograft of leukocytes from HIV-1 infectedpatients with undetectable plasma viral loads into severely immuno- compromised mice would result in viral amplification and measurable viral loads within the aberrant murine host.Methods : We evaluated whether xenograft of 1) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from five HIV-1 /C27patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), 2) PBMCs or purified resting CD4 /C27 T cells from 5 HIV-1 /C27elite suppressors (ES), or 3) PBMCs from undetectable plasma viral loads, into NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice resulted in viral amplification in the mouse. Successful xenograft of mice was confirmed by flow cytometry. Human CD8 /C27T cells were depleted in humanized mice with depleting antibody, and CD4 /C27T cells were activated in a subset of mice with activating anti-CD3. Plasma viral loads in xenografted mice were quantified using qRT-PCR, and compared to plasma viral load and QVOA results from the human or macaque donor.Results : With this murine viral outgrowth assay (MVOA), we amplified HIV-1 from all 10 HIV /C27subjects with undetectable plasma viral load, including an ES from whom we were unable to recover virus by QVOA. We detected HIV in mice an average of 20 days after xenograft withPBMCs from patients on suppressive ART, and an average of 28 days after xenograft with PBMCs or resting CD4 /C27T cells from ES. For two of the mice xenografted with CD4 /C27T cells from ES, we detected HIV only after activation with anti-CD3. We similarly detected SIV inmacaquized mice by seven days post-xenograft. Conclusions : The MVOA has the potential to serve as a powerful tool to identify residual HIV-1 in patients with undetectable viral loads,such as those who have undergone promising cure therapies. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20320 MOAA0102 Virologic and immunologic correlates of Reserve University, United States.4NCI/NIH, Frederick, United States.

Recently, a sustained control of HIV replication in the absence of ART has beenachieved in a subset of patients starting ART early after infection,defined as post-ART treatment controllers (PTC). Unfortunately, the virologic and HIVORAL ABSTRACTS MOAA0101 /C1Figure 1. MVOA for detection of residual virus.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/20479 1replication are still unclear, particularly in tissues. Here, we used the well-established model of SIV-infection in rhesus macaques (RMs) toinvestigate the existence of PTC in this model and the features associated with post-ART SIV control. Methods : Fifteen RMs (B*08 -and B*17) were infected (i.v.) with SIVmac239 . All 15 animals initiated a five-drug ART regimen 60 days after infection, which was maintained for seven months. ART was then inter- rupted and RMs monitored for eight additional months. Blood (PB), lymph node (LN) and colorectal (RB) biopsies were collected throughoutthe study. Quantitative assessment of total SIV-DNA and RNA was per-formed on purified blood CD4 T cells and mucosal tissues by quantitative PCR; immunological parameters wer e determined by flow cytometry. Results : ART suppressed SIV-RNA to B60 copies/mL in all RMs. After ART interruption, six RMs controlled SIV viremia at B10 3copies/mL up to eight months off-ART (PTC), while nine RMs rebounded to pre- ART levels (non-controllers, NC). At pre-ART, PTC had significantlylower plasma viremia and SIV-DNA content, as well as higher CD4 Tcellcounts as compared to NC. Levels of intestinal CD4 T cells were similar, but PTC had higher frequencies of Th17 cells than NC. On-ART, PTC had significantly lower levels of residual plasma viremia (3 copies/mL, limitof detection) and SIV-DNA content (both in blood and colorectum).After ART interruption, SIV-DNA content rapidly increased in NC while it progressively decreased in PTC. Finally, in PTC control of SIV rebound associated with higher CD4 T cell levels and reduced immuneactivation in PB and RB during the entire off-ART period. Conclusions : Lower set point viremia, reduced cell-associated SIV- DNA and preserved Th17 cell homeostasis associate with improvedvirologic response to ART and sustained viral control post-ARTinterruption in SIV-infected RMs. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20321 MOAA0103 Anti-HIV antibody responses Palmer6; Peter Burbelo7and Steven Deeks11Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.2Department of Immunology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.3Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.4Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, United States. 5Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States.6Department of Medicine, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.7National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, Clinical Dental Research Core, Bethesda,United States.Presenting author email: sulggi.lee@ucsf.edu Introduction : A major challenge to HIV eradication strategies is accurate measurement of the latent HIV reservoir. We assessedwhether the host response to residual virus may be a sensitivemeasure of reservoir size by comparing anti-HIV antibody profiles in relation to several HIV reservoir assays. Methods : Using a luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) assay, we quantitatively analyzed seven anti-HIV antibody profiles from61 patients who initiated long-term ( ]3 years) antiretroviral therapy (ART) during chronic HIV infection. HIV antibody levels were evaluated in relation to 12 HIV reservoir measures: total, integrated and 2-LTR DNA (rtPCR, n /C3048); DNA n /C3016); viral outgrowth assay (VOA, n /C3027) and plasma HIV RNA (single copy assay, SCA, n /C3027). Summary estimates of the overall association between HIV reservoir measures and HIV antibody levels adjusted formultiple comparisons were obtained using permutation testing. Results : Participants were mostly male (96%) with a median age of 56, median nadir and proximal CD4 /C27T cell counts of 210 and 670 cells/mm 3, respectively, and ART-suppression for a median of 11 years. Individual correlations showed that integrated and total HIV DNA levels by aluPCR and ddPCR were significantly associated with all antibody levels except p24 (nor matrix, for ddPCR, Figure 1).HIV reservoir size measured by viral outgrowth assay (VOA) was associated with gp120 and gp41 levels (r /C300.45, p /C300.02; r /C300.43, p/C300.02) while HIV RNA by SCA and HIV DNA by rtPCR were not correlated with any HIV antibody responses. Permutation testing Abstract MOAA0103 /C1Figure 1. Individual correlations matrix.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 2demonstrated a strong overall association between HIV reservoir size and anti-HIV antibody responses (r /C300.82, p /C300.04, Table 1), in particular with gp120 (r /C300.80, p /C300.009), gp41 (r reverse /C300.007). Further adjustment for age, proximal CD4 /C27T cell count and years of ART suppression did not significantly alter these results.Conclusions : Anti-HIV antibody responses correlate with quantifiable reservoir size during chronic ART-mediated suppression. Epitope location (envelope proteins and reverse transcriptase, an enzyme involved in the early steps of viral replication) may determine the strength of thisassociation. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether viral RNA orproteins are produced in cells with defective proviruses. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20322 MOAA0104 Trancriptomics and metabolomics identify inflammatory profiles that segregate subjects with high and low inducible HIV reservoir Khader Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, United States.2VGTI-FL, Port Saint Lucie, United States. 3Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, United States. Presenting author email: khader.ghneim@case.edu Introduction : To identify mechanisms that control immune recon- stitution and the size of the inducible HIV reservoir, we performedwhole blood transcriptional and metabolic profiling of subjects from the CLIF and UCSF SCOPE cohorts. These cohorts included subjects who increased CD4 counts post cART (IR) or stayed B350/mm 3after three years of cART (INR). Methods : We performed unsupervised analysis of gene expression data using hierarchical clustering to identify class and supervisedanalysis using statistical filtering to identify gene signatures and path-way activity differentially expressed between classes. Multivariate analysis based on Sparse Partial Least Regression was used to determine if Group membership correlated with plasma metabolitesmeasured by LC-MS/GC-MS. A gene-based classifier was developedto identify INR groups using the pamr package. Results : Two groups of INR subjects were identified by whole blood gene expression and pathway analysis. INR-A had the highest levelsof IL-6, sCD14, FOXO3 and STAT1 expression, and highest levels of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Pathway analysis showed that INR-A failed to activate the NF- kB pathway, TLR-MyD88 atolerogenic myeloid response. In contrast, INR-B was characterized by an unrestrained proinflammatory response including the upregu-lation of multiple TLRs, STAT1, IRF1 IRF8 Plasma metabolites including carnitines, bacterial metabolites and cholesterol also segregated between the two INRgroups and correlated with gene expression including FOXO3A andSTAT-1. TILDA, a measure of the inducible HIV reservoir; revealed that INR-A subjects had higher levels than INR-B and IR's. As CD4 counts and plasma biomarkers of inflammation/immune activation fail todistinguish the two INR groups, we developed a 352 gene-basedclassifier that accurately identified patient groups (AUC of 0.81 by ROC analysis) in an independent test cohort (UCSF SCOPE) including those that had the highest levels of HIV reservoir.Conclusions : Identifying pathways that control immune reconstitu- tion and the size of the inducible HIV reservoir paves the way to the development of therapeutic strategies that can lead to eradicationof HIV. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20323 MOAA0105LB HIV-1 virological remission for more than 11 years after interruption of early initiated antiretroviral therapy in aperinatally infected child Pierre asier.saez-cirion@pasteur.fr Introduction : Durable HIV-1 remission after interruption of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been reported in some adults who started cART during primary HIV-1 infection. The in utero HIV-1- infected ''Mississippi child'' exhibited transient viral control afterinterrupting very early-initiated cART. However, viraemia rebounded 27 months later, leaving unclear the possibility of obtaining long- term post-treatment remission in vertically infected children. Here,we report the case of a perinatally HIV-1-infected adolescent whoshows unprecedented virological remission more than 11 years after cART discontinuation. Methods : HIV-RNA and CD4 /C27T-cell counts have been monitored reactivation of the CD4 /C27T-cell reservoir were evaluated after 10 and 11 years of control off therapy. Plasma concentrations of antiretro- virals were determined by tandem mass spectrometry.Abstract MOAA0103 /C1Table 1. Adjusted summary 0.0398th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 3Results : One infant born for a woman with uncontrolled HIV-1 viraemia received zidovudine-based prophylaxis during six weeks.HIV-RNA and DNA were not detected 3 and 14 days after birth. HIV- DNA was detected at four weeks of age. HIV-RNA reached a peak of 2.1/C2910 6copies/mL at three months of age when cART (zidovudine, lamivudine, didanosine and ritonavir) was initiated. HIV-RNA wasundetectable one month later and remained below assay-detection limits while on cART, except at 15 and 21 months of age. Between 5.8 and 6.8 years of age, cART was discontinued by the family. HIV-RNA was undetectable at 6.8 years of age and cART was notresumed. HIV-RNA has remained B50 copies/mL through 18.3 years of age, except for one blip (515 copies/mL). CD4 /C27T-cell counts remained stable. After 11 years of control off therapy (confirmed byundetectable plasma concentrations of antiretrovirals), HIV-RNA was below four copies/mL and HIV-DNA was 2.2 log copies/10 6PBMC. Low levels of HIV-RNA and p24 were detected upon the activationof CD4 /C27T cells with very weak. HIV-1 western blot was positive with theabsence of antibodies against gp110 and p18.Conclusions : This case provides first-time evidence that very long- term HIV-1 remission is possible in perinatally infected early-treated children, with similar characteristics as reported in adult post-treatment controllers. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20566 MOAA0106LB Time-associated changes in cell-associated HIV RNA in HIV- infected subjects on suppressive antiretroviral therapy /C1 implications for clinical trials of cure interventions Christina Chang1,2; Paul Cameron1,2; Steve Deeks5and Sharon Lewin1,2 1Doherty Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.2Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.3Los Alamos National Laboratory, University of California, Los Alamos, United States.4Department of Medicine, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.5School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States. 6Department of Pathology, Melbourne, Australia.7Division of Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, United States. 8Center for Integrative Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, United States.9National Laboratory for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, United States.Presenting author email: christina.chang@unimelb.edu.au Introduction : Cell-associated unspliced (CA-US) HIV RNA is an important marker of the HIV reservoir and a common primary endpoint in clinical trials of latency reversing agents in HIV-infectedsubjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We observed large baselinevariation in CA-US HIV RNA in a recent clinical trial of disulphiram and hypothesized that these changes were due to circadian-related alterations in CD4 /C27T-cell composition, gene regulation or antici- patory stress.Methods : Blood was collected on three occasions (B1, B2 and B3) from HIV-infected subjects (n /C3030) on suppressive ART prior to any intervention. B3 was collected immediately prior to administration ofdisulphiram. We measured CA-US HIV RNA and DNA by real-time PCR and plasma HIV RNA (using a single copy assay) by droplet digital PCR. Plasma cortisol and thyroid-stimulating hormone levelswere by analyzed by flowcytometry. Data were assessed for normality and then analyzed with Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests and paired t-tests. Results : CA-US RNA was higher in blood collected at B3 compared to B1 and B2 (median 85.63 vs. 28.14 34.87 copies/million CD4 /C27T- cell equivalents; both, p B0.001). There were little differences in HIV DNA or plasma HIV RNA at these times. B3 was collected earlier in the day compared to B1 and B2 (mean 8.28 am vs. 11.38 am and10.21 am; both, p B0.001). Other parameters that were significantly higher at B3 compared to B1 and B2 were cortisol (p cells, which were elevated at B3 compared to B2 (p /C300.012). There were no significant differences in the percentage of T-cell subsets or histone acetylation in the blood collected at these time points.Conclusions : Time-associated variation in CA-US HIV RNA seen in HIV-infected subjects on suppressive ART was not associated with significant alterations in CD4 /C27T-cell subset composition and was suggestive of circadian changes in HIV RNA transcription. Diurnalchanges in CA-US HIV RNA may need to be considered in the designof future cure intervention trials. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20567 MOAA0202 Treatment with anti- a4b7 integrin antibody 1Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, United States.2Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, United States.3Department of Mass Biologics, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Boston,United States. 4Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, Atlanta, United States.Presenting author email: siddappa.n.byrareddy@emory.edu Introduction : Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that in vivo administration of a monoclonal anti- low-dose intra-vaginal SIV challenge lead to markedly lower gastro-intestinal tissue viral loads compared to rhesusmacaques (RM) treated with a control mAb. The purpose of the present study was to compare the tissues that served as primary targets of viral infection in the a4b7-mAb versus control mAb-treated RM, in order to identify mechanisms bywhich a4b7-mAb antibody reduces virus-mediated gastrointestinal pathology. Methods : Groups of 12 /C116 RM were administered a rhesus a4b7- mAb intravenously (i.v.) starting on day -1 and then every three weeks after infection. Each monkey was then repeatedly challenged with a low-dose SIVmac251 intra-vaginally or a single high-dose intrarectally. tion of a4b7 on CD4 cervicovaginal tissue and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) throughout the period ofmAb administration. Viral DNA was reduced in GALT biopsies of the a4b7-mAb treated RMs compared to those treated with control mAb8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 4treated (median 3.5 vs. 12.8 copies/ng DNA respectively, p /C300.006). Furthermore, in-depth analysis performed on a subset of animals(n/C304/group) indicated that proviral DNA was 5 to 25 fold more abundant in jejunum, ileum or colon of control-treated RMs compared to those treated with a4b7-mAb. In contrast, no difference in proviral loads in the spleen and lymph nodes from various sites was noted inthe two groups. Immuno-PET/CT assisted analysis revealed that for animals with comparable plasma viral loads, the a4b7-mAb treated monkeys showed a lower signal in the large intestine. In addition, onlythe control treated monkeys showed a clear PET/CT signal in lymphnodes surrounding the genital tract suggesting that treatment with a4b7-mAb prevents viral replication in this tissue, leading to different patterns of tissue localization of the virus between the two groups.Conclusions : The a4b7-mAb either protects or delays intravaginal SIV transmission, reduces gastrointestinal pathology following infection and results in both quantitative and qualitative differences in thelevel of viremia and tissue localization of virus. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20324 MOAA0203 Oral microbiome in HIV-infected women: ageing, disease progression opportunistic infections increase thepathogenic profile Michael George1; Barbara Weiser2,3; Harold Burger2,3; Tyler Lewy1 and Kathryn Anastos4 1Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, United States.2School of Medicine, University of California Davis, Davis, United States. 3Sacramento Veterans Administration Medical Center, Sacramento, United States.4Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, United States.Presenting author email: mdgeorge@ucdavis.edu Introduction : A recent marked increase in the proportion of HIV- infected individuals older than 50 highlights the need to study the impact of ageing on HIV pathogenesis. HIV-associated non-AIDS (HANA)conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis anddementia are more prevalent in older HIV-infected populations than young adults. The microbiome in saliva and the oral cavity has been studied as a window into pathogenesis in ageing populations. Althoughdisruption of the oral microbiome (dysbiosis) has been linked tovarious human conditions and diseases associated with ageing, the role of age-related dysbiosis in the development of opportunistic infections and HANA conditions in HIV patients is not well understood.Methods : We utilize 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing to compare the salivary microbiome in three groups: chronically HIV-infected women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study who are (1)/C2150 years old (ageing), or (2)B35 years old (young adult) and (3) healthy age-matched uninfected women. We also examine correlations between dysbiosis of the salivarymicrobiome, disease progression and opportunistic oral infections.Results : HIV infection results in dysbiosis of the salivary microbiome that is enhanced in ageing individuals and characterized by increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria and a decline in healthy probioticmicrobes. Higher proportions of Prevotella ,Staphylococcus, Moryella, Peptostreptococcus, Ruminococcus and Oribacterium were detected in both ageing and young adult HIV infected women than in uninfected controls. Prevotella ,Moryella and Oribacterium increases were higher in ageing than in young HIV patients. HIV infection in older patients was associated with greater salivary shedding of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Increased EBV shedding, higher peripheral HIV burdenand reduced CD4 /C27T cell counts correlated with increases in Prevotella and decreases in probiotic Lactobacillus . Patients with opportunistic oral infections also showed enhanced salivary levels ofPorphyromonas, Lachnospira and Actinobacillus, and reduced Streptococcus . Conclusions : Age, severity of disease progression and emergence of opportunistic infections all contribute to various degrees in increasing the pathogenic footprint of the oral microbiome during chronic HIVinfection. The study findings provide new insights into age-relateddysbiosis of the salivary microbiome and its role in HIV pathogenesis and lay critical groundwork for future expanded investigations. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20325 MOAA0204 Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin isolate increases peripheral and mucosal T cell count in patients withHIV enteropathy David Ma Somsouk2; Peter Hunt2; Shaw7; Eric Weaver8and Gerald Klein9 1Internal Medicine, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, United States.2Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.3Center for Comparative Medicine, University of California Davis, Davis, United States.4Center for Comparative Medicine, Davis, United States.5California National Primate Research Center, Davis, United States.6EarlyPhase Sciences Inc., Cary, United States. 7Entera Health Inc., Cary, United States.8Entera Health, Inc., Ankeny, United States.9Entera Health, Inc., Cary, United States. Introduction : A multi-centre trial in HIV-enteropathy was conducted to evaluate the impact of serum-derived bovine immunoglobulinisolate (SBI) on markers of peripheral and mucosal immunity and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as previously reported. Methods : Patients (pts) on long-term suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART) with HIV-enteropathy were randomized to receive SBI 2.5 vs. 5.0 g BID or placebo (PBO) during a four-week lead-in phase followed by SBI 2.5 vs. 5.0 g BID for 20 weeks. Evaluationsincluded plasma biomarkers for inflammation, peripheral CD4 countsand pt-reported surveys on GI symptoms. Eight pts underwent duodenal biopsies to examine mucosal immunity. Results : A total of 103 pts (SBI 2.5 g; n /C3034; SBI 5.0 g; n n/C3036 continued 2.5 /C3018 each)) were enrolled (31% female; 61% black; mean age 51 years). Mean duration of HIV, ART and enteropathy was over 15, 5 and 5 years, respectively. All cohorts showed a reduction in abnormal stool frequency (p /C300.0001) from baseline (BL) to week 4; however between group analysis was notsignificant. This reduction was maintained for pts receiving SBI through 24 weeks. The 2.5 and 5.0 g cohorts were combined for zonulin and CD4 analysis. The mean plasma zonulin levels signifi-cantly increased (p B0.0001) for pts receiving SBI through 24 weeks. Median peripheral CD4 counts increased significantly from BL to week 24 in patients in the lowest baseline CD4 quartile (308 to386 cells/mL, p /C300.002), while no significant change was observed among subjects in the combined SBI cohorts during this time period. This compromised subgroup also experienced greater increases in CD4 counts at week-4 than PBO pts (median /C2742 vs./C2817 cells/mL, p/C300.02). Duodenal densities increased from 217 to 329 cells/ mm 2(median increase of 145 cells/mm2(p/C300.02)) in biopsies obtained from eight pts, consistent with earlier findings. Duodenal crypt cells expressing Ki67 decreased in 6/7 pts from 41 to 24%(p/C300.08, n /C307) which correlated with the decreased number of Paneth cells per crypt (p /C300.048). Conclusions : Oral SBI may be a novel strategy to restore mucosal immunity and systemic immune reconstitution among pts who havenot achieved normal CD4 counts despite prolonged suppressive ART. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.203268th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 5MOAA0205 HIV-exposure, gut microbiome, and vaccine responses in South Sciences, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of CapeTown, Cape Town, South Africa. 2Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States. 3Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.4Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, Ottawa, Canada.5Institute for Molecular Medicine and Health, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.6Institute of Human Virology, Baltimore, United States.7Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.8Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, United States.9Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Global Health, Seattle, United States. Presenting author email: hbjaspan@gmail.com Introduction : The gut microbiome is crucial for mucosal and systemic immune development. In mice, certain bacteria are required forinduction of Treg and Th17 cell development in the gut. Likewise, gut microbiota enhance immune responses to influenza vaccination in the mouse model. HIV-infected women have altered vaginal and gutmicrobiome, and HIV-exposed infants (HEU) and their mothersreceive antibiotics for pneumocystis pneumonia there- fore HEU may have altered gut microbiota. HEU have higher morbidity and mortality than HIV-unexposed (HU) infants, and respond poorlyto certain infant vaccinations. We hypothesized that the aetiology of this relative immune deficiency is mediated by gut dysbiosis. Methods : HEU and HU infants were recruited at birth from infor- mal settlements of Cape Town. Blood and stool were collected afterinformed consent was obtained. Stool DNA was extracted using MoBio PowerFecal DNA kit and 454 or Illumina sequencing Data was pre-processed using QIIME and UPARSE andimported into R for further analyses using phyloseq. Differentialabundance testing was performed at Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) level using the R metagenomeSeq package. Whole blood was incubated with BCG, positive and negative controls, and proliferationand cytokine expression measured using multi-parameter flowcytometry. Results : We found substantial differences in bacterial diversity between HEU and HU infants by Shannon index. Moreover, at alltaxonomic levels, there were differences between the HIV exposure groups via PCoA analysis. Several OTUs of the phylum Firmicutes were differentially abundant between HEU and HU infants, three of whichwere of the genus Veillonella. Several key species were significantlycorrelated with both proliferative and cytokine responses to BCG. For example, at six weeks of age, significantly decreased abundance ofBacteroides species, and in particular B. fragilis, were present in infants with high CD4 /C27IL-2/C27, CD8/C27ki67/C27and CD8 /C27IL-17/C27 responses to BCG vaccination at six weeks of age. Conclusions : Gut microbial composition could explain the immuno- logical differences between HU and HEU infants. These differencesshould be considered in development of HIV vaccines for exposed neonates. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20327 MOAA0206LB SIV-induced translocation of bacterial products in the liver mobilizes myeloid dendritic and natural killer cells associated with liver damage Jamie Schafer1; Tristan Evans2; Haiying Li1and R Keith Reeves31Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, United States.2New England Primate Research Center, Harvard University, Southborough, United States. 3Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Harvard Medical School/ Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, United States.Presenting author email: rreeves@bidmc.harvard.edu Introduction : Disruption of the mucosal during immuno- deficiency lentivirus infections permits translocation of microbial products into the circulation, causing systemic immune activation anddriving disease progression. However, the specific effects of microbialproducts in liver, as a blood-filtering organ, are unclear. Methods : In this study, we investigated the effects of simian immu- nodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus liver immunohistochemistry.We also comparedliver infiltration by myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), trafficking to the liver by liver-resident natural killer (NK) cell frequen- cies, phenotypes or SIVmac251-infected rhesus macaques using flow cytometry. Results : In livers of normal rhesus macaques, very low levels of bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were detectable, but increasedup to 20-fold in chronically SIV-infected animals. Increased microbialproducts in the liver of infected macaques was associated with the production of the chemoattractant, CXCL16, by mDCs. Subsequently, lymphocytes expressing were mobilized inblood and hypercytotoxic NK cells were recruited the liver. Microbialaccumulation, mDC activation and hepatic cytotoxic NK cell frequency were all significantly correlated with markers of liver damage. Conclusions : Collectively, these data indicate that SIV-associated accumulation of microbial products in the liver initiates a cascade of innate immune activation resulting in liver damage. These findings have implications for the liver pathology associated with HIV,especially in instances of coinfection with HCV. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20568 MOAB0101 Field evaluation of point-of-care testing for early infant diagnosis in Cape Town, South Africa Max Kroon1; Lorna Dunning2; Marvin Department of Paediatrics & Child Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. 2Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, School of Public Health & Family Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. 3Division of Medical Virology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. Introduction : Provision of rapid early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) service remains a challenge for prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes globally. Point-of-care (POC) EID testing may improveaccess and turnaround times, but while several POC technologies are in development there are few data on implementation. Methods : We conducted an implementation study of the Alere q Detect POC system for EID at two public sector health facilities. Ata maternity hospital the POC device was used to test HIV-exposed neonates soon after birth; at a primary care clinic the device was used for routine six-week EID testing. At each site infants undergoinglaboratory-based HIV PCR testing per local protocols were tested onthe POC device by doctors or nurses with results available within one hour. Analysis examined the performance of POC versus laboratory testing of the same specimen, and semi-structured interviews withproviders to assess implementation issues and acceptability. Results : Overall 476 tests were conducted: 291 birth tests in the maternity hospital (mean child age, B1 day) and 195 six-week tests in primary care (mean child age, 51 days). Twelve percent of all testsresulted in an error with no differences by site; most error results8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 6resolved with retesting. POC EID was more sensitive (100%; lower confidence limit, 40%) and specific (100%, lower confidence limit,98%) among older children tested in primary care compared birth testing in hospital (92% (95% CI, 62 /C1100%) and 99% (95% CI, 99/C1100%), respectively), though test performance improved with repeated lab testing and negative predictive value was high ( /C2199%) at both sites. In interviews, providers felt that the ease of use of the device coupled with the rapid turnaround time of POC EID results facilitated decision-making in the management of infants, but manywanted to understand better the cause of errors on the POC device toassist in repeat testing. Conclusions : POC EID testing performs well in field implementation in health care facilities and is highly acceptable to health careproviders. While further research is needed to understand POC EID implementation at scale, the rapid turnaround time of POC testing may allow immediate identification and management of HIV-infectedinfants. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20328 MOAB0102 High rates of baseline NNRTI-resistance and virologic failure among ART na \u00a8ve HIV-1-infected children of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, United States. 2Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sciences Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Unite \u00b4d'Epide \u00b4miologie Mole of Infectious Diseases, Northwestern United of Virology, Ho pital Pitie \u00b4-Salpe trie`re, Paris, France.6Division of Pediatric Infectious Children's Hospital, Chicago, United States.Presenting author email: claudia.crowell@seattlechildrens.org Introduction : Limited data exist on drug resistance and antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcomes in HIV-1 infected children in West Africa.We determined the prevalence of baseline resistance, and correlatesof virologic failure (VF) and on-treatment resistance in a cohort of HIV-1 infected children in Mali. Methods : Prospective observational study of HIV-1 infected children B10 years of age initiating first-line ART in Bamako, Mali. Assess- ments occurred at baseline and after six months of ART. Genotypic resistance testing on stored baseline and six-month samples occur- red at study end. Reverse transcriptase and protease genes weresequenced using in-house methods. Resistance was defined as intermediate or high-level according to the Stanford HIV Genotypic Resistance Algorithm v7.0. Virologic failure was defined as viral load(VL)]1000 copies/mL. Clinical and immunological failures were based on WHO criteria. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with VF and resistance. Results : A total of 150 children were enrolled; 60% male and mean age 3.4 years. Ninety-four percent reported no prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) exposure. Median baseline CD4 count baseline samples, 28 (19.86%) had NNRTI resistance,only two of whom had PMTCT exposure and none had proteaseinhibitor (PI) resistance. Mean age of children with baseline NNRTI resistance was 2.3 years. By six months of ART, 11 died, 8 were lost tofollow-up and 6 had missing VL data. Among 125 remaining children, 41 (33%) had VF, 24 of whom (58%) had drug resistance (23 with NNRTIand one with PI mutations). A total of 93% of children with VF did not meet criteria for clinical or immunological failure. In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, gender, adherence and ART regimen,baseline NNRTI resistance was strongly associated with VF and six-month resistance (OR: 6.7, p /C300.001; OR: 20, p B0.001). Conclusions : Baseline NNRTI resistance was common in Malian children without prior NNRTI exposure and was associated with VFand a high resistance rate during ART. Clinical and immunologic criteriararely detected VF. Our findings support WHO recommendations of PI-based regimens in all children B3 years, and virological monitoring. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20329 MOAB0103 T cell activation and treatment outcomes among infants receiving early ART Kristjana Hro \u00a8nn A\u00b4sbjo\u00a8rnsdo \u00b4ttir1; Jennifer Kenneth Tapia9and Grace C John-Stewart1,2,10 1Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.2Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.3Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.4Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.5Center for AIDS Research Immunology Core, University of Washington,Seattle, United States. 6Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Seattle, United States. 7Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.8Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.9Center for AIDS Research Biometrics Core, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.10Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle,United States.

We determined levels and correlates of T-cell activation and the effect of baseline activation on response to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in HIV-infected infants.Methods : This investigation utilized specimens from the Optimizing Pediatric HAART study of early infant ART (NCT00428116). Kenyan infants less than five months of age were enrolled between 2007 and 2010 and started on ART. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)samples collected before ART initiation were analyzed using flow Abstract MOAB0103 /C1Figure 1.

Factors associated with T-cell activation at baseline wereidentified using Mann-Whitney U tests or linear regression. The effect of baseline activation on survival, CD4 reconstitution and HIV-1 log 10viral load (VL) suppression was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models.Results : Among 72 infants, median age at enrolment was 111 days, median VL was 6.6 log 10copies/mL and median CD4 was 19%. Most infants had symptomatic disease; 49% were WHO stage 3/4, medianweight-for-age Z-score and median length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) was /C282.1. Twenty infants died, including eight before ART initiation. Median CD8 /C27T-cell activation at baseline pre-ART was 17.0% (interquartile range 31.8) and median CD4 /C27T-cell was 3.3% (IQR 1.6, 5.8). At enrolment, CD8 /C27T-cell activation was associated with younger age ( /C280.15%/day Interval (CI) CD4% or VL. CD4 enrolment (95% CI /C280.36,/C280.05), p/C300.01). reconstitution or VL suppression. Low CD8 /C27T-cell activation (B5%) was associated with mortality (hazard ratio /C303.8 (95% CI 1.3, 11.4), p /C300.02). Conclusions : Contrary to findings in adults, low CD8 /C27T-cell activa- tion was strongly associated with mortality in this infant cohort. Among infants, low CD8 /C27T-cell activation in symptomatic HIV infection may be a marker of ineffective immune response. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20330 MOAB0104 Changes in renal laboratory parameters and bone mineral density in treatment-na \u00a8ve HIV-1-infected adolescents Kampala, Uganda.2St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, United States.3HIVNAT, Bangkok, Thailand.4Children's National Health System, Washington, United States.5Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.6Mpati Medical Centre, Dundee, South Africa.7Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, Cape Town, South Africa.8Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, United States.

Adverse events(AE), laboratory tests, bone mineral density (BMD) by dual X-rayabsorptiometry and height-age adjusted (HA) Z-scores were assessed through Week 24. Results : The E/C/F/TAF and STB trials enrolled 50 and 33 adolescents, respectively (median age 15 vs. 16 years, 56% vs. 30% female, 88% vs. 76% Black, 22% HIV-1 /C21100,000 copies/mL, median CD4 count 456 vs. 407 cells/ mL median eGFR 156 vs. 143 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Most AEs in both trials were mild andunrelated to treatment, with no deaths or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. At Week 24, the median increase in serum creatininewas/C270.08 mg/dL in E/C/F/TAF participants, with and /C270.10 with median eGFR decreases of /C2817.0 and /C2818.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2, respectively, of E/C/F/TAF participants vs. 52% of STB participants, with Grade 2 or higher proteinuria occurring in 4% vs. 21% of participants, respectively. Of those participants with BMD measure-ments at Week 24, the median increase in spine BMD was /C271.98% in E/C/F/TAF participants, with a decrease of ]4% in 3/41 participants (7%), versus a median decrease of /C281.29% in the STB cohort, with a decrease of ]4% in 6/20 participants (30%). Spine HA Z-scores decreased by /C280.02 and /C280.21 respectively. Conclusions : Compared with STB, E/C/F/TAF exhibited similar effects on eGFR, a lower incidence and severity of proteinuria, and a medianincrease in spine mineralization. Both STRs were well-toleratedthrough 24 weeks. These findings support INSTI-based STRs as initial HIV-1 treatment in adolescents and suggest that TAF could offer safety advantages in paediatric populations. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20331 MOAB0105 Treatment and resistance outcomes of Asian Study 1HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross /C1AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand. 2Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.3HIV-NAT, SEARCH, Thai Red Cross /C1AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.4U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute ofResearch, Silver Spring. 5Henry M.

Presenting author email: annette.sohn@amfar.org Introduction : With limited paediatric third-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings, data on treatment efficacy anddrug resistance following second-line failure are needed to guide future management. Methods : HIV-infected children B18 years old who were taking or switching to second-line ART were enrolled from Indonesia, Thailandand Vietnam. Clinical and laboratory assessments were retrospec-tively and prospectively obtained from the time of second-line switch (baseline). Genotyping was performed upon virologic failure (VF; HIV- RNA/C211000 copies/mL). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate factors predicting post-switch VF. Results : A total of 277 children were enrolled; 41% were female. Baseline values included median (interquartile range; IQR) age 7.5 (5.3/C110.3) /C15.5) log 10copies/mL.

Methods : We evaluated foetal long bone measurements in HIV- infected pregnant woman/foetus dyads in Cape Town, South Africa.Measurements were conducted by a trained research sonographer using Foetal femur (FLZ) and humerus compared duration of in utero TDF exposure in three categories: 1) TDF-exposed since conception (TDF-C)versus 2) TDF-exposed for ]4 weeks and initiated after first trimester (TDF-E), versus 3) TDF-exposed for B4 weeks or TDF-unexposed (TDF-U). Ultrasounds performed at B10 weeks gestational age (GA), twin pregnancies and those resulting in intrauterine foetal demise were excluded. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of duration of TDF exposure category on FLZ and HLZ.Results : A total 1957 TDF-E, of whom had ]2 ultrasounds) were available for analysis. Women in the TDF-C group were older and had lower CD4 cell counts than women in the other categories but did notdiffer in anthropometry or history of low birth weight deliveries(Table). Median duration of TDF exposure was 26.9, 13.0 and 0 weeks, respectively, in the TDF-C, TDF-E and TDF-U groups. Mean FLZ and HLZ did by exposure vs. 0.048, p /C300.832). These relationships persisted after adjusting for maternal age, gestation, gravidity, socioeconomic status, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA level TDF-U HLZ).

Presenting author email: chanrah1@jhmi.edu Introduction : Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) has been demon- strated to reduce the risk of active tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected adults, but the effectiveness of shorter IPT regimens (6 /C19 months) rapidly wanes in high TB burden settings. We examined the long-term durability of six months of IPT among HIV-infected adults in South Africa. Methods : We analyzed the experience of a prospective clinical cohort of HIV-infected adults at one urban and one rural hospital inSouth Africa. The exposures of interest were receipt of IPT and antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the primary outcome was incidentTB. We used multivariate Poisson regression to examine the asso- ciation of IPT and ART with risk of TB.Results : From 2003 to 2010, 3465 HIV-infected adults were followed for 9908 person-years (PY) during which 372 incident TB cases (incidence rate (IR): 3.8/100PY; 95% CI: 3.4 /C14.2). A total of 776 participants received IPT (median treatment length:5 months (IQR: 2 /C16)). During 1886 PY of follow-up after initiating IPT, 54 were were diagnosed (IR: 4.0/100 PY; 95% CI:3.6/C14.4). After adjusting for age, sex, study site, ART use and CD4 count, IPT was associated with a 23% reduction in TB incidence over 0.7 /C11.0; p /C300.070). IPT appeared to be protective only for the first year following initial IPT exposure (aIRR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.36 /C10.98; p /C300.042), risk of TB was not significantly reduced.Conclusions : In this prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults in South Africa, receipt of six months of IPT resulted in a marked (40%) reduction in risk for TB during the first year following IPT initiation,independent of ART status. No reduction in TB risk was observedbeyond one year, confirming similar findings in settings of high TB burden. We demonstrate that IPT remains an important intervention for HIV-infected individuals, and that even a short regimen canprovide crucial protection from TB of up to one year for those not yetinitiated on highly active antiretroviral therapy. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20334Abstract MOAB0107LB /C1Table 1.

Person-timeaccrued from treatment initiation until the earliest of outcomedate recorded or 24 months on treatment. Cox hazard models were used to evaluate the relationship between HIV status and all-cause mortality. Models were adjusted for age, gender and previous historyof TB treatment.Results : In total, 13,692 confirmed MDR-TB 66% (7289/11,028) were co-infected with HIV. Among those with an outcome reported (8465/13,692; 62%), overall mortality and success rates were 24.6% (95% CI 23.7 /C125.6) and 42.4% (41.3 /C143.4), respectively. (41.0 /C144.8); 15.5/100 pys).

Fewer HIV positive patients were lost to follow-up or failed treatment compared to HIV negatives (21.6 and 8.6% vs. 29.0 and 10.8%).Conclusions : In this analysis of the outcomes of MDR-TB treatment in the South African national database, the reported rate of treatment success was low (42%) and did not vary by HIV status. Mortality washigh in both groups but almost 1.5 times more in HIV co-infectedpatients. New guidelines allowing decentralized (outpatient) treat- ment of some MDR-TB patients and newly available drug regimens may improve treatment results. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20335 MOAB0203 Excess TB mortality in HIV patients in Eastern Europe: restructured approach to care needed Anna Schultze1; Anne Marie Werlinrud Efsen2; Ole Kirk2and on behalf of the TB: HIV Study Group in EuroCoord1Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom.2Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, CHIP , Finsencentret, of London,United Kingdom. 4Department of HIV/TB, TB Hospital 2, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation.5Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.6Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.7Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre, London,United Kingdom. 8Department of Immunocompromised, Hospital J.M.

Presenting author email: a.schultze@ucl.ac.uk Introduction : Management of TB in HIV patients in Eastern Europe (EE) is challenged by high MDR-TB prevalence, low rates of drugsusceptibility testing (DST) and poor access to ART. We report 1-year mortality estimates from a multi-regional (EE, Western Europe (WE) and Latin America (LA)) cohort study.Methods : Deaths within 12 months of starting TB therapy (baseline) among consecutive HIV patients with TB in 2011 /C12013 were classified as being TB-related or not. Risk factors for all-cause and TB-relateddeath were assessed using standard survival analysis methods.Results : Among 1410 patients starting TB therapy (EE /C30835,WE LA/C30256), died within months of baseline; 170 (66%) of these were TB-related. The cumulative probability of all-cause and TB-related death at 12 months was 29, 5 and 11% (p B0.001) and 22, 1 and 4% (pB0.001) in EE, WE and LA respectively. In EE, fewer patients were on cARTat 12 months (68% vs. 90% and 85%, p B0.001), and many were treated without access to baseline DST (66% vs. 37% and 69%,pB0.001). Among those with DST, the empiric treatment regimen (composed when DST results were not yet known) included B3a c t i v e TB-drugs in 36, 7 and 9% (EE,WE, LA, p B0.001); of those 81, 46 and 86% had MDR-TB. Patients who started B3 active drugs were at excess risk of dying from TB compared to patients starting ]3a c t i v ed r u g s Abstract MOAB0203 /C1Figure 1.

Patients without DST results (and thus no option for targeting subsequent therapy) also had a greater riskof death (aHR /C302.33, 1.40 /C13.87). This appeared driven by deaths in EE (Figure, aHR /C302.37, 1.66 /C13.40, analyses restricted to EE), although a formal test for interaction with region was not significant (p /C300.44), potentially due to few deaths outside EE.Conclusions : There is an elevated risk of death from TB in HIV patients managed in EE compared to WE and LA.

Presenting author email: baddeleya@who.int Introduction : Despite being preventable and curable, tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of peopleliving with HIV (PLHIV). The past decade has seen considerable scale-up of collaborative TB/HIV activities, however, implementation remains suboptimal. Closer inspection at each stage of the cascadeof TB/HIV care is warranted to assess the gaps and to identifyopportunities for strengthened service delivery in order to eliminate HIV-associated TB mortality. Methods : Data were downloaded from the Global TB Programme Database on 22/01/2015 on the latest available TB treatment out- comes (2012 cohort), disaggregated by HIV status, from reporting high TB/HIV burden countries in the WHO African Region, alongwith related data on the implementation of collaborative TB/HIVactivities. Data were analysed and missed opportunities identified. Results : Fourteen countries reported the required outcome data, accounting for some 570,000 HIV-positive incident TB cases, (Table 1),or 63% of the African burden and 49% of the global burden in 2012. More than 50,000 reported HIV-positive TB cases died or were lost tofollow-up, representing 18% of evaluated cases, compared with 11% of evaluated HIV-negative TB cases, (Figure 1). Of the estimated HIV-positive TB cases almost 260,000 (46%) wentunreported, (Table 1). Among registered TB patients, 11% (around80,000) did not have an HIV test in the TB register. In eight countries that reported, there was a gap of over 1,700,000 reported as not having received a TB screen, (53% of the 3,300,000 people in HIV care).Among notified HIV-positive TB cases, 42% (nearly 130,000) were notreported as receiving ART. Only five of the 14 countries reported providing Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) to people newly registered in HIV care. In the four countries that reported a denominator, 69%(some 900,000) people newly enrolled in HIV care did not receive IPT. Conclusions : This analysis highlights some considerable gaps in the care cascade, resulting from suboptimal implementation and/or re-cording and reporting. In order to prevent disproportionate TB mor-tality among PLHIV, countries are encouraged to scrutinize weaknesses in the care cascade at every level to enhance early detection of HIV- associated TB, timely ART initiation and scaled-up TB prevention. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20337 MOAB0205LB Empiric TB therapy does not decrease early mortality compared to isoniazid preventive therapy in adults with advanced HIV initiating ART: results of ACTG A5274 Study Team 1UNC Project, Lilongwe, Malawi.2School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States.3University of Abstract MOAB0204 /C1Figure 1.

Presenting author email: mina_hosseinipour@med.unc.edu Introduction : Strategies for reducing the high early mortality seen among patients initiating antiretroviral therapy ART in resource- limited settings (RLS) are urgently needed. We hypothesized thatgiven the high burden of tuberculosis (TB) in these settings, empiric TB treatment among patients at high risk for death would reduce early mortality.Methods : REMEMBER ( Reducing Early Mortality and Early Morbidity byEmpiric Tuberculosis Treatment Regimens) is a multicountry randomized clinical trial comparing two management strategies: ART/C27empiric 4 drug TB therapy (Empiric) vs. ART /C27isoniazid pre- ventive therapy (IPT) in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 count B50 cells/mm 3. Participants were screened for TB prior to entry using symptom screen, locally available diagnostics per standard of care, andGeneXpert when available. The study was stratified according to CD4count (B25 vs.]25 cells/mm 3) and poor prognostic B18.5, haemoglobin B8 g/dl, recent hospitalization).The primary endpoint was survival (death or unknown status) at 24 weekspostrandomization, and Kaplan /C1Meier estimates of the endpoint rates across arms were compared by the z-test. Results : Of 1368 participants screened, 850 (62%) were randomized; 53% were male, 90% were black and median (quartiles) age was 36(30/C142) years. The median (quartiles) CD4 count at study entry was 18 cells/mm 3(9, 32). At week 24, both arms had the same primary endpoint rate of 5.2% (95% CI: 3.5 /C17.8% for Empiric and 3.4 /C17.8% for IPT) with an absolute risk difference of /C280.06% (95% CI: /C283.05 to 2.94%). Primary endpoint rates were similar across arms for the stratification factors and for other secondary outcomes: viral load B400 copies/mL was achieved in 84% Empiric and 85% IPT; Grade 3 or 4 symptoms occurred in 12% Empiric and 11% IPT; Grade 3 or 4laboratory abnormalities in 23% both arms; and new 49% Empiric and 51% IPT.Abstract MOAB0204 /C1Table 1.

The trialstarted in April 2005 and ended in May 2015. Methods : HPTN 052 enrolled 1763 HIV serodiscordant couples in Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Thailand, India,Brazil and the U.S. (97% heterosexual). HIV-infected index partici-pants had CD4 cell counts between 350 and 550 cells/mm 3at enrolment. Index participants were randomized to receive ART at enrolment (early arm) or when their CD4 cell count fell to 5250 cells/mm3or they developed an AIDS-defining illness (delayed arm). The primary analysis was based on genetically linked viral transmis- sion events. When interim analysis in May 2011 demonstrated the benefits of early ART, ART was offered to all index participants in thedelayed arm ( N Engl J Med 2011 ;365:493 /C1505); the study then continued otherwise unchanged. Results : At the end of the trial, 1171 (66%) of 1763 couples remained in follow-up (603/886 Indexparticipants were followed for 9822 person-years (py). ART was initiated by all 886 index participants in the early arm and 785 (90%) of 877 index participants in the delayed arm. Before ART was offered toall index participants, there was 1 linked infection in the early ART arm(4 total infections/1776 py) and 35 linked infections in the delayed arm (42 total infections/1757 py). After ART was offered to index participants in both study arms, there were two linked infections inthe early arm (15 total infections/2537 py) and six linked infections in the delayed arm (17 total infections/2412 py). Only seven linked infections were diagnosed while the index participant was receivingART: four infections were diagnosed shortly after the index participantstarted ART and three were diagnosed after ART failure.These findings demonstrate that HIV transmission is very unlikely when viral replication is suppressed.Conclusions : The previously reported efficacy of early ART for HIV prevention was sustained for the duration of the HPTN 052 study. ART, combined with counselling and provision of condoms pro- vides durable, highly effective protection from HIV transmission inserodiscordant couples. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20482 MOAC0102 Level of viral suppression and cascade of HIV care in a South African semi-urban setting in 2012 Kevin Johannesburg, South Africa.5APHP Bichat-Cl Bernard, Paris, France.6Ouest medical school of the University of Versailles, University of Versailles,Versailles /C1Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Versailles, France.

Presenting author email: bertran.auvert@uvsq.fr Introduction : For antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs to have a preventive impact, the proportion of HIV-infected people beingtreated should be high. In 2012, seven years after the beginningof ART programs in the South-African township of Orange Farm, we measured the proportion of HIV /C27who were virally suppressed, especially among age groups highly exposed to HIV (women 18 /C129 years and men 25 /C134 years). Methods : A community-based cross-sectional representative survey conducted in 2012 among 3293 men and 3473 women. Study pro- cedures included a face-to-face questionnaire and collection of bloodsamples that were tested for HIV, 10 antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and HIV-viral load (VL).8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 15Results : HIV prevalence was 17.0% (95% Confidence Interval: 15.7 /C1 18.3%) among men (28.5 /C131.6%) among women. 59.1% (57.4 /C160.8%) of men and 79.5% (78.2 /C180.9%) of women reported having ever been tested for HIV. When controlling for age, circumcised men were more likely to ever have been tested (66.1%vs. 53.6%; p B0.001). Among HIV men and 30.5% (27.7 /C133.3%) of women tested positive for any ARV. The ratio of ARV /C27people over those HIV /C28was 0.084. Using basic calculations, we found that if ART programs were actuallytreating all eligible patients since 2005, this ratio should have been0.21/C10.28, indicating an effectiveness of ART programs around 47/C163%. Among ARV /C27participants, 91.9% (88.7 /C194.3%) had viral suppression (VL B400 of viral suppression among HIV /C27was 27.0% (24.3 /C129.9%) among women and 17.5% (14.4/C120.9%) among men. These proportions were lower among the highly-exposed age groups: 15.6% (12.1 /C119.7%) among women and 8.4% (5.0 /C113.1%) among men. Conclusions : In Orange Farm, in the 2005 /C12012 period, ART pro- grams were sub-optimal and, among HIV /C27, proportion of viral suppression was low, especially among the highly-exposed agegroups. This suggests that, up to 2012, ART programs may not havesubstantially impacted HIV incidence. However, our study showed at community level that, when effectively taken, ARVs present a high effectiveness in suppressing VL. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20338 MOAC0103 A mathematical model to determine potential costs and benefits of increasing antiretroviral therapy coverage infemale sex workers: the case International Foundation, University of South Florida, Panama, Panama.2IRMACS, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.3Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.4National STI/HIV/AIDS Program, Ministry of Health, Panama, Panama.5British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver,Canada. 6Department of Mathematics, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada. Presenting author email: jenkins.lorna@yahoo.com Introduction : Panama adopted Treatment as Prevention (TasP) in February 2014 and is now seeking efficient and effective ways toexpand antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage in key populations. Wedeveloped a mathematical model to determine the ART coverage and associated costs required to meet HIV incidence reductiontargets for the female sex worker (FSW) population, which has a 1.6% HIV prevalence. Methods : The Government of Panama, British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and Simon Fraser University are collaborat-ing to develop mathematical models for informing Panama's TasP strategy. Quantitative and qualitative information was collected from national reports, key informant interviews and focus groups withcivil society to inform a compartmental HIV transmission modelincorporating disease progression and treatment. The model was calibrated and validated for 2013. Estimated FSW population size is 17,000 and according to the Global AIDS Response Progress report,current ART coverage for both FSW and the hard-to-reach client population is about 47%. Annual ART cost/individual is US$625. Simulation scenarios for meeting 50, 70 or 90% reduction in HIVincidence in FSW in 15 years assumed ART expansion either for FSWand their clients (Scenario 1) or for FSW only (Scenario 2). Results : ART expansion for FSW costs slightly more in Scenario 1 than 2. However, overall for both populations of FSW and clients, moreinfections are averted and treatment programme costs are lowerfor the strategy targeting FSW only (see Table 1). Furthermore, initial aggressive expansion of ART coverage leads to overall cost savings and a more effective means of averting new infections (see Figure 1).The result of no action compared to the 90% Scenario 2 strategy would be 170% more HIV infections and 50% more treatment costs over 15 years.Conclusions : Rapid expansion of TasP for female sex workers in Panama would avert infections and treatment costs already within 15 years. Initial short-term investment to increase ART coverage would be offset by long-term savings. Since Panama adopted TasP ,UNAIDS has announced the 90 /C190/C190 targets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and suppression, which call for an even more rapid reduction in incidence. Ongoing analyses are evaluating costs and outcomes of reaching the new targets by 2020. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20339 MOAC0104 Does a universal test and treat strategy impact ART adherence in rural South Africa?

Presenting author email: ciwuji@yahoo.com Introduction : HIV treatment guidelines are recommending ART at increasingly higher CD4 counts for maximizing individual andpopulation benefits. However, the expansion of ART use may be atthe expense of optimal adherence. We report on adherence and virological suppression when initiating ART at different CD4 thresh- olds within the Treatment as Prevention (ANRS 12249) trial ofuniversal home-based testing and immediate ART initiation in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Methods : Using data of a cluster-randomized trial of immediate ART versus initiation according to current national guidelines(CD45350 cells/mm 3), we compared adherence levels ( ]95% vs. B95%) measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and pill count (PC) and virological suppression at six months ( B400 c/mL) according to CD4 count at ART initiation through logistic regressionmodels, adjusting for possible confounders (age, sex, marital status, education and employment). Results : During March 2012 /C1May 2014, 601 participants who were not on ART entered care in trial clinics; 382 initiated ART; 254 have completed ]6 months on ART, 227 of whom had six months HIV RNA data and were included in analyses. One hundred sixty-nine werewomen; median (IQR) age and CD4 at ART initiation were 35 years(28, 46) and 313 cells/mm 3(206, 513). Adherence ]95% at six months was high (88 and 83% by PC and VAS, respectively) with no evidence that this was associated with CD4 at initiation (aOR 0.98 /C11.31, p /C300.09 for PC). Male sex was independently associated with B95% adherence (2.58, 1.24 /C1 5.35, p /C300.01; ref. females). Eighty-three percent (183/227) of those who started ART achieved HIV suppression by six months with noassociation with CD4 at initiation (1.13 per 100 cells/mm 3higher, 0.96/C11.33, p /C300.40). Compared to those with ]95% adherence byVAS, individuals with B95% adherence were somewhat less likely to suppress (0.44, 0.19 /C11.03, p /C300.06). Conclusions : We found no evidence that, among people newly entering HIV care, higher CD4 at ART initiation was associated with reduced adherence or poorer virological suppression, at least in theshort-term. In this rural South African setting, motivation to adhereto ART may be independent of the presence of symptomatic HIV disease. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20340 MOAC0105LB Community-based HIV testing and linkage effectively delivers combination prevention: results from a Linkages1 of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.2Human Sciences Research Council, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.3Integrated Community-Based Initiatives, Kabwohe, Uganda.4Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States. Presenting author email: rbarnaba@uw.edu Introduction : To have a population impact in generalized HIV epidemics in Africa, high coverage of combination HIV preven- tion strategies that reduce the susceptibility of uninfected persons and the infectiousness of infected persons is needed. Community-based HIV testing and counselling, with linkage to care andprevention, is a potential delivery platform for combination HIV prevention. Methods : We conducted a multisite programme of community-based HIV testing and counselling, linkage to HIV care, and demand creation for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) in rural commu- nities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and Sheema district, Uganda.HIV testing was done at home or through mobile units. HIV-positivepersons were randomly allocated to linkage to care strategies: clinic facilitation by lay-counsellors at the initial clinic visit, lay-counsellor follow-up visits at home, or standard clinic referral. HIV-negativeuncircumcised men were randomized to VMMC demand creationstrategies: lay counsellor follow-up visits at home, SMS reminders, or standard VMMC promotion at the time of testing. Results : Between June 2013 and February 2015, 15,332 persons received HIV testing and counselling. Among 1325 HIV-positivepersons randomized to linkage strategies, the overall clinic linkage was high (93%). Compared to standard linkage, lay counsellor clinic facilitation increased linkage to care (RR /C301.09, 95% CI: 1.05 /C11.13), and home follow-up visits increased therapy (ART) initiation (RR /C301.23, 95% CI: 1.02 /C11.47). In all arms, ART initiation was limited by bottlenecks in service delivery at the clinics, although67% of those eligible initiated ART by nine months. Overall, 82% ofpersons initiating ART achieved viral suppression without significant difference between study arms. Of 750 HIV-negative uncircumcised men randomized to VMMC promotion strategies, the uptake ofcircumcision was 41% by month 3. Compared to standard messages,VMMC uptake was significantly higher in the SMS promotion (RR/C301.72, 95% CI: 1.36 /C12.17) 95% 1.29 /C12.14). Conclusions : Community-based HIV testing and linkage to care and prevention effectively deliver combination HIV prevention. Simple strategies, such as SMS reminders or lay-counsellor visits, increaselinkage for ART initiation and male circumcision.

Presenting author email: seshlem@jhmi.edu Introduction : In 2011, results from an interim analysis of the HPTN 052 trial demonstrated that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) washighly effective for the prevention of HIV transmission from HIV- infected adults (index participants) to their HIV-uninfected sexual partners. All index participants were offered ART after May 2011; thetrial ended in May 2015. This report describes the analysis of partnerinfections in HPTN 052. Methods : HIV from index-partner pairs was analyzed. Phylogenetic methods were used to compare HIV pol sequences from index- partner pairs and controls. Linkage probability was further assessed by comparing the genetic distances between polsequences (Bayesian analysis). Selected samples were also analyzed using next genera-tion sequencing ( envy region). Three infections that occurred close to the time of index ART initiation were analyzed by BEAST and serologic methods to determine the probable timing of HIVtransmission. This abstract presents provisional findings based on data available as of May 2015.Results : Seventy-five partner infections were confirmed (64 in Africa, 6 in Asia, 5 in the Americas), including 39 described previously (JID 2011; 204:1918 /C11926). Linkage status was determined for 70 cases (five cases failed analysis). Of these 70 cases, 26 (37%) wereclassified as unlinked (the partner was most likely infected from someone other than the index participant), and 44 (63%) were classified as linked (the index was most likely the source of thepartner ?s HIV infection). In 7 of the 44 linked cases, the partner seroconverted while the index was receiving study ART. In four of these seven cases, the partner seroconverted shortly after the index started ART, likely before the index was virally suppressed. In theremaining three cases, the partner seroconverted when the index was not virally suppressed due to ART failure. Conclusions : Laboratory and statistical methods were used to identify and characterize linked partner infections in HPTN 052. Seven linkedinfections were observed in partners after index participants started study ART: four occurred shortly after ART initiation and three occurred in the setting of ART failure. The timing of the linkedtransmission events supports the model that HIV transmission is veryunlikely in the setting of viral suppression. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20484 MOAC0201 Post prevention of mother-to-child-transmission: 30-months outcomes Oosterhout5and Olivia Keiser1 1Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.2International Training and Education Centre for Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. 3Department of HIV and AIDS, Ministry of Health, Lilongwe, Malawi. 4Baobab Health email: andreas.haas@ispm.unibe.ch Introduction : Under the Option B /C27PMTCT strategy, HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women initiate lifelong ART. Long-term retention after weaning is unknown. We examine treatment out-comes for up to 30-months after ART initiation.Methods : We examined cumulative incidence of mortality, no follow- up after ART initiation, loss to follow-up after the first follow-up visit (LTF), treatment discontinuation and retention in the Malawian''Option B /C27programme.'' We analyzed 24-months aggregated facility-level and data (3225 patients; six large facilities) from OptionB/C27patients who initiated ART during 2011 /C12014. We excluded patients who transferred to another facility. Results :I n facility-level data , 79.9% (52,525/65,749) and 75.0% (40,509/54,029) of all patients were still in care 6 and 12 monthsafter ART initiation. After 24 months, 70.6% (17,257/24,245) wereretained, 26.8% were LTF, 1.5% had died and 0.6% stopped ART. In six large facilities with individual-level data , slightly more patients defaulted or discontinued treatment: 24 and 30 months after ARTinitiation retention was 67.2 and 62.6%. Most patients were lost early and many did not return after the first visit (Figure 1), but after 18 months, further LTF was low.

Presenting author email: nora_rosenberg@unc.edu Introduction In Malawi's antenatal programme, HIV counselling and testing (HCT) for pregnant women is nearly universal, but couple HCT (cHCT) is uncommon, even though it is included in the Option B/C27guidelines. cHCT is critical for HIV-infected women: many have HIV-infected partners in need of HIV diagnosis and treatment orHIV-uninfected partners in need of HIV prevention. cHCT may also increase Option B /C27retention. Two partner recruitment strategies were assessed for cHCT uptake, male HIV status, female Option B /C27 retention and consistent condom use. Abstract MOAC0201 /C1Figure 1. ART outcomes for Option B /C27patients.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 19Methods : Newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women ]16 years with male partners in Lilongwe were recruited from Bwaila DistrictHospital Antenatal Unit from March to October 2014 to participate in a randomized controlled trial. Women in the ''invitation only'' arm received an invitation inviting male partners to antenatal care;women in the ''invitation plus tracing'' arm received the sameinvitation but male partners were traced by phone and/or home visit if they failed to present within one week. Women were assessed one month later. Analyses were conducted using Chi-squared tests.Results : Of 220 eligible women, 200 (90%) consented and enrolled. cHCT uptake was 52% in the invitation only arm and 74% in the invitation plus tracing arm (p /C300.001). Among the 126 men who presented for cHCT, 25% already knew they were HIV-infected, 47%learned they were HIV-infected for the first time and 25% were HIV- uninfected with no difference by arm (p /C300.8). There was a trend towards greater one-month retention among women in the invita-tion plus tracing arm (91%) compared to the invitation only arm(83%) (p /C300.09). Among HIV-discordant couples, unprotected sex declined from 94 to 23% (p B0.001) following cHCT. Participation did not lead to intimate partner violence in either arm.Conclusions : The invitation plus tracing strategy was extremely effective for recruiting male partners for cHCT and substantially more effective than the invitation only strategy. Both strategies identified many HIV-infected men and HIV-discordant couples. cHCT resulted inhigher ART retention, declines in unprotected sex in HIV-discordant couples and no intimate partner violence. Scaling up an invita- tion plus tracing strategy within the Option B /C27programme would have substantial public health benefits. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20342 MOAC0203 Zimbabwe approaching virtual elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV following implementation of Option A Raluca Buzdugan1; Sandra I Frances M Cowan2,9and Nancy S Padian1 1School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, United States.2Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe.3Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco, United States.4Ministry of Health and Child Care, Harare, Zimbabwe.5Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Zimbabwe, Harare,Zimbabwe. 6Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Harare, Zimbabwe.7Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development, Harare, Zimbabwe.8Children's Investment Fund Foundation, London, United Kingdom.9Institute of Epidemiology & Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom. Presenting author email: f.cowan@ucl.ac.uk Introduction : We evaluated the impact of Option A, rolled out in August /C1December 2011, on HIV-free infant survival and mother-to- child transmission (MTCT) in Zimbabwe. Methods : In 2012 and 2014, we conducted cross-sectional commu- nity-based serosurveys of mother-infants pairs residing in thecatchment areas of 157 health facilities randomly selected from 5 of 10 provinces in Zimbabwe. Eligible infants (alive or deceased) were born 9/C118 months before each survey to mothers ]16 years old. We randomly selected mother-infant pairs and conducted questionnaires and verbal autopsies and collected blood samples. The impact analysis was limited to 113 catchment areas unexposed to Option A activities at baseline according to facility records; we estimated the HIV-freeinfant survival and MTCT rate within each catchment area and compared the 2012 and 2014 estimates using a paired t-test.Results : We enrolled 8568 mother-infant pairs with viable maternal specimens in 2012 and 9619 in 2014, of whom 1107 (12.9%) and 1176 (12.2%) 90.6% (95% confidence interval (CI):88.8, 92.3) of infants were alive and HIV-uninfected at 9 /C118 months in 2012, compared to 94.7% CI: 5.3% (95% CI: 4.0, 6.6) in 2014. In the 113 catchment areas where OptionA was implemented after the infants surveyed in 2012 were born, there was a 6.5 percentage point (95% CI: 3.3, 9.7) mean increase in HIV-free infant survival (89.8 to 96.3%, p B0.001), and 6.2 percentage point (95% CI: 3.0, 9.4) mean decrease in MTCT (9.9 to 3.7%, pB0.001). Conclusions : We found a substantial and statistically significant increase in HIV-free infant survival and decrease in MTCT among infants aged9/C118 months following the implementation of Option A in Zimbabwe. Our estimates capture transmissions during pregnancy, delivery and the first 9 /C118 months of breastfeeding. Notably, 72% of HIV-exposed infants were still breastfeeding at baseline and 78% at endline,so additional infections may occur. The 2014 survey also provides a baseline for evaluating Option B /C27, which has been recently rolled out in Zimbabwe and should further accelerate efforts to eliminateMTCT. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20343 MOAC0204 Antiretroviral intensification to prevent intrapartum HIV Chiang Mai, Thailand.2Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard Chan School of Public Health, Boston, United States.3Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.4LASER Analytica, London, United Kingdom.5EA 08, Paris, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart Thailand.8Nopparat Thailand.14Institut National d'Etudes De\u00b4mographiques (INED), Paris, France. Introduction : Infants born to HIV-infected pregnant women present- ing late are at high risk of intrapartum infection. Mother/infantantiretroviral (ARV) intensification may substantially reduce this risk.Methods : In a multicentre, phase 3, adaptive single-arm trial in Thailand, pregnant women with B8 weeks of standard ARVs (zidovudine intensification'' to prevent transmission at delivery: women took a single nevirapine (NVP) dose in labour and continued ARVs for four weeks; formula-fed neonates received twoweeks AZT /C273TC/C27NVP followed by two weeks AZT /C273TC, instead of standard one-week ZDV. Infants were tested for HIV at birth, one, two, four, six months. A negative DNA PCR B48 hours, followed by a confirmed positive PCR defined intrapartum transmission.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 20Data from 3965 mother/infant pairs (84 HIV prevention trials(NCT00386230, NCT00398684 and NCT00409591) conducted in the same setting were used to define an historical control and build an intrapartum transmission model. Viral load (VL) during pregnancy wasmodelled as a function of ARVs exposure and intrapartum transmis-sion was predicted through a logistic model with VL, maternal/infant ARVs, delivery mode and prematurity status as covariates. The Bayesian estimation of the risks of intrapartum transmission with/without intensification used all historical information and decision rules to stop for futility or superiority of ARV intensification over standard of care (risk ratio, RR B1) were determined for three interim analyses. Prior intrapartum transmission probabilities weresubsequently updated using the results of the intensification trial to derive posterior probabilities (credibility interval, CrI) as well as probability distributions of RR B1 and RR B0.5. Results : At first interim analysis, the DSMB recommended stop- ping enrolment and reporting intensification efficacy. Overall 88 mother/infant pairs received intensification with no intrapartum transmission.The posterior intrapartum transmission was /C11.4%) with intensification compared to 2.0% (0.3 /C15.2%)without. The probability of superiority of intensification over stan- dard of care (RR B1) was 94.1%, and that of at least a two-fold reduction of risk (RR B0.5) was 82.9%. ARV intensification appeared safe. Conclusions : ARV intensification is very effective in preventing intra- partum transmission in pregnant women receiving a short courseantepartum ARVs before delivery. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20344 MOAC0205LB Costs of Zimbabwe's accelerated prevention of mother-to- child of HIV programme Ivan Ochoa-Moreno1; Collin Mangenah2; 1National Institute Public Health, Mexico.2Centre for Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Research, Harare, Zimbabwe.3University of California, Berkeley, United States.4University College London, London, United Kingdom. Presenting author email: f.cowan@ucl.ac.uk Introduction : In 2010 and 2013, World Health Organization issued revised guidelines on the recommended approaches for preventionof mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) (Options A, B, B /C27). Estimating the cost of these PMTCT regimens is essential. We estimated the cost of Option A in Zimbabwe, which was rolled out in2011. These data also represent baseline estimates to assess the cost-effectiveness of Option B /C27, rolled out in Zimbabwe in late 2013.Methods : We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 157 randomly selected health facilities offering PMTCT services in 5 of 10 provinces in Zimbabwe. In each facility, we collected data on the output and cost of PMTCT services, including staff and supplies for the wholeyear and for each month of 2013. We also assessed the timeallocation of staff providing these services. We estimated the average cost of PMTCT services per facility and for specific services in the PMTCT cascade such as HIV testing and antiretroviral prophylaxis. Wealso examined the variation in costs by the type of provider.Abstract MOAC0204 /C1Table 1.

On average, 80% of the overallcost corresponds to staff (US$10,900) and the remaining 20% to supplies (US$2700). The average cost per pregnant woman tested was US$75 (median US$44) and the average cost per HIV-infectedpregnant woman on antiretroviral prophylaxis or treatment wasUS$1040 (median US$527) per year. Scale was associated with cost; 40% of the variation in the cost per pregnant woman tested can be explained by number of HIV /C27women on ART/ARV, as was 50% of the variation in prophylaxis and treatment costs (see Figure). Conclusions : These findings are the first empirical estimations of PMTCT programmes costs in Zimbabwe. Given limited resources,calls for the elimination of MTCT have challenged the internationalcommunity to optimize the use of resources to increase coverage of PMTCT priority services. Information about costs is essential to determine the highest possible quality HIV services at the lowestfeasible cost and thus maximize efficiency. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20485 MOAC0301LB Increasing uptake of voluntary medical male circumcision among men aged 20 /C134 years in Njombe and Tabora regions, Mwanza, Tanzania, United Republic of Tanzania.2LSHTM, London, United Kingdom.3CDC/CGH/DGHA, Atlanta, United States. 4MITU/LSHTM, Mwanza, Tanzania, United Republic of Tanzania. 5Jhpiego/Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, United Republic of Tanzania.Presenting author email: wmwita@yahoo.com Introduction : Tanzania introduced voluntary medical male circumci- sion (VMMC) in 2009 as part of its national HIV prevention strategy.Reaching men aged 20 /C134 years with circumcision may affect the most immediate reduction in HIV incidence. However, approximately 80% of VMMC clients in Tabora and Njombe regions are aged 10 /C119years. This study evaluated the effect of a strategy to increase VMMC uptake among men aged 20 /C134 years in Njombe and Tabora. Methods : A cluster-randomized controlled trial at 20 VMMC outreach sites was conducted in Njombe and Tabora, focusing on increasing VMMC uptake. The intervention, which was informed by formative research, included 1) additional demand-creation messages (non-HIVbenefits of VMMC, voluntary nature of HIV testing), 2) involvement ofrecently circumcised men as auxiliary peer promoters, 3) separate waiting and education areas for men aged /C2120 years, and 4) sessions on wound healing and post-circumcision abstinence targeting femalepartners. Analysis was based on cluster-level summary measures. Results : Overall, 6251 men were enrolled in 10 intervention sites (1809 Njombe and 4442 Tabora) and 3968 men in the 10 control sites(1035 Njombe and 2933 Tabora). The proportion of clients aged20/C134 was greater in intervention sites compared to control sites (17.7% vs. 13.0%; RR /C301.4; 95% CI: 0.9 /C12.0; p/C300.11) and was associated with a greater number of clients in both regions (overallmean difference /C30227; 95% CI: 33 /C1420; p/C300.03). The effect of the intervention varied by region: in Njombe, there was little difference in attendance between control and intervention sites (11.3% vs. 14.7%; RR/C300.77, 95% CI: 0.4 /C11.6; p/C300.43), twofold vs. 11.5%; RR /C302.39, 95% CI: 1.7 /C13.4; the mean number of clients aged 20 /C134 was greater in intervention facilities in Tabora (mean difference /C30182; 95% CI: 5 /C1359; p/C300.05) and /C3012; 95% CI: /C2813 to 36; p /C300.31). Conclusions : The intervention was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of VMMC clients aged 20 /C134 years in Tabora but not in Njombe. The lack of intervention effect in Njombemay be due to saturation, as VMMC has been available for longer. The results suggest that the intervention may be more likely to be effective in areas newly targeted for VMMC. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20486 MOAC0302LB Acceptability and feasibility of a novel approach to promote HIV testing in sexual and social networks using HIV self-tests Harsha Thirumurthy1,2; Immaculate /C1Figure 1.

HIV self-testing is an emerging approach with high acceptability, but limited evidence exists on optimal strategies for distributing self- tests and reaching men in particular. This study explored a novelapproach of providing multiple self-tests to women with high HIV incidence to promote HIV testing among their sexual partners. Methods : HIV-uninfected women aged 18 /C139 years were recruited at two sites in Kisumu, Kenya between January and March 2015: adrop-in centre for female sex workers (FSWs) and a health facility with antenatal and postpartum clinics. Following informed consent and instructions on using the OraQuick Rapid HIV 1/2 Test, indexparticipants (IPs) enrolled at the health facility and drop-in centrereceived three and five self-tests, respectively. Structured interviews were conducted with IPs at enrolment and multiple times over three months to determine how self-tests were used. Key outcomesincluded the proportion of IPs reporting their primary sexual partnerused a self-test. Results : A total of 278 IPs were enrolled (101 FSWs, 61 antenatal, 116 postpartum). Follow-up interviews were completed with 262 IPs(94.2%) by May 9, 2015. Most self-tests provided at enrolment were either used by the IP or given to other persons (mean 2.7 (90%) for antenatal and postpartum IPs, 4.7 (94%) for FSWs). All but two IPsgave]1 self-tests to other persons, and a large majority gave a self- test to their primary sexual partner (77% and 86% postpartum). Ninety-eight percent of self-tests given to other persons were reported to be used. Among 367 persons who receivedself-tests from FSWs and used them, commercial sex clients were thelargest group (211, 57%). In total, 10.6% (72/681) of those who received self-tests from IPs and used them were reported to obtain an HIV-positive result; 55% of them sought confirmatory testing.Conclusions : Provision of multiple HIV self-tests to sub-populations of women with high HIV incidence was successful in promoting HIV testing among their sexual partners. This novel strategy warrants further consideration as countries develop self-testing policies. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20487 MOAC0303LB Community outbreak of HIV infection linked to injection drug use of oxymorphone /C1Indiana, 2015 Joan Duwve1,2; Karen Waterhouse4and Paul Weidle3 1Indiana State Department of Health, Indianapolis, United States. 2Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, Indiana University, Indianapolis, United States.3Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States.4Clark County Health Department, Jeffersonville, United States. Presenting author email: jduwve@iu.edu Introduction : On 23 January 2015, the Indiana State Department of Health began investigating an outbreak of HIV infection after disease intervention specialists (DIS) reported 11 confirmed HIV cases traced to a rural community in southeastern Indiana that had reported fiveHIV cases between 2004 and 2013. From 2009 to 2013, the com-munity (population 4200) had substantial unemployment (8.9%), many adults without high school diplomas (21.3%), a substantialproportion living in poverty (19%) and a limited healthcare access. A public health emergency was declared on March 26 by executive order. We report on efforts to diagnose HIV infection in thiscommunity.Methods : For individuals newly diagnosed with HIV infection, partner services' interviews elicited information about needle- sharing and sex partners and social contacts (who could benefitfrom an HIV test) within the past 12 months. HIV testing was offeredto all contacts who could be located. Results : DIS identified 491 unique individuals during contact tracing, and as of May 13, 390/491 (79%) persons were located, assessed forrisk and tested for HIV. Overall, 153/390 (39%) persons were diagnosed with HIV infection. There was no difference in age and sex between HIV-positive and HIV-negative tested persons (Table 1).Compared with HIV-negative contacts (n /C30239), the 153 HIV-infected individuals were more likely to be named as needle-sharing partners (81% vs. 52%; p B0.0001) and less likely to be named as sexual partners only (1% vs. 15%; p B0.0001) during contract tracing. All individuals reporting injection drug use described practices includingcrushing, dissolving and cooking OPANA ER or extended-release generic oxymorphone. The reported daily numbers of injections ranged from 4 to 15, and the number of injection partners rangedfrom 1 to 6 per injection event. Individuals reported that injectiondrug use in this community is a multigenerational activity with family and community members injecting together, frequently sharing syringes and drug preparation equipment.Conclusions : This outbreak highlights the vulnerability of rural, resource-poor populations to drug use, misuse and addiction; the importance of timely HIV surveillance activities and rapid response tointerrupt disease transmission and the need for expanded mentalhealth and substance use treatment programmes in medically underserved rural areas. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20488 MOAC0304LB HIV-1 and HCV molecular epidemiology of a large community outbreak of HIV-1 infection linked to injectiondrug use of oxymorphone /C1Indiana, 2015 Romeo R Galang1,2; Jessica Philip Sara J HIV cases and contacts identified during investigation HIV- positive N (%)HIV- negative N (%)Total N (%) Overall 153 237 390 Male sex 88 (58) 132 (56) 220 (56) Median age (range) 34 (18 /C157) 35 (13 /C175) 34 (13 /C175) HIV risk factorSexual risk only 2 (1) 36 (15) 38 (10)Needle-sharing risk only 65 (42) 87 (37) 152 (39)Sexual and needle-sharing risk59 (39) 36 (15) 95 (24) Unknown 27 (18) 78 (33) 105 (27)8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 23S Michele Owen1; Andrea Perez3; Paula Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, CDC, Atlanta, United States. 2Epidemic Intelligence Service, CDC, Atlanta, United States.3Indiana State Department of Health, Indianapolis, United States.4Richard M.

Presenting author email: ydh0@cdc.gov Introduction : In January 2015, a cluster of HIV-1 infections was detected in a rural county in southeastern Indiana among persons who reported injection of the prescription opioid oxymorphone. As of 13 May 2015, HIV-1 infection has been diagnosed in 153 individuals.We compare molecular analyses of HIV-1 and HCV sequences among a subset of individuals in this outbreak to infer the timing of HIV transmission relative to HCV.Methods : Serum and plasma samples were collected from November 2014 to April 2015. HIV polymerase ( pol) gene sequences from persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection were phylogenetically analyzed. Phylogenetic clusters were defined when HIV-1 polsequences were highly genetically related ( /C2197% nucleotide identity) and statistical evidence supporting relatedness was high (Shimodaira /C1Hasegawa probabilities /C210.99). Recency of HIV infection was determined by avidity testing using a modified Bio-Rad HIV 1/2 plus O assay (BRAI).HCV NS5B gene sequences were phylogenetically analyzed todetermine the of clusters of independent HCV strains within this population.Results : The polgene was sequenced for 57 HIV-1-infected persons. Two clusters of HIV-1 subtype B infection were identified (Cluster 1, n/C3055; Cluster 2, n /C302; Figure, panel a). Among 49 specimens available for BRAI testing, 45 (91.8%) were recent infections. Of 36HIV-infected specimens with HCV antibody results, 34 (94%) were HCV co-infected. The HCV-infected persons. Genotype 1a (n /C3082) /C3029), 2b (n /C305) and 1b (n /C303). Three unique clusters of HCV strains were identified (Cluster 1, n /C3045; Cluster 2, n /C309; Cluster 3, n /C307; Figure, panel b). Of 118 HCV-infected specimens with HIV antibody results, 38 (32.2%) were HIV co-infected.Conclusions : In this prescription opioid injection-associated out- break, a single strain of HIV-1 was introduced into a population infected with multiple HCV strains. In contrast to the homogeneity ofHIV strains observed in this cohort, the heterogeneity of HCV strains(clustering and non-clustering) suggests earlier introduction of HCV compared with HIV. These data demonstrate the outbreak potential with the introduction of HIV-1 into a community where HCVprevalence is high among persons who inject prescription opioids. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20489 MOAC0305LB HPTN 067/ADAPT intermittent pre-exposure prophylaxis dosing for HIV prevention in men who have sex with men andtransgender women in New York city Sharon Mannheimer1,2,3; Yael Hirsch-Moverman2,3; Avelino Loquere3; Julie Franks3; James Cluster 1 Cluster Cluster 1 (n = 59) 55 patientsCluster 2(a) (b) (n = 3) 2 patients 100% Nuc.

Exclusion criteria included HIV infection, hepatitis B infection, acuteHIV symptoms and abnormal renal function. Following six weeks of once/week directly observed dosing, participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 24 weeks of PrEP dosed: daily (D), twice weeklyplus one post-sex dose (time-driven (T)), or one pre- and one post-sex dose (event-driven (E)). Regimens were compared for prophy- lactic coverage (PrEP within four days pre- and 24 hours post-sex) of sex events, pills taken, side effects and plasma drug levels.Adherence and coverage were assessed using electronic monitoringadjusted by self-reported sex and pill taking behaviour collected in detailed weekly interviews.Results : A total of 179 participants were randomized: 176 MSM, 3 TGW; median age 30 years; 70% black, 13% white and 25% Hispanic.D arm participants had significantly higher complete coverage of sexacts (66% D, 47% T, 52% E; p /C300.03; Table 1) and highest adherence to regimen (65% D, 46% T, 41% E; p B0.001). Significantly fewer pills were used with intermittent (T and E) PrEP (p B0.001). Side effects were similar across arms, with gastrointestinal and neurologic symp-toms most common.

An alternate dosing (non-daily) regimenwas effective in the IPERGAY trial. Daily and non-daily regimens havenot been compared directly with respect to prophylactic coverage for sexual exposure. Methods : We enrolled men who have sex with men (MSM) into a phase 2, randomized, open-label trial of oral FTC/TDF PrEP inBangkok, Thailand. We randomly assigned participants to one of three self-administered dosing regimens for 24 weeks: daily (D); time-driven twice weekly with a post-sex dose (T) or event-drivenbefore and after sex (E). We contacted participants weekly to collect dates/times of PrEP use (monitored electronically by Wisepill TM) and sex events. We defined adherence as the proportion of tablets takenas recommended, and coverage as taking ]1 tablet in the four days before sex and ]1 tablet within 24 hours after sex. Results : We randomized 178 MSM (median age 31 years). PrEP coverages were similar in arms D and T (85% vs. 84%, p /C300.79) and both were greater than in arm E (74%; p B0.05). Adherence was greater in D (85%) compared with T (79%) or E (65%; p B0.001). Compared with D, the number of doses required for full adherence was reduced by 57% in T and by 80% in E (p B0.001). Among MSM reporting sex in the past week, PBMC detectable (96.6%) in T and 28/30 (93.3%) in E at week 10 on study, and (91.3%), 18/19 (94.7%) /C300.54). Median PBMC drug concentrations at week 30 were highest among men in D (102.0 vs. 46.8 vs. 32.9 fmol/million cells for D, T and E, respectively, p B0.001). No HIV infections occurred after randomization.Conclusions : Compared with the daily regimen, the time-driven dosing regimens offered comparably high PrEP coverage for sex acts for Thai MSM, despite slightly less adherence, while requiring fewertablets. However, since non-daily dosing results in significantly lowerPBMC drug concentrations, stricter adherence is required under these regimens to maintain prophylactic drug concentrations. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20539 MOAD0101 Rapid uptake and adoption of the WHO 2013 consolidated ARV guideline recommendations: paving the way to achieving the 90/90/90 global target World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.2AFRO, World Health Organization, Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo.3SEARO, World Health Organization, New Delhi, India. 4PAHO/WHO, Washington, DC, United States.5WPRO, World Health Organization, Manila, Philippines.6EMRO, World Health Organization, Cairo, Egypt.7EURO, World Health Organization, Copenhagen, Denmark.Presenting author email: dohertym@who.int Introduction : Progress towards the ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 critically depends on adoption of global guidelines that address evidenced based proven approaches to optimally treat all people living with HIV and how to best deliver interventions. With the 2013 Consolidated ARV Guidelines , WHO successfully launched new policy recommendations on the clinical, operational, programmatic and M&E aspects of HIV treatment and care. Methods : WHO HQ with regional and country offices, held nine capacity building and dissemination consultations for /C21100 coun- tries from 2013 to 2014. Through triangulation of baseline surveys, e-surveys with the country MoH HIV focal point and data compiledfrom the 2014 Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting, we havedocumented the adoption of priority HIV treatment policies within the 58 WHO focal countries. Data are presented through end 2014. Results : Within 18 months of the launch of the 2013 consolidated antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) guidelines, 44 of 58 (76%) of focuscountries adopted at least one of the major recommendations; globally another 25 countries were in the process of adopting. Sixty percent of focus countries adopted a CD4 count initiation of 5500 cells/mm 3, while Brazil, Thailand and Yemen offer treatment to all adults regardless of CD4 cell count.

Presenting author email: jacob.levi11@imperial.ac.ukIntroduction : UNAIDS has set the ''90 /C190/C190'' target for all coun- tries: to diagnose 90% of all HIV positive people, provide antire- trovirals for 90% of those diagnosed and achieve undetectable HIVRNA for 90% of those treated, in every country worldwide by 2020.This translates to at least 73% of all HIV positive people achieving undetectable HIV RNA in every country. We used national level HIV treatment cascades to analyze whether countries have achievedthese targets.Methods : We compared published estimates of HIV treatment cas- cades across 12 countries in Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, Australia and sub-Saharan Africa. Cascades wereselected based on reliable, generalizable, recently published resultsfrom large cross-sectional and longitudinal study cohorts. Data were analyzed in six stages: 1) HIV positive people, 2) Diagnosed, 3) Linked to care, 4) Retained in care, 5) On antiretroviral treatment (ART), 6)Undetectable HIV RNA. Each country level cascade was analyzed to identify whether each stage of the 90 /C190/C190 target was met. Results : The percentage of HIV positive people who both received ART and achieved undetectable HIV-RNA ranged from 9% (Russia) to73% (Switzerland). None of the 12 countries met the UNAIDS target of 90% of HIV positive people diagnosed. One country (Switzerland) met the target of 90% of diagnosed people on ART. Five countries(Switzerland, Australia, UK, Denmark and The Netherlands) met thetarget of 90% of treated people with undetectable HIV RNA. While five Western European countries achieved /C2150% undetectable HIV- RNA, three Eastern European countries achieved under B20%. USA achieved undetectable HIV-RNA for 30% overall, the lowest amongst high-income countries, comparable to sub-Saharan Africa (29%).

Conclusions : Only one of the 12 countries analyzed achieved the UNAIDS 90 /C190/C190 coverage target of 73% of HIV positive people with undetectable HIV RNA. There were disparities between coun- tries. A standardized reporting method should be implemented to facilitate comparisons between countries to better identify gaps andinform policy. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20346 MOAD0103 Major outcomes of early HAART wave of Giganti2; Catherine Mc Gowan2and Caribbean, Central America and South America Network (CCASAnet) 1School of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.2Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, United States.Presenting author email: marcewolff@yahoo.com Introduction : Expanded access to HAART in Latin America began slowly in the late 1990s and faster in early 2000s; many antiretro- virals used then, are now outdated and most patients presentedwith advanced disease stages. Characterizing these patients' major outcomes (death, loss to follow-up (LTFU), viral suppression, CD4 /C27 cell (CD4) count evolution and regimen changes) after a decade of HAART /C1not well defined at present /C1may provide insights into their present and future situation and provide information relevantfor the management of patients who initiated HAART more recently.Methods : The study included adults from six CCASAnet sites: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras and Mexico who initiated HAART before 2004, without exclusion of non-ART-na \u00a8ve. Status (active, LTFU or dead) for each patient was registered at six-monthintervals for up to 10 years, as well as CD4 and viral load (VL) in active patients. The proportions of patients in first, second, third or further HAART regimen or not on HAART were also measured.Results : In total, 4975 patients (66% male) met inclusion criteria. At HAART initiation, the median age was 35 years, 23% had AIDS and 45% were not ART-na \u00a8ve. At 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years, overall rates of mortality were 4.2, 6.8, 9.0, 10.8 and 13.6% respectively. LTFUrates for the same periods were 2.4, 6.8, 10.9, 14.8 and 24.2% respectively; 62% remained in active care at 10 years (Figure 1). At the end of follow up, 85% of active patients had VL B400 copies/mL (Haiti excluded because VL not regularly measured) and median CD4increased from 153 to 517 cells/mm 3 .After 10 years, only 11% of patients remained active and on their first HAART regimen, 13% were on their second, 12% were on their third and 23% were on theirfourth or more regimen. Heterogeneity in outcomes between sites was substantial. Abstract MOAD0103 /C1Figure 1. Major outcomes of early HAART programs at CCASAnet.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 28Conclusions : Despite advanced disease and use of mostly old antire- trovirals, a large proportion of first HAART initiators in these LatinAmerican cohorts were alive, in active control, with substantial im- mune recovery and virologic suppression after 10 years. Early death was a problem as well as persistent LTFU and frequent change of therapy. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20347 MOAD0104 Integrating HIV-care into primary care clinics improved access to treatment and did not compromise primary healthcare: province-wide trend analysis over four years during implementation in Free State, South Africa Angeli Rawat1; K E Uebel2; David Moore3and Annalee Yassi1 1School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.2Free State Department of Health, Bloemfontein, South Africa.3British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada. Presenting author email: angelirawat@gmail.com Introduction : The integration of HIV-care into primary health care (PHC) clinics is a strategy to expand access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, integration may compromise PHC service delivery within weak health systems. We designed a study to examinechanges in PHC service provision (pre and post-integration) in public-sector PHC clinics in Free State, South Africa. Methods : We analyzed administrative data on 15 PHC indicators. The data were collected monthly over a critical four year period asintegration was implemented into 131 PHC clinics representing a catchment population of 1.5 million. We defined integration as the month and year the PHC clinic provided comprehensive HIV-care,from testing to treatment to follow-up. We utilized interrupted timeseries analysis at 918 and930 months from HIV integration in each clinic to identify changes in PHC services post-integration. We conduc- ted sensitivity analyses with linear mixed effect models to study therelationship between HIV service indicators and the PHC indicators.Results : The number of patients receiving ART in the 131 PHC clinics studied increased from 121 (April 2009) to 57,958 (March 2013). Wedid not observe any changes in service indicators for 11 of the 15 PHC indicators we examined, However, we did observe decreasesin population-level immunization coverage after integration by 0.98% (SE/C300.25, pB0.001) at 918 months and by 1.31% (SE /C300.16, pB0.001) at 930 months. Clinic level immunization coverage also decreased by 33 infants per 100,000 patients (SE /C308, pB0.001) at 930 months. None of these changes were associated with the number of HIV patients at the clinics. We also observed decreases in total clinic visits per year for adults and children under five years old.Conclusions : Despite an extraordinary increase in patients accessing ART in PHC clinics during our study period, the vast majority of PHC indicators remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that the integration of HIV-care into public-sector PHC clinics is a viable strategythrough which to expand access to ART. However, further research is needed to understand how immunization coverage is affected. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20348 MOAD0105LB Implementation scale up of the Adherence Club model of care to 30,000 stable antiretroviral therapy patients in the Cape Metro: 2011 Cape Town, South Africa.2City Health, Cape Town Municipality, Cape Town, South Africa.3Department of Health, Western Cape Government, Cape Town, South Africa. 4Institute for Healthcare Improvement, Boston, United States. 5University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. Presenting author email: msfocb-khayelitsha-coord@brussels.msf.org Introduction : The Adherence Club (AC) model of care was piloted by Me\u00b4decins Sans Frontie `res starting in 2007. ACs are groups of approximately 30 stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients who met every eight weeks for group support, brief symptom screen and collection of pre-packed ART facilitated by a lay-healthcare worker.Following good pilot outcomes, from 2011 the Cape Metro health Abstract MOAD0105LB /C1Figure 1.

Few data on large-scale implementation of novel models of care exist. We describe the implementation scale-up across the district highlighting key efficien- cies and context-specific adaptations to the model.Methods : We describe the scale-up from January 2011 to December 2014. Data from routine electronic monitoring of the ART pro- gramme provide the total number of ART patients retained in care (RIC) while monitoring of AC participation is reported monthly byeach AC.Results : AC implementation expanded over the four-year period with the number of patients retained in AC care increasing annually from 5675 in December 2011 to 30,790 in December 2014 (Figure 1). ByDecember 2014, ACs were offered at 76.1% of ART facilities (51/76) with only 7.5% of ART patients in care at a facility where ACs were not operating. The proportion of patients receiving ART within an ACgrew from 7.3% in 2011 to 25.0% by the end of 2014 (Figure 1).Conclusions : Over a four-year period, the AC model of care was widely accepted and expanded to support a quarter of all patients receiving ART in the district. Adaptations to the model of caresupported implementation within the various facility contexts.Some facilities offered ACs at the facility while others decentralized the model to outreach community and home venues. Most used various lay cadres of staff, while some used nurses to facilitatethe groups. The model offered efficiencies both to patients and the health system. For ACs to expand to provide quality care to a greater proportion of ART patients, appropriate resources arerequired. Further research is needed to evaluate the outcomes ofAC patients. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20540 TU/C1TUESDAY TUAA0101 Phylogenetically estimated HIV diversification rates reveal prevention of HIV-1 by antiretroviral therapy Jeffrey Joy; Art Poon BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada. Presenting author email: jjoy@cfenet.ubc.ca Introduction : Treatment of HIV infection with antiretrovirals reduces individuals' plasma viral loads to undetectable levels and in turn decreases the risk of transmission. Despite epidemiological evidence supporting the efficacy of ''Treatment as Prevention,'' quantifyingthis success remains a significant challenge. Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequence data can yield crucial insights into epidemic processes, including transmission dynamics. We sought to evaluate the impactof treatment on HIV transmission rates in British Columbia (BC),Canada, using phylogenetic methods. Methods : We recovered 27,296 anonymized HIV protease and RT sequences from 7747 HIV patients in BC from the BC Centre forExcellence in HIV/AIDS database. Sequences were annotated with:sample collection date, treatment status at sample collection, date of first antiretroviral treatment and risk factor (intravenous drug use (IDU), men having sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual (HET)).Codons associated with known drug resistance were censored from the alignment prior to tree inference. We inferred a set of 1000 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. We calculated a lineagelevel phylogenetic branching rate for each HIV lineage in the trees,which provides an approximate measure of transmission rates. We stratified branching rates by treatment experience and risk factor.To assess the impact of treatment on onward transmission of HIV, we compared the mean HIV branching rate between treatment-experienced and treatment-naive lineages across the BC epidemic as a whole and among risk factors. Results : Phylogenetic branching rates were significantly lower among treatment-experienced HIV lineages relative to treatment-naivelineages (p B0.001), implying reduced rates of HIV transmission in the former. Importantly, treatment experienced lineages had signifi- cantly lower HIV branching rates irrespective of HIV transmissionrisk factor (p B0.001 for IDU, MSM and HET) or exposure to different antiretroviral drug classes (p B0.001 NRTI, NNRTI, PI), suggesting these results are not driven by penetrance of health care into particular risk groups or therapeutic regimens.Conclusions : Our results provide independent evidence that anti- retroviral HIV treatment has limited the onward transmission of HIV to new hosts. These results are based on a lineage level measure,are measured phylogenetically rather than epidemiologically andare replicated both across different risk exposure categories and different treatment regimens. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20349 TUAA0102 Phenotypic properties Arts1 1Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.2Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, United States.3Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. Presenting author email: kklein5@uwo.ca Introduction : Sexual HIV-1 infection requires penetration of the virus across the mucosal barrier and the establishment of infection in target cells. It is widely accepted that only one or a small number of HIV-1 clones is successfully transmitted from the donor to therecipient. However, little is known about the phenotypic properties of the transmitted virus and the influence the phenotype plays in the genetic bottleneck selection process. Here we evaluated possiblephenotypic differences between acute and chronic HIV-1 that mayeffect transmission fitness. Methods : We compared the genetic diversity of HIV-1 isolates from the female genital tract with isolates from the blood of the samedonor by 454 pyrosequencing of the env region. Furthermore, wegenerated chimeric viruses from acute and chronic envelope genes using a yeast-based cloning strategy. The chimeric clones were then evaluated for host cell entry and receptor efficiency, sensitivityto entry inhibitors and for replication fitness in PBMCs, T cells and macrophages. Additionally we evaluated the transmission fitness across mucosal tissues by multi-virus competitions.Results : Both acute and chronic HIV-1 clones showed similar cell entry and receptor efficiency, sensitivity to inhibitors and replication fitness. Sequence analysis revealed that primary infection in the cervix resulted in a highly genetically diverse HIV-1 population, while only one or a fewHIV-1 clones are in matched blood. Analysis of mixed competitions ofacute and chronic HIV-1 env-clones in ex vivo tissue models revealed higher transmission fitness of acute isolates than chronic. We observed that higher transmission fitness was related to a reduced number ofconserved N-linked glycans on the envelope of acute viruses. Conclusions : Chronic HIV-1 isolates appear to stay and replicate in the mucosal tissue, while acute isolates are preferentially bound bytissue residing dendritic cells/langerhans cells (DCs/LCs) and aresubsequently transmitted to T cells.

Presenting author email: nkinloch@sfu.ca Introduction : HLA-driven HIV-1 immune escape mutations that persist following transmission could gradually spread in the viral population,compromising host antiviral immunity over time. We investigate the extent and correlates of escape mutation accumulation in HIV-1 Polymerase (Pol) sequences in North America from 1979 to present.Methods : HIV-1 RNA Pol and HLA class I genotyping was performed on 338 Historic (1979 /C11989) and 278 Modern (2001 /C12011) specimens from Boston, New York, San Francisco and Vancouver. HLA-associatedpolymorphisms were defined according to published lists. Historic andmodern datasets were also investigated for the presence for novel HLA-associated mutations using phylogenetically- informed methods. Ancestral reconstruction of the HIV-1 epidemic founder sequence wasperformed using bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees(BEAST) and Hypothesis testing using Phylogenies (HyPhy). Results : The estimated HIV-1 epidemic founder sequence dated to /C21969 and was near-identical to the modern subtype B consensus, suggesting no historic selective sweeps have occurred to shift thepopulation consensus. No HLA-associated polymorphisms unique to the historic dataset were identified. Nevertheless, pairwise sequence diversity of modern HIV-1 sequences was approximately two-foldgreater than historic sequences, with diversification predominating at HLA-associated sites (p B0.0002). N /C3020 published HLA-associated polymorphisms were investigated for spread over time. Overall, theirmedian ''background'' frequencies (in individuals lacking the restrict-ing HLA) were 6.6% vs. 16.8% in historic and modern eras respectively (p/C300.0004); polymorphism frequencies in reconstructed pre-1979 ancestral sequences were also consistent with gradual spread(pB0.01). No correlation was observed between HLA allele fre- quency and relative spread of its associated polymorphisms (r /C30 /C280.13, p /C300.8); rather, polymorphisms restricted by protective HLA alleles exhibited greater relative spread than those restrictedby non-protective alleles (r /C300.83, p /C300.0047). Despite these overall increases, the frequency of many polymorphisms (e.g. B*51- associated RT-I135T) remained consistent throughout the eras.Moreover, at the whole-sequence level, the median extent ofadaptation of the typical circulating modern HIV-1 Pol sequenceto the average North American host remains 0%, indicating a low overall risk of acquiring HIV-1 harbouring adaptations to one's HLAprofile. Conclusions : Immune escape mutations in HIV-1 Pol have spread significantly in the population since the genesis of the North Americanepidemic; however, these changes are unlikely to herald immediateconsequences for host antiviral immunity on this continent. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20351 TUAA0104 Primary resistance against dolutegravir Wainberg University AIDS Centre, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research-Jewish General Hospital, Montre \u00b4al, Canada.

In tissue culture experiments, we have identified the R263K resistance substitution as a signaturesubstitution for HIV resistance against dolutegravir, an observationthat was later confirmed in highly treatment-experienced individuals. Given the importance of DNA integration in the establishment of HIV persistence, we tested the ability of dolutegravir-resistant HIVstrains to integrate within human DNA.Methods : We used an Alu-mediated quantitative PCR to measure levels of integration of dolutegravir-resistant variants in primary human PBMCs. Levels of integration were normalized using the b-actin gene. These experiments were performed using subtype B andC viruses. Results : Our results show that dolutegravir-resistant variants are impaired in their ability to integrate within human DNA. The inte-gration levels of subtype B and C R263K variants were decreased by 30% and 40% compared to WT viruses, respectively. More important, the addition of several secondary substitutions failed to restoreintegration to a level comparable to WT and, in some cases, furtherlowered integration to only 20% of WT. Conclusions : The relative inability of dolutegravir-resistant variants to integrate within human DNA may contribute to a progressivedecrease in the viral reservoir of individuals who develop thesesubstitutions. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20352 TUAA0105 HIV-1 integrase variants retarget proviral Jonas Demeulemeester1; Sofie Vets1; Rik Schrijvers1; Leuven University, Leuven, Belgium.2HIV Pathogenesis Program, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, Nelson R Mandela Schoolof Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa. 3KU Leuven University, Chemistry, Leuven, Belgium.

A tetramer of the viral integrase (IN) assembles on the two viral cDNA ends, docks onto the target DNA (tDNA) to form the target capture8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 31complex (TCC) and catalyzes viral genome insertion into the host chromatin.Methods : We combined structural information on the Prototype Foamy Virus TCC with conservation in retroviral IN protein align- ments to determine aa-tDNA base contacts. We generated HIV-1variants based on the observed variability at these positions,assessed replication capacities and performed integration site sequencing to reveal their integration preferences. Finally, we examined their effect on disease progression in a chronic HIV-1subtype C infection cohort.Results : We identified retroviral IN amino acids affecting molecular recognition in the TCC and resulting in distinct local tDNA nucleotide biases. These residues also determine the propensity of the virus tointegrate into flexible tDNA sequences. Remarkably, natural poly- morphisms IN S119G and IN R231G retarget viral integration away from gene dense regions. Precisely these variants were associated withrapid disease progression in a chronic HIV-1 subtype C infection cohort.Conclusions : Our findings reveal how polymorphisms at positions corresponding to HIV IN 119and IN 231affect both local and global integration site targeting. Intriguingly, these findings link integrationsite selection to virulence and viral evolution but also to the hostimmune response and antiretroviral therapy, since HIV-1 IN 119is under selection by HLA alleles and integrase inhibitors. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20353 TUAA0106LB HIV-1-specific IgG antibody levels correlate with the presence of a specific HLA class II allele to impactacquisition and vaccine efficacy Rasmi Thomas1 1US Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, United States.2Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States.3Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States.4Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Inc., Frederick, United States.5New York University School of Medicine, New York, United States.6AFRIMS, Bangkok, Thailand.7Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand. 8Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.9Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, United States. Presenting author email: rthomas@hivresearch.org Introduction : The RV144 trial had a vaccine efficacy of 31%, and IgG antibodies to HIV-1 Envelope (Env) amino acid positions 120 /C1204 were identified as a predictor of decreased risk of infection. The IgG responses were binding to scaffolded Env antigen comprising the variable loops 1 and 2, flanked by partial regions of the first andsecond conserved domains. Since HLA class II molecules areexpressed on antigen-presenting cells and modulate CD4 T-cell stimulation of antibody production by B cells, we tested whether HLA allotypes influenced vaccine response and efficacy.Methods : HLA-DRB1, DQB1 and DPB1 were genotyped in 760 individuals. Direct associations of 31 HLA class II alleles on Env (120/C1204)-specific IgG were compared using linear regression models. Interaction of HLA with IgG response to Env (120 /C1204) was tested for an effect on acquisition by logistic regression. Results : Higher levels of Env (120 /C1204) IgG antibody directly cor- related with (p /C300.002, q /C300.05). Env (120/C1204)-specific IgG antibody levels also associated with decreasedrisk of HIV-1 infection only with the presence of DPB1*13 (OR /C300.29 per 1-SD increase, p /C300.006). Both of these findings were replicated with Env antigens across multiple viral subtypes. Vaccine efficacy increased to 71% among individuals that were DPB1*13 /C27and had higher levels of Env (120 /C1204)-specific IgG levels relative to the placebos. To delineate the anti-Env antibody responses in DPB1*13 /C27 individuals, we screened overlapping peptides to Env (120 /C1204). Frequency and magnitude of IgG response specifically to Env peptide positions 119 /C1133, which are involved in Env binding to CD4, associated with both presence of DPB1*13 and protection from HIV-1 acquisition among individuals with a DPB1*13 allele. Further evidence that immune responses induced by vaccination in individuals carrying DPB1*13 are different from those without DPB1*13was apparent in significant viral sequence differences specifically in infected vaccine recipients with DPB1*13. Conclusions : DPB1*13-associated immune responses to vaccination is associated with decreased risk of HIV-1 acquisition. The specificdifferences in vaccine-induced responses elicited by individuals with HLA-DPB1*13 should be examined to determine the mechanism of protection of the vaccine. Understanding this HLA class II restrictedmechanism will enable improved HIV vaccine design . http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20541 TUAA0202 Zinc finger nuclease gene editing for functional cure in a non-human primate model of HIV/AIDS Cancer Center, Seattle, United States. 2Sangamo BioSciences, Richmond, United States.3Washington National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.Presenting author email: cwpeters@fhcrc.org Introduction : Nuclease-mediated gene editing in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) holds great promise in the cure of HIV infection, but little information is available regarding the feasibility of thisapproach in large animal models. To better evaluate the function ofHSCs following gene editing, we have engineered cells with disrupted CCR5 alleles and assessed engraftment following autologous trans- macaque, M. nemestrina . Disrupted CCR5 alleles in this should directly protect against infection withsimian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). We are evaluating the extent to which CCR5-disrupted cell progeny engraft in macaques and testing whether these cells impede infection by SHIV.Methods : Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are used to target the CCR5 locus in macaque HSCs. Engraftment and persistence of stem cells and stem cell-derived lymphoid and myeloidcells are measured ex vivo and in vivo . Animals are challenged with SHIV virus containing an HIV envelope; to approximate the status of an HIV /C27patient, three-drug combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is initiated following viral set point. Animals reach undetect-able levels of plasma viremia prior to autologous transplant withgene-edited cells. Results : CCR5 targeting experiments yield up to 60% gene disruption in CD34 /C27cells ex vivo , translating to approximately 5% steady state bulk disruption in vivo . Gene-disrupted cells demonstrate long-term, multilineage engraftment in of disruption CD20/C27, CD14/C27and granulocyte subsets. We also observe biallelic disruption of CCR5 in colony forming assays.Importantly, this approach is equally feasible in SHIV-na \u00a8ve and in SHIV-infected, cART-suppressed animals. During robust SHIV tion, our preliminary data suggest that CCR5-deleted cells undergopositive selection in vivo .8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 32Conclusions : This is the first demonstration of successful long-term multilineage engraftment of ZFN-edited, CCR5-deleted HSCs in anon-human primate (NHP) transplantation model. Our strategy results in robust levels of target gene disruption in vivo , yet does not impair HSC engraftment or differentiation. CCR5-deleted cellscan undergo positive selection following challenge with SHIV. Ourmodel enables the evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches not only in the context of acute HIV exposure, but also in the clinically relevant setting of pre-existing latent HIV infection. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20354 TUAA0203 Crispr/Cas9 gene editing eradicates latent and protects cells new HIV-1 infection Rafal Wenhui Neuroscience, Temple University, Philadelphia, United States.2Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, United States. Presenting author email: kkhalili@temple.edu Introduction : A sterilizing cure for HIV-1/AIDS requires a strategy that eliminates all or at least some critical regions of the HIV-1 genome including the promoter positioned within the 5' LTR of the viralgenome from cells serving as a stable reservoir for HIV-1, that is,resting CD4 /C27T-lymphocytes, macrophages and brain microglia, with no adverse impact on the host cells. Methods : We have tailored CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing by bioinformatic screening, surveyor assay, and whole genome sequencing and havesuccessfully developed a series of guide RNAs (gRNAs) that, in complex with Cas9 nuclease, effectively and s afely eliminate integrated copies of HIV-1 proviral DNA in several human cell culture models. We assessedthe impact of our gene editing strategy on viral transcription and replication by measuring the level of a GFP reporter and viral p24, upon reactivation of virus from the latent stage by treatment with phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA) and trichostatin A (TSA).Results : We demonstrated inactivation of HIV-1 gene expression and replication in latently infected T-lymphocytes and promonocytic human cell lines as well as microglial cells upon excising the proviralDNA fragment corresponding to the entire coding sequence of HIV-1 spanning the 5' to 3' LTRs from the host chromosome by theCRISPR/Cas9 approach. Further, we demonstrate that the presence of LTR-specific multiplex of guide RNAs in cells expressing Cas9 acts as an efficient inhibitor blocking new HIV-1 infection.Conclusions : Our findings suggest that the strategy involving the newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 serves as a promising platform that can be advanced for eradication of HIV-1 and a cure for AIDS. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20355 TUAA0204LB Investigating the role of the immune checkpoint receptor TIGIT in T cells during HIV disease progression and as a target for immune restoration Glen Chew1; Medicine, Medical Microbiology, and Pharmacology, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, United States. 2Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.3Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.4Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, United States.5Hawaii Center for HIV/AIDS, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, United States.6Biologics Discovery California, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Redwood City, United States. Presenting author email: glenchew@hawaii.edu Introduction : HIV infection induces a series of phenotypic and functional changes to T cells that eventually results in a state of T-cellexhaustion and failure to control viral replication. T-cell-Ig-and-ITIM- domain (TIGIT) is a recently described negative checkpoint receptor expanded on CD8 /C27T cells during LCMV infection in mice and inhibits anti-viral effector CD8/C27T-cell activity. We hypothesized that during progressive HIV infection, TIGIT surface expression will mark an expanded population of dysfunctional T cells, and that novel monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting TIGIT would restore anti-HIV-specific T-cell responses.

Quantified cell asso-ciated HIV (CA-HIV) DNA and RNA from purified CD4 /C27T cells. Functional characterization of TIGIT/C27T cells was performed, and ex vivo HIV-specific cytokine and proliferative responses were assessed in and/or PD-1 pathways (anti-TIGIT mAb /C27T cells was TIGIT/C27 (IQR 24.43, 39.15). In comparison, we found a significant expansion of TIGIT/C27CD8/C27T cells during chronic (median 57.1%, IQR 42.6, 63.45; pB0.0001) a (40.40%, IQR 28.3, 47.8; p /C300.08). TIGIT expression remained elevated despite viral suppression and associated with CD4/C27CA- HIV DNA. TIGIT/C27and TIGIT/C27PD-1/C27CD8/C27T cells inversely correlated however, TIGIT/C27T cells failed to produce cytokines in response to HIV antigens. Single blockade of TIGIT led to a significant increaseof interferon gamma response to HIV Gag compared to no blockade (p/C300.027). Co-blockade of TIGIT and /C300.039). Conclusions : These findings identify TIGIT as a novel marker of dysfunctional HIV-specific T cells and suggest TIGIT along with othercheckpoint receptors may be novel curative HIV targets. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20542 TUAA0205LB Oestrogen blocks HIV re-emergence from latency and points gender-specific differences in HIV reservoirs Jonathan Karn1; Biswajit Johnston5 1Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, United States. 2Brigham and Women's, Boston, United States.3Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, United States.4UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, United States.5amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, New York, United States. Presenting author email: jonathan.karn@case.edu Introduction : Unbiased shRNA library screens have been used to identify novel genes and pathways that are required to maintain HIV latencyand/or play an essential role in HIV transcription. One of the most pro- minent and robust ''hits'' was the oestrogen receptor type 1 (ESR-1). Methods : The activities of ESR-1 agonists, antagonists and oestrogen on proviral reactivation were studied in transformed and primary cellmodels of latency and in patient cells. Results : Specific antagonists of ESR-1, such as Tamoxifen and Fulvestrant, are weak proviral activators but sensitize latently infectedcells to very low doses a(NF-kB inducer) the ESR-1 antagonists, ESR-2 antagonists were not effec-tive inducers of HIV expression in cell models. Co-activator 3 (SRC-3) is an upstream modulator of ESR-1, which was also identified as a hit in the shRNA screen. Blocking of SRC-3 by its inhibitor Gossypol alsoinduces latent proviruses. Consistent results, in Jurkat 2D10 cells with latent provirus. In the HAART-treated patient samples,there was a modest increase of spliced HIV env mRNA when restingmemory cells were treated with the Fulvestrant or Tamoxifen alone. Proviral reactivation by contrast, b-estradiol at concentra- tions in the physiological range led to dramatic reductions in proviral reactivation efficiencies. This is consistent with earlier observationsthat high levels of b-estradiol can block HIV replication. Conclusions : ESR-1 is a pharmacologically attractive target that can be exploited in the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at eradication of the latent reservoir. Our results show that drugstargeting ESR-1 can be used to either promote the re-activation oflatent proviruses (antagonists) or limit their responses (agonists). The profound effects of b-estradiol on HIV reservoir reactivation suggest that there may be gender-specific differences in HIV reservoirs andhighlight the need to tailor latency reactivation strategies for both men and women. mg Group 1HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross /C1AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand. 2Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.3Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Chulalongkorn Institute, Nonthaburi, Thailand.15Faculty of Medicine, Vajira Hospital, University of Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Bangkok, Thailand.16National Health Security Office, Nonthaburi, Thailand. 17Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Presenting author email: torsak.b@hivnat.org Introduction : Asian HIV-infected patients generally experience higher systemic exposure to HIV protease inhibitors (PIs). We compared the efficacy and safety of switching to lower versus standard dose of atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) in virologically suppressed second-linepatients.Methods (A300) once daily with 2NRTIs at 14 sites in Thailand. Patients were followed every 12 weeks until week-48. Virological failure (VF) was defined as had confirmed pVL /C21200 copies/mL. Patients in ATV200 with VF resumed standard dose PI-based regimens.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 34Treatment groups were regarded as non-inferior if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference in VF was above /C2810% in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis at 48 weeks. Results : A total of 559 patients were randomized (ATV200; N /C30279 vs. ATV300; N /C30280). At baseline, 85% used lopinavir/ritonavir, mean age was 42 years, body weight was 59 kg, CD4 was 539 cells/mm 3and total bilirubin was 0.85 mg/dL. At week 48, by ITT, the proportion of patients in ATV200 vs. ATV300 with pVL (1.71, copies/mL 98.5% vs. 99.2% (/C280.72,/C282.6 to 1.16). Only one ATV200 recipient developed major resistance (I50 L) to ATV. Discontinuation from randomized therapy was 8 (2.9%) in ATV200 (1 death, 2 VF, 1 jaundice, 2 rash, 2 others) and 21 (7.5%) in ATV300 (2deaths, 7 jaundice, 7 rash, 5 others) (p /C300.01). At week-48, there was no difference between treatment arms in CD4, total cholesterol, triglyceride and Crcl (all p /C210.1). Comparing ATV200 vs. ATV300, number (%) of patients with total bilirubin /C213.2 mg/dL was 27 (10%) vs. 46 (17%) respectively (p /C300.017). Conclusions : A lower dose of ATV/r-based regimens in Thais is non- inferior compared to standard dose ATV/r. Higher dose ATV was associ- ated with higher rates of treatment discontinuation. ATV/r 200/100 mgcan be recommended as part of routine care for Asian adults who have well-controlled HIV infection on a PI-based regimen. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20356 TUAB0102 Switching data in virologically suppressed adults through 48 weeks of treatment Tony Mills1; Jamie Andrade2; Giovanni Diperri3; Jan Van Lunzen4; Ellen Shamblaw10; Edwin Dejesus11; Calvin Cohen12;A n d r e wP l u m m e r13; YaPei Liu13and Scott McCallister13 1Anthony Mills MD, Inc., Los Angeles, United States.2Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico.3University Hospital Paolo, Brazil.9Maple Leaf Research, Toronto, Canada. 10La Playa Medical Group, San Diego, United States.11Orlando Immunology Center, Orlando, United States.12Community Research Initiative of New England, Boston, United States.13Gilead Sciences, Foster City, United States. Presenting author email: tmills@tonymillsmd.com Introduction : Despite a favourable efficacy and safety profile, TDF- based regimens may be associated with renal toxicity and reducedbone mineral density (BMD). TAF is a novel tenofovir prodrug inwhich TFV plasma levels are 90% lower than seen with TDF, thereby reducing off-target side effects. Week 48 data in patients switching toa once-daily fixed dose combination regimen containing elvitegravir 150 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg and TAF 10 mg (E/ C/F/TAF) are described.Methods : Virologically suppressed adults (HIV-1 RNA B50 copies/ mL) with normal renal function taking one of four different TDF- based regimens for at least 48 weeks were randomized 2:1 to receive E/C/F/TAF or to retain their prior TDF-based regimen. Followingrandomization, all treatments were open-label.Results : Of 1196 patients completing at least 48 weeks of treatment, 799 received E/C/F/TAF and 397 received and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Generalsafety was similar between the arms. The mean percent change (SD) in hip BMD: /C271.95% (3.0) for E/C/F/TAF and /C280.14% (3.0) for FTC/ TDF/C273rd Agent (p B0.001); the mean percent change (SD) in spine BMD: /C271.86% (3.1) for E/C/F/TAF and /C280.11% (3.7) for FTC/ Agent (p B0.001). There were no cases of Fanconi Syndrome on E/C/F/TAF and one case on FTC/TDF /C273rd Agent. For patients on either a COBI or RTV boosted regimen prior torandomization, the estimated GFR increased 1.8 mL/min for E/C/F/ TAF decreased 3.7 mL/min for FTC/TDF /C273rd Agent (p B0.001). As shown in the table, multiple measures of quantitative proteinuria,including tubular proteinuria, had statistically significant improve-ments for patients switching to E/C/F/TAF as compared with those retaining their prior TDF-based regimen. Conclusions : These 48 week data demonstrate that patients who switch from a TDF-based regimen to E/C/F/TAF maintain high efficacy,have statistically significant increases in BMD and have statistically significant improvements in multiple tests of renal function, as compared with patients remaining on their prior TDF-based regimen. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20357 TUAB0103 Subjects with renal impairment switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to tenofovir alafenamide have improved renal and bone safety through 48 weeks Samir Gupta1; Anton Pozniak2; University, Indianapolis, United States.2Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.3Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.4Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom. 5Holdsworth House Medical Practice, Sydney, Australia.6Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, United States.7Be Well Medical Center, Berkley, United States.8Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, United States.9Gilead Sciences, Foster City, United States.

Tenofovir alafe- namide (TAF) is a novel prodrug (TFV) that results in 90% lower plasma TFV levels as compared to TDF. The safety and efficacyof a once-daily single tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat,emtricitabine and TAF (E/C/F/TAF) was assessed in HIV-1 infected patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Methods : Virologically suppressed adults with stable renal impair- ment (eGFR CG30/C169 mL/min) had their treatment TDF- and non-TDF-containing regimens to open-label E/C/F/TAF. Week 48 safety data by pre-switch TDF use are presented. Results : Of 242 subjects switched to E/C/F/TAF (mean age 58 years (range: 24 /C182), 18% Black, 39% HTN subjects (65%) were taking TDF-containing regimens prior to switch. At Week 48, the median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline for eGFR C-Gwas/C270.2 (/C285.8, /C272.7 (/C286.2, 14.1) mL/min/1.73 m2 (p /C300.003). The following measures of renal tubular function improved significantly (p B0.001 for all) for subjects switching from TDF-containing and from 56 to 22%, respectively. Significantincreases in mean% in hip ( /C271.29%) and spine ( /C272.60%) BMD were observed at 48 weeks (p B0.001 for both). Subjects taking non- TDF based regimens pre-switch (n /C3084) had no significant changes from baseline measures of renal function or BMD.Conclusions : Subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 69 mL/min) who switched from TDF-containing regimens to once daily single-tablet E/C/F/TAF experienced improvements in multiple as- sessments of renal and bone safety through 48 weeks. These data sup-port the safety of E/C/F/TAF in patients with impaired renal function. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20358 TUAB0104 Efficacy and safety of doravirine 100 mg QD efavirenz 600 mg QD with TDF/FTC in ART-naive week results of of Infectious Diseases, Hotel-Dieu University Hospital, Nantes, France.3ifi-Institute for Infections, Hamburg, Germany.4Albion Centre, Sydney, Australia. 5University Miguel Hernandez, Alicante, Spain.6ICH Study Center, Hamburg, Germany.7EPIMED/Vivantes Auguste-Viktoria-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.8AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta, Atlanta, United States.9Chatham County Health Department, Savannah, United States.10Clinical Research Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico.11Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, United States.Presenting author email: gatell@fundsoriano.es Introduction : Doravirine (DOR), an investigational NNRTI with a novel resistance profile, was compared with efavirenz in adouble-blind, randomized, 2-part who also received tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC). In Part 1 (dose selection), DOR at 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg QD showed ratesof virologic suppression similar to EFV 600 mg QD; DOR 100 mg wasselected for ongoing evaluation. Part 2 enrolled additional patients to receive DOR 100 mg or EFV. Using data from Parts 1 /C272 com- bined, DOR 100 mg showed significantly fewer CNS AEs than EFV atweek 8. Methods : Week 24 efficacy and safety results were analyzed for all patients who received DOR 100 mg or EFV in Part 1 (n /C3042 per group) and Part 2 (n /C3066 per group) combined. Patients were stratified at randomization by screening RNA 5or/C21100,000 copies/ mL. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with HIV RNA B40 c/mL (efficacy) and the proportion of patients with pre- specified CNS events (safety).Results : Of the 108 patients randomized and treated per group, mean baseline RNA was 4.6 log 10c/mL in both the DOR and EFV groups, and mean CD4 counts were 432 and 448 cells/mm3, respectively. Discontinuations in the DOR and EFV groups, respec-tively, were 4.6 and 12.0%. The most common drug-related clinical AEs in the DOR and EFV groups, respectively, were nausea (7.4%; 5.6%), dizziness (6.5%;25.0%), abnormal sleep (3.7%; 6.5%). Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were hallucination for DOR (n /C301) and dysesthesia, hallucination, drug eruption, dizziness and disturbance in attentionfor EFV (n /C305). The most common CNS AEs (all were dizziness (DOR 9.3%; EFV 27.8%), (6.5%; 8.3%). Lab abnormal-ities of Grade 2 or greater were uncommon in both groups.Conclusions : DOR 100 mg qd demonstrated antiretroviral activity and immunological effect similar to EFV (each with TDF/FTC) and was generally safe and well tolerated during 24 weeks of treatment inART-na \u00a8ve, HIV-1 infected patients.

Methods : Infants born to mothers treated with RAL during pregnancy from the Centre Maternel et Infantile sur le Sida (CMIS)mother-child cohort between 2010 and 2014 were included in thestudy. RAL levels were tested on the first available stored plasma sample after birth, and in the treated newborn, therapeutic drug monitoring was done at weekly intervals.Results : In RAL-exposed infants, RAL was given to mothers at standard dosing of 400 mg BID, started at a mean GA of 30 weeks (range pre-conception-37.5 weeks). Indications for RAL included drug resistance and/or detectable viral load in the third trimester. MeanGA was 38.5 weeks ( 91.76), and mean birthweight was 3200 g (9540). There were no clinical adverse events noted among RAL- exposed infants (mean follow-up time 119 weeks, range 48 /C1144), and all were confirmed HIV negative. RAL levels tested in twoexposed newborns at 16 and 30 hours of life were detectable at0.9345 mg/L and 0.0381 mg/L, respectively, and undetectable in six other infants tested at days 4 /C114. RAL granules for suspension (Merck, special access) were obtained for prophylaxis of a term newborn (39 weeks GA) from a mother with multidrug-resistant virusand started at 1.5 mg/kg BID, along with zidovudine and lamivudine at standard doses. RAL levels were consistently above the targeted trough for treatment (0.02 mg/L) (Table 1) for the duration oftherapy. RAL was well tolerated and at follow-up, the infant wasconfirmed HIV negative. Conclusions : RAL in late pregnancy had no adverse effects on infants exposed in utero. RAL treatment in the newborn at doses of 1.3 /C11.6 mg/kg BID was well tolerated and resulted in therapeutic drug levels.Given detectable levels of RAL in the first 30 hours of life in exposed infants, the timing and role of RAL in PMTCT should further be considered. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20360 TUAB0106LB Second-generation HIV-1 maturation inhibitor BMS-955176: antiviral Lataillade4and for the BMS HIV Global Development Team 1Bristol-Myers Squibb, Research and Development, Princeton, United States.2Charite \u00b4Research Organisation GmbH, Berlin, Germany.3St. Stephen's Centre, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, United Kingdom.4Research and Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wallingford, United States.

Two drug combination studies in vitro demonstrated that BMS-955176 /C27 atazanavir (ATV) had an additive effect. Due to the proximity of their sites of inhibition in the virus life cycle and the potentialfor synergy, we assessed the antiviral activity and safety of BMS- 955176 with ATV 9ritonavir (RTV) for 28 days in HIV-1-infected subjects. In addition, this combination is being further evaluated topotentially serve as part of a booster-sparing and nucleot(s)ide-sparing strategy. Methods : AI468002 (NCT01803074) was a Phase 2a, randomized, multipart trial.

Results : Median change in HIV-1 RNA at Day 29 was /C281.66,/C281.99, /C282.18 and /C282.22 log 10c/mL, and maximum median change in HIV- 1 RNA from baseline to end of study/discharge (Day 42) was /C281.86, /C282.20,/C282.23 and /C282.39 log 10c/mL, for BMS-955176 40 mg 400 mg, BMS-955176 40 mg /C27ATV 300 mg /C27RTV 100 mg, BMS- 955176 80 mg /C27ATV 400 mg, and the SOC control, respectively(Table 1 and Figure 1). There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or AEs leading to discontinuation. Furthermore, the median bilirubin level was below the upper limit of normal for subjects receiving unboosted ATV with BMS-955176, in contrast to the levelobserved for subjects receiving BMS-955176 40 mg /C27ATV/C27RTV or SOC. Conclusions : In this study, BMS-955176 80 mg /C27ATV and 40 mg/C27ATV/C27RTV had similar maximum median declines in HIV-1 RNA compared with the SOC control. BMS-955176 with ATV 9RTV was generally well tolerated.

Presenting author email: laurence.brunet@mail.mcgill.ca Introduction : Both protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) have been associated with acute hepatotoxicity, but their long-term effect on liver fibrosis remains uncertain. We explored rates of change in liver fibrosis as measured bythe aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) modern PI- or NNRTI-based regimens. Methods : Data from a Canadian prospective multicentre cohort were analyzed for 397 HCV PCR /C27persons who initiated antiretroviral therapy in or after 2000, with regimens at cohort entry comprised of a backbone of either Tenofovir/Emtricitabine or Abacavir/Lamivudine with a PI or NNRTI as the anchor agent. The natural logarithm of theAPRI score was the outcome of interest. Three multivariate linear regression analyses with generalized estimating equations were performed. Analysis 1 (intention-to-treat) used baseline exposureto PI or NNRTI; analysis 2 (per protocol) was restricted to personswith a viral load under 1000 copies/mL and censored participants when the class of anchor agent was changed; analysis 3 (as treated) allowed for changes in the class of anchor agent during follow-up.Results : At cohort entry, 74% of participants were male, the median age was 44 years and 56% had used alcohol in the past six months. Therapy was started a median of 1.9 years before cohort entry (IQR: 0.3, 5.0), 70% used a PI and 69% were on a backbone ofTenofovir/Emtricitabine. PI use was associated with a medianincrease in APRI per 5 years of 27%) in Analysis 3. NNRTI use was not significantly associated with changein APRI in any of the three analyses, as shown in the Table. Conclusions : PI use seems to be associated with a faster progression of liver fibrosis, as measured by the median change in APRI scoreover five years. The consistency of estimates across the threeanalyses suggests that this is not the result of the type of patientsusing PI-based regimens, although we could not account for all patient characteristics influencing the choice of an anchor agent. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20361 TUAB0202 Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks Susanna Dieterich5 and Mark S Sulkowski6 1Infectious Diseases, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, United States.2Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.3Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, United States.4Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, United States.5Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, United States.6Infectious Disease Center for Viral Hepatitis, Johns Hopkins University School ofMedicine, Baltimore, United States. Introduction : Historically HIV co-infection was considered a negative predictor of HCV response to treatment with interferon/ribavirin (IFN/RBV). For response (SVR) rates as HCVmono-infected patients. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the IFN-free, RBV-free, single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in HCV genotype 1 or 4 patients HIV-1 inthe Phase 3 ION-4 study.Methods : HCV treatment na \u00a8ve and experienced HIV co-infected patients on stable, approved antiretroviral (ARV) regimens were enrolled and received LDV/SOF (90 mg/400 mg) once daily for 12weeks. Patients with compensated cirrhosis were eligible. Permitted concomitant ARVs adverse event (AE) and standard laboratoryparameter monitoring in addition to enhanced renal toxicity monitoring, CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA levels. The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12.Results : A total of 335 patients male, 61% were white, mean age was 52 (range 26 /C172), mean baseline HCV RNA was 6.7 log 10IU/mLAbstract TUAB0201 /C1Table 1.

In the TURQUOISE-I trial, response rates were 94 and 91% in thispopulation when treated for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Wereport the week 12 post-treatment sustained virologic response rates (SVR12) by baseline characteristics. Methods : Patients were randomized to receive OBV/PTV/r /C27DSV/C27 RBV for 12 (N /C3031) or 24 weeks (N /C3032). Eligible patients in this open-label study were treatment-na \u00a8ve cells/mm 3or CD4/C27%]14%, and plasma HIV-1 RNA suppressed while receiving a stable atazanavir- or raltegravir-inclusive antiretroviral (ART) regimen. Results : Sixty-three patients were enrolled, of whom 92% were male, 24% black race, 19% with compensated cirrhosis and 16% with aprior null response to pegIFN/RBV treatment. Two patients in the 12-week treatment group (1 withdrawn consent, 1 HCV relapse), and three in the 24-week treatment group (1 virologic breakthrough, 2 post-treatment HCV re-infections) did not achieveSVR12. with on-treatment breakthrough and relapse were both genotype 1a-infected with prior response RBV F4 fibrosis (cirrhosis). High characteristics includingthose with IL28B non-CC genotype, high viral load, prior treatment failure and advanced liver disease (Table 1). Lower baseline CD4 /C27T-cell counts did not negatively affect SVR12 rates. The regimen was well tolerated with no discontinuation due to adverse event or serious adverse event.Conclusions : In HCV genotype 1 patients co-infected with HIV-1, OBV/PTV/r /C27DSV/C27RBV achieved high rates of SVR12 regardless of baseline host, viral and disease characteristics whether treated with 12 or 24 weeks of therapy. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20363 TUAB0204 Liver fibrosis regression after anti HCV therapy and the rate of death, liver-related death, liver-related complications and hospital admissions in HIV/HCV co-infected cirrhosis Luis Casado; Sara Ban Quereda; Ana Moreno; Maria J Perez El \u00b4as and Santiago Moreno Infectious Diseases, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain.

Results : Overall, 42 patients reached SVR, and 23 of them (55%) had FR, in comparison with only 14 of the 91 (15%) without SVR. During amedian follow up of 6.8 years (916.8 person-years), the IR of death, liver-related death, liver-related complications and hospital admis- sions were significantly lower in patients with SVR/FR (Table). SVRpatients without FR had a worse IR of death (5.36) and liver-relateddeath (2.68) than non-SVR patients with FR (1.3 and 0.65, respectively; pB0.01). In Cox multivariate analysis, only FR was associated with a lower risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, HR, 0.36; 95% CI 0.15 /C10.86), and liver-related death (HR 0.03 CI 0.07/C10.87) decreased the risk of liver-related complications. Conclusions : FR is frequent after anti-HCV therapy in HIV/HCV co- infected patients with compensated cirrhosis who achieve SVR, and it is associated with the highest reduction of death of any cause, liver-related mortality, liver-related complications and hospitaladmissions. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20364 TUAB0205 How generalizable are direct antiviral agents (DAA) trials for real world people co-infected with HIV/hepatitis C?

Presenting author email: sahar.saeed@mail.mcgill.ca Introduction : Worldwide, approximately seven million people are co- infected with HIV-Hepatitis C (HCV). The most common risk factor forco-infection is injection drug use. HCV treatments have evolved at anunprecedented speed; Simpeprevir (SIM) and Sofosburvir (SOF) are among the latest DAAs approved for use. However clinical trials conducted with these agents have enrolled a small number of indi-viduals, in ideal circumstances with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. This provokes the question: how generalizable are their results? Methods : We examined the study population characteristics (based on published inclusion/exclusion criteria) from the only two efficacytrials evaluating SIM (NCT01479868) and SOF (NCT01667731: PHOTON-1) for HIV-HCV co-infected patients and compared them to participants in the Canadian Co-Infection Cohort (CCC), aprospective cohort following 1383 co-infected people from acrossCanada (representing /C223% co-infected population in care). Results : Due to eligibility criteria, 30% (49/160) of screened subjects from 32 international study locations and 29% (96/330) of screenedsubjects from 27 American sites were excluded from the SIM andSOF trials, respectively. Of 1383 CCC participants, 1054 (76%) had evidence of chronic HCV (RNA /C27) at last visit; 699 (66%) infected with HCV genotype 1 and 887 (84%) infected with genotype 1, 2 or 3and therefore could have been eligible for these trials. After applying all the available trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, only 8.6% of genotype 1 (60/699) and similarly 8.6% (76/887) overall would havebeen eligible to participate.

C- EDGE co-infection is an on-going phase-III study HIV/HCV co-infected patients with GT1, 4, or 6. Methods : Enrolled patients were on a stable antiretroviral (ARV) regimen (tenofovir or abacavir, and lamivudine All patients GZR/EBR 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response at follow-up week 12(SVR12). Adherence was assessed using electronic study medicationdiaries and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. All patients underwent testing for HCV resistance associated variants (RAVs) at baseline, and at failure and follow-up in those with virologic failure. Phylogeneticanalysis was performed to distinguish relapse from reinfection.Results : A total of 218 patients were enrolled; 211 had suppressed HIV viraemia; 7 were ARV-na \u00a8ve. In the Full Analysis Set population, SVR12 was achieved by 207/218 (95%) patients, including 35/35(100%) patients with cirrhosis (Table 1). Of the 11 non-SVR12 patients, 4 failed for reasons other than virologic failure and 7 patients met criteria for virologic failure. Phylogenetic analysis of theseven failures demonstrated five were relapses and two werereinfections (Table 1). Thus, 5/218 (2.3%) patients failed to clear HCV infection that was present pre-therapy. Of the five virologic relapses, two had baseline NS5A RAVs with /C215/C29resistance to EBR in vitro (L31M, Y93S). Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 157/218 (72%) patients; serious AEs occurred in 2/218 (0.9%) patients. Adherence was /C2190% in the total population, including virologic failures. There was no difference in PK parameters in patients whoachieved SVR12 versus patients who did not achieve SVR12. Conclusions : A 12-week regimen of GZR/EBR FDC was highly effective among HIV/HCV co-infected patients with GT1, 4 or 6infection, with a favourable safety profile. SVR was high across allpatient subgroups including and those with cirrhosis. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20545 TUAB0207LB Daclatasvir plus or without ribavirin in patients with HIV-HCV co-infection: interim analysis of a French multicentre compassionate Lacombe1; c43 1 0 Relapsed54 0 1 Reinfection 2 1 1 0 aFAS (Full Analysis Set): all patients who received at least one dose of GZR/EBR. bHCV RNA assessed B15 subjects included in the analysis. n (%)/C30Number of subjects who achieved SVR12 and the percentage calculated as (n/N)*100. cTwo subjects were lost to follow-up; one patient was discontinued for taking a prohibited concomitant medication, and one subject's FW12 visit was outside the analysis window. dAt baseline in the NSSA gene, one of the relapses had L31M/L RAV and one of the relapses had the Y93S RAV.

Thisanalysis reports SVR4 and SVR12 results from an ongoing multicentre compassionate use programme (ATU) in France. Methods : HIV-HCV co-infected patients with advanced liver disease from 221 centres have been included since March 2014. All patients received DCV /C27SOF QD for 12 or 24 weeks, with RBV added at the physician's discretion. Baseline characteristics, virological response ratesand adverse events were collected through a standardized form.We report interim SVR rates at 4 and 12 weeks after the end of treatment for patients who have completed treatment to date. Results: Of 562 patients enrolled, 73.8% were males, median age was 52.3 years (30 /C174), 395 (71.0%) were cirrhotic and 460 in 36.4%, NNRTI in 23% and INI in 63.7% of the Baseline median CD4count was 551/mm 3(0/C11922). HIV-RNA was undetectable added to DCV /C27SOF in 67 patients (12.0%). Treatment duration was 24 weeks in 478 (85.1%) and 12 weeks in 84 (14.9%)patients.Overall, SVR4 was obtained in 90.2% (148/164) and SVR12 in 95.9% (94/98) of the cases Among patients treated with DCV /C27SOF for 12 or 24 weeks, 96.0% (24/25) 100% (6/6) for patients receivingDCV/C27SOF/C27RBV. Neither duration of treatment nor cirrhosis status and genotype influenced the rate of SVR12 (Table 1). Treatment discontinuations occurred in 17 patients (3%) and wererelated to an adverse event (n /C305), death (n /C304, not related to treatment), patient decision (n /C303), contraindication (n /C303), un- known reason (n /C301) and patient lost to follow-up (n /C301). Conclusions: DCV/C27SOF9RBV regimen was well tolerated and demonstrated high SVR12 rate in HIV-HCV co-infected patients with advanced liver disease. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20546 TUAC0101LB Impact of conditional cash incentives on HSV-2 and HIV prevention in rural South African high school students: results of the CAPRISA Karim1,2 1CAPRISA, Durban, South Africa.2Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University, New York, United States.3MIET Africa, Durban, South Africa. Presenting author email: quarraisha.abdoolkarim@caprisa.org Introduction : Young women in southern Africa have high rates of sexually transmitted infections, including herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) and HIV. We investigated whether conditional cash incentives (CCIs) reduced the incidence of HSV-2 and HIV in rural high schoolstudents in South Africa.Methods : An open-label, matched-pair, cluster randomized con- trolled trial (CAPRISA 007) was undertaken in 3217 consenting male (n/C301517) and female (n /C301700) grade 9 and 10 students. A locally developed HIV prevention programme, My Life! My Future! , was actively implemented in all 14 schools. Seven schools (n /C301592 students) were randomly assigned to receive; in addition, cash incentives (maximum of $175 over two years) for fulfilling anycombination of four conditions; annual HIV testing, performance in school tests, participation in My Life! My Future! , and a written report on their community involvement project. HSV-2 and HIVserology was undertaken at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. Inthe intent-to-treat analysis, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and p-values were adjusted for the matched-pair cluster design. Results : HSV-2 prevalence at baseline was 9.0% in CCI schools and 7.3% in control schools. During follow-up, there were 319 new HSV-2infections, with an incidence rate of 6.2 per 100 person-years in CCIAbstract TUAB0207LB Treatment duration HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 43schools compared to 8.7 per 100 person-years in 95% CI: 0.57 HSV-2 incidence was 7.1 per 100 person-years in the 760 students who received B$65, 6.3 per 100 person-years in the 304 students who received $65 /C1$95, and 4.2 per 100 person-years in the 265 students who received /C21$95 (Trend test, p /C300.12). The lower-than-anticipated overall HIV incidence rate of 1.6 per 100 person-years was similar in both groups of schools (IRR /C301.26, 95% CI: 0.66 /C12.39; p /C300.419). A fourfold larger study would be required for 80% power to observe a 30% HIVincidence reduction.Conclusions : CCI schools had 30% lower HSV-2 incidence. Students who received larger cash incentives had lower HSV-2 incidence rates. The impact of CCI on HIV could not be adequately assessedas incidence was lower than expected, likely due to HIV lowering effects of both study-initiated and background community HIV interventions. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20547 TUAC0102 The effect of conditional economic compensation and lottery-based rewards on uptake of medical male circumcision in Kenya: a randomized trial 1Department of Health Policy and Management, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.2Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.3Impact Research and Development Organization, Kisumu, Kenya.Presenting author email: hthirumu@email.unc.edu Introduction : Low uptake of male circumcision has been a major challenge to scaling-up and maximizing the HIV prevention impact of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services in eastern andsouthern Africa. There is limited evidence on effective demand creation strategies for VMMC that address reported barriers to male circumcision. Building on insights from behavioural economics, weassessed whether providing compensation for opportunity costs oftime or lottery-based rewards can increase VMMC uptake among men in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Methods : Uncircumcised men aged 21 /C139 years were provided information on VMMC services and randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to twointervention groups or a control group. One intervention group was offered compensation of US$12.50 conditional on VMMC uptake. Compensation was provided in the form of food vouchers valid atshops in the study region. A second intervention group was offered the opportunity to participate in a lottery with high-value prizes upon undergoing circumcision. The primary outcome was VMMCuptake within three months.Results : Among 903 participants enrolled, those randomized to receive compensation of US$12.50 had the highest VMMC uptake (8.4%, 26/308), followed by those receiving lottery-based rewards(3.3%, and those in the control group (1.3%, 4/299). Logisticregression analysis showed that compared to the control group, the US$12.50 group had significantly higher VMMC uptake (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 7.1; 95% CI 2.4 /C120.8). Participants in the lottery- based rewards group were not significantly more likely to becomecircumcised than participants in the control group (AOR 2.5; 95% CI 0.8/C18.1). The effect of providing compensation of US$12.50 was largest among participants who were contemplating circumcision atthe time of enrolment. Conclusions : Providing conditional economic compensation was effective in increasing circumcision uptake among men in a shorttime period. The results are consistent with studies showing thatsmall incentives can modify health behaviours by addressing barriers such as opportunity costs of time and present-biased decision-making. Contrary to findings from studies in high-income countries, lottery-based rewards did not significantly increase circumcision uptake. Testing economic interventions in other settings and applyingthem to different HIV behaviours can be useful for assessing thegeneralizability of the findings. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20366 TUAC0103 Estimating the population-level effect of homelessness on HIV viral suppression among people who use drugs: an observational study Brandon D L Marshall1; Beth Epidemiology, Brown University, Providence, United States.2British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.3Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Presenting author email: brandon_marshall@brown.edu Introduction : Homelessness has been identified as an important structural barrier to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) utilizationamong HIV-infected people who use drugs (PWUD). However, thepotential effect of reducing homelessness on viral suppression rates at the community level is unknown. We used an imputation-based marginal modelling approach to estimate change in the prevalenceof viral suppression among HIV-infected PWUD, if homelessnesswere eliminated from the population. Methods : We used data from a cohort study of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. Of note, HIV/AIDS treatment and care isprovided free of charge in this setting. Persons were eligible toparticipate if they were HIV-infected and used an illicit drug in the month prior to enrolment.We assessed self-reported baseline housing status in the past six months.Viral suppression was defined as HIV RNAviral load B50 copies per mm 3at first study visit. We estimated the effect of homelessness on viral suppression using modified-Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic characteristics,trauma history, depression, addiction treatment and other confoun-ders. Then, a marginal modelling approach was applied. First, we imputed the outcome probability for each individual while manipulat- ing the exposure (homelessness) to never exposed, and then averagedthese probabilities across the population. Bootstrapping was con-ducted to calculate 95% confidence limits. Results : Of 718 eligible individuals enrolled between January 2005 and December 2013, the majority was male (66%), white race/ethnicity (55%) and had a history of injection drug use (94%). At baseline, 230 (32%) reported homelessness. The prevalence of viral suppression was 35% (95% CI: 31 /C138%). Adjusted marginal models estimated a 14% relative increase (95% CI: 10 /C124%) in viral suppression in the entire sample /C1to 40% (95% CI: 36/C145%)/C1if all homeless individuals were housed. Among those homeless at baseline, adjusted marginal models estimated thateliminating this exposure would increase viral suppression from 19%(95% CI: 14 /C124%) to 37% (95% Reducing homelessness among HIV-infected PWUD could have significant population-level benefits on outcomes in theHIV care continuum. Low threshold shelter and housing support programs should be considered as key components in comprehen- sive strategies to increase population-level viral suppression forPWUD. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.203678th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 44TUAC0104 Applying principles of behavioural economics to ART adherence: discount rate, future expectations and intrinsicmotivation for adherence among ART initiates in Shinyanga of California Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.2PMTCT, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania.3Department of Health Economics, National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Mexico. 4Regional Medical Office, Shinyanga, United Republic of Tanzania. 5Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, United States. Presenting author email: nczaicki@berkeley.edu Introduction : Behavioural economic theory suggests that under- standing motivations and future preferences of people living withHIV infection (PLHIV) can inform the development of interventions supporting adherence to treatment and care. For example, PLHIV with high levels of intrinsic motivation to adhere to ART may requireless external motivation, such as cash incentives. In addition, PLHIVwho disproportionally value the present and heavily discount the future may be less likely to adhere to ART, a behaviour with future benefits and present costs. We measured these constructs amongantiretroviral therapy (ART) initiates at four HIV care and treatmentclinics in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania. Methods : We analyzed data collected from in-person interviews between December 2013 and December 2014 with food-insecure,HIV-infected adults who initiated ART in the past 90 days. Temporal discount rate, the rate at which individuals discount future costs and benefits, was measured using a bidding process to assess theacceptable percent increase of a hypothetical monetary offer theywould receive in three months compared to a smaller amount received today. Future health expectations were assessed for one year from now, and intrinsic motivation for ART adherence wasmeasured as the mean score (range: 0 /C13) on a Likert-scale using questions in the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire. Results : Overall, 511 food-insecure recent ART initiates were interviewed (mean age: 37, 64% female). Nearly all (99%) expectedtheir health to be somewhat (55%) or much better (44%) one year from now. Excluding those who initiated treatment on the same day of the interview, mean internal motivation was 2.75 (standarddeviation 0.36; n /C30423). Temporal discount rates (n (2%). Conclusions : These data indicate high levels of both intrinsic motivation for ART adherence and optimism towards future healthamong food-insecure ART initiates in Tanzania, suggesting that interventions designed to strengthen and sustain intrinsic motivation may be appropriate. The high discount rates indicate a greater focuson the present; thus, interventions aiming to overcome the short-term cost barriers to adherence and care (e.g. time, transport and competing needs) in order to achieve future gains may be highly effective among this population. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20368 TUAC0105 Negative impact of South Africa's disability grants on recovery Noah Kobus Herbst2; Deenan Pillay2; Till Ba \u00a8rnighausen1,2and Wellcome Trust Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies1Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, United States.2Health Systems and Impact Evaluation, Wellcome Trust Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, Mtubatuba, South Africa. Presenting author email: nhaber@mail.harvard.edu Introduction : The South African disability grant (DG) has been theorized to incentivize poor recovery by tying grant receipt to AIDSsickness. Prior to 2008, many official guidelines defined qualifying AIDS disability as a CD4 count below 200 mmHg, and this recom- mendation persists unofficially. We make two predictions:1) The population distribution of CD4 counts will have an observablediscontinuity with excess mass just below the CD4 qualification threshold of 200 mmHg, and 2) individuals receiving the grant will recover more slowly aroundthis threshold than those who do not, due to threat of grant loss. Methods : The analysis utilizes a two-stage panel regression meth- odology to absorb individual trends and identify differential recoveryrates around the CD4 threshold of 200 mmHg. The dataset for thisanalysis utilizes the Africa Centre Demographic Information System (ACDIS), an open cohort health and demographic monitoring pro- gramme consisting mainly of annual surveys, individually matchedwith an HIV-focused clinical informatics system in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data are restricted to HIV /C27individuals from 2004 to 2011, who have at least four observed CD4 counts, with at least one observed CD4 count above and below 200 mmHg.Results : The cohort for this analysis consists of 11,160 observations from 1450 individuals. The distribution of CD4 counts shows clear excess mass just below a CD4 count of 200 mmHg, with more pronounced for CD4 counts occurring in 2008 or earlier. Amongobservations around the threshold, the rate of recovery of those receiving DGs is 0.23 mmHg/year lower (p /C300.020) than that of those not receiving DGs, controlling for individual recovery trends,age, education, time, household assets and employment. Stratifyingon gender, the effect is seen much stronger among women with a differential recovery rate of 58 mmHg/year (p /C300.018). The effect is significantly larger for observations in 2008 or earlier.Conclusions : This study finds that the South African DG system resulted in a modest but significant manipulation of CD4 counts in order to qualify for the grant. While policy changes have likely reduced the severity of the effect, policy makers should ensure thatincentives from grants are aligned with health incentives to reduce poor outcomes, infectivity and drug resistance. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20369 TUAC0106LB HPTN 068 conditional cash transfer to prevent HIV infection among young women in South Africa: results of a randomized controlled trial Audrey 068 Study Team 1Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.2School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.3University of New England, Armindale, Australia.4Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States.5MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Unit, School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 456University of Washington, Seattle, United States.7School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States. 8School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States.9FHI360, Durham, United States.10Division of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of MentalHealth, Rockville, United States. 11Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States.12National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, DAIDS, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, United States.Presenting author email: apettif@email.unc.edu Introduction : Young women in South Africa face a particularly high risk of HIV infection. Structural factors such as schooling, socio- economic status (SES) and financial dependence on partnerscontribute to this risk. Cash transfers have shown promise inreducing HIV risk in young women by addressing these factors. HPTN 068 is the first randomized trial to examine the impact of conditional cash transfers on HIV incidence among young women.Methods : HPTN 068 is a phase III individually randomized trial to assess the impact of a conditional cash transfer on the acquisition of HIV among South Africa young women. Young women and theirparent/guardian in the intervention arm received a monthly cashtransfer conditional on 80% school attendance, which was verified using school attendance rosters. The intervention ran from April 2011 to March 2015. Participants enrolled in the study were aged13/C120, in high school, not married or pregnant and resident in the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (AHDSS) site in rural Mpumalanga Province. Participants were seen at baseline, then annually for up to three follow-up visits, where HIV and HSV-2testing was conducted and an interview was completed using Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interviewing (ACASI). The interview assessed sexual behaviour including partner-specific details, schooling, mentalhealth, SES and gender power dynamics. Participants were tested forHIV infection using two HIV rapid tests with Western blot confirma- tion. Stored samples from all participants at all visits were also tested at the HPTN Laboratory Center using assays that included an HIVantigen/antibody test and a qualitative HIV RNA test. To comparetreatment arms, time to first HIV detection was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results : We will present the impact of the conditional cash transfer on HIV incidence, unprotected sex, pregnancy, age difference withpartners, number of sex partners, transactional sex, age of sexual debut and school attendance. Conclusions : Cash transfers are increasingly being included as part of the package of prevention services that should be offered to young women to reduce HIV risk in sub-Saharan Africa. The evidence from this RCT will have important implications for HIV prevention policyand practice. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20548 TUAC0201 The safety of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in the presence of hepatitis B infection Marc M Solomon1,2; Mauro Schechter3; Albert Y Mayer7;Robert M Grant2,8and iPrEx Study Team 1University of California, San Francisco, Division of Infectious Diseases, San Francisco, United States.2Gladstone Institutes of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, United States.3Projeto Prac\u00b8a Onze, Hospital Escola Sa o Francisco de Assis, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.4Bridge HIV, San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco, United States.5Investigaciones Medicas en Salud, Lima, Peru. 6Research Institute for Health Sciences and Department ofCommunity Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.7Fenway Institute, Fenway Health, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.8University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.Presenting author email: robert.grant@ucsf.edu Introduction : Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily oral FTC/ TDF prevents HIV infection and is safe, but concern has been raisedthat PrEP could cause hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated flares when discontinued by people with HBV infection, particularly among individuals with cirrhosis. The safety and feasibility of providingHIV PrEP in the setting of HBV infection was evaluated in the iPrExstudy. Methods : The iPrEx study randomized 2499 HIV-negative men and transgender women who have sex with men to once-daily oral FTC/TDF versus placebo. Hepatitis serologies and transaminases were obtained at screening and at PrEP discontinuation. Participants with a reactive hepatitis B surface antigen were enrolled if there was noclinical evidence of cirrhosis and transaminases were B2.5-fold the ULN. HBV DNA was assessed by PCR and drug resistance was assessed by population sequencing (Abbott labs) at least once for individuals with evidence of HBV DNA. Vaccination was offered toindividuals susceptible to HBV.Results : Among 2499 enrolled participants, 12 (0.5%; including six randomized to FTC/TDF) had chronic HBV infection. After stopping study drug, five of six in the active arm had LFTs performed at follow-up. LFTs remained within normal limits at post-stop visits except for a Grade 1 elevation in one participant at post-stop week 12 (ALT /C3090, AST/C3061). There was no evidence of flares. PCR of stored samples showed that four had evidence of acute HBV infection at enrolment(two in the active arm). Both had evidence of grade 4 transaminase elevations by week 4 with subsequent resolution. Overall, there was no evidence of TDF or FTC resistance among tested genotypes. Of 1633eligible for vaccination, 1587 (97.2%) received at least one vaccine and1383 (84.7%) received the complete series. Anti-HBs detection was 44.4% after one, 74.5% after two and 86.9% after three doses. Conclusions : PrEP can be safely offered to persons with HBV infection if there is no evidence of cirrhosis or substantial transaminase elevation. As information is limited and treatment for HBV is complex, referral to a specialist is appropriate when available. HBV vaccinationrates at screening were low globally, yet uptake and efficacy werehigh when offered. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20370 TUAC0202 Adherence, sexual behaviour and HIV/STI incidence among men who have sex with men and transgender women in theUS PrEP demonstration (Demo) Demo Project Study Group 1San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco, United States.2Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, United States.3Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado, Aurora, United States.4University of Miami, Miami, United States.5National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States.6Whitman-Walker Health, Washington, DC, United States.

Little is known about adherence, sexual behaviour and HIV/STI incidence among thosewho elect to take PrEP in real-world settings. Methods : The Demo Project is the first US multi-site open-label study assessing PrEP delivery in municipal STD (San Francisco, Miami)and community-health (Washington, DC) clinics. HIV-uninfected MSM/TGW were offered 48 weeks of PrEP . Tenofovir-diphosphate levels were measured in dried blood spots (DBS) in a random sampleof participants (pts). Correlates of adherence were assessed usingmultivariable logistic regression. Sexual behaviours, PrEP disconti- nuations and HIV/STI are described. Results From 9/2012 to 1/2014, 557 pts enrolled, with 83% retained for the final visit (468.8 person-years (py)). Longitudinal drug levels,sexual behaviour and STI incidence are shown (Figure). Among 147 pts with DBS testing, 65% had drug levels consistent with taking ]4 doses/week at all visits, 3% always had DBS levels B2 doses/week, and 32% had an inconsistent pattern. Black pts, being self-referred tothe PrEP programme and having a greater number of condomless anal sex (AS) partners were independently associated with DBS ]4 doses/week (all p B0.05). Median AS partners in the past three months declined from baseline to week 48 (5 to 4, p B0.0008). Two- thirds reported condomless receptive AS (CRAS) at baseline, which remained stable during follow-up (p /C300.96). Twenty pts chose to stop PrEP due to low self-perceived HIV risk, however 65% of thesepts reported CRAS in the prior three to six months. Three participants were acutely infected at enrolment, and one seroconverted during follow-up (HIV incidence 0.21/100 py). This subject had DBS B2 doses/week at all prior visits. Overall, 27.5% had early syphilis, GC orCT at screening, and 38% had ]1 STI STI incidence 12.6/100 py for CT, GC and syphilis) but did not increase over time (p /C300.87). Conclusions : PrEP adherence was high and HIV incidence was low in this cohort at ongoing high sexual risk for HIV. STIs were common during PrEP use, highlighting the importance of screening andtreatment. Strategies for counselling on appropriate PrEP disconti-nuation are warranted. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20371 TUAC0203 Characteristics and oral PrEP adherence in the TDF2 extension Paula for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States. 2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Francistown, Botswana. 3ICF Macro, Atlanta, United States.4Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Gaborone, Botswana. Presenting author email: inh3@cdc.gov Introduction : The TDF2 Study was a Francistown, Botswana. TDF2 completed follow-up in 2011, demonstrating 62% overall protective efficacy. We describe final results of a 12-month open-label extension (OLE).Methods : Between February and May 2013, former TDF2 partici- pants were screened and offered 30-day supplies of TDF/FTC for up to 12 months. OLE exclusion criteria included HIV infection, pregnancy/breastfeeding and abnormal serum creatinine clearanceor phosphorus. Demographic and sexual behaviour data werecollected at baseline. Dual rapid fingerstick HIV testing, sexual behaviour questionnaires and self-reported adherence measures were conducted monthly. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collectedmonthly. Tenofovir levels were measured from DBS for a subset of 30randomly selected participants at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12. Results : Of 1219 TDF2 participants, 736 were contacted, and 229 (Male: 55.5%) were eligible and started drug. 71.2% were single, and23.9% were married/cohabitating. 60.3% of participants completed at least 10 monthly visits. Across all visits, 71.2% reported one sex partner in the prior 30 days; 8.7% reported two partners, and 2.4%reported ]3 partners. For the prior three days, 87.8% reported taking TDF/FTC daily, while 5.5% reported taking it 1 /C12 times and 6.7% reported taking none. Overall, 58.3% reported ''very good'' adherence in the prior 30 days, and 32.3% reported ''good''adherence. Of the 30 participants (Male: 77%) selected for DBStesting, the overall proportion with detectable mean tenofovir levels (/C2125 ng/mL) was 94%. At months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12, the proportion with detectable mean tenofovir levels were 93, 93, 100, 93 and 90%,respectively. After starting drug, no HIV infections were observed during the study. Conclusions : In this open-label study of TDF/FTC for oral PrEP, we observed high self-reported three-day medication adherence, highpercentage of detectable DBS tenofovir levels and no HIV infections. These findings lend support to efforts to expand availability of PrEP in the context of generalized epidemics in resource-limited settings.Further work is needed to define longer-term adherence for suchpopulations. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20372 Abstract TUAC0202 /C1Figure 1.

Presenting author email: shosek@cookcountyhhs.org Introduction : Young men who have sex with men (YMSM), particularly racial/ethnic minority YMSM, are a key population prophylaxis (PrEP) inter- ventions. This open-label PrEP study examined uptake and adherence to PrEP and assessed sexual risk behaviour among a diverse sampleof YMSM in 12 U.S. cities.Methods : ATN110 combined PrEP with evidence-based behavioural risk reduction interventions along with frequent sexual health and adherence promotion counselling. Eligible participants were 18- to22-year-old HIV-uninfected MSM who reported HIV transmission riskbehaviour in the past six months. Participants were recruited and screened for preliminary eligibility through venue-based outreach, community presentations and online advertising. Laboratory screen-ing determined final eligibility. Study visits occurred at baseline,monthly through week 12, then quarterly through week 48. Dried blood spots were serially collected for the quantification of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) blood levels.Results : Between March and September 2013, 2186 individuals were approached, 277 (13%) were preliminarily eligible and 200 were enrolled (mean age /C3020.2; 54.5% Black, 26.5% Latino). Eleven (4%) had undiagnosed HIV infection at screening and two acute HIVinfections were diagnosed at baseline. Diagnosis of STIs at baselinewas high (22%) and remained high across visits. Most participants (98%) chose to take PrEP . Figure 1 shows TFV-DP levels. At week 4,56% of participants had TFV-DP levels consistent with ]4 pills/ week. By week 48, 34% of participants had TFV-DP levels consistent with]4 pills/week, with a noticeable drop-off occurring at Week 24. Four HIV seroconversions occurred on study (3.29/100 person-years); all had TFV-DP BLQ at diagnosis. Condomless sex was reported by /C2180% of participants throughout the study and condomless anal sex with last partner was associated with higherTFV-DP levels.Conclusions : ATN110 enrolled a diverse sample of YMSM vulnerable to HIV. PrEP uptake was high with the majority achieving protective drug levels during initial monthly visits. As visits decreased infrequency, so did adherence, while reported sexual risk behaviour remained constant. Given the frequency of STI diagnoses, HIV infections may have been higher without PrEP . YMSM in the U.S.may need access to PrEP in youth-friendly settings with tailoredadherence support and potentially augmented visit schedules. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20549 TUAC0205LB Pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and associated factors among MSM in the PrEP Brasil demonstration de Janeiro, Brazil.2Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.3CRT, Sa o Paulo, Brazil.4USP, Sa o Paulo, Brazil. 5Bridge HIV, San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco, United States.

This study aims to describe PrEPuptake and associated factors in Brazil. Methods : PrEP Brasil is a demonstration project to assess the feasibility of implementing PrEP provided at no cost to high risk MSMand TGW within the Brazilian public health system. The project wasadvertised through social and other media. Participants were assessed for PrEP eligibility at FIOCRUZ-RJ, CRT-SP and USP-SP at FIOCRUZ and CRT,they were either self-referred or assessed for participation duringHIV-testing or post-exposure prophylaxis provision. Predictors of PrEP uptake were assessed using a Poisson regression model. Results : Of 986 MSM/TGW approached between April/2014 and April/2015, 798 were potentially eligible and 409 were enrolled. PrEP uptake was 51.25%. Median age at enrolment was 29 years (IQR 25 35); 8.2% and 4.7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, factors PrEP uptake were: recruitment atCRT-SP 95% CI 1.33/C12.24) versus FIOCRUZ; having a steady partner (aRR 1.45, 95% CI 1.18 /C11.78); having an HIV-test within the last 12 months (aRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 /C11.74); prior PrEP awareness (aRR CI 1.0/C11.59) and having ]2 male condomless anal sex partners within the last 12 months (aRR 1.65, 95% CI 1.32 /C12.05). Conclusions : This is the first PrEP demonstration project for MSM and TGW in a middle-income country. Overall, PrEP uptake was high.The higher uptake among those at higher risk and with an existing awareness of PrEP emphasizes the importance of establishing strategies to improve HIV risk perception and PrEP awareness inthe MSM and TGW of tenofovir reduced-glycerin 1% gel the rectal and vaginal compartments in women: a cross-compartmental study with Ian McGowan9and Charlene Dezutti6 1Centre for AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa.2ICAP at ColumbiaUniversity, University, New York, United States.3NIAID/ DAIDS, Bethesda, United States.4Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.5FHCRC-SCHARP, Seattle, United States. 6Microbicides Trial Network, Pittsburgh, United States.7FHI 360, Washington, United States.8CONRAD, Arlington, United States. 9Magee-Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States. Presenting author email: jj2158@columbia.edu Introduction : Tenofovir (TFV) gel, when used consistently as a vaginal microbicide, prevents HIV infection. As unprotected anal intercourse is prevalent amongst heterosexual women, data on TFV concentra- tions and anti-HIV activity in the rectal compartment followingvaginal application, and vice versa, are needed.Methods : MTN-014 is a phase 1 cross-over, randomized trial comparing the pharmacokinetics of TFV reduced-glycerin (RG) 1% gel following 14 days each of daily rectal versus vaginal directlyobserved dosing (DOD), with a six-week washout period in betweeneach phase. Vaginal and rectal tissue and fluid and blood samples were collected 24 hours after the end of each phase and analyzed for TFV and TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations. Vaginal and rectalfluids were tested for HIV inhibition using a TZM-bl assay. Results : Fourteen HIV-uninfected women, mean age 34 years, were enrolled at the Bronx Prevention Center in New York City and 13completed all study procedures. Of the 392 expected doses, 91%were DOD, two (0.5%) were missed and the remaining doses were reported as used. Mean plasma TFV concentrations were similar after 14 days of either dosing route (Table). Rectal concentrationsof TFV and TFV-DP were detectable after vaginal dosing in only 1 of13 and 2 of 13 tissue samples, respectively, while vaginal concen- trations of TFV and TFV-DP were detectable after rectal dosing in 6 of 14 and 3 of 14 samples, respectively. Rectal and vaginal dosingphases each resulted in markedly lower levels of tissue TFV and TFV-DP concentrations in the opposite compartment, with at least 1.7 log 10 differences between mean concentrations in the twocompartments.After vaginal dosing, inhibition of HIV increased by 42% in vaginal fluid, but no change was found in rectal fluid. No change in HIV inhibition in vaginal or rectal fluid was noted after rectal dosing.Conclusions : Cross-compartmental concentrations of TFV and TFV-DP were low in this study comparing rectal and vaginal DOD TFV RG 1% gel, and pharmacodynamics activity was noted only in the vaginal fluid compartment. Whether these low tissue concentrations areprotective remains to be determined. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20551 Abstract TUAC0206LB /C1Table 1.

Presenting author email: xjjbeijing@gmail.com Introduction : Recent upsurge of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) is a major concern in China. Paucity of national-level information regarding the burden and predictors of this progressive epidemic of new infections called for a multi-centric,comprehensive investigation.Methods : Mixed methods were used to recruit MSM (engaged in sex with men (oral and/or anal) within the last one year, aged 18 years or older and agreed to provide written informed consent) from sevencities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Ji'nan, Shenyang and Kunming) in different regions of China between 2012 and 2013. Early and established HIV infections were determined by Western Blot andBED HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay. Syphilis and herpessimplex virus-2 (HSV-2) were also tested. The study process and content were approved (No. 2011(36)) by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University.Results : A total of 4496 eligible MSM were recruited. The majority was aged 535 years (77.5%), migrants (60.3%), never married (69.8%) and played receptive role in anal sex (70.5%). The HIV prevalence was 9 /C2159% and 41 /C2159% were recently infected, with HIV incidence of 8 /C2159/100 person-years. The prevalence of HSV-2 and syphilis were 12 /C2155 and 8 /C2155%, respectively. Early HIV infection was associated with having multiple male partners (aOR /C301.4, 95% CI 1.1/C11.9), 1.5 /C13.3). Conclusions : HIV epidemic among Chinese MSM was worsening with an alarming number of recently infected HIV patients along with high burden of STIs. High rate of early HIV infection is potentially resulting in progressive deterioration of the overall HIV epidemic among MSM inChina. Interventions specifically targeting high-risk MSM especiallythose having high-risk behaviours (especially multiple partners and re- creational drug use), syphilis or HSV-2 infection and anal bleeding were urgently required for efficient control of HIV among MSM in China. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20373 TUAC0302 Repeat HIV voluntary counselling and testing within one year among men who have sex with men, Bangkok, Thailand Program, Nonthaburi, Thailand.2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Atlanta, United States. 3Ministry of Public Health, Department of Disease Control and Prevention, Nonthaburi, Thailand.Presenting author email: tkh3@cdc.gov Introduction : Current Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) recommendations state that men who have sex with men (MSM) should repeat HIV testing every 6 /C112 months. We investigated the proportion and trend of repeat HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) within 12 months among Thai MSM attending Silom Commu- nity Clinic @TropMed.Methods : Silom Community Clinic @Trop Med has been located in downtown Bangkok since late 2005, with easy access and convenient operating hours for MSM. It provides free-of-charge, confidential and rapid HIV VCT by MSM-friendly staff. We advertize the clinic viawebsite, Facebook, outreach and friend referrals. For first-timetesters, we recommend that they repeat VCT every 6 /C112 months. For this analysis, we included men with an initial HIV test who had visited the clinic for ]12 months and had a baseline HIV-negative result; the first VCT visit occurred between 2006 and 2013 withfollow-up period through October 2014. On a yearly basis, we looked at the number and proportion of first-time testers who had another VCT visit within the next 12 months. We used chi-square test fortrend to test changes in the proportion of repeat testing within 12 months by calendar year. Results : Between 2006 and 2013, 9345 MSM were tested by our testing services and 4597 met the criteria above and were includedin this analysis. Most (67.1%) were 25 years and older and most (87.9%) lived in Bangkok or nearby provinces at time of first test. Among these MSM, 2016 (43.9%) repeated VCT. The number of newtesters increased annually from 340 men in 2006 to 880 in 2013. Theproportion of MSM who repeated VCT within one year varied between 15.3 and 26.1% by calendar year (mean /C3022.2%) and there was a statistically significant increasing trend from 2006 to 2013(pB0.01) (Figure 1). Conclusions : Between 2006 and 2013, the number of new testers doubled, and the proportion of men who repeated VCT signifi-cantly increased. Given that roughly one-fifth of MSM repea-ted VCT within 12 months, counselling to emphasize repeating VCT according to Thailand MOPH recommendations should be strengthened and systematic strategies to retain testers should beimplemented. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20374 TUAC0303 Dramatic declines in lifetime HIV risk and persistence of racial disparities among men who have sex with men inKing County, Washington, USA Galant Chan1; Amy Bennett2; Susan Buskin2,3; Julia Dombrowski1,2 and Matthew Golden1,2 1Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.2Public Health- Seattle & King County, Seattle, United States.3Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. Introduction : In the United States, HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM), who account for /C2160% of new cases. Although recent data suggest HIV incidence is declining nationally, rates in MSM are stable, and the proportion of casesoccurring in black MSM is increasing. Because sexual mixing is largely age-assortative, using life tables to estimate risk within birth cohorts may be useful in assessing and anticipating trends in thepopulation's risk.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 51Methods : We constructed life tables for the period 1982 /C12012 to estimate the cumulative risk of HIV diagnosis among MSM born 1940/C11994 in King County. We used U.S. Census data to define the size of the white and black male populations of King County,Washington, national and local survey data to estimate theproportion of men who are MSM, and local surveillance data to define the number of HIV diagnoses in MSM each year. Results : We estimated that 6% of the local male population was MSM. Age-specific risk of HIV diagnosis increased in birth cohorts from the 1940s until the mid-1960s and thereafter declined, plateauing among cohorts born after the mid-1970s (Figure 1). This trend occurred in both white and black MSM. In the peak risk cohort, among MSM born 1960 /C164,/C2140% of white and /C2160% of black MSM had been diagnosed with HIV by age 50. A dramaticdecline in this risk was evident when comparing the percentage ofMSM diagnosed with HIV in different birth cohorts. Among white and black MSM born 1960 /C11964, the cumulative risk of HIV diagnosis by age 35 was 29 and 42%, respectively, while amongMSM born 1975 /C11979, this risk decreased to 9 and 15%, respectively.However, as absolute risk of HIV diagnosis decreased overall in younger cohorts, relative differences between white and black MSM appeared to increase. Throughout the period and across birth cohorts, cumula- tive HIV risk was 18 to 84% higher among black versus white MSM.Conclusions : Comparing birth cohorts, cumulative HIV risk among MSM in King County has declined approximately 65% in those born after the mid-1960s, although racial disparities persist. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating HIV risk within birth cohortsand demonstrate remarkable local progress in HIV prevention. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20375 TUAC0304 Ethical considerations for inclusion of men who have sex with men under the age of 18 in epidemiological research:evidence from six sub-Saharan African HIV repeat testers.

Presenting author email: grossoas@gmail.com Introduction : In many settings, laws or institutional review board policies require parental permission for youth B18 years to participate in research. Individual and social risk factors for HIV acquisition often occur before age 18. Youth may be unwilling toparticipate in HIV epidemiological research requiring parentalconsent due to the sensitive nature of risk factors such as sexual behaviours and experiences of violence. Young men who have sex with men (MSM) are at especially high risk for HIV acquisition andare often unwilling or unable to disclose their sexual orientation orpractices to their parents. In sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV prevalence among MSM is high and sex between men is criminalized or highly stigmatized in many countries, epidemiologic research onthis vulnerable population of young MSM is particularly relevant and sparse. One strategy for assessing the potential size of the population of young ( B18) MSM is to ask adult MSM retrospective questions about the age at which they first had anal sex with a man. Methods : MSM aged 18 or older were recruited using respondent- driven sampling in Burkina Faso, Togo, Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland. MSM aged 15 and above were recruited using snowball sampling in The Gambia. Participants completed a survey that included a questionasking how old they were when they first had anal sex with another man. This variable was dichotomized and tabulated to assess the prevalence of anal sex under the age of 18.Results : Across settings, 40.20% (1106/2751) of MSM had anal sex with a man before the age of 18. The highest percentage was in Lome, Togo (63.84%), while the smallest percentage was in Swaziland (14.46%). MSM under the age of 18 represented 12.14% of the studysample in The Gambia.Conclusions : A substantial proportion of MSM participants had anal sex with a man under the age of 18. Further research on this group, including a waiver of requirements for parental consent forparticipation, is warranted. Given the relatively small proportion ofstudy participants under the age of 18 in a setting where this was feasible, additional outreach strategies such as web-based recruit- ment may be necessary. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20376 TUAC0305 Nuanced seroadaptive behaviours among Seattle men who have sex with men: sexual decision-making based on ARTuse/viral load and recency of partner HIV testing Christine M Khosropour1; David A Katz2,3; Julia C Dombrowski2,3and Matthew R Golden2,3 1Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.2Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.3HIV/STD Program, Public Health /C1Seattle & King County, Seattle, United States.Presenting author email: ckhosro@uw.edu Introduction : Seroadaptive behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM) may protect against HIV. Anecdotally, some MSMincorporate partners' antiretroviral therapy (ART)/viral load (VL) orHIV testing frequency into sexual decision-making. The frequency and effect of these strategies is unknown. Methods : HIV-negative MSM attending an STD clinic in Seattle, WA from March /C1December 2014 were enrolled in a study of seroadap- tive behaviours. Men completed a computer-based survey on behaviours in the past 12 months. HIV testing was performed perclinic protocol. Among HIV-negative men with HIV-negative partners,we examined if the timing of the partner's last HIV test was asso- ciated with condomless anal intercourse (CAI). Of those with HIV- positive partners, we asked (in aggregate) if respondents' decisionto have sex or use condoms was based on partner ART use or VL(i.e. ART/VL serosorting). We compared proportions with chi-square tests. Results : We enrolled 988 (58%) of 1718 eligible HIV-negative MSM. The mean age was 33 and 62% were white, non-Hispanic. Most (69%) had CAI with HIV-negative partners, 18% had CAI with HIV- positive partners and 22% reported no CAI. The majority (86%) askedHIV-negative partners when the partner last tested negative.

Of 222 men with HIV-positive partners, 60 and 64% decidedwhether to have sex/use condoms based on their partners' ART use or VL, respectively. CAI with an HIV-positive partner was more com- mon among men who reported ART/VL serosorting compared tothose who did not (79% vs. 57%, p /C300.03), but testing newly posi- tive for HIV was less common among men who reported ART/VL serosorting compared to men who did not (1/120 (1%) recency of apartner's HIV test to inform sexual decision-making are common. The high prevalence of these behaviours suggests they could impact HIV incidence rates, but the individual- and population-level effects ofthese behaviours are uncertain. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20377 TUAC0306 Viral load awareness and risk behaviour in male serodiscordant couples in Australia, Brazil and Thailand Benjamin Study Group 1The Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia.2Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society, La Trobe Janeiro, Brazil.4Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand. Presenting author email: bbavinton@kirby.unsw.edu.au Introduction : There are very limited data from homosexual male serodiscordant couples (HM-SDC) on the impact of antiretroviraltherapy (ART) and viral load (VL) on HIV transmission risk and on riskbehaviours within such couples. To date, no studies have investigated the issue in middle income countries. Methods :Opposites Attract is an ongoing multisite cohort study of HM-SDC in Australia, Brazil and Thailand. HIV-positive partners (HPP)had VL tested; HIV-negative partners (HNP) had HIV antibody tests and reported sexual behaviour and perception of the HPP's most recent VL test. Undetectable VL (UVL) was defined as B200 copies/ mL. We compared couples from the three countries; baseline differences were examined with bivariate logistic regression. Results : By January 2015, 242 couples were enrolled (Australia /C30 137, Brazil /C3053, Thailand /C3052). The majority of HPP were taking ART (80.2%); this was lower in Thailand than in Australia and Brazil (pB0.001), accompanied by higher proportions with UVL in Australia (88.2%) and Brazil (85.0%) than in Thailand (69.2%,p/C300.008). Overall, 61.2% of HNP perceived their HPP's last VL test result to be undetectable. Brazilian and Thai HNP were more likelynot to know the result (17.0 and 38.5%) compared to Australians (5.1%, pB0.001). Australian HNP reported more sex with other partners than Brazilian (p /C300.013) but not Thai HNP (p /C300.183). Australian HNP reported more condomless anal intercourse (CLAI) with outside partners compared to both Brazilians (p /C300.002) and Thais (p /C300.012). 54.6% of HNP reported CLAI with study partner in the last three months. Compared to Australia (67.9%), this was lower in Brazil (45.3%, p /C300.005) and Thailand (28.9%, p B0.001). Overall, 63.5% perceived the HPP's VL to be undetectablereported CLAI in the last three months, compared to only 40.4% ofHNP in which the HPP's VL was detectable/unknown (OR/C300.39, 95% CI /C300.23/C10.66, p /C300.001). While this was strongly associated amongst Australian couples (p /C300.002), there was no such association in Brazil or Thailand. Conclusions : Australian HNP were more aware of their partner's VL results. Australian HM-SDC with perceived UVL practiced more CLAI,suggesting they may be acting upon beliefs that treatment-as-prevention is effective.This pattern was not seen in Brazil and Thailand. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20378 TUAC0401 Estimating the number of people who inject drugs in two urban areas in Mozambique using four different methods,2014 Isabel Surveillance Prevention & Public HealthGroup, University of California, San Francisco, United States. 3National Institute of Health, Ministry of Health, Maputo, Mozambique. 4Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Maputo, Mozambique. 5Department of Mental Health, Ministry of Health, Maputo, Mozambique.

As partof the Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) Survey implemented in 2014, we conducted the first population size estimation among PWID in two urban areas, Maputo (n /C30353) and Nampula (n /C30139). Methods : Given the lack of a gold standard, we synthesized four independent methods to estimate the number of PWID: unique objectmultiplier, wisdom of the crowd, sequential sampling and literaturereview. The unique object estimate is calculated as the number of objects distributed to PWID pre-survey, divided by the proportion of survey participants who reported receiving the objects.

The sequential sampling method applies a Bayesian approach to the self-reported PWID network size of eachparticipant to infer the size of the hidden population. In the literaturereview, estimates were based on proportions of adults who are PWID from other African locations applied to the 2014 census projections for Maputo and Nampula. A consensus meeting among stakeholdersagreed that the median of all four methods was the best estimate of population size of PWID in each city and also agreed to the lowest and highest estimates as ''acceptable bounds.''Results : HIV prevalence was 50.3% Maputo and The numbers of PWID were estimated at 1445 of 3921 (1.16%)). Usingthese population size estimates, there are 727 and 171 PWIDinfected with HIV and in need of care and/or treatment services in Maputo and Nampula, respectively. Conclusions : Our results highlight the feasibility of using the median of multiple methods to estimate the size of PWID in two urban areas inMozambique. Given the limited population size and high rates of infec-tion, harm-reduction, prevention interventions and HIV care and treat- ment services should be practical and affordable in this population. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20379 TUAC0402 Efficacy of a network intervention in reducing HIV incidence among people who inject drugs in Ukraine: preliminaryresults from a clustered randomized /C1Figure 1.

Presenting author email: robert.booth@ucdenver.edu Introduction : HIV incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Ukraine is among the highest in the world. We assessed the efficacy oftwo interventions, a network-based peer intervention combined with HIV testing and counselling (T/C combined; experimental condition, N/C30614) versus HIV testing and counselling alone (T/C alone; control condition, N /C30592), in reducing HIV incidence among PWID. Methods : Between 2010 and 2014, 1205 HIV-seronegative PWID were recruited from street settings in Odessa, Donetsk and Nikolayev. We used a clustered randomized design that consisted of 611 networksand included: peer-leaders; first wave network members; and secondwave network members. Participants were randomly assigned to interventions in groups of 16 and interviewed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Interviewers and HIV tester/counsellors were not blindedto intervention. Cox regression was used to compare HIV incidence between groups, incorporating GEE to account for clustering. Results : Preliminary results suggest that mean age and duration of injection was 31.8 and 11.7 years, respectively; 75% were male. Inthe past 30 days, 43% injected daily, 46% always injected with others, 78% had ]1 sex partner. HIV incidence was 19.0 per 100 person- years (py) in the experimental condition compared to 31.8 per 100py in the control condition (p B0.001). PWID in the experimental con- dition had a 39% reduced hazard for HIV seroconversion versus the control group (p B0.001). With each year increase in age, the hazard increased by 5% (p B0.001) ,and with each injection episode in the past 30 days, the hazard increased by 0.6% (p /C300.02). Those who were sexually active in the last 30 days had a 26% reduced hazard (p /C300.03). Conclusions : The combined network-based peer intervention and was more efficacious in reducing HIV incidence among PWID inUkraine than T/C alone. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20380 TUAC0403 Factors associated with initiation of antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected people who use illicit drugs Brenden Joseph1and M. J Milloy1,2 1British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.2Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Presenting author email: bjoseph@ualberta.ca Introduction : Treatment-as-prevention-based efforts to reduce HIV/ AIDS-associated morbidity, mortality and HIV viral transmission among people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) rely on prompt engagement in antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the long-itudinal factors that promote or block initiation of ART among PWUDare not well described. Thus, we sought to identify factors associated with time from seroconversion to ART initiation among PWUD. Methods : Using data from two observational prospective cohorts of illicit drug users linked to comprehensive ART dispensation records,we included HIV-seronegative individuals at baseline who serocon- verted during follow-up. We fit multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for a time-updated measure of clinicaleligibility for ART to identify factors independently associated with time to treatment initiation following seroconversion. Results : We included 133 individuals of whom 98 (73.7%) initiated ART during follow-up at a rate of 17.6 per 100 person-years. In amultivariable model adjusted for clinical eligibility, living in the HIV epicentre (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) /C301.62, 95% confidence /C302.37, 95% CI and later year of interview (AHR /C301.07, 95% CI /C301.02/C11.13) were associated with shorter time to ART initiation. Barriers to ART initiation were illicit income generation (AHR /C300.51, 95% CI /C300.32/C10.79) and incar- ceration (AHR /C300.52, of community-recruited HIV-positive PWUD with well-defined dates of seroconversion, we found that illicit income generation and incarceration were barriers to ART initiation while MMT and living in the HIV epicentre promoted ART initiationindependent of clinical eligibility. Current efforts to scale-up HIV treat-ment among PWUD should consider these factors in order to reduce HIV/AIDS-associated morbidity, mortality and HIV viral transmission. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20381 TUAC0404 Periodic HIV testing and immediate antiretroviral therapy among people who inject drugs in Vietnam Huu Hai Nguyen1; Duc Duong Bui1; Control, Hanoi, Vietnam.2Center for Research and Training on HIV/AIDS, Ha Noi Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam.3National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Hanoi, Vietnam.4World Health Organization, Hanoi, Vietnam.5Thai Nguyen Province AIDS Center, Thai Nguyen, Vietnam.6Thanh Hoa Province AIDS Center, Hanoi, Vietnam. Presenting author email: katom@wpro.who.int Introduction : In Vietnam, injecting drug use is[VR1] the leading cause of HIV transmission. Multiple local transmission modelssuggest periodic HIV testing and counselling (HTC) and initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of CD4 count in people who inject drugs (PWID) can markedly reduce HIV-related mortality andtransmission. Programme experience with this approach in Vietnam is limited. Therefore, the acceptability and feasibility of this approach was assessed in two high-burden provinces. We present preliminaryART outcomes.Methods : Village health workers, PWID peer educators, and health staff were educated on the new approach and the benefits and risks of immediate ART initiation. Since April 2014, HTC has beenrecommended to PWID every six months, and immediate ART, thatis, initiation irrespective of CD4 count, has been offered to PWID living with HIV in Thai Nguyen and Thanh Hoa provinces. Following consent, PWID were followed for 12 months. HIV viral load (VL) wasassessed before ART start (baseline) and at months 6 and 12. Results : Of 232 identified HIV-positive PWID, 218 (94%) agreed to participate and initiate immediate ART, among which 102 initiatedART before 30 June 2014. Of this cohort, 97.1% were males, medianage was 36 years, 47.1% reported methadone use in the past three months, 38.2% had baseline CD4 counts greater than 350 cells/mm 3 and median baseline VL was 4.1 (IQR 2.3 /C15.2) log10 copies/mL. Ninety-one of the 102 participants (89.2%) were retained after sixmonths (eight died and three lost-to-follow-up). Retention was 84.1 and 97.4% among PWID with baseline CD4 counts below and above 350 cells/mm 3, respectively (Figure 1). Excluding five patients who transferred to other care sites and seven patients whose sampleswere not available due to logistical issues, 67 of the 79 participants (84.8%) achieved viral suppression (i.e. VL B1000 copies/mL) at month six. Viral suppression was 84.4 and 85.3% among PWID withCD4 counts below and above 350 cells/mm 3, respectively (Figure 1). Conclusions : The preliminary results suggest high uptake and adherence to ART irrespective of CD4 count among PWID; however,late presentation to care remains a critical problem.

Presenting author email: lrichardson@cfenet.ubc.ca Introduction : There is extensive documentation of the direct clinical benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence leading to plasma HIV RNA-1 viral load suppression. However, very little is known about the social, socio-economic and ancillary clinical benefits of ARTadherence, particularly among people who use illicit drugs (PWUD). Methods : We used longitudinal data from a prospective cohort of community-recruited HIV-positive PWUD in Vancouver, Canada, asetting of free and universal access to HIV care. Participant data werelinked to comprehensive HIV clinical monitoring and ART dis- pensation records. We developed a series of generalized linear mixed effects models, adjusting for potential confounders. Modelsexamine whether, among ART-exposed individuals, becoming opti-mally adherent to ART medication (i.e. ]95% using a validated measure of pharmacy dispensation) resulted in associated social, socio-economic and ancillary clinical benefits, such as relationshipinitiation, transitioning out of homelessness, entering employ- ment, ceasing involvement in illegal or prohibited income gen- eration activity (e.g. street-based income generation, sex work,drug dealing or other illegal activities) and enrolling in addictiontreatment. Results : Between December 2005 and November 2013, of the 724 eligible study participants, 241 (33.3%) self-reported as women and404 (55.8%) as Caucasian, with 463 (64.0%) individuals becoming ]95% adherent to ART at least once during the study period. In final multivariate models, becoming adherent to ART was positively andsignificantly associated with ceasing prohibited or illegal income generation activities (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.52; 95% con-fidence interval 95% CI: 1.12 /C11.71), while ART adherence was marginally associated with initiating a romantic relationship (AOR: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.96 /C11.81). Conclusions : These findings suggest that becoming adherent to ART results not only in virologic suppression among HIV infected PWUD, but also increases the likelihood of reducing key drivers of social andsocio-economic vulnerability. These secondary benefits of ARTadherence hold the potential to reinforce ongoing engagement in HIV care and support significant improvements in quality of life and individual health among this marginalized population. Findingsreinforce the clinical and non-clinical importance of promotingaccess and adherence to ART among HIV-positive individuals who use illicit drugs. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20383 TUAC0406LB Modelling the impact of improvements in the cascade of care for chronic hepatitis C among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Montre \u00b4al, Centre Bernard, Paris, France.7Chronic Viral Illness Service, McGill University Health Centre, Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montre \u00b4al, Canada.Presenting author email: anthony.cousien@inserm.fr Introduction : Since 2010, HCV incidence among active (i.e. injection past six months) PWID in Montre \u00b4al remains greater than 15 of 100 person-years (p-y).

Our objective was to assess how improvements in the cascade of care can impact future HCV incidence, prevalence and complications among PWID in Montre \u00b4al. Methods : We used a dynamic model to simulate HCV transmission and natural history among active PWID in Montre \u00b4al from 2015. The reference scenario (scenario 1) was the current cascade of care including new DAA as standard treatment (see Table 10). HCVprevalence and incidence after 10 years and the number of livercomplications avoided after 40 years were estimated under different conditions: decreased time from chronic infection to diagnosis (scenario 2), greater adherence to treatment (scenario 3), improvedtreatment rate (scenarios 4 and 5) and a combination of theseinterventions (scenario 6). Due to a lack of data on time to linkage to care (time between diagnosis and first consultation related to hepatitis C), simulations considered three such intervals: one, threeand five years. A thousand simulations were performed per scenario. Results : Scenarios 2 and 3 showed similar results for HCV prevalence (53.3/C159.5%) and incidence (9.1 /C110.3/100 p-y) after 10 years, and less than a 3.4% difference in the number of liver complications after40 years relative to the reference scenario. Improving access to treatment (scenarios 4 and 5) demonstrated a great decrease in all outcomes. When combining all interventions (scenario 6), prevalenceand incidence decreased until 26.9% and 4.9/100 p-y, respectively,and the number of liver complications until 39.3%, depending on the time to linkage to care.Conclusions : Our results suggest that decreasing time to diagnosis or improving treatment adherence is not sufficient to impact HCV prevalence, incidence and complications among PWID in Montre \u00b4al. The current level of treatment access in the cascade of care islimiting a massive decrease in disease burden and transmission. Asubstantial treatment scale-up is necessary in this population. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20552 TUAD0101 Where to strengthen care: model-based triangulation of trends in the HIV care cascade Anna Bershteyn; Daniel Klein; Kevin Oishi and Philip Eckhoff Institute for Disease Modeling, Bellevue, United States. Presenting author email: abershteyn@intven.com Introduction : The HIV ''cascade of care'' provides a framework for identifying priority areas for improvement of HIV services. In sub-Saharan Africa, the cascade has yet to be characterized nationally due to challenges such as distinguishing first initiation of care from re-initiation absent unique patient identifiers. Lacking direct datacharacterizing the cascade, we hypothesize that national-leveltemporal trends in care can be triangulated based on epidemiological, actuarial and programmatic information fed into a quantitative model.

Datawere available up to 2012, beyond which we assumed continuation of current trends in scale-up. HIV-associated mortality in the model was classified into those dying without initiating care, havinginitiated late (CD4 B200), lost to follow-up (LTFU) after previous initiation or currently in care. Results : Failure to initiate care constituted the largest but most rapidly declining category of HIV mortality, predicted to decline from47% of HIV-associated deaths in 2015 to 37% in 2020. Late initiation was the second-largest and declined more slowly because increasing CD4 counts at initiation were partially offset by growing numbers ofpatients initiating care. LTFU was the third-largest but the mostrapidly-growing category of HIV mortality. Programmatic data about re-initiation of care is lacking, but under the assumption that half of patients LTFU will re-initiate care, deaths LTFU were not expected tosurpass deaths due to late initiation by 2020. Those receiving careconstituted 3% of HIV-associated deaths, mostly among those receiving treatment rather than in pre-ART care. This proportion remained constant over time because the growing population ontreatment was offset by improvements in treatment quality, such asexpansion of virological monitoring and availability of second-line regimens. Conclusions : More data are required to fully characterize the spatial heterogeneities and dynamics of the care cascade. Nevertheless, trends revealed by model-based triangulation were consistent with findings in well-studied populations such as demographic surveil-lance sites. Failure to access care remains the largest but mostrapidly declining category of HIV mortality. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20384 TUAD0102 Optimizing tools for measuring short-term antiretroviral adherence from pharmacy refill data to predict virologicoutcomes in resource-limited settings Rory Leisegang1; Mcmahon2; Boulle4; Julian Gary Maartens1 1Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.2Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.3Aid forAIDS, Afrocentric Health Pty Ltd, Cape Town, South Africa. 4Department of Public Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.5Centre for Population Health, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Australia. Presenting author email: rory.leisegang@uct.ac.za Introduction : Estimates of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) using pharmacy refill data have outperformed self-reportand can identify patients at risk for virologic failure, especially in settings where viral load testing is limited. Uncertainty exists about the best method to estimate adherence using pharmacy refilldata and the optimal duration of data to predict virologicoutcomes. Methods : We identified individuals over 18 on first and second line ART from a national private sector (Aid for AIDS) and regional publicsector (Khayelitsha) programme. The area under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for virologic suppression (VS) (viral load B400 copies/mL) was used to compare three short-term adherence estimate methods:1) ''crude'' /C1refills divided by months, 2) ''average'' /C1days ART dispensed plus unused ART from prior dispensing divided by interval duration, and3) ''gap'' /C1interval duration less the number of days without ART coverage, divided by interval duration. The ''gap'' method is different to the ''average'' method as it does not allow the adherence estimate to be artificially increased byadditional ART dispensed after a possible ''gap'' in ART coverage. The interval for pharmacy refill varied from 3 to 12 months. Results : We included 56,472 individuals from the private programme (median 1.7 years, 65% female) and 24,466 from the public programme(median 2.1 years, 65% female). The ''gap'' method consistently outperformed the other two methods (see Figure 1). In the public programme, the ''gap'' method was 12% less potent due to significantdata capture errors. Longer pharmacy refill intervals outperformedshorter intervals (''gap'' ROC 0.837 (12 months), 0.812 (3 months)) in the more powered private dataset. When further separated by regimen line, the ''gap'' method for second line was superior but theROC AUCs estimates did not vary by the pharmacy refill identified possible cut-points for virological failure in the private programme: 80 and 72% for first and second line therapy. respectively.Conclusions : Adherence measures that identify gaps in pharmacy data were superior and consistent across programs and regimen Abstract TUAD0101 /C1Figure 1.

ART coverage is reported annually to UNAIDS using mathematically-modelled estimates of the number of HIV /C27persons eligible for ART based on an assumed distribution of CD4 counts in the HIV /C27population and the number of persons receiving ART in health facilities. We compared ART coverage reported to UNAIDS with coverage estimated from a nationally representative survey in Kenya using two independent methods.Methods : The 2012 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey was a population- based household survey of persons aged 18 months-64 years conducted from 10/2012 to 2/2013. Interviews collected data on ART use for persons reporting HIV /C27status. Blood samples weretested for HIV, and HIV /C27samples tested for ART by High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Tandem MassSpectrometry. We estimated and compared ART coverage among HIV/C27persons aged 15 /C164 years based on: 1) routine programme monitoring data; 2) self-report; and 3) biological confirmation of ART.ART eligibility in the survey was defined as: CD4 count B350 cells/ mm 3or having active tuberculosis. Estimates were weighted to adjust for survey design and non-response.Results : According to ART programme monitoring data, 549,000 adults were receiving ART in 2012, covering 39.6% (confidence interval (CI) 36.8/C143.0) of HIV /C27persons and 78.3% (CI 74.8 /C182.8) ART- respondents, 648 (5.6%) were HIV /C27and 559 (86.3%) had samples available for ART testing. Among those,42.5% (CI 0.4 /C147.7) tested positive for ART while 34.2% (CI 29.1 /C1 39.3) reported receiving ART. Based on biological confirmation of ART, coverage among ART-eligible persons was 71.0% (CI 63.2 /C178.9) or 444,000 self-report 63.4%(CI 53.2 /C173.6) or 374,000 persons. Conclusions : Self-report underestimated ART coverage by 70,000 persons while programme data may overestimate coverage by up to105,000 persons. Until monitoring systems for the national ART programme are strengthened and mathematical models are updated to reflect actual need for ART, surveys that provide biological confir-mation of ART may be required to accurately track national estimatesof ART coverage. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20386 TUAD0104 Crowdsourcing to spur first-time HIV testing among men who have sex with men and transgender individuals in China: anon-inferiority pragmatic randomized controlled trial Abstract TUAD0102 /C1Figure 1.

Presenting author email: jdtucker@med.unc.edu Introduction : Improving first-time HIV testing among key populations, especially young MSM and transgender (TG) individuals, is a global health priority. However, most HIV testing campaigns do not reach untested populations and have minimal input from key populations.Crowdsourcing, the process of taking a task performed by an individualand opening it to a large group in the form of a contest, may enhance HIV testing interventions. We organized a non-inferiority, pragmatic randomized controlled trial to compare first-time HIV testing ratesamong MSM and TG individuals who received either a crowdsourcedHIV test promotion intervention or a health marketing intervention. Methods : Participants were recruited through three large MSM web portals in China. We randomly assigned 721 MSM and TG individuals(]16 years old, never before tested for HIV) to one of two video interventions. The crowdsourced video was developed using an open contest and formal transparent judging while the evidence-basedhealth marketing video was designed by experts. We followed upfour weeks post-intervention via text message to assess HIV test uptake. Descriptive statistics and sensitivity analyses for missing data were carried out to assess test uptake. Cost-minimization analysiswas used to evaluate economic and financial costs of the twointerventions. The trial was registered (NCT02248558). Results : Overall, 624/721 (86.5%) MSM and TG individuals re- sponded to the text message. HIV test uptake was similar betweenthe crowdsourced arm (37.1%, 114/307) and the health 111/317). Sensitivity analysis using imputation sup- ported the similarity of the two approaches. Within the crowd-sourced arm, individuals who previously viewed the video were morelikely to receive HIV testing compared to first-time viewers (52.4% vs. 26.5%, p B0.001). Among those tested, 30.7% (69/225) reported a new HIV diagnosis. The crowdsourced intervention cost substantiallyless than the health marketing intervention in eliciting first-timetesting ($131/person vs. $238) and detecting new HIV diagnoses ($415/person vs. $799).Conclusions : We provide proof of principle for using crowdsourcing as a tool to enhance community engagement and improve HIV testing services. Crowdsourcing may be a cost-effective method tooptimize HIV interventions, especially interventions targeting youngkey populations. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20387 TUAD0105LB The effect of a population-based health department Data- to-Care intervention to increase HIV care engagement and antiretroviral use: a controlled evaluation Julia C Dombrowski1,2; James P Hughes3; Susan E Buskin2,4; Jane M Angela Nunez2and Matthew R Golden1,2,4 1Medicine, University of Washing ton, Seattle, United States.2HIV/STD Program, Public Health /C1Seattle & King County, Seattle, United States. 3Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. 4Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. 5Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. Presenting author email: jdombrow@uw.edu Introduction : The US CDC promotes the use of HIV surveillance data to identify out-of-care persons and return them to care (''Data-to-Care'').Methods : We used stepped wedge cluster randomization to institute a Data-to-Care programme in Seattle-King County, Washington, DC, USA. We attempted to provide the intervention to all eligible personsin the county, initiated in a randomly assigned order based on cases' medical provider (the cluster). Eligible persons had 1) no CD4 or viral load (VL) reported for ]12 months or 2) VL /C21500 and CD4 B350 at last report. Programme staff contacted patients to offer assistancerelinking to HIV care and treatment. The primary study outcome was time to viral suppression (first VL B200 reported to surveillance), starting from the programme implementation date. The secondaryoutcome was care relinkage (first VL or CD4 reported). We used CoxProportional Hazards to compare outcomes during control periods (before initiation of each case's provider cluster) to intervention periods (after initiation of the cluster). We censored cases at thetime of ascertainment of relocation or death, or end of the observation period. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included all eligible cases; the modified ITT (mITT) analysis excluded cases foundto have died or moved.Results : The ITT and mITT analyses included 1008 and 824 persons, respectively (Figure). Study staff provided the individual intervention to 165 persons, of whom 73% relinked to care within one month and70% achieved viral suppression within six months.

The HR associated with the intervention was higher amongpersons with last VL /C21500 in the past year than persons with no labs in the past year. Conclusions : Data-to-Care programmes can relink some persons to HIV care, but the effect of these programmes may be limited by thelarge numbers of persons who have moved, died or cannot bereached, and the rate of relinkage to care in the absence of the intervention. Focusing on persons with recently reported unsup- pressed VLs rather than a gap in lab reports may be more effectiveand efficient. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20553 TUAD0201 Retaining mother-baby-pairs in care mothers2mothers, Cape Town, South Africa.2Research and Strategic Information, mothers2mothers, Cape Town, South Africa. 3mothers2mothers Uganda, Jinja, Uganda.

Furthermore, 796 preg-nant women and new mothers accessing PMTCT between June 2012and March 2014 across both study arms participated in facility based Psychosocial Wellbeing surveys. Bivariate and multivariate inferential statistical analysis was done using STATA 12. Propensity ScoreMatching was used to investigate the net effect attributable to the m2m standard-of-care. Results : Comparison of the intervention and control sites indicated that clients in m2m-supported health facilities showed improveduptake of PMTCT services (see Table 1). The m2m model was further associated with increased coping self- efficacy (86.6% vs. 64.5%, p B0.001); coping behaviour (69.4% vs. 56.9%, p B0.001); HIV disclosure and safer sex self-efficacy (71.7% vs. 50.7%, p B0.001); and reduction in the experience of depression (83.5% vs. 78.1%, p /C300.028). Conclusions : m2m has developed and refined a simple, scalable, adaptable and sustainable model of peer education and psychosocial support that improves uptake of PMTCT services and addresses the challenges facing HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers. Theevidence shows that m2m's psychosocial peer support helps HIV-positive pregnant women and new mothers and their families cope more effectively with HIV and enhances their psychosocial wellbeing. Integration of peer education and psychosocial support into clinicalPMTCT standard-of-care is recommended. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20388 TUAD0202 Effectiveness of conditional cash transfers to increase retention in care and adherence to PMTCT services: arandomized controlled Public Health, Ohio State University, Columbus, United States.2Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.3Department of Health Policy and Management, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.4Department of Health Behavior, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill,United States. 5School of Public Health, University of Kinshasa, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Presenting author email: yotebieng.2@osu.edu Introduction : Novel strategies are needed to increase retention in, and adherence to prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) services, and ultimately enhance PMTCT implementationeffectiveness in sub-Saharan Africa.Objective : To determine whether small, increasing cash payments conditioned on attending scheduled clinic visits and receiving proposed services can increase the proportion of HIV-infectedpregnant women who attend PMTCT visits and adhere to availablePMTCT services through six weeks postpartum. Methods : Newly diagnosed HIV-infected women, 532 weeks preg- nant, were recruited at antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa, DemocraticRepublic of Congo, and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to anintervention group that received compensation on the condition they attend scheduled clinic visits and accept offered PMTCT services ($5 plus $1 increment at each subsequent visit) or to a control groupthat received usual care. Outcomes assessed included: retention in care measured by loss-to-follow-up (LTFU), and adherence to PMTCT services (attend all scheduled clinic visits and accept proposedservices) through six weeks postpartum. Analysis was by intentionto treat. The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01838005. Results : Between April 2013 and August 2014, 612 potential parti- cipants were identified, 545 were screened and 433 were enrolled andrandomized (Figure 1).

Presenting author email: rmusarandega@pedaids.org Introduction : Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) partnered with the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) to roll out theWHO 2010 and later 2013 prevention of mother-to-child HIVtransmission EGPAF, MOHCC and CIFF developed a path'' with a prioritized set of performance indicators, withpopulation-based targets, that are the main drivers of impact. The indicators are reviewed quarterly, as they largely draw on routine monitoring data. If performance is lagging in a particular indicator, adiagnosis is undertaken to identify the reason and corrective actionexplored. Critical path indicators and results for quarter 2, 2012 are in Figure 1. The EGPAF-CIFF goal was to reduce mother-to-child trans- mission (MTCT) of HIV from about 25% in 2009 to less /C29% by 2015. Methods : Health facilities (HFs) were supported to implement the guidelines through training and mentoring during site support visits, among other assistance. PMTCT data were collected quarterly from all supported HFs, and performance of each indicator compared withestablished targets during data-driven programme reviews held by EGPAF, partner programme officers and MOHCC district staff. Reasons for under-performance and improvement strategies were identifiedand implemented in subsequent quarters through mentoring andcoaching of HF staff to improve service provision and patient follow-up. Results : By October 2014, EGPAF was supporting 1480 out of 1560 sites to provide WHO 2013 PMTCT guidelines (Option B /C27). Service uptake in all critical path indicators increased significantly(pB0.001) from 2009/10 to 2013/14 as follows: ANC bookings /C198%, AZT prophylaxis 32 /C191%, CD4 testing 41/C167%, ART initiation for pregnant mothers 18 /C185%, EID 13 /C171%, mothers' adherence on ARV prophylaxis 34 /C177%. The national MTCT rate fell to /C29.0% in 2013. Conclusions : Through use of the critical path cascade, EGPAF and CIFF supported the MOHCC to achieve a rapid scale-up of PMTCTservices. There is a need to maintain coverage and quality PMTCT services and ensure that children needing ART are actively identified, Abstract TUAD0203 /C1Figure 1.

This studyassessed factors associated with attrition among pregnant and non-pregnant patients initiating ART following adoption of Option B /C27 (universal ART eligibility for HIV-infected pregnant women) in October 2012 in Haiti.Methods : Electronic medical records of adult patients initiated on ART from October 2012 to August 2014 at 73 health facilities (HF) from 8 of 10 Haitian administrative departments were analyzed.Within a survival analysis framework, attrition was defined as thefirst instance of failure to attend a HF visit for 90 days after a mis- sed clinical or pharmacy-dispensing appointment, or an officially- recorded programme discontinuation, whichever came first. Knowntransfers to alternative HF were treated as censored observations,not attrition cases. ART initiations during or within 12 weeks after pregnancy were deemed Option B /C27cases. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression, stratified by HF,were used to determine attrition and associated factors. Results : Among 17,084 patients who initiated ART, 7719 (45.2%) were non-pregnant women, 5920 (34.7%) were men and 3445(20.2%) were pregnant women. At six months, attrition was 15.6%(95% confidence interval (CI): 14.8 /C116.4) for non-pregnant women, 17.0% (16.1 /C118.0) for men and 30.1% (28.5 /C131.7) for pregnant women. At 12 months, and HF, attrition risk was 63% higher among pregnant women and 16% higher among men, compared to non-pregnant women (p B0.001). Significant protective factors included: HIV-positive household member (HR: 0.80, p B0.05); living in the same commune as the HF (HR: 0.94, p B0.05), and greater duration of pre-ART enrolment (HR: 0.99 for each 30-day increase, p B0.001). Conclusions : Following adoption of Option B /C27, ART attrition in Haiti was higher than that described in published reports from other resource-limited settings. Early, sustained and tailored interventions are urgently needed to reduce ART attrition in Haiti, particularlyamong pregnant women. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20391 TUAD0205 Evaluation of early experience implementing Option B/C27in the northwest and southwest regions of Cameroon.2Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Services, Mutengene, Cameroon.3Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health/U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Allan Rosenfield Global Health Fellowship, Washington, DC, United States. 4U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Yaounde, Cameroon.5U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States.6Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Washington, DC, United States.7District Health Service, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Kumba, Cameroon. 8District Health Service, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Bamenda, Cameroon.9QED Group, LLC, Washington, DC, United States.Presenting author email: piustih@cbchealthservices.org Introduction : The Cameroon Ministry of Public Health began imple- mentation of life-long antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women (Option B /C27) in 2013.

Results will guide subsequent phases of the national rollout.Methods : From October, 2013, to June, 2014, we recruited partici- pants from 22 purposefully selected health facilities in the Northwest and Southwest Regions for an observational cohort evaluation.HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women, not currently onantiretrovirals (prophylaxis or treatment), were eligible to participate in the assessment. Option B /C27was offered to all eligible participants, and a descriptive analysis was performed.Results : Of 1267 HIV-positive pregnant or breastfeeding women identified, 669 (53%) were eligible for the evaluation. Of those who were offered Option B /C27, 666 (99%) accepted life-long ART and 3 (B1%) accepted ART only during pregnancy and breastfeeding. As of October 2014, 569 (85%) women remained alive and on treatment; 8 (1.2%) died, 17 (3%) discontinued ART and 34 (5%) were lost to follow-up (LTFU). Fifty-six (8%) did not return for their first refill afterART initiation; this percentage varied from 2 to 8% between facilities.The six month retention for monthly cohorts of women initiating Option B /C27was 77 /C191% (Figure 1). Of 409 infants born to the 669 women enrolled, 8 (2%) died, 3 ( B1%) were LTFU. Four hundred and three (99%) received NVP prophylaxis within 72 hours of birth. Byeight weeks post-partum, 342 (89%) were tested for HIV deoxyr- ibonucleic-acid, 9 (3%) received a positive result. The remaining infants are not yet old enough for HIV status determination. All HIV-infected infants initiated ART. Conclusions : In Cameroon, Option B /C27is highly accepted by HIV- positive pregnant and breastfeeding women and can achieve a highsix month retention rate. Long-term retention, mortality and finalmother-to-child-transmission after cessation of breastfeeding need further evaluation. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20392 TUAD0206LB Improving early ANC attendance through community engagement and dialogue: project ACCLAIM in three African countries Mary Pat Kieffer1; Godfrey Woelk1,2; Daphne Mpofu3; Rebecca Cathcart1and ACCLAIM Study Group 1Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Washington, DC, United States.2Department of Health Behavior and Health Education, Gillings School of Global Public Health, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.3Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Mbabane, Swaziland.Presenting author email: mpkieffer@pedaids.org Introduction : Timing of first antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance in sub- Saharan Africa averages 24 /C125 weeks; however, to effectively prevent HIV transmission to infants, earlier ANC attendance and initiation of antiretroviral therapy are necessary.Advancing Community Level Action for Improving Maternal and ChildHealth (MCH)/Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission (PMTCT), known as ACCLAIM, a three-arm randomized trial in 45 clusters across Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe, aims to improveaccess, uptake and retention in MCH/PMTCT services.Methods : The study randomized clusters and evaluated three interventions: 1) community leader engagement (participation intheCommunity Leaders Institute , mentoring to engage in community action); 2) Community Days and dialogues (community event with structured dialogues on MNCH/PMTCT, and provision of healthservices) and 3) male and female MCH classes (set of four structuredsessions led by peer facilitators). This sub-study analyzed early ACCLAIM results on earlier access to ANC services. Baseline gestational age (GA) data at first ANC visitwere collected from health facilities before implementation andquarterly after implementation. We compared proportions of women attending ANC during first half of pregnancy ( 520 weeks' gestation) at baseline and 6 /C112 months after interventions. Results : A total of 277 trained community leaders held /C217000 community meetings and engaged /C2127,000 individuals in dialogues at Community Days, identifying and addressing barriers, mispercep-tions and harmful gender norms. The proportion of womenattending ANC 520 weeks' gestation across the three countries increased by 36% from baseline; this trend was significant across the quarters observed (p B0.0001). Attendance during the first trimester ( 512 weeks) also increased, from 11.7% (84/719) to 12.0% (97/809) (p B0.0001) in Zimbabwe (Uganda data not available). Community dialogues actively focusedon the benefits of early ANC and addressed norms of waiting until the woman ''shows'' before seeking ANC. Conclusions : In our study, community based interventions have resulted in significant greater than one-third increase in ANC 520 weeks' gestation in three African countries. On-going data analysis will provide data on the full potential of open community dialogues by trained community leaders to change community norms andhealth-seeking behaviours such as early access to ANC and MCH/PMTCT services. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20554 WE/C1WEDNESDAY WEAA0101 Comparison of HIV-1 envelope specific IgA and IgG antiviral ability to prevent HIV-1 infection: additive, inhibitory andsynergistic Robin J Shattock1 1Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. 2International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, London, United Kingdom. Presenting author email: s.okala12@imperial.ac.uk Introduction : Despite the crucial role of IgA in mucosal immunity, very little is known about how IgG and IgA isotypes interact toprevent HIV-1 infection. This gap in the current knowledge was highlighted in the HIV-1 RV144 vaccine trial in which specific monomeric (m)IgA mitigated IgG effectors functions and correlatedwith increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition. Both IgG and dimeric (d)IgAare present in the female and male genital tracts, which are the main Abstract TUAD0206LB /C1Table 1.

However, the ratio of IgG to IgA varies between compartments. In this study, we compared the antiviral properties ofIgG and IgA antibodies with the same epitope specificity at ratios found in genital secretions. Subsequently, we investigated whether the combination of antibody recognizing discrete epitopes but fromthe same isotype resulted in CH31, b12, 2F5 7B2 HIV-1 BaL gp140 Env and kinetics parameters of these interactions enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayand Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). HIV-1 BaLvirus panel of mAbs was quantified by p24 ELISA, antibody mediated viral aggregation (AMVA) was determined using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and neutralization activity by TZM-bl neutralizationassay. Results : We demonstrated that IgGs captured significantly more virions than IgAs, and this was correlated with higher association rateconstants whereas dIgA presented the ability to mediate viralaggregation. Strikingly, the combination of dIgA and IgG recognizing the same epitope did not elicit any additive effects. In contrast, IgG prevented dIgA binding to HIV-1 BaLgp140 Env and its ability to capture and aggregate HIV-1 BaLvirions. However, mixtures of IgGs or dIgAs recognizing distinct epitopes but from the same isotype resulted in synergistic effects with higher proportions of captured viruses; antibody mediated viral aggregates and neutralization activities.Conclusions : This study compared the ability of IgG and dIgA to prevent HIV-1 infection with respect to the ratio IgG and dIgA found in genital secretions. Collectively, these results suggest that thecombination of antibody targeting different epitopes providesenhanced general antiviral activities. Nonetheless, antibody binding to the same epitope but of different isotypes may lead to competition and inhibition of antiviral functions. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20393 WEAA0102 Anti-V3/glycan and anti-MPER neutralizing antibodies, but not anti-V2/glycan-site antibodies are strongly associated with higher anti-HIV-1 neutralization breadth and potency Dorfman1,21International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Cape Town, South Africa.2Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.3Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.Presenting author email: jeffrey.dorfman@icgeb.org Introduction : Previous candidate HIV vaccines have failed to either induce wide-coverage neutralizing antibodies or substantially pro- tecting vaccinees. Therefore, current efforts focus on novel ap-proaches never before successfully used in vaccine design, includingmodelling epitopes. Candidate immunogen models identified by broadly neutralizing antibodies include the membrane proximal eternal region and anti-V3/glycan antibodies are often autoreactive or polyreactive, and this is thought to pose both direct and indirectbarriers to achieving neutralization breadth. Recent evidence shows that antibodies with moderate neutralization breadth are frequently attainable, with 50% of sera from chronically-infected individualsneutralizing ]50% of a large, diverse set of viruses. Such moderately neutralizing antibodies may be more attainable in vaccinees. Despite these findings, there is little systematic information addressing which specificities are preferentially targeted among such commonly found,moderately broad neutralizing sera. Methods : We explored associations between neutralization breadth and potency and presence of neutralizing antibodies targeting MPER, V2/glycan site 177 antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected ( /C211 year) individuals recruited in Cape Town, South Africa.Results : Recognition of both MPER and V3/glycans was associated increased breadth and potency. 4.41, 5.20), viruses only 0.38 0.20, 0.45) than V2/glycan site-negative sera and no association between V2/glycan site recognition and breadth or potency was observed.

This suggests that the autoreactivity effect is not critical and that the MPER and the V3/glycans should remain high priorityvaccine candidates. The V2/glycan site result is surprising becausebroadly neutralizing antibodies to this site have been repeatedly observed. It may therefore be appropriate to focus on developing immunogens based upon the MPER and V3/glycans. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20394 WEAA0103 Impact of HLA-B*35 alleles on HIV disease outcome in Mexico and Central Valenzuela-Ponce1; Mesoamerican HIV Project Group 1Center for Research on Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Mexico City, Mexico.2Hospital Roosevelt, Guatemala City, Guatemala.3Instituto Conmemorativo Managua, Nicaragua.5HIV National Program, Tegucigalpa, Honduras. of Health, Belize, Belize. Introduction : HLA-B*35 alleles have[SL1] been classified into two groups, PY and Px, based on residues 114/116 in the HLA peptide binding groove, defining the amino acid preference at position 9 of the peptides they present. B*35:02/35:03, part of the Px group, havebeen associated with rapid HIV disease progression in the context ofHIV-1 B clade infection. As B*35 is the most prevalent HLA-B allelic group in Mexico and Central America (expressed in 41.4% of individuals), including a number of relatively unstudied B*35 alleles,we investigated HIV disease outcome in this cohort. Methods : HLA sequence-based typing was performed on 1971 chronically HIV-1 clade B infected, ART-na \u00a8ve individuals from Mexico (n/C301058), Guatemala (n /C30396), Nicaragua (n /C30218), Honduras (n/C30165), Panama (n /C3085) and Belize (n /C3049). Associations between HIV plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4 T cell count (CD4 count) with B*35 expression were evaluated using Mann /C1Whitney U-tests and Storey q values. Only HLA-B heterozygous individualswere compared in order to exclude confounding effects resulting from HLA homozygosity. Results : We observed 10 different B*35 alleles (n /C215). Based on residues 114 and 116, B*35:01/08/14/16/17/20/43 were classified as PY, and B*35:02/03/12 as Px. Ranking HLA-B*35 alleles according to median pVL or CD4 count showed a wide spectrum of associated HIVdisease outcomes. B*35:01 (PY) and B*35:12 (Px), which are notconsidered alleles, were associated with pVL and lower CD4 count (p B0.05, qB0.05). B*35:12 detrimental effect was stronger in Guatemala and Nicaragua than in Mexico, andthe magnitude of B*35:01 effect in each country was frequency-dependent. B*35:08 (PY) had a modest protective effect on disease outcome (although not statistically significant). No significant impact on median pVL or CD4 count was observed between HLA-B*35 PY(n/C30359) and Px (n /C30134) groups. Conclusions : These results challenge the B*35-PY/Px hypothesis, indicating that PY alleles can be disease-susceptible. Moreover, the previous observation that the negative effect of the B*35 group is dueto all Px alleles is not supported by these data. Interestingly, differ- ences in the detrimental effect of some B*35 alleles in different coun-tries seemed to be frequency-associated, warranting further studies on HIV adaptation in previously http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20395 WEAA0104 Type-1 programmed dendritic cells induce primary CTL capable of effectively targeting the HIV-1 reservoir Robbie B Mailiiard1; Kellie N Smith1; Paolo Piazza1; James I Mullins2,3 and Charles R Rinaldo1 1Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States.2Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.3Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.Presenting author email: rbm19@pitt.edu Introduction : The ''kick and kill'' strategy for the cure of chronic HIV-1 infection involves unmasking cells harbouring the latent viral reservoir followed by their immune elimination. We hypothesize that a broadpriming of de novo rather than memory HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) will be required to effectively target the autologous HIV-1 reservoir, and that this ''kill'' can be best achieved using specifically programmed type-1 dendritic cells (DC1).Methods : Mature, IL-12p70 producing DC1 were generated using a combination of either TNFa, IL-1b, poly IC, IFNa and IFNg or CD40L and IFNg. Mature, IL-12 deficient were using acombination IL-6 and PGE2 or CD40L alone. CD8 /C27T cells were purified from HIV-1 negative donors, and both naive (primary) and memory CD8/C27T cells were isolated from HIV-1 infected Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study participants who were onvirus-suppressive cART for several years. These cells were stimulatedwith autologous DC loaded with HIV-1 Gag peptides or autologous AT2-inactivated HIV-1. Resulting CTL activity was assessed Results : DC1 proved far superior to the IL-12-deficient DC for inducing primary CTL responses in both infected and uninfected donors.Importantly, DC1 required CD40L ''help'' at the onset of primingcultures for successful CTL induction and expansion. Both primary and memory CTL each responded to distinct autologous HIV-1 Gag peptides with robust IFN gproduction. However, a broader targeting of known MHC class I-restricted epitopes was achieved by the primaryCTL responders than the memory cells. Importantly, despite sub- stantial IFN gproduction by both T cell subsets, the primary CD8 /C27T cells were significantly superior to restimulated memory T cells ineradicated HIV-1 infected CD4 /C27T cells in the CTL assays. Conclusions : We demonstrate that na \u00a8ve T cells from HIV-1 infected persons on cART have the repertoire and ability to be primed by highIL-12p70-producing DC1 to effectively target the HIV-1 reservoir,while memory CTL responses are suboptimal. These findings high- light the importance of directing HIV-1 curative strategies towards the induction of de novo rather than memory HIV-1-specific CTL responses. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20396 WEAA0105 Molecular on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 691CHUM-Research Center, Montreal, Canada.2Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, University of Montreal,Montreal, Canada.

Presenting author email: delphine.planas@gmail.com Introduction : HIV-infected CD4 /C27T-cells integrin a47 and CCR9 mediate imprinting for gut-homing, and their expression is induced by retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin A metabolite produced by GALTdendritic cells. We previously demonstrated that CD4 /C27T-cells expressing the Th17 marker CCR6 are permissive to HIV in vitro , harbour replication-competent HIV reservoirs in ART-treated subjects and that RA selectively increases HIV replication in these cells. Toidentify new molecular determinants of HIV permissiveness/persis- tence, we performed CCR6 /C27versus CCR6- T-cells. Methods : CD4/C27T-cells were sorted from peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells by negative selection using magnetic beads (Miltenyi).Memory (BDAriaII). Cells were stimulated via CD3/CD28 and cultivated in the presence or absence of RA (10 nM) for four days.Total RNA was extracted for microarrays analysis 12v4 /C2146,000 probe performed by real-time PCR and/or HIV-DNAintegration was measured by nested real-time PCR. Functionalvalidations were performed using RNA interference Among 15,303 ''present calls,'' 1538 and 1285 CCR6- and CCR6 /C27T-cells, respectively (pB0.05; fold change cut-off 1.3). Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Ontology tools were used to identify pathways/individual transcripts specifically induced by RA in CCR6 /C27versus CCR6- T-cells. This signature included an increased markers (a4 b7, CCR9), HIV-1 coreceptors (CCR5, (CD38, and CCR6 /C27T-cells showed expres- HIV-1 resistance factors (PPAR-g, CCL3 and CCL3L1).Conclusions : Our studies demonstrate that RA-mediated imprinting for gut-homing is associated with HIV permissiveness in CCR6 /C27but not CCR6- T-cells and reveal molecular mechanisms underlying these differences. These findings will orient the discovery of new therapeu-tic strategies aimed at limiting HIV permissiveness, and subsequently the size of HIV reservoirs, specifically in gut-homing Th17 cells. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20397 WEAA0106LB The potential of attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis or BCG vaccines to enhance oral SIV acquisition in infantmacaques Kara Jensen1; Myra Grace Paris1 1Microbiology & Immunology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.2Frederick National Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical, Inc., Frederick, United States.3Albert Einstein Institute, New York, United States.4Rutgers New Jersey Medical School,Newark, United States.5CFAR, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States.6LSUHSC, Microbiology, Immunology, and Parasitology, New Orleans, United States.7CNPRC, UC Davis, Davis, United States. Presenting author email: abelk@med.unc.edu Introduction : Infants bear a high burden of HIV-1 and tuberculosis (TB) infections, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. We previously demon-strated that the double auxotroph Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strain mc engineered was safe and immunogenic in neonatal macaques. Here, we tested the efficacy of an oral mc26435 prime/intramuscular MVA-SIV boost regimen to protect against repeated low-dose oral SIVmac251 challenge in infant macaques. Methods : The study included 75 infant rhesus macaques. Mock- vaccinated infants (n /C3015) orally, or BCG (n /C307) intradermally at birth at nine weeks, infants were exposed to a once-weekly low-dose oral SIVmac- 251 challenge regimen. Plasma viraemia was determined by real-timePCR. Cellular immune activation was determined by flow cytometricanalysis in blood and tissues, soluble plasma markers were measured with a Procarta 37plex. Statistical analysis for risk-per-SIV exposure was determined by SAS and Kaplan-Meier plots; immune parameterswere analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis with multiple Dunn's comparison.Results : A single administration of the mc 26435 vaccine at birth induced persistent immune activation that was associated with oral SIV acquisition after fewer challenges compared to mock-vaccinatedinfants. The human BCG vaccine resulted in similar enhanced acquisition of SIV, and BCG-vaccinated infants showed higher peak viraemia compared to mock- and Mtb-vaccinated infant macaques. The potential for enhanced oral SIVacquisition was independent of themycobacterial vaccine strain, immunization route and boost regimen. Analysis of blood and tissue samples revealed that both Mtb and BCG vaccines induced immune activation of myeloid cell populations andCD4 /C27T cells, potential target cells of SIV. Immune activation was detected as early as three weeks post-vaccination and persisted for several months. Conclusions : Our results in the infant macaque model are consistent with BCG-induced immune activation of CD4/C27T cells in human infants, reports of persistent monocyte activation in BCG-vaccinated human adults, and increased HIV-1 infection rates in human CD4/C27T cells exposed to Mtb complex in vitro . Thus, in areas of high HIV-1 prevalence, TB vaccines need to be tested for their risk of enhancing HIV-1 susceptibility in human infants. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20555 WEAB0101 Long-term early antiretroviral therapy limits the HIV-1 reservoir size as compared to later treatment initiation but not to levels found in long-term non-progressors Eva Malatinkova1*; Ward Research Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University and GhentUniversity Hospital, Ghent, Belgium. 2Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free Hospital, London NW3 2QG, United Kingdom. 3AIDS Reference Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. author email: eva.malatinkova@ugent.be*equal contribution8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 70Introduction : Early initiation of long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) may lead to viral control after treatment discontinuation. Recent evidence indicates that ART initiated within seroconversion limits the HIV-1 reservoir size. Insight into the reservoir in patientswith different timings of ART as well as those who can control HIV-1without therapy should further inform new treatment strategies. Methods : A cross-sectional study of HIV-1 reservoir size (total and integrated HIV-1 DNA) and dynamics (2-LTR circles and cell-associated HIV-1 unspliced RNA (usRNA)) was performed in periph- eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 84 HIV-1 infected patients from four cohorts in two clinical centres (London, UK and Ghent, BE):long-term treated patients with ART initiated during seroconversion (SRCV on ART; n /C3025) or chronic /C3010). HIV-1 DNA, 2-LTR and usRNA were measured by ddPCR and integrated HIV-1 DNA byAlu-HIV PCR. Clinical parameters including time on ART and aviremia, CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio were collected. Results : Median total HIV-1 DNA copies were: 92, 48, 137 and 1901 c/10 6PBMCs in SRCV on ART, LTNP, Chronic ART and Recent SRCV, respectively. Significantly lower levels of total (p /C300.041) and inte- grated HIV-1 DNA (p /C300.003) were detected in early as compared to Abstract WEAB0101 /C1Figure 1.

Interestingly, similar levels ofintegrated HIV-1 DNA were found in Recent SRCV compared to the Chronic ART cohort (p /C300.104), confirming very fast seeding of the reservoir (Figure 1b). Levels of usRNA were significantly lower in earlycompared to chronically treated cohort (p /C300.007), indicating a lower transcriptional activity in early treated patients and similar to LTNP (p /C300.615). Furthermore, early treated patients exhibited a higher CD4/CD8 ratio as compared to chronically treated patients(p/C300.009), suggesting lower levels of residual immune activation. Conclusions : Our data demonstrate that long-term early treated pati- ents have smaller reservoir size as compared to patients treated during chronic infection, however not reaching levels found in LTNP . Inter-estingly, the reservoir dynamics in terms of 2-LTR and usRNA as well as the CD4/CD8 ratio in early treated patients are comparable to LTNP . http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20398 WEAB0102 High rates of non-reactive HIV serology after antiretroviral treatment initiated in acute HIV infection James L K Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, SEARCH, Bangkok, Thailand.2U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, United States.3Department of Retrovirology, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences /C1 United States Component, Bangkok, Thailand.4The Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok,Thailand. 5Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.6Henry M.

We examined the evolution of HIV antibody in a cohortof individuals treated during acute HIV infection (AHI).Methods : Between April 2009 and December 2014, adults attending voluntary HIV testing in Bangkok, Thailand, were screened for AHI, by either pooled nucleic acid testing (NAT) of 4th generation immunoas-say (4G IA) non-reactive samples or by 3rd (3G) or 2nd generation (2G)enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of 4G IA reactive samples. Immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART) was offered. Western blot and p24 quantification were performed for Fiebig staging. HIV serology atbaseline, weeks 12 and 24 were performed. Results : Two hundred and thirty-three Thai adults were enrolled from 130,164 samples screened; three individuals did not initiateART and were excluded from analysis. The median age of thevolunteers was 27 years, and 95% were male. Median time from history of HIV exposure to enrolment was 18 days, and median timefrom enrolment to ART initiation was one day. Of 207 baseline 2G EIA non-reactive subjects, results were available for 150 at week 12 and 135 at week 24 (Table 1). At week 12, 34% were non-reactive by2G, 3% by 3G and 39% 5% 3G and 18% /C21350 cells/ and Fiebig or 2 (p /C300.03) were predictive of non-reactive 2G EIA at week 24. Lower AUC 0/C124 week for HIV RNA was also associated with non- reactive 2G EIA at week 24 (p 50.001, Figure 1). Seroreversion was uncommon. One of 23 individuals with reactive 2G EIA at baselinewas non-reactive at week 24; 11 of 207 demonstrated transient 2GEIA reactivity at week 12. Conclusions : Approximately 40% of individuals who initiated treat- ment in AHI maintained non-reactivity to 2G EIA after 24 weeksof ART. Rapid ART initiation and HIV RNA decline as well as lowHIV RNA and high CD4 at baseline predicted subsequent sero- logical non-reactivity. HIV serologic non-reactivity is likely due to low viral burden, further supporting the benefits of early initiationof ART. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20399 WEAB0103 Twenty-four weeks is too short to assess virological success in primary HIV infection treatment Anne N (%) Baseline (N /C30207) Week 12 (N /C30150) Week 24 (N /C30135) 2nd generation EIA 207 (100) 51 (34)a53 (39)a 3rd generation EIA 99 (48) 5 (3)a7 (5)a 4th generation IA 43 (21) 30 (20) 24 (18) aMcNemar's test, p B0.001, compared to baseline (Note: no significant difference between week 12 and 24).

Plasma viral load by 2G EIA reactivity.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 72Introduction : The goal of HAART, in established HIV infection, is to ob- tain virological (plasma HIV-RNA level (pVL) B40 copies/mL) with CD4 increase at 24 weeks of treatment (W24). Therefore, we analyzed whether such W24 end-point is also pertinent for patients treated for primary HIV infection (PHI).Methods : We conducted a 10-year retrospective analysis of the immuno-virological response in 55 adults receiving HAART within three months after diagnosis of PHI. Genotypic resistance tests were performed before HAART and at W24 for patients with virologicalfailure (VF) as well as HAART plasma concentrations.Results : Patients were mostly men (n = 48, 87%), White European (n = 50, 91%), MSM (n = 29, 52%) and mean age 35.9 years. At baseline, mean pVL was 2.6.10 6cp/mL (8.103to/C21107) and mean CD4 count 479/mm3(77/C11003). Patients were mostly infected with subtype B HIV-1 (n = 30, 54%). Due to the evolution of treatment recommendations over the 10-year study period, nine differentcombinations of HAART were used, including mostly TDF/FTC (n = 38,69%) and a protease inhibitor as (n pVL (45 /C1391 cp/mL; mean: 155). In these latter patients, we observed neither mutation associated with resistancenor inefficient drug concentration. VF was correlated in univariate analysis with a significantly higher mean baseline pVL (p = 0.03) and a significantly lower mean baseline CD4 count (p = 0.04) than patientswith undetectable pVL at W24. There was no relationship between age, sex, ethnicity, source of contamination, HAART combination or VF at W24.Conclusions : Our results show that 24 weeks is too short to achieve virological success in patients with high pre-treatment pVL associated with low CD4 count. These data highlight that the usual W24 end- point to conclude virological success may not be appropriate in PHI. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20400 WEAB0104 HIV transmitted drug resistance declined from 2009 to 2014 among acutely infected MSM in Cross AIDS Research Center, SEARCH, Bangkok, Thailand. 2Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.3Armed Forces Research Institute for Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand. 4U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Bethesada, United States.5Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Center, Bangkok, Thailand. Presenting author email: doctordonn@gmail.comIntroduction : Rates of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) have been reported to be 11 /C121% in the USA and Europe, where baseline genotype resistance testing prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is routine. In resource limited settings, baseline resistance testing is not the standard of care, but TDR data can ensure that first-linetreatment regimens used in national HIV treatment programs remaineffective. Methods : The RV254/SEARCH010 cohort has enrolled patients with acute HIV infection from the largest HIV testing and counsellingcentre in Thailand, since 2009. Patients have baseline genotypetesting prior to initiating ART: TRUGENE HIV-1 (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Australia) was used for the first 66 patients and a validated in-house method for the remainder. Mutations werecategorized following the World Health Organization surveillance drug resistance mutation (SDRM) list. Prevalence of resistance was calculated by dividing the number of subjects with mutations by thenumber enrolled during each time period. Change in prevalence overtime was assessed by chi-square test for trend. Time periods were combined into two-year blocks for analysis. Results : Genotype resistance test results were available from 184 of the first 186 subjects enrolled in the study; virus from two patientscould not be amplified. Median age was 28 years, 95% were male and 92% were men who have sex with men (MSM). Median time (inter- quartile range, IQR) from HIV exposure to diagnosis was 18 (14 /C124) days. Median (IQR) HIV RNA was 5.7 (5.1 /C16.7) log 10copies/mL and was not significantly different between patients with and without resistance mutations. Median (IQR) CD4 was 352 (260 /C1486) cells/ mm3. Prevalence rates for resistance mutations are shown in the table. Overall TDR was 7.1%, declining from 12.5% in 2009 /C12011 to 4% in 2013/C12014, although the change was not statistically significance (p/C300.07). The mutations most commonly found were the M46I (n/C303), (n /C302), /C302). Conclusions : TDR does not appear to be increasing among MSM in Thailand and may be declining. Routine genotype testing prior to initiating ART may not currently be necessary in this population, butsurveillance for TDR should continue to monitor for any futurechanges. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20401 WEAC0101 Social cohesion among sex workers has an independent effect on reduced client condom refusal in a Canadiansetting Sexual Health Initiative, BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.2School of Population and Public Abstract WEAB0104 /C1Table 1.

Presenting author email: eargento@cfenet.ubc.ca Introduction : Despite substantial evidence in low and middle-income settings that community-led empowerment and collectivization can be a powerful determinant of successful HIV prevention, there is limited understanding of the impact of connectedness among sexworkers on HIV risk in the global north. This study longitudinallymodelled the impact of social cohesion on client condom refusal among street and off-street sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. Methods : Longitudinal data were drawn from an open prospective cohort of female (trans*-inclusive) sex workers, AESHA (An Evalua-tion of Sex Workers Health Access), in Metro Vancouver (2010 /C1 2013). Participants were recruited through outreach to outdoor locations and hidden indoor and online venues and completed bi-annual interview questionnaires and HIV/STI testing by a project nurse. Lippman and colleagues' Social Cohesion Scale measured community connectedness (i.e. perception of mutual aid, trust andsupport) among sex workers. Bivariable and multivariable logisticregression using generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the independent effect of social cohesion on client condom refusal over three-year follow-up.Results : Of 654 sex workers, one-third (n /C30221) reported client condom refusal over three-year follow-up. On average, a medium level of social cohesion was reported; median social cohesion scores were 24 (IQR 20 /C129, range /C304/C145). In the final multivariable confounder model, for every one point increase in the social cohesion score, the odds of client condom refusal decreased by 3%, (adjusted odds ratio/C300.97; 95% CI: 0.95 /C10.99) after adjusting for age, injection drug use and place of solicitation.Conclusions : This is the first study to examine the independent effect of social cohesion on client condom refusal among sex workers in the global north. Findings suggest that community collectivization andsex worker-led empowerment efforts can have a direct protectiveeffect on HIV risk reduction and shifting social norms among clients in the sex industry. Given public health and human rights concerns around new Canadian laws introduced this year to further criminalizesex workers' ability to work together (C-36), these findings highlightthe urgent need for legal reforms and a structural framework that better promotes sex workers' ability to more formally collectivize, including sex worker-led efforts in the HIV response. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20402 WEAC0102 Understanding the financial lives of female sex workers: implications for economic strengthening interventions forHIV prevention Emily 360, Durham, United States. 2Independent Consultant, Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire.3Economic Development & Livelihoods, FHI 360, Washington, DC, United States.Presenting author email: enamey@fhi360.org Introduction : Many women's decisions about whether and how to participate in sex work are driven by financial considerations. Despite the importance of economic factors in structural interventions forHIV prevention, data on the financial practices of female sex workers (FSWs) on which to base economic strengthening programs for HIV risk reduction are limited.Methods : We collected qualitative data in Abidjan, Co te d'Ivoire, through structured participant observation activities conducted with72 FSWs during non-working hours. Detailed notes were taken as FSWs discussed their expenditures, income-generation and savingand borrowing strategies. We also collected quantitative financial diary data from a sub-sample (n /C3033) of FSWs. Women who kept fi- nancial diaries did so for six weeks, meeting weekly with researchersto systematically discuss and record all financial transactions. Partici-pant observation notes were coded and analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Data from financial diaries were analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results : All women in our sample reported sex work as their primary source of income; many supplemented their income with cash gifts and modest loans from clients, family or peer FSWs. Food, clothing and transportation accounted for the highest amounts of relatively-fixed spending. Around one-quarter of all expenses were related to costs of sex work (e.g. ''work'' clothing, beauty care, personal hygiene products, right to work payments, police pay-offs, etc.). Qualitatively,both income and expenditures were reported to fluctuate monthly(e.g. around pay day), seasonally (e.g. around holidays) and unexpectedly (e.g. illness or financial shocks). FSWs described saving money in their homes, through social tontines or through formalsystems (mobile money or banks), to help manage expenditures.They also reported increasing their sex work activities (e.g. traveling to other areas, offering sex for goods) to bridge financial shortfalls. Conclusions : Economic strengthening interventions have, in theory, great potential to lower FSWs' risks of HIV by lessening the financial drivers of sex work. Our findings offer a rare glimpse into the earning, spending, saving and borrowing practices of FSWs, providing evidenceon which to base decisions about how best to design and implementeconomic strengthening elements of HIV prevention for FSWs. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20403 WEAC0103 High utilization of health services and low ART uptake among female sex workers (FSW) in three South African cities: results from the South Africa health monitoring study(SAHMS-FSW) Tim Lane1; Maria Sibanyoni2; Albert Venter2 1Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco, United States.2Wits Reproductive Health & HIV Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa.3Anova Health Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa.4Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco, United States.Presenting author email: tim.lane@ucsf.edu Introduction : The 2012 /C12016 South Africa HIV National Strategic Plan calls for integrated behavioural and biological surveillance withfemale sex workers (FSW) to address critical HIV epidemiological andprogrammatic data gaps. In 2013 /C12014, we conducted the SAHMS- FSW in three metropolitan areas to estimate prevalence of HIV, syphilis and associated risk factors and assess current utilization ofhealth and HIV services.Methods : We recruited 764 FSW in Johannesburg, 650 in Cape Town and 766 in Durban using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to take behavioural surveys, access voluntary counselling and testing andprovide blood samples for HIV and syphilis surveillance. Serologicaltesting followed national standards. We used RDSAT (version 7.1) to estimate population-adjusted prevalence for HIV, syphilis, selected behavioural and programmatic indicators; logistic regressions with selected RDS-adjusted behavioural and programmatic indicators to identify site-specific significant associations with HIV-infection. We report adjustedodds ratios (aOR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) in8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 74Table 1: Predictors of HIV /C1South African Health Monitoring Study, 2014, and current ART utilization in Figure 1. Results : HIV prevalence was 71.8% (95% CI 37.5 /C165.5%) in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban respectively. After controlling for age, consistent condom use and hazardous drinking, brothel-based FSW had significantly higher odds of HIV-infection in Cape Town (aOR 2.1,95% CI 1.5 /C13.1) and Durban (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4 /C13.9); those working both brothels and streets in Johannesburg were more likely to be HIV-positive (3.0, 95% CI 1.2 /C17.9). Those accessing healthcare in Johannesburg and Durban (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 /C11.6 and 1.3, 95% CI 1.1/C11.4, respectively) and ANC services in Cape Town and Durban (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 /C12.4 and 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 /C13.0, respectively) were significantly more likely to be HIV-positive. However, uptake of ARTremains low among FSW. Conclusions : Although FSW accessing healthcare services are more likely to be HIV-positive, current ART utilization demonstrates a substantial gap to be addressed as South Africa begins implementinguniversal treatment. Identification and expansion of effective out-reach models are needed to increase utilization of ART, as well as effectively target prevention services for HIV-negative FSW. Health outreach strategies must account for behavioural andstructural factors in specific sex-work environments. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20404WEAC0104 Closing the gap: integrating mobile HIV testing and point-of- care CD4 testing for timely identification of HIV-infectedand ART-eligible Powers1; Irving F Hoffman1,2and William C Miller1 1University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States. 2UNC Project, Lilongwe, Malawi.3Theatre for a Change, Lilongwe, Malawi.Presenting author email: klanc@unc.edu Introduction : Female sex workers (FSW) are a hard-to-reach key population in sub-Saharan Africa with high HIV prevalence, infrequent access to HIV care services, and low uptake of antiretroviral therapy(ART).

Eligibility forART followed the Malawi (CD4 5500 cells/mm 3, currently pregnant or breastfeeding, or any pregnancy after July 2011 following Option B /C27policy). Proportions were estimated for HIV seroprevalence, self-reported previous HIV diagnosis, ART-eligibilitybased on national guidelines, and self-reported ART use. Results : HIV seroprevalence was 69% (n /C30138); 20% (n /C3027) were newly diagnosed, and 80% (n /C30111) were previously diagnosed. Among those newly diagnosed, 63% (n /C3017) were identified as ART- eligible (median CD4: 305; IQR: 237 /C1427). Among those who were previously diagnosed, 65% (n /C3072) were currently on ART, 22% (n /C3024) w e r ec u r r e n t l yA R T - e l i g i b l eb u tn o to nA R T( m e d i a nC D 4 :3 9 1 ;I Q R :2 6 1 /C1 474) and 13% (n /C3015) were ART-ineligible and not on ART. The most commonly reported reason among previously diagnosed and ART-eligible FSW for not being on ART was a prior high CD4 count (17%; n /C304). Conclusions : This study is one of the first to integrate mobile HIV and POC CD4 testing to identify HIV-infected and ART-eligible venue-based FSW in The majority diagnosed FSW were imme- diately identified as ART-eligible. A substantial proportion of pre-viously diagnosed FSW were ART-eligible but not on ART, with manyhaving a prior high CD4 count. Large-scale integration of frequent HIV and POC CD4 testing for timely identification of HIV-infected and ART-eligible FSW is urgently needed to improve health outcomes forFSW and decrease HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20405 WEAC0105 Injection drug use among female sex workers in Iran: findings of the first national bio-behavioural study Abbas 1Ministry Health and Medical Education, Center for Diseases Control, HIV/STIs Office, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of Iran. 2Regional Knowledge Hub and WHO Collaborating Center for HIV Surveillance, Institute for Future Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran, Islamic Republic of Iran.Presenting author email: abased@gmail.com Introduction : While the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers (FSW) in Iran is approximately 4.5%, FSW who have ever injected drugs are believed to have a significantly higher HIV prevalence. Thisstudy tries to assess the determinants of injection drug use amongFSW through Iran's first and only national bio-behavioural surveil- lance survey. Methods : This survey was conducted in 2010, by recruiting 827 FSW through facility-based sampling from 21 sites in 14 cities in Iran. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a pilot-testedstandardized risk assessment questionnaire. All analyses were weighted based on the response rate and adjusted for the clusteringeffect of the sampling sites. A predictive multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to investigate the determinants of injection drug use among FSW in Iran.Results : Mean age of participants was 32, 50% had primary school educations, 36% were married and most of them reported sex work as their primary source of income. Of all participants, 71.6% (95% CI: 68.5 /C1 74.6) 14.6% (95% CI: 12.2 /C116.9) had ever injected drugs. The most frequently injected drugs were methadone,crystal methamphetamine and crack. Among those who had ever injected drugs, 36.6% reported that they had a drug injection during the previous month and the prevalence of HIV was 11.2% (95% CI: 5.4 /C1 21.5). In the HIV testing (AOR /C301.79, 95% 95% CI: 1.04 /C1 1.12), drug use past month (AOR /C302.70, 95% CI: 1.79 /C1 4.10) and alcohol the past month (AOR /C302.07, 95% CI: 1.35/C13.17) were significant predictors of injection drug use. Conclusions : The prevalence of injection drug use among FSWs in Iran is concerning which calls for special attention to be paid to FSWswho inject drugs. As selling sex to cover drug habit expenses is alikely practice among female drug users, a part of harm reduction programs for drug users should try to target this population in order to reduce their sex work practices. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20406 WEAC0106LB Engagement in the HIV care cascade and predictors of uptake of antiretroviral therapy among female sex workersin Port Elizabeth, South Africa Sheree 1Epidemiology, Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.2TB/HIV Care Association, Cape Town, South Africa.3HIV/AIDS, STIs and TB (HAST), Human Sciences Research Council, Port Elizabeth, South Africa. 4Epidemiology, Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, United States.5TB/HIV Care Association, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.Presenting author email: sschwartz@jhu.edu Introduction: Female sex workers (FSW) are 13-times more likely to be living with HIV than other reproductive-aged women. Data onFSW engagement in the HIV care cascade are limited, but suggesthigh rates of drop-off prior to viral suppression, with substantial drop-offs at HIV diagnosis. Abstract WEAC0106LB /C1Figure 1. Engagement of South African FSW in the HIV care cascade.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 76Methods: FSW]18 years were recruited through respondent driven sampling into a cross-sectional study in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.Socio-demographics, reproductive, behavioural and healthcare his-tory were assessed through interview-administered questionnaires. All FSW were tested for HIV, and CD4 counts were assessed among women living with HIV. Engagement in the HIV care cascade isdescribed, and predictors of self-reported antiretroviral therapy(ART) uptake among treatment-eligible, previously diagnosed FSW were estimated using robust Poisson regression. As ART eligibility thresholds changed from 5350 to5500 cells/mm 3during the study period, eligibility was determined based on CD4 count and currentguidelines at time of study participation. Results: Between October 2014 and April 2015, 410 FSW partici- pated in study activities. Overall, 261/410 (63.7%) were living withHIV. Prior history of HIV testing and diagnosis were relatively high (/C2180%), however, self-reported ART coverage among HIV-positive FSW was just 39% (Figure 1).After adjusting for time since HIV diagnosis, women who hadintimate partners and had not disclosed their HIV status to them were over 50% less likely to be on ART than FSW not in relationships (Table 1). Mothers and women with fewer clients per month werealso statistically significantly less likely to be on treatment than non-mothers or FSW with more clients in the adjusted analyses. Among treatment eligible FSW not on ART, 16/61 (26.2%) had previously been initiated but were no longer taking ART.Conclusions : HIV testing was common among FSW in this setting, and awareness of HIV status was relatively high, however, efforts are needed to improve ART uptake and retention in this population.Though viral suppression data were not available, this likelyrepresents additional fall-out from the care cascade. Disclosure to partners and family appear to be key barriers to treatment uptake. Building HIV disclosure skills and efficacy may help to improve healthoutcomes for FSW living with HIV and prevent onward transmission. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20556 WEAD0101 Community-based adherence clubs improve outcomes for stable antiretroviral therapy patients: findings fromGugulethu, South Biostatistics, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.2Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.3Gugulethu Community Health Centre, Provincial Government of the Western Cape, Cape Town,South Africa.4The Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.Presenting author email: agrimsrud@gmail.com Introduction : There are few data on patient outcomes from community-based models to deliver antiretroviral therapy (ART), with previous research focused on models for home-based delivery.We describe outcomes of ART patients decentralized to community-based adherence clubs (CACs) and compare outcomes with patients managed within a facility-based model. Methods : This analysis included 8150 adults initiating ART from 2002 /C1 2012 at a public sector clinic in Gugulethu, South Africa, followed untilthe end of 2013. From June 2012, stable patients (ART /C2112 months, suppressed viral load) were referred to CACs. Kaplan-Meier methods estimated time to outcomes among CACs stratified by gender and age(youth: 15 /C124 years of age and older patients: /C2125 years of age). Long-term follow-up (LTFU) was compared between CACs and facility- based care using proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates and inverse probability weights of CAC participation.Results : Of the 2113 patients (68.8% female, 7.4% youth) decen- tralized to a CAC, 94% were retained on ART after 12-months. After the first CAC visit, LTFU among CAC patients was 5.6 and 6.4% at 12-months (Figure 1a) and viral rebound 2.2 and 1.5% (Figure 1c), for menand women, respectively. LTFU was higher in CACs among youth compared to older patients (Figure 1b). Youth were twice as likely to be LTFU ((adjusted hazard ratio) aHR: 2.17, 95% CI 1.26 /C13.73) experience viral rebound (aHR 2.24, 95% CI 1.00 /C15.04) in a CAC compared to older patients. Overall, CAC participation reduced LTFU by 67% (aHR: 0.33, 95% CI 0.27 /C10.40) compared to facility-based care, and this reduction persisted when stratified by patient demographicand clinic characteristics. Patients initiating ART most recently, in 2010 or 2011, had a 90% reduction in LTFU in a CAC compared to facility- based care (95% CI 0.05 /C10.21).Youth were the only sub-set of patients that did not have a significant decrease in risk of LTFU in CACs compa-red to the community health centre (CHC) (aHR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37 /C11.22). Conclusions : Community-based Adherence Clubs appear to be associated with a decreased risk of LTFU compared to facility-basedcare. More research is needed on how to expand the role ofcommunity-based ART services and what components of these delivery models support long-term retention. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20407 WEAD0102 Sustained viral suppression in persons living with HIV/AIDS receiving HAART in Peru p-valueAdjusted days 0 /C110 REF 0.074 REF 11 or more 1.24 [0.98 /C11.57] 1.29 [1.02 /C11.63] 0.032 Partnership non-paying intimate partner REF /C1 REF /C1 Disclosed to some 0.219 0.86 assessed age, race, education, mobility, violence and depression.

Patients with undetectable HIV-RNA levels have a significantly lower risk of clinical disease progression. Andat community level viral suppression is important to reduce HIVtransmission and the emergence of resistant strains. The study aimed to analyze the frequency and duration of viral suppression (VS) in the first cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) under treatment.Methods : We retrospectively evaluated data from all PLWHA unin- sured adults who initiated HAART through the National Program during 2004 /C12006 and followed-up until 2012. Patients with com- plete records in the National Laboratory Reporting System Data Basewere included. The duration of VS was analyzed using survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) in PLWHA who achieved viral suppression. Survival time was measured between the first control with viral load 5400 copies/ml until the presence of first interruption or failure of viral sup-pression (FSV) with viral load /C21400 copies/ml. Persons lost to follow up and those without FSV were censored. R Software 3.0.3.was used. Results : During the study period a total of 6289 PLWHA had access to health care settings for initial evaluation and only 5142 receivedHAART. Of these, 4530(88%) achieved VS for variable time (respon-ders) and 612 never presented VS (non-responders). Cumulative survival rate was analyzed in responders: 91.1% maintained VS up toone year, 84.6% up to two years, 80.2% to three years, 77.1% to four years, 74.1% to five years and 70.1% to six years. According to survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves presented lower duration ofVS in young adult patients, females, persons in prisons and thosewho did not increase their CD4 above baseline. No differences were observed with baseline CD4 and viral load (p B0.05). Conclusions : This findings suggest that SVS as a programme indicator is feasible and useful for monitoring health care settings and rankingthem like a control quality measure. SVS could also be included as another parameter in cascade of treatment measures. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20408 WEAD0103 Entry into care following universal home-based HIV testing in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: the (ISPED), Bordeaux, France.

Presenting author email: melanie.plazy@isped.u-bordeaux2.fr Introduction : In a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) strategy, entry into care soon after HIV diagnosis is crucial to achieve optimal popula-tion-antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage. We evaluated the rate of, and factors associated with, entry into care following home-based HIV testing in a cluster-randomized trial of the effect of immediateART on HIV incidence in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Methods : From March 2012 to May 2014, individuals ]16 years in ten (2/C295) clusters were offered home-based HIV testing; those ascertained HIV-positive were referred to TasP trial clinics and wereoffered universal and immediate ART (intervention clusters) oraccording to national guidelines (control clusters). Entry into care was defined as attending a TasP clinic within three months of referral among adults not actively in HIV care (no visit to local HIVprogramme within past 13 months). Associated factors were identified separately by sex, using multivariable logistic regression. Results : Overall, 1205 adults (72.6% women) not actively in HIV care were referred to a TasP clinic. Of these, 405 (33.6%) attended a TasPclinic within three months (no difference between trial arms): 32.5% of women, 36.7% of men. Participants who ever visited the local HIV programme (n /C30360) were more likely to enter into care than those who didn't (women: adjusted odd-ratio (1.18 /C13.64)). In women (n /C30875), those less likely to attend a TasP clinic within three months had completed some secondary school (0.51 (0.33 /C10.79)) or at least secondary school (0.47 (0.29 /C10.76)) versus below primary school; were living 1 /C12 km from a TasP clinic (0.30 /C10.62)) km; didn't know HIV /C27within their family (0.60 (0.43 /C10.81)) and didn't agree that it is good to initiate ART as soon as possible if infected (0.47 (0.26 /C10.85)); among men (n /C30330), none of the factors examined was significantly associated with entry into care.Conclusions : Only one-third of HIV-positive adults referred after home-based HIV testing entered into care within three months in this rural South African community with a 30% HIV prevalence.Innovative interventions should be considered to ensure the success of a UTT strategy. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20409 WEAD0104 Assessing the HIV care continuum in The Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet): progress in clinical retention, cART use and viralsuppression Peter F Rebeiro1; Carina Cesar2; C McGowan1and Pedro Cahn2 1School of Medicine, Vanderbilt Nutricio von Lima, Peru. Presenting author email: p.rebeiro@vanderbilt.edu Introduction : Retention, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) use and viral suppression are key stages in the HIV Care Continuum associated with delayed disease progression and reduced transmis- sion. We assessed trends in these indicators within the large anddiverse CCASAnet cohort over a decade.Methods : Adults from CCASAnet clinical cohorts in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico and Peru contributed data from first visit between 2003 and 2012 until final visit, death, or the end of2012. Retention was ]2 HIV care visits in a year, /C2190 days apart. cART use was prescription of a regimen of ]3 active antiretroviral agents in a year. Viral suppression was HIV-1 RNA B200 copies/mL at last measurement in the year. cART use and viral suppressiondenominators were subjects with ]1 visit in the year. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were used to assess temporal trends and predict percentages meeting each indicator in each year,adjusting for age, sex, HIV transmission mode, cohort, calendar yearand total time in care. Results : Among 18,799 individuals contributing to retention ana- lyses, 14,380 to cART use analyses and 13,330 to viral suppression Abstract WEAD0104 /C1Table 1.

There were significant improvements in the indicators from 2003 to 2012: from 63 to 80% retained, 74 to 91% using cART, and 53 to 82%virally suppressed (p B0.05, each). Predicted values from adjusted models revealed similar trends (Figure 1). Female sex (risk ratio (RR) /C300.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 0.99 vs. males) and injection drug use (IDU) as HIV transmissionmode (RR /C300.84; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.94 vs. male sexual contact with males (MSM)) were associated with lower retention, but unrelated with cART use or viral suppression. MSM transmission (RR /C300.96; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99) decreased probability of cART use versusheterosexual transmission. Conclusions : HIV Care Continuum outcomes have improved over time. However, efforts must be made to improve retention, parti-cularly among females and IDUs, and cART use must be improvedamong MSM. Additional research is needed to sustain progress by identifying impediments to achieving positive Care Continuum outcomes, and their causes, in these settings. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20410 WEAD0105LB Providing same day, observed ART to newly diagnosed HIV/C27outpatients is associated with improved virologic suppression Diane Havlir1 1HIV/AIDS Division, Medicine, UCSF, San Francisco, United States. 2Tulane University Medical School, New Orleans, United States. Presenting author email: cpilcher@php.ucsf.eduIntroduction : Despite known clinical and prevention benefits, ART is typically delayed by weeks-to-months after HIV diagnosis to allow linkage to care, HIV education, social stabilization and laboratory evaluation. The UCSF/San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) RAPIDprogramme aimed to eliminate this delay by providing same-day/observed ART even as HIV care was being established. We investigated consequences of the RAPID treatment initiation strategy. Methods : RAPID eligibility included new HIV diagnosis with acute/ recent infection, active opportunistic infection or CD4 B200/mm 3.A t referral, all RAPID-eligible or -ineligible patients with new diagnosisreceived a standard package of multidisciplinary services for social support, education, risk and stigma reduction; labs were drawn; and regular provider follow-up was arranged. The RAPID interventionconsisted of 1) same-day access to an on-call provider; 2) a five-day ART supply facilitated by and 3) an accelerated process for insurance benefits.

Results : We studied 227 newly diagnosed outpatients receiving RAPID (n /C3039), universal (n /C30149) or CD4-guided (n /C3039) ART. No patients had private to VL B200 cp/mL was significantly faster in RAPID patients versus both contemporaneous and historical controls(pB0.001; see Figure). Median (IQR) time to VL B200 for RAPID ART was 56(40 /C187) days versus 119(58 /C1201) days for universal and 283(128 /C1777) days for CD4-guided ART. After three months of ART, 75% RAPID versus 38% non-RAPID patients achieved a VL after patients achieved VL B200 cp/ mL. Among the first 39 patients receiving RAPID ART and followed for 5/C118 months, only two (5%) had toxicity-related regimen changes, none discontinued ART and 35 (90%) remain engaged in care.Conclusions : Combined with patient education and psychosocial support, same day-observed initiation of ART at the time of HIV diagnosis was feasible and associated with substantially faster sustained viral suppression. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20557 WEAD0201 Targeted HIV testing in home or clinic for older children of HIV-infected adults in care increases paediatric HIV testing rates and reveals high prevalence of previouslyundiagnosed HIV infection Anjuli Wagner1; John-Stewart5,6,7and Jennifer Slyker4 1Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.2Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.3Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.4Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.5Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.6Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.7Department ofMedicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. Presenting author email: anjuliwagner@gmail.com Introduction : Health systems offer infant HIV testing as part of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs, but are not built to systematically diagnose HIV infection in older children before symptomatic illness. Offering HIV-infected adultsattending HIV treatment programs targeted testing in home or clinic may increase early diagnosis of paediatric HIV. Methods : HIV-infected parents attending HIV care clinic at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) in Nairobi, Kenya were asked about their children's HIV status. Adults with untested children 512 years old chose to test children either at home (HBT) or in a clinic (CBT). Multinomial relative risk regression was used to identify cofactors of testing acceptance. Results : During the 9-month period when targeted testing was routinely offered, approximately four times as many children weretested per month as in the previous 10-month period (13.6 vs 3.5 per month, RR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.8 /C15.5). Among 116 enrolled adults, 23 (20%) chose HBT and had 46 childrentested, 48 (41%) chose CBT and had 58 children tested, and 45 (39%)did not complete testing. More adults chose CBT than HBT (p = 0.003), but more children were tested per adult by HBT (2.0 vs. 1.2, p B0.001). HIV prevalence among 104 tested children was 8% overall; six infected children were identified by CBT and two byHBT (median age: 8 years (IQR: 2 /C111)). Compared to adults who chose CBT, adults who chose HBT were more likely to have higher income, more education, be male, have apartner, have an unemployed partner and have a partner known to be HIV negative (p B0.05), while adults who did not test their children were more likely to have higher income and have a partnerwho was known to be HIV negative or of unknown HIV status(pB0.05). In multivariate analyses, income and partner status remained significantly associated with testing choice. Conclusions : Targeting HIV-infected parents in care increased the rate of paediatric testing and found high prevalence of paediatricHIV. CBT was preferred over HBT at this urban referral hospital. Efforts to increase paediatric HIV testing and to understand parental characteristics are important to provide timely diagnosis and linkageto care. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20411 Abstract WEAD0201 /C1Figure 1.

Presenting author email: tbandason@brti.co.zw Introduction : WHO recommends PITC to all in high-burden coun- tries. Symptom screening algorithms have been used widely forother diseases like tuberculosis. Prompt identification of undiag- nosed HIV infection remains a priority in Southern Africa. We previously proposed a simple algorithm where a child is asked torespond to any of the four questions, namely, whether child 1) has previously been admitted to hospital, 2) has had recurring skin problems,3) is a single or double orphan4) has experienced poor health in the past three months which can be asked by any cadre at primary care level for screening older children at risk of HIV infection and requiring an HIV test. Theobjective of this study was to validate the performance of thisalgorithm in a primary care setting. Methods : All previously untested children, aged 6 /C115 years attend- ing seven selected Primary Health Care Clinics of Harare, Zimbabwe,with parental/guardian consent were tested for HIV infection and asked to respond to four algorithm questions. Each positive response was scored as one.Results : A total of 6102 (74%) children with median age 9 (IQR: 7 to 11) years, 3138 (51%) of them male, consented to an HIV test. HIV prevalence was 4.8% (95% CI: 4.2 /C15.3) and positivity increased successively as the score increased with those who scored zero, 55/3830 (1%); scored one, 110/1609 (7%); scored two, 80/489(16%);scored three, 26/96 (27%); scored four, 10/16(63%). A child with a score of one or more had eight times odds (95% CI: 6/C111) of testing HIV positive with a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 75 /C1 85), specificity of 66% (95% CI: 64 /C167). Sensitivity was higher in those aged 10 years or more (86% vs. 70%, p = 0.001). Overall, we needed to test 11 children to identify one HIV positive.Conclusions : The algorithm maintained its integrity and demon- strated that it is a sensitive tool screening older children at risk ofHIV infection. The algorithm can be used by lower cadre healthcare workers and can help prioritize limited resources. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20412 WEAD0203 Impact of implementing ''Test and Treat'' policy on paediatric ART enrolments and coverage in Uganda 1STD/AIDS Control Program, Ministry of Health, Kampala, Uganda. 2School of Public Health, University of Texas, Houston, United States. 3Baylor College of Medicine Children's Foundation-Uganda, Kampala, Uganda.4Pharmacy Division, Ministry of Health/Management Sciences for Health, Kampala, Uganda.5Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), Kampala, Uganda.6CDC, Atlanta, Uganda.7Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), Boston, United States.8Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Pediatrics and Child Health, Kampala, Uganda. Presenting author email: eleanormagongo@gmail.com Introduction : In 2013, it was estimated that 193,500 of children under 15 years were living with HIV in Uganda and 83% would be eligible for treatment according to WHO guidelines; recommending lifelong treatment for all children under five years and all olderpatient based on clinical or immunologic staging. However, despiteefforts to scale up paediatric treatment, coverage remained low at 22% in 2013. Programmatic barriers to ART initiation in children include the perception that paediatric ART is complicated, unavail-ability of CD4 testing and difficulty in accurate clinical staging. InSeptember 2013, Uganda adopted a ''test and treat'' antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy for all HIV infected children under 15 years of age to simplify recommendations and remove programmatic barriersto ART initiation in children. Methods : The MOH launched and disseminated these guidelines to all stakeholders though three day health facility based trainings andmentoring during the period January to December 2014. To evaluatethe impact of this new policy a comparison was made between the number of children initiated between June and December 2013 and those initiated between January and June 2014.

Children 0 /C114 years newly initiated on Antiretroviral therapy (July 2013 to June 2014).8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 82Results : By December 2014, 1340 (84%) of 1600 ART providing health facilities and 17,238 health workers were trained on the newguidelines. There was 1.4-fold increase in the number of HIV infected children newly initiated on ART from 5540 in June /C1Dec 2013 to 9145 in Jan/C1June 2014. The increase was greater among children aged 5/C114 years and 2 /C14 years (2.4 and 1.4 fold, respectively); however, there was no change among the under two year old's ( see Figure 1). Pregnant adolescents constituted 2.5% (229/9145) of children less than 15 years of age enrolled on ART in Jan /C1June 2014. Paediatric ART coverage has increased from 22% (43,481/193,500) in December2013 to 27% (51,305/193,500) in June 2014. Conclusions : Expanding eligibility criteria increases initiation of older children on ART but to enrol those who are at higher risk of diseaseprogression/mortality, more work needs to be done to improve early infant diagnosis (EID) and early case detection. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20413 WEAD0204 Immunization practice and vaccine safety perception in centres caring for children with prenatally acquired HIV:results from the Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS survey Emma Concetta Manno1; and Infectious DPUO, University Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital ''Bambino Gesu'', Rome, of Children's Hospital, Guy's Sophia' Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece.8Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom. 9U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, United States.10Henry M.

For this high risk population it is important to design specific vaccine schedules to define correct dosing and to setaccurate correlates of protection. This survey was performed to givean overview of current vaccinations practice among paediatricians looking after vertically HIV-infected children. Methods : An online questionnaire regarding vaccination practices in HIV-infected children was completed by investigators from the PENTA network. Data were collected between November 2013 and March 2014.Results : A total of 88 experts in the management of paediatric HIV- infection from 46 different units looking after 2465 patients completed the questionnaire. The majority of units (72%) did not perform routine childhood immunizations in HIV centres. Vaccination histories wereincomplete for 40% of the studied population. Influenza, pneumo-coccal conjugate vaccine and human papilloma vaccine immunizations are widely administered (93, 89 and 83% of units, respectively). Varicella and Rotavirus vaccinations are less recommended (61 and24% of the units, respectively). Monitoring of vaccine responses is employed in 72% of centres. Serology appears to be the most feasible assay among the different centres (90%), mostly performed withimmune-enzymatic assays.Conclusions : Vaccination practices for perinatally HIV-infected chil- dren still vary widely between countries. A crucial issue is the in- complete adherence to varicella vaccine. Indeed only in few countriesvaricella vaccination is universally recommended for children atnational. More efforts should be made to standardize mandatory and recommended vaccinations, as well as to guide timing of serological assays. The majority of units carry out immuno-enzymatictests to evaluate specific antibody levels. However, methods vary withdifferent cut-offs of protection and units of measurement employed. Moreover, especially in high risk groups (e.g. children who started late HAART or performed vaccinations before treatment), researches onthe development of novel methods to assess protective immunity and accurate correlates of protection are needed. The ultimate goal will be to design individualized vaccine schedules, developed on therapeuticand immunological features of individual patients, optimizing thechances of them gaining robust long-term vaccine induced protection. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20414 WEAD0205LB Lower ANC attendance and PMTCT uptake in adolescent versus adult pregnant women in Kenya Keshet Ronen1,2; Christine Mcgrath3; and Grace John-Stewart2 1Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States. 2University of Washington, Seattle, United States.3University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, United States.4Centers for Disease8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 83Control and Prevention, Nairobi, Kenya.5Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.6Kenya Medical Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya. Presenting author email: kronen@fhcrc.org Introduction : Although rates of pregnancy and HIV infection are high among Kenyan adolescent women, their engagement in Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission (PMTCT) services is poorlycharacterized. We hypothesized that adolescent women show lower engagement in the PMTCT cascade than adult women, from antenatal care (ANC) attendance to HIV testing and antiretroviral(ARV) uptake.Methods : We conducted a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of mothers attending 120 maternal child health clinics selected by probability-proportionate-to-size-sampling in Kenya inJuly/C1December 2013, with a secondary survey oversampling HIV- positive mothers in 30 clinics. Self-report questionnaires verified by clinic booklets recorded ANC attendance, HIV testing, ARV use and maternal characteristics. Data were compared between adolescent(ageB20) and adult mothers. Differences in maternal characteristics were assessed by Chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to analyze ANC attendance and HIV testing among all women and ARVuptake among HIV-positive women.Results : Among 2521 mothers surveyed, 278 (12.8%) were adoles- cents. Adolescents were less likely than adults to have above primary education (25.0% vs. 42.9%, p B0.001), intended pregnancy (40.5% vs. 58.6%, p B0.001) and a current partner (73.1% vs. 90.9%, p B 0.001). Overall, 2471 (97.8%) reported attending ]1 ANC visit. Among 1859 women with verified ANC visits, 898 (44.7%) attended ]4 visits. Adolescents were less likely than adults to attend ]4 ANC visits (35.2% vs. 45.6%, OR[95% CI] /C300.65 [0.49 significant when adjusting for education, primigra- vida, pregnancy intention and 0.97]). Among 2359 women who attended ]1 ANC visit and were not known to be HIV-positive prior to pregnancy, 2298 (96.1%) received HIV testing during pregnancy. Testing rates were not significantly different between adolescents and adults. Among 288HIV-positive women who attended ]1 ANC visit and were not on HAART prior to pregnancy, 20 (6.9%) were adolescents, and 243 (84.4%) used any ARVs for PMTCT. Adolescents were less likely to use vs. 85.8%, OR[95% CI] /C300.31 [0.12 /C10.81]). Conclusions : Adolescent mothers showed poorer ANC attendance and lower uptake of ARVs for PMTCT. This calls for further study on barriers to ANC and PMTCT services among adolescent women and development of targeted interventions to improve uptake andretention of this vulnerable population through the PMTCT cascade. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20558 WEAD0301 Health resource use pattern analysis to inform targeted interventions alongside the HIV cascade of care andoptimize the effect of treatment as prevention for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.2Division of Aids, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.3Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada. Presenting author email: ekrebs@cfenet.ubc.ca Introduction : Identifying patterns of health resource utilization (HRU) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) can allow for comparisonof their effects on longer-term health outcomes and costs. Further, identification of patterns associated with greater risk of attrition between stages of the cascade of care can help in the development oftargeted interventions to effectively increase patient retention.Methods : We conducted a population-level analysis of HRU for indi- viduals having received a CD4 test after HIV diagnosis. All individuals18 years or older in British-Columbia in the modern HAART-era (post- September 2006) were included. Using linked comprehensive ad- ministrative health databases in a probabilistic model-based clus-tering analysis with 14 HRU measures, we estimated parameters bymaximum likelihood using the expectation maximization (EM) algo- rithm. Individuals with estimated parameters maximizing the prob- ability of belonging to a similar HRU cluster were classified with eachother, and the optimal number of clusters was estimated by theBayesian Information Criterion. The analysis was conducted across CD4 count stratification ( /C21200 cells/mm 3;B200 cells/mm3). Results : Our study included 941 individuals with at least one year follow-up (median age 40, 21% female) and with a CD4 count obtained between September 1st, 2006 and March 31st, 2011. Individuals with CD4B200 clustered in two HRU patterns. The high cost cluster (N/C3068; mean $18,169(SD$21,432)), driven by lengthy HIV-related emergency hospitalization stays (76.5% with /C217 days), had costs more than double the low cost cluster (N /C30147; $6811($13,592)). Individuals with CD4 /C21200 were best classified in four clusters. The high cost cluster (N /C3074; $15,831($19,180)) was characterized by non-HIV ER hospitalizations (100% ]1 day, 55.4% /C217 days) and high prevalence of mental health issues. The second highest cost cluster (N/C3060; $5058($5152)) was characterized by short-term non-HIV elective hospitalizations (48.3% /C301 day). The two lower cost clusters both had no hospitalizations; the higher (N /C30425; $3378($6454)) with much more frequent physician visits and medication use than thelowest cost cluster (N /C30167; $1291($7969)). Conclusions : Even within relatively homogeneous cohorts in terms of disease progress at time of linkage to HIV care, individuals were found to have heterogeneous HRU patterns. Identifying classes of individualsaccording to HRU can help inform clinical response, as well as thedesign of public health interventions to optimize HIV care. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20415 WEAD0302 Optimizing HIV/AIDS resources in Armenia: increasing ART investment and examining seasonal Physics, University Sydney, Australia.3Department of Mathematical SciencesUniversity of Copenhagen, Copenhagen,Denmark. 4National Center for AIDS Prevention, Yerevan, Armenia. Presenting author email: skelly@gmail.com Background : HIV prevalence is declining in all key affected popula- tions in Armenia (people who inject drugs, men who have sex withmen, prisoners and female sex workers); however, there are increases among labour groups who seasonally migrate to countries of higher HIV prevalence. We conducted a modelling study to assessthe impact of optimizing the national strategic plan to minimize HIVincidence and AIDS-related deaths by 2020. We determined optimal funding levels for all programs to best achieve the strategic plan and, in particular, examined the outcomes required for migrant programsto warrant increased funding.Methods : We used the Optima model to perform epidemiological and economic analyses. Demographic, epidemiological, behavioural and HIV programme cost data were obtained for Armenia from 2000to 2014 and used to inform the model. Through internal and external consultations, assumptions were generated on what coverage levels among targeted populations could be attained for different invest-ments, as well as their expected outcomes. A sensitivity analysis on8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Oral Abstracts 84migrant HIV testing and counselling programs was conducted around assumptions based on observed data.Results : According to Optima's optimization algorithm, shifts in funding allocations are required to minimize incidence and deaths by 2020. The largest emphasis should be on antiretroviral therapy (ART),as optimal allocations nearly doubled the investment in treatmentfrom 17 to 24% of the total budget. This is projected to avert almost 25% of new infections and 50% of AIDS-related deaths by 2020 compared to levels if 2013 spending were maintained. We show thatfunding for seasonal migrant programs should be maintainedthrough to 2020 at 5% of the total budget. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that these programs are cost-effective to fund if thecoverage threshold for HIV testing and counselling for seasonal migrants, as illustrated in Figure 1B, can be achieved. Conclusions : Optimization of HIV/AIDS investment in Armenia could significantly reduce HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths by 2020,particularly by focusing more on antiretroviral therapy. We have also identified thresholds for programme performance, prior to their scale-up, which can be used to evaluate whether they should bescaled-up or down in the future.

We evaluated the impact of a PBF programme implemented by Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Founda- tion (EGPAF), on the provision of HIV, PMTCT and MCH services. Wealso examined the temporal effects of PBF to better understand itslifecycle both in terms of onset and duration of effect. Finally, we evaluated the impact of PBF on non-incentivized services. Methods : The impacts of PBF in Gaza (South) and Nampula (North) provinces were analyzed using a retrospective observational studydesign in which PBF provinces were matched with control provinces Eighteen indicators related to HIV, PMTCT and MCH services were reviewed. Due to regional heterogeneity, we evaluated the Northand South as separate experiments. Beginning January 2011, up to eleven quarters of data from 134 PBF facilities after matching (84 North and 50 South) were used. Data sources include PBFprogramme data and health management information system data.Our econometric framework employed a multi-period, multi-group difference-in-difference model on data that was matched using propensity scoring. The regression design employed a generalizedlinear mixed model with both fixed and random effects, fitted usingthe seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) technique. Results : PBF resulted in positive impacts on MCH, PMTCT, and paediatric HIV programme outcomes. The majority of the 18 indicatorsresponded to PBF (77% North and 66% South), with at least half of the indicators demonstrating a statistically significant increase inaverage output of more than 50% relative to baseline. Most adult HIV (excluding pregnant women) initiation and retention indicators did not respond to PBF. On average, it took six quarters ofimplementation for PBF to take effect, and impact was generallysustained thereafter. Indicators were not sensitive to price, but rather inversely correlated to the level of effort associated with marginal output. No negative impacts on incentivized indicators norspill-over effects on non-incentivized indicators were observed.Conclusions : The PBF programme in Mozambique has shown to pro- duce large, sustained increases in the provision of PMTCT, paediatric HIV and MCH and should be considered as a powerful alternative totraditional input-based financing. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20417 WEAD0304 The estimated need of second-line antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa 2015 /C12030: mathematical Pra \u00a8ventivmedizin (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.2World Health Organisation, Geneva, Switzerland. Presenting author email: olivia.keiser@ispm.unibe.ch Introduction : At the end of 2013, about 300,000 patients were on second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. Theneed for second-line ART may increase substantially with increasingduration of patients on ART and roll-out of viral load monitoring. We aimed to estimate the need of second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa between 2015 and 2030 under various scenarios.Methods : We developed a mathematical simulation model of HIV progression on ART to project second-line needs up to 2030 for individual countries. The model allows the user to vary key input parameters, including annual numbers of patients starting ART, delay Abstract WEAD0304 /C1Table 1.

We applied the model to all countries in sub-SaharanAfrica assuming 12 scenarios that combine different future ART scale-up scenarios (accelerated until universal coverage; stable; no future scale-up), monitoring (routine viral load monitoring in all or only selected countries), and retention and switching (including orexcluding possibility of treatment drop-out and delayed switching). The input parameters were chosen to fit the numbers of patients on first- and second-line ART in 2005 /C12013 to observed estimates. Results : If the scale-up of ART is accelerated across the region, patients are retained in care, switching is immediate, and all countries implement routine viral load monitoring, the number of patients on second-line ART will increase to 4.1 million by 2030 (17% ofall patients on ART). In a scenario with a stable scale-up andrealistic drop-out and switching delay, the corresponding numbers were 2.8 million (15%) with universal routine viral load monitoring, and 2.2 million (12%) with routine viral load monitoring only in selectedcountries. Conclusions : We expect that by 2030, 2 /C13 million people will receive second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa, but the number of patients inneed may be over four million. Routine viral load monitoring, timelyswitching and minimizing treatment interruptions will further increase the number of patients on second-line ART. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20418 WEAD0305 Kenya private health sector HIV care services costing using the management accounting system for hospitalsframework Benson Chuma1; Sayaka Koseki2; Stephen Musau3; Ben Johns3and Agnes Associates, International Health, Nairobi, Kenya.2Abt Associates, Washington, United States.3Abt Associates, Washington, United States. Presenting author email: bensonchuma@gmail.com Introduction : The private sector is a key HIV service provider in Kenya, but few data on the cost of private service provision are available. The lack of cost data has inhibited the design ofreimbursement mechanisms and health insurance packages, as well as policy decisions on private sector financing. This study estimated unit costs for private sector HIV services disaggregated by facilitytype and level, as a contribution to ongoing efforts to implementhealth insurance products covering HIV services. Methods : Cost and service volume data were collected from 149 private sector facilities in 2013 as part of a nationwide systematicsampling of public and private healthcare costing study supported byGIZ, the USAID-funded Strengthening Health Outcomes Through the Private Sector (SHOPS) Project Kenya, and the Ministry of Health. The MASH (Management Accounting System for Hospitals) tool was usedto analyze data. Multiple facilities were eliminated due to lack of complete data with only 60 used. Results : Average unit costs per inpatient day and per outpatient visit were generated by sector and facility levels 2 /C14 (as defined by Kenya Norms and Standards 2006). HIV specific unit costs estimated included for HIV counselling and testing (HCT) services and provision of ART. The authors estimated operational costs, but were unable toestimate capital costs following lack of data. Average outpatient visitsranged from Ksh. 689 to 1036 in level 2 and level 4, respectively. ART visit costs ranged from Ksh. 1575 to 3660 across the facilities sampled. HCT visit services ranged from Ksh. 537 to 1151 across level2 and 4 facilities, respectively.Conclusions : The study contributed to health financing policy discussions in the provision and financing of HIV services in Kenya. Data generated was presented to insurers and providers who expressed intentions ofusing it for decision making. Possible applications include design of Abstract WEAD0304 /C1Figure 1.

Presenting author email: brian.honermann@amfar.org Introduction : A total of $29.5 billion has been allocated by PEPFAR from 2007 to 2014 through the annual country operational plan(COP) process. COPs serve as a planning tool for activities of USgovernment and in-country partners funded by PEPFAR. Historically, utilizing data from COPs has been difficult due to their inflexible PDF/ RTF format hindering the ability to query and manipulate data,create graphical representations of the financial data or identify trends in PEPFAR allocations over time. As PEPFAR moves towards greater civil society engagement during COPs' development, it isincreasingly important that COPs' data are readily accessible,categorizable and interpretable for civil society organizations (CSOs). Methods : Utilizing standard open source tools, amfAR /C1funded by MAC AIDS /C1created a navigable database and website of all allocation data contained in published COPs from 2007 through2014. Data are categorized and can be graphically represented and disaggregated by year, primary partner, host country, strategic area, budget code and organizational type of recipient. Text narratives ofindividual budgetary mechanisms captured directly from the COPs are also included in the database and provide users with detailed information for specific allocations. In addition, epidemiologicalprofiles and PEPFAR targets are available by country to provide context for the public health impact of investments.Results : From 2007 through 2014, $29.5 billion was allocated through the COPs process. By organizational type, the primary recipients of PEPFAR funds were NGOs ($8.3 billion), privatecontractors ($5.4 billion) and universities ($3.5 billion). Another $5.5 billion was not allocated to an identifiable partner or programme. Trends varied substantially by country. In Rwanda,resources shifted dramatically to Rwandan government agencies(from 7.6% of PEPFAR resources in 2011 to 34.2% of PEPFAR resources in 2013). Comparatively, PEPFAR 2013 host government funding was lower for Kenya (10.72%), Malawi (3.66%), Nigeria(2.64%) and South Africa (0.8%).Conclusions : amfAR's COPs database provides corresponding finan- cial and graphical information about progress towards country ownership and gives the most granular view to date of PEPFARbudgets. The database will be an invaluable tool to help CSOs and others digest and utilize PEPFAR budgetary information.

We collected longitudinal intrahost deep-sequence data and applied ancestral phylogenetic reconstruction methods to character- ize HIV transmission and evolution in this rare event.Methods : Pairwise genetic distances separating donor and recipient bulk plasma HIV gag, pol, nef andenv-V3 sequences were the lowest in the cohort (e.g. 0.0027 substitutions/nuc site in Gag vs. cohortmedian 0.06), identifying them as a putative transmission pair.The estimated transmission date (ETD), calculated as the midpoint of the recipient's last HIV-negative and first positive dates, was Aug/01. Donor plasma/Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and and deep-sequenced (Roche 454). BEASTand HyPhy were used to reconstruct phylogenies, estimate multi-plicity of infection and reconstruct transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses from plasma-derived deep sequences from donor and recipient. Results : Despite infection with the same X4 HIV strain, donor CD4 count was 20 cells/mm 3within 1.5 years of infection whereas the recipient's remained /C21270 cells/mm3. Donor/recipient plasma viral loads were comparable ( /C24.5 Log). All 10 ancestral reconstructions were consistent with transmission of a single X4 T/F virus betweenMay and August 2001. The estimated T/F virus sequence was identical to the co-dominant variant (36%) observed in the recipient's first ( /C275 month) timepoint. This sequence was also observed in 0.09% of donorplasma and 33.5% of PBMC at month /C281, suggesting minority variant transmission. In the donor, reversion of /C260% of the total plasma virus population to an R5 phenotype occurred by 50 months post- infection; in contrast, the recipient's dominant V3 sequence steadilydiversified over time but remained consistently X4. Conclusions : Results highlight the utility of phylogenetic reconstruc- tion applied to deep-sequence data to characterize T/F andintra-host evolution in transmission pairs. Differential CD4 depletionand V3 evolution in these individuals, despite acquisition of a near- identical X4 strain, underscores the critical role of host genetics on HIV evolution/pathogenesis. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20420 MOPDA0102 Genetic ancestry component proportions are \u00b4n1 1Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Mexico City, Mexico.2National Institute of Genomic Medicine, Mexico City, Mexico. Presenting author email: danni.garrido@gmail.com Introduction : Genetic stratification within specific populations may explain differences in HIV control. We explore the influence of gen- etic diversity on HIV disease progression in a cohort of mestizo individuals with different proportions of European (EUR), Amerindian(AMI) and African (AFR) genetic ancestry components.Methods : We estimated individual ancestry proportions in a cohort of 565 HIV clade-B infected, antiretroviral treatment-na \u00a8ve Mexican individuals using a panel of 128 ancestry informative markers. HLAalleles and KIR genes were genotyped for each participant in orderto control for already known associations with HIV control and to describe putative novel associations in different genetic context. Results : The mean ancestral component proportions in the study cohort were 0.594 AMI, 0.38 EUR and 0.026 AFR, as previously observed in Mexican mestizo populations. We observed a negative correlation between the proportion of AMI ancestry component(p/C300.0014) and a positive correlation between the proportion of EUR ancestry component (p /C300.0004) and CD4 T cell counts. To try to explain these observations, we evaluated differences in frequency and effects on CD4 T cell counts of specific HLA alleles, KIR genes orHLA-KIR combinations in EUR 60% vs. AMI 60% individuals. A*31:01,B*39:05, B*44:03 and C*07:02 showed protective effects in indivi- duals with high EUR component, but risk effects in individuals with high AMI component (p B0.05). Most KIR genes were more protective for EUR individuals than for AMI individuals. KIR /C27HLA- Bw4 combinations were more frequent in individuals with EUR component (p B0.05) while KIR /C27HLA-C1 combinations were more frequent in AMI individuals (p B0.05). Interestingly, the previously observed protective associations KIR3DS1/3DL1 /C27HLA-Bw4 80Illewere not evident, neither in the entire cohort, nor in EUR individuals. KIR2DS4 in combination with HLA-C1 seemed to be protective forindividuals with higher EUR component.Conclusions : This is the first time that differences in HIV disease pro- gression associated with genetic stratification are shown in a single population. Further studies involving fine stratification of geneticallydiverse populations, exploring expression of other genes involved in HIVcontrol are warranted to understand differences observed in this study. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20421 MOPDA0103 Dasatinib preserves SAMHD1 antiviral activity in CD4 treated with IL-7 Jose Alcami1; 2Institute of Human Genetics, Montpellier, France.3Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, United States.Presenting author email: ppalcami@isciii.esPOSTER ABSTRACTS8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 89Introduction : HIV-1 post-integration latency in quiescent CD4 /C27T cells is responsible for viral persistence despite antiretroviral treatment. Itwas proposed that the increase in proviral load in HIV-infected patients after IL-7 treatment was due to homeostatic proliferation of memory CD4 /C27T cells. We determined previously that IL-7 increased HIV-1 infection through phosphorylation and subsequent inactivationof the restriction factor SAMHD1. Now we analyzed SAMHD1 phosphorylation in PBMC from patients enrolled in ACTG 5214 study (NTC00099671), in order to elucidate the role of IL-7 in HIV-1 proviralintegration and persistence and whether this could be related toSAMHD1 inactivation. In addition, we determined that the tyrosine- kinase inhibitor Dasatinib preserved HIV-1 infection.Methods : PBMC samples obtained from 10 patients enrolled in ACTG 5214 study (NTC00099671), collected before (day 0) and 4 after administration of IL-7. PBMCs obtained from two patients diagnosedwith chronic on chronic treatment withDasatinib. Resting CD4 /C27T cells from healthy donors obtained by negative selection from PBMCs. Phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at T592 was determined by was by TaqMan qPCR. Dasatinib (BMS-354825,Sprycel) was by Bristol-Meyers 1) IL-7 (1 nM) induced SAMHD1 phosphorylation, interfering with its antiviral activity. 2) IL-7-mediated SAMHD1 phosphorylationgreatly increased HIV-1 infection in purified CD4 /C27T cells, increasing early and late retrotranscription, as well as proviral integration. 3) A significant increase in pSAMHD1 was observed in central memoryCD4/C27Tcells from HIV-infected patients treated IL-7 (ACTG completely SAMHD1 phosphorylation at nM, interfering with HIV-1 retrotranscription and consequently, with proviral integration. 5) CD4 /C27T cells from patients with CML treated with Dasatinib showed lower expression of SAMHD1 phosphorylated.Conclusions : By inducing phosphorylation, IL-7 increases susceptibility of resting CD4 /C27T lymphocytes to infection, leading to HIV persistence. SAMHD1 regulation plays a central role in theestablishment of HIV-1 reservoirs and represents a major target fortherapeutic intervention. Dasatinib is the first compound currently used in clinic that has been described to preserve the antiviral function of an innate factor such as SAMHD1. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20422 MOPDA0104 HIV-specific latency reversing therapies that Tat protein expression Damian Purcell1; the Peter Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.2The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia.3Peter Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia. Presenting author email: dfjp@unimelb.edu.au Introduction : We have identified a footprint of viral Tat expression in latent HIV infected cells. Suboptimal levels of Tat arise from an IRES- mediated translation of chimeric cell-HIV mRNAs that arise from alternative splicing of read-through mRNA transcripts from cellularpromoters adjacent to latent integrated provirus. To simulate the roleof RNA-processing pathways in HIV recapitulated the low Tat-expression from cellular-provirus read-through transcripts present in HIV latency reporter cells that express low-level Tat usingthe native IRES that underlies the first coding tat exon and a second, different Click-Beetle-Luciferase, expressed from a CMV-IE promoter to test specificity. Novel compounds and drug combinations werescreened to identify HIV-specific drugs that synergize with thislatent-viral signature. HIV-specific activation was further examined in T-cell models.Methods : We screened 5600 compounds in a known drug library and a library comprising of 114,000 drug-like compounds using a 293. IRES HIV-specific reporter cell line that contained CMV-CBG/LTR-CBRluciferase reporter system. Hits were identified that activated the LTR-CBR while having a minimal effect on the CMV-CBG reporter. A rigorous selection verification included 11-point titration in the normal and counter-screen assay cell lines, in dsRED-expressing J-Latcells, and activity in primary cell models of latent HIV.Results : From this screening cascade, two known BET bromodomain and four HDAC inhibitors were found to significantly and specifically activate LTR promoter whereas compounds such as Vorinostatexhibited non-specific activity and increased global transcription. Several drug combinations that target different mechanisms im- plicated in HIV-1 latency were found to synergistically reactivate thevirus with high potency. Importantly, seven novel compound classeswere identified in the 114,000 compound library screens. Analogues of these seven classes were obtained and examined in 11-point assay with CMV-CBG/LTR-CBR reporter cell lines and 106 compounds gavea clear indication of early structure-activity relationships.Conclusions : Seven novel classes of HIV-specific latency purging drugs were found that activate HIV provirus in synergy with a low intrinsic expression of HIV RNA and Tat. These novel small moleculeleads warrant further development to iteratively enhance their HIV-1 specificity and potency. We also identified new drug combinations that synergistically activate expression from the latent HIV-1 LTR. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20423 MOPDA0105 HIV rebound and meningoencephalitis following ART interruption after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant: an investigation of the source of HIV rebound Adam Capoferri1,2; Matthew Sievers2; Andrew Redd2,3; Ayla Cash2; Richard F Ambinder2,5and Christine M Durand2,5 1Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baltimore, United States. 2Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.3Division of Intramural Research, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Bethesda,United States. 4Research Technologies Branch, Genomics Unit, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, United States.5Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, United States.Presenting author email: alongwi2@jhmi.edu Introduction : Allogeneic hematopoietic st em cell transplant (alloHSCT) with uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being investigated as a component of HIV eradication strategies. In the two ''Bostonpatients,'' alloHSCT resulted in the disappearance of HIV in peripheralblood. However, after analytical ART interruption, viral rebound occurred. Proposed sources of HIV rebound include the latent reservoir in resting CD4 /C27T cells and tissue macrophages. We present the case of an HIV-infected patient, who received alloHSCT forleukaemia and experienced acute retroviral syndrome after self- discontinuing ART post-alloHSCT. Methods : Resting memory CD4 /C27T-cells obtained 16 and 1 week prior to alloHSCT were used in a limiting-dilution viral outgrowthassay (VOA) in which each well that demonstrates viral growth contains a single replication-competent viral clone. The polregion of virus from positive VOA supernatants was sequenced. Rebound virusfrom blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also analyzed using deep-sequencing (Roche 454) of pol. Sequences were aligned and maximum likelihood analysis was performed using the GTR /C27G model of evolution with 100 bootstrapping pseudoreplicates.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 90Results : The patient had undetectable plasma HIV and achieved 100% donor chimerism at week 12 post-alloHSCT, but then becamenon-adherent with ART. At five months, the patient presented with fever and meningoencephalitis. Plasma and CSF HIV levels were 25,500 and 17,000 copies/mL, respectively. Before alloHSCT, 31sequences were isolated from the VOA. At rebound, 14,645 and 5003 sequence reads were obtained from CSF and blood respectively and were combined into consensus sequences using a cut-off of /C210.2% of total sequence reads. An identical sequence found at both pre-alloHSCTtimepoints accounted for 9/31 (29%) of independent VOA sequences. This sequence grouped with the plasma and CSF viral rebound sequences in a monophyletic clade with high sequence homology.Conclusions : Despite 100% donor chimerism in peripheral blood, ART interruption led to HIV rebound in plasma and CSF. Rebound virus was identical to a pre-alloHSCT isolate which compromised nearly 1/3 of the latent CD4 /C27T-cell reservoir sampled. This unique case suggests that recipient cells persist at early time-points after alloHSCT and that a single viral population latent in resting memory CD4/C27T cells can re-establish infection. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20424MOPDA0106LB Assay to measure the latent reservoir of replication-competent HIV-1 in suppressed patients based on ultra Biochemistry and Biophysics, UNC Center for AIDS Research, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States. 2Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States.Presenting author email: sooklee@med.unc.edu Introduction : Viral outgrowth assay (VOA) is a widely used culture assay to measure the latent HIV-1 reservoir harbouring replication- competent HIV-1 in resting CD4 /C27T cells in patients on HAART. However, the assay is costly, and both labour and resource intensive. To overcome some of these issues with the VOA, we designed an assay using ultra deep sequencing (UDS), which directly analyzes thenumber of different sequences of the induced viruses to score thenumber of latently HIV-infected resting CD4 /C27T cells. In this study, we tested the premise whether the viral sequences derived from two Abstract MOPDA0105 /C1Figure 1. ML Tree.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 91different proviruses are genetically distinct, since the assay involves a bulk culture. Methods : To analyze viruses derived from different VOA culture wells scored as p24 positive, the viral samples derived from differentculture wells were assigned with a specific Barcode and subjected to sequence analysis of the V1 /C1V3 region of envsequences using the Primer ID-based paired-end MiSeq platform. A total of nine patientsamples, two acute and seven chronic, were analyzed by UDS.Phylogenetic trees were generated by using consensus sequences created from sequences with the identical Primer ID and were used to detect distinct viral lineages present in the individual culturesupernatant. For chronic patient samples, IUPM values were deter-mined by using distinct viral lineages detected and the adjusted number of patient-derived resting CD4 /C27T cells used for VOA. Results : Approximately 50% of the viral lineages derived from each chronic patient were distinct. In contrast, all viral lineages derivedfrom each acute patient were homogeneous. When IUPM valuesdetermined by UDS analysis were compared to the IUPM values obtained from VOA, we observed approximately twofold higher IUPM values than the IUPM values determined by VOA. We also observed asignificant positive correlation between the number of viral lineages observed per well and the number of resting T cells present per well. Conclusions : The results suggest that approximately 50% of the viral lineages induced from different cells derived from chronic patientswere distinct. Thus, the UDS assay is applicable for samples derived from chronic patients. The multiplexing ability of the assay improves the efficiency for the throughput capacity. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20560 MOPDB0101 Bacterial vaginosis, intravaginal practices and HIV genital shedding: Alcaide1; 1Division of Infectious Diseases, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, United States.2Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.Presenting author email: malcaide@med.miami.edu Introduction : Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with an increased risk of HIV transmission, and intravaginal practices (IVP), the practiceof cleansing the vagina for hygienic, health or sexuality reasons, is the primary risk factor for developing BV. This study examines the relationship between BV, IVP and lower genital HIV shedding in HIVinfected women in Zambia.Methods : Participants were HIV-1 infected women, older than 18 years and living in Lusaka, Zambia. Participants completed audio computer administered self-interviews questionnaires assessingdemographic, sexual risk factors and IVP . BV was diagnosed by gram stain of vaginal secretions using Nugent criteria. HIV-1 plasma viremia and genital shedding was assessed by measuring HIV-1 RNA inplasma and cervico vaginal lavages using real time PCR.Results : One hundred and twenty-eight HIV-1 infected women were enrolled. Mean age was 37 years (range 24 /C160). Most had a stable male sex partner (126; 98%), and the majority of male partners hadHIV infection (86; 67%). About one third (44; 34%) reported morethan one partner in the prior year. All participants had engaged in IVP in the prior month, and over 90% used IVP daily. Ninety-eight participants (76%) had abnormal vaginal flora (Nugent score of 4 /C110); and 80 (62%) had BV (Nugent score 7 /C110). HIV-1 plasma viremia was detected in 26 participants (20%) (median /C308.4 log copies/mL, range /C30 3.9/C114.5). HIV-1 genital shedding was d etected in 18 participants (14%) (median /C306.7 log copies/mL, range /C303.6/C112.7). In multivariate (OR /C307.9, CI/C301.54/C140.8, pB0.01) and plasma viremia HIV-1 genitalshedding (OR /C307.23, CI /C302.43/C121.37, pB0.01). Demographic, sexual risk factors, IVP or BV were not asso ciated with HIV genital shedding. Conclusions : BV was common in this sample of women with HIV infection and occurred in women engaging in frequent IVP . Neither BV nor IVP increased HIV genital shedding in women on suppressiveantiretrovirals. Effective antiretroviral therapy remains the mainstrategy to prevent HIV female genital shedding and risk of sub- sequent HIV transmission. Further research in women with detect- able plasma viremia is needed to examine how IVP and BV affect thevaginal mucosa and increase HIV transmission.

Presenting author email: lvicol@cw.bc.ca Introduction : Eighty percent of HIV-positive (HIV /C27) women are of childbearing age, therefore access to effective, safe contraception isessential. Generally, intrauterine device (IUD) provide safe, effective contraception but historically, IUDs were contraindicated in HIV /C27 women due to concerns regarding infection. Data in HIV /C27women are scarce.The goal was to assess rate of complications for IUS insertion inHIV/C27women. Methods : IUDs insertions in HIV /C27women were offered at Oak Tree Clinic (the provincial referral centre for HIV /C27women and children) since 2009, following strict clinical evaluations for eligibility. Criteria used for insertion were: not planning a pregnancy for at least one year; requesting a reversible contraceptive, wanted/needed to avoidoestrogen-based methods and CD4 /C21150. STD screening was done in all cases. Demographic information collected included: age, CD4, ARV at insertion and purpose of IUD (contraception vs. cycle control). Results : Data was reviewed from 44 sequential women given IUDs from 2009 to 2014 with ages 17 /C148. CD4 count 160 /C11230 (median 590); 32/44 (73%) loads B40 women had detectable VL between 89 /C1126,908 c/ml. 7 were not on ARV therapy. 2 were on ARV but struggled with adherence and were detectable. 3/44 hada copper IUD. 40/44 had a hormonal IUD. 1 had a hormonal followed by a copper IUD. 3 IUDs were inserted for menorrhagia. 1 IUD was for combined therapeutic and contraceptive purposes. 5 requested thehormonal IUD removed not related to reproductive plans. 1 refusedreinsertion when the expired hormonal IUD was removed. Complica- tions included four IUD expulsions (9%) (three spontaneous; one partial within the cervix). The rate of expulsion in general populationis 6%. One IUD was removed by hysteroscopy due to upward migra-tion of strings and myometrial embedment. One IUD accidentally pulled out during intercourse and required emergent reinsertion of a new device. No IUD related infections or other serious complicationsoccurred, regardless of CD4 count.Conclusions : In this small series of HIV /C27women, IUDs were safe and well tolerated. This method of contraception should remain an option for HIV /C27women if close follow up of short and long term complications can be followed. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20426 MOPDB0103 Effectiveness of contraception for HIV-infected women using antiretroviral therapy: combined data from three longitudinal studies8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 92Maria Pyra1,2; P Kourtis7; Jared M Baeten1,2,6and Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study and Partners PrEP Study Teams 1Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.2Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.3Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.4Sexual, Reproductive, Adolescent and Child Health Research Program, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya.5Integrated Health Sciences, FHI 360, Research Triangle Park, United States. 6Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.7Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States. Presenting author email: mpyra99@uw.edu Introduction : Ensuring safe, effective contraception for women with HIV-1 is a public health imperative. Some data suggest thatantiretroviral therapy (ART) may diminish the effectiveness of certaincontraceptive methods, particularly implants. Methods : Combining data from 5282 HIV-infected women partici- pating in three longitudinal studies (Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study, Couples Observation Study and Partners PrEP Study) from seven countries in Africa between 2004 and 2012, wecalculated incident pregnancy rates among women using differentcontraceptive methods (implant, injectable and oral) and compared those to rates among women using no contraception. Multivariable Cox regression models controlled for confounding factors, and theinteraction between each contraceptive method and ART use wastested to assess if ART diminished contraceptive effectiveness. Results : During follow-up (median 1.8 years, IQR 1.2 /C12.3), 9% of women ever used implant, 41% used injectables (primarily depotmedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)), 15% used oral pills and 47% never used hormonal contraception. Additionally, 31% of women ever used ART during follow-up, including 23% using nevirapine and 5% using efavirenz. Among women not using contraception, pregnancyrates were 13.2 and 22.5 per 100 women-years for those on and not on ART, respectively. Use of implants reduced the risk of pregnancy by more than 90%, both among women on ART (aHR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 /C1 0.45) and not on ART (aHR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 /C10.11). Likewise, injectables reduced pregnancy risk (aHR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 /C10.35 on ART and aHR 0.20, 95% CI 0.16 /C10.24 not on ART), as did oral contraceptives by a lesser degree (aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 /C10.91 on ART and aHR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 /C10.47 not on ART). We found no statistical evidence that ART use diminished contraceptive effectiveness, includ- ing for nevirapine and efavirenz, although sample size was limited for assessing specific ART agents. Conclusions : In this large prospective evaluation of three studies, modern contraceptive methods were highly effective in reducingpregnancy risk in HIV-infected women, including those concurrentlyusing ART. While limited evidence from other studies suggests that some ART agents could diminish the effectiveness of con- traceptive implants, these data emphasize that implantable contra-ception is highly effective compared to no contraception and moreso than shorter-acting methods such as injectables and oral pills. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20427 MOPDB0104 Importance of programmatic longitudinal surveillance for identification of congenital anomalies among infants exposed to HIV-1 and antiretrovirals: findings from theMpepu Study, effectiveness, by ART status and type Progestin use ART Use #Pregnancies Person-yearsIncidence rate (per 100 person-years)aHR* (95% CI), reference no contraceptionp-value for interaction term No contraception On ART 111 843.5 13.2 /C1/C1 No contraception No ART 1067 4733.6 22.5 /C1/C1 Implant On ART 1 94.1 1.1 0.06 (0.01, 0.45) 0.73Implant No ART 7 507.8 1.4 0.05 (0.02, 0.11)Injectable On ART 11 332.8 3.3 0.18 (0.094, 0.35) 0.79Injectable No ART 111 2100.2 5.3 0.20 (0.16, 0.24) Oral pills On ART 5 81.2 6.2 0.37 (0.15, 0.91) 0.97 Oral pills No ART 63 573.1 11.0 0.36 (0.28, #Description of congenital anomaly Presenting symptom Timing of diagnosis from birth 1 Anovestibular fistula Stool in urine 42 days 15 days5 Jejunal atresia Failure to pass stool with abdominal distension and vomiting 5 days6 Macrocephaly Widening of fontanelle and increasing head size 85 days 7 Pyloric stenosis Projectile vomiting 25 days 8 Talipes equino valgus Concern expressed by mother about position of foot 60 days8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 93Kara Bennett5; Joseph Makhema1; Botswana. 2Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, United States.3Division of Infectious Diseases, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, United States.4Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, United States.5Bennett Statistical Consulting, Ballston Lake, United States.6Infectious Disease Unit, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, United States.7Department of Internal Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, United States. Introduction : A large and increasing number of HIV-infected women are conceiving while taking antiretrovirals (ARVs) globally. Inresource-limited settings, surveillance systems, if present, often arelimited to the initial birth exam. Methods : We used pre-randomization data from May 2011 to December 2014 from an ongoing clinical trial of infant cotrimoxazoleprophylaxis in Botswana. Enrolments of live-born infants of HIV-infected women occurred after delivery, so long as the mother con- sented to infant participation and no infant life-threatening conditions were identified at birth. Infants were examined by study staff atdelivery, and monthly in the first three months of life, and congenitalanomalies were documented. We present a descriptive analysis of anomalies identified after the initial birth exam. Results : Of 2935 HIV-infected women enrolled in the Mpepu study who delivered live-born infants, newborn exams were documentedon 2900 (99%) infants. monotherapy; and 223 (7%) received no ARVs during pregnancy. A total of 28 congenital anomalies wereidentified, and 8 (29%) were first diagnosed at a visit after the initial birth exam (Table 1). No differences were identified in the number of infants with or without congenital abnormalities by ARV exposuregroup in pregnancy, but the study was underpowered to detect differ-ences in rare outcomes. Identification of congenital anomalies after the birth exam occurred either because the anomaly was not readily apparent at birth (e.g. biliary atresia), or because an externally-identifiable anomaly was overlooked at birth but subsequent parentalconcern led to documentation and management of the anomaly. Conclusions : ARV use in pregnancy warrants ongoing surveillance monitoring for teratogenicity, particularly for regimens such as EFV/FTC/TDF with insufficient safety data in pregnancy. Nearly one thirdof birth anomalies detected in this cohort of well children were diagnosed after the initial birth exam. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating, where possible, longitudinal assessmentand reporting for detection of congenital anomalies that may not be identifiable at the birth exam. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20428 MOPDC0101 Communities can mobilize to test: findings from a community randomized trial of a theory-based community mobilization intervention in South Africa Sheri A Lippman1; Pettifor Kathleen Kahn6,7 1Department of Medicine, Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco, United States.2Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.3Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences,University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 4School of Health, University of New England, Armidale, Australia.5Sonke Gender Justice, Cape Town, South Africa.6MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt),School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 7Centre for Global Health Research, Division of Epidemiology and Global Health, Umea University, Umea , Sweden. Presenting author email: sheri.lippman@ucsf.edu Background : While community mobilization (CM) is a powerful tool to increase and sustain demand for HIV testing services, few rigoroustrials of CM interventions have been conducted. We implemented a theory-driven CM intervention in order to improve HIV outcomes in 22 communities participating in a community randomized trial(CRT) in a rural area of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Themobilization activities were designed to improve community colla- boration to address HIV and inequitable gender norms. Methods : Cross-sectional surveys were conducted with 50 /C155 residents ages 18 /C135 in each village prior to (n /C301181; 2012) and following (n /C301174; 2014) two years of intensive intervention acti- vities in half of the villages. Intervention activities mapped onto six domains of CM: 1) shared concern around HIV, 2) community con-sciousness, 3) organizational structures, 4) leadership, 5) community cohesion and 6) collective action. Validated domain measures were included in the surveys and mean community CM scores werecomputed and used to predict HIV testing in the past year for eachdomain and for total CM scores. We used GEE logistic regression analysis to assess the effect of village level CM domain scores on individual-level testing outcomes and included interaction terms toassess intervention effects at follow-up. Results : The overall CM score as well as three of six CM domains, including consciousness, concerns, collective action, were significantlyassociated with HIV testing following the intervention and interacted with intervention assignment. For example, for every standard devia- tion increase in community consciousness, the odds of HIV testingincreased for intervention village participants (OR: 1.36, p /C30B0.01) but not for control village participants. Similar findings for total CM score (OR: 1.51), shared concerns (OR: 1.62) and collective action (OR: 1.45) indicate that the intervention successfully improved HIV testing.Leadership, presence of organizations and community cohesion were not significantly associated with HIV testing at end line. Conclusions : To our knowledge this is the first CRT assessing a theory-based CM intervention including quantitative measures of CM domains over time. While not all of the six domains were asso- ciated with HIV testing uptake, we found clear evidence that com-munities can be mobilized and that CM measures are associated with improved engagement in HIV testing. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20429 MOPDC0102 Reducing stigma and increasing HIV testing with a health information intervention, a cluster-randomized trial from Malawi of Economics, London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom.2College of Medicine, University of Malawi, Blantyre, Malawi.3Dignitas International, Zomba, Malawi.4Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. Presenting author email: l.c.derksen@lse.ac.uk Background : Despite widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), demand for HIV testing remains low across southern Africa. HIV testing may be viewed as a signal of HIV status. Those who seekan HIV test may be rejected by potential sexual partners who fear contracting HIV. This could discourage HIV testing and encourage8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 94travel far from home for HIV testing to avoid being seen. Such stigma may be exacerbated by unawareness of the public benefit of ART,that is, its capacity to reduce HIV transmission by 96%. We evaluated an information experiment designed to increase HIV testing rates by reducing stigma.Methods : We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Malawi. We held community health information meetings in all villages. In control villages (n /C3062), we provided information on the private benefits of ART, including its potential to prolong life andreverse AIDS symptoms. In intervention villages (n /C3060), the public benefit of ART was discussed in addition to the control message. Results : Among those aged 15 /C149, there was a significantly larger uptake of HIV testing in the intervention villages (intervention 2.6%vs. control 1.6%; p /C300.0035), according to routinely collected data from 18 health facilities over a period of three months after the intervention. This effect was significant for men and women, andlarger when corrected for spill-overs. The intervention led to a largeshift in beliefs about ART, as measured by a survey five months after the intervention. Respondents in intervention villages were more likely to report accepting attitudes towards sexual partners on ART. Highbeliefs about the public benefit of ART were associated with signifi-cantly more tests at nearby clinics. HIV testing decisions were predicted by a respondent ?s perception of his/her community's beliefs about ART. These observations strongly suggest that the effect of the interventionon HIV testing uptake is mediated by a reduction in stigma. Conclusions : The results demonstrate that stigma between sexual partners is a significant barrier to HIV testing, and that providing newinformation on the effect of ART on HIV transmission can increasetesting uptake. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20430 MOPDC0103 HIV self-testing increases HIV testing frequency among high- risk men who have sex with men: a randomized controlled trial David Katz1,2; Matthew Golden1,2; James Hughes1; Carey Farquhar1 and Joanne Stekler1 1Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.2Public Health /C1Seattle & King County, United States, Seattle.Presenting author email: dkatz7@u.washington.edu Background : HIV self-testing has the potential to increase HIV testing and thereby decrease the time persons living with HIV are unawareof their status, but the absence of counselling may result in increasedrisk of HIV acquisition.Methods : In Seattle, Washington, we randomly assigned 230 HIV- negative men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk for HIVacquisition in a 1:1 ratio to have access to HIV self-testing using the OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test on oral fluids or to testing as usual for 15 months.

All participants were advised to test quarterly, offered testing reminders and could test through any existing HIV testing source. Theprimary outcome was self-reported number of HIV tests duringfollow-up. To evaluate potential adverse effects of self-testing, we compared the following between the two arms: non-concordant condomless anal intercourse (CAI) and number of male CAI partnersin the last three months (measured at 9 and 15 months) and diagnosis with a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) at the final study visit (15 months).Results : Men randomized to self-testing reported significantly more HIV tests during follow-up (mean /C305.3, 95% CI /C304.7/C16.0) than those in the control arm (3.6, 3.2 /C14.0; pB0.0001), represent- ing an average increase of 1.7 tests per participant over 15 months.Men randomized to self-testing reported using an average of 3.9 self-tests during follow-up. Self-testing was non-inferior to clinic-based testing with respect to markers of HIV acquisition risk. At the final study visit, 5.4% of MSM randomized to self-testing were diagnosedwith a bacterial STI compared with 12.2% of control participants (risk difference /C30/C28 6.8%; 95% CI /C30/C28 16 to/C271.6%). There were no significant differences between the two arms in the proportion ofmen reporting non-concordant CAI or the reported number of maleCAI partners in the last three months at 9 and 15 months. Conclusions : Access to free HIV self-testing increased testing fre- quency among high risk MSM and did not impact sexual riskbehaviour or STI acquisition. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20431 MOPDC0104 Home HIV testing among transgender women in San Francisco: a pilot feasibility and acceptability study Sheri A Lippman1; Mary E Moran1; Angel Ventura1; Lesley Susan Buchbinder3; Sarah Treves-Kagan1and Jae M Sevelius1 1Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco, United States.2School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, United States.3San Francisco Department of Public Health, Bridge HIV, San Francisco, United States.Presenting author email: sheri.lippman@ucsf.edu Abstract MOPDC0103 /C1Figure 1. Distribution of self-reported HIV tests by arm.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 95Background : Transgender women are the population most impacted by HIV in the United States, with prevalence approximately 40 timeshigher than the general population. The rates of HIV antibody testing in the transgender community are not commensurate with risk. Development of alternative testing strategies to ensure early detec-tion, care and prevention of infection is critical.Methods : We conducted a pilot study to explore feasibility and acceptability of offering home-based, self-conducted HIV testing for transwomen. Fifty HIV-negative transwomen in San Francisco wereprovided with OraQuick oral HIV self-test kits and asked to utilize the tests once a month for three months. Survey data were collected at baseline, one month and three months. In-depth-interviews (IDIs) were conducted with 11 participants at their final visit to learn moreabout self-testing experiences, barriers to self-testing and how the self-test might fit into an expanded pool of testing options. Results : Self-testing was both feasible and acceptable: following the first test 94% reported the test easy to use; 93% said the results wereeasy to read; and 91% said they would recommend the self-test to others. Acceptability remained high at three months. Approximately 25% used the test kit with others present and 68% reportedpreference for self-tests versus clinic-based testing. IDIs revealedtension between a desire for the privacy afforded by self-testing and a desire for the social and resource support offered at health facilities. While most participants were comfortable accessing ser-vices and had been tested recently (88% in the past year), IDIs revealed apprehension about being seen at HIV-testing clinics. Qualitative data also indicated that partner testing was of interestand that the cost of the kits could discourage future utilization.Conclusions : The home-based, self-conducted HIV test provides a viable option for populations who prefer to avoid the clinic environment. To increase acceptability, enhanced linkage strategiesto social and resource support should be considered. The currentprice point is inaccessible for populations that experience dispropor- tionate economic marginalization. Interest in partner testing could represent an opportunity to package tests in pairs and an expandedopportunity for testing uptake. Additional research should focus onexpanding delivery options and implementation strategies. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20432 MOPDC0105 Supervised HIV self-testing to inform implementation and scale up of self-testing in Sue International, Women's Global Health Imperative, San Francisco, United States.2Centre for Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Research, Harare, Zimbabwe.3Population Services International, Harare, Zimbabwe.4Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care,Harare, Zimbabwe.5Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, London, United Kingdom.Presenting author email: smavedzenge@rti.org Background : HIV self-testing (HIVST) can potentially increase uptake of testing in a low-cost, confidential and non-stigmatizing manner. Rigorous evaluation of instructional materials for accurate self-testing has rarely been conducted. In preparation for implementation and scale-up of HIVST in Zimbabwe, we have adapted and iteratively refined instructional materials to support self-testing. Here we pre-sent results from our evaluation of these materials through super-vised self-testing. Methods : Participants were recruited at an HIV testing clinic using convenience sampling. They were given the instructional materialsand left alone to complete their self-test and record the result.Confirmatory rapid testing after HIVST, and pre- and post-test ques- tionnaires to evaluate their experience were conducted. The testing process was video recorded and videos analyzed using checklists.Data were evaluated weekly and IEC materials iteratively refined accordingly to optimize accuracy. Results : We conducted 172 supervised self-tests among participants in urban Harare, with mean age of 30 (range 18 /C170), 53% female and 20% first-time testers. Overall 93% read their result accurately, in some cases despite failing to follow instructions as determined byvideo. Six percent were unable to determine their result. One percentgot inaccurate results, including one HIV /C27individual on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who followed instructions correctly as determined by video. While most (88%) reported the test was not hard to use, 23%said some instructions were unclear, resulting in modifications to thematerials. Common sources of confusion were in interpreting results, the purpose of the test kit desiccant and unclear images/language. Low literacy was associated with unsure/invalid results, promptingrevision of the materials for a rural, less literate setting. There, among 29 participants, 3% were unable to determine their results and 31% got an inaccurate result. Materials have been further revised makingthem almost entirely pictorial, and supervised self-testing is ongoing. Conclusions : Though there is little published research on optimizing HIVST materials, we found that thorough evaluation of materialsthrough supervised self-testing has been critical to optimizingaccuracy. Numerous revisions were required, and evaluation in dif- ferent settings yielded differing results. Rigorous development and testing of HIVST supportive materials appropriate to country andsetting is recommended prior to implementation of HIVST programs. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20433 MOPDC0106 Integrating partner notification services into PMTCT (Option B /C27) services in the northwest and southwest regions of Cameroon Abstract MOPDC0105 /C1Table 1.

Presenting author email: piustih@cbchealthservices.org Background : Partner notification (PN) for control of sexually trans- mitted infections (STIs) is a public health strategy which notifies thepartners of infected individuals of their possible exposure to disease. PN has rarely been used in sub-Saharan Africa as an HIV prevention intervention. In Cameroon, patients newly diagnosed with HIV do notusually receive assistance in notifying their sex partners leading tolow partner disclosure and poor partner involvement in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). In 2012, the World Health Organization issued new guidelines in PMTCT including Option B /C27 which recommends that all HIV positive pregnant women (PW) beplaced on antiretroviral treatment for life irrespective of CD4 count. PN was integrated into PMTCT at 22 pilot Option B /C27sites as a strategy to increase male partner disclosure, notification, testing andlinkage to care. Methods : Beginning in March 2013, Trained Health Advisors (HA) at the 22 B /C27sites interviewed consenting HIV-positive PW about their sexual partners in the last two years and facilitated disclosure orconfidentially informed their partners that they had been exposed to HIV. The HAs pre-test counselled the partners and offered HIV testing in the clinic, their home or other location. They then educated bothindex cases and their partners on HIV prevention and risk reductionand linked all HIV positive partners to care and treatment. Results : During the 18 months, uptake was monitored monthly and 823 PW tested HIV positive at the 22 option B /C27sites (Figure 1). Of the 840 partners they identified, 693 (82.5%) were traced and notified of their exposure to HIV. Of the 693 notified, 421 (60.8%) didtheir HIV test and received results. A total of 139 (33.0%) of thosetested were HIV positive and 138 (99.3%) were linked to appropriate C&T services. HIV negative partners (67.0% of those tested) were counselled on risk reduction. Male partner involvement increasedgreatly at seven of ten sites monitored. Conclusions : PN is a feasible HIV prevention strategy in resource- limited settings which can identify and test many partners of HIVpositive PW. PN can be integrated into Option B /C27PMTCT programsto identify HIV positive partners who are placed on treatment alongside the HIV positive PW. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20434 MOPDD0101 The effect of opiate substitution therapy on healthcare utilization and engagement among HIV-infected people who inject drugs in Ukraine Chethan Michael Soule3; Sergey Dvoryak4and Frederick Altice5 1Department of Internal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.2Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, United States. 3Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital McLean, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.4Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy, Kyiv, Ukraine.5Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,United States. Presenting author email: chet86@gmail.com Background : Eastern Europe and Central Asia face a rapidly escala- ting HIV epidemic driven by injection drug use (IDU). We evaluatethe role of opioid substitution treatment (OST) in engaging HIV- infected people who inject drugs (PWID) in care and the effect of OST on utilization of medical services. Methods : Cross-sectional study of healthcare utilization in the past six months among 296 randomly sampled HIV-infected opioid-dependent PWID conducted in healthcare clinics in 2010 across Ukraine. Participants categorized as therapeutic on OST if on OST for at least three consecutive months prior to the past six months or asnot taking OST if not on any OST in the past nine months. Based onthis criterion, 24 individuals were excluded. Results : The 65% on OST (177/272) were less likely to be below the poverty line or live alone and more likely to be married or have goneto prison (p B0.05).The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, gender, or education. Those on OST had more years of opioid injection but were less likely to have injected in the past 30 days, tohave engaged in poly-substance abuse, or to have ever overdosed ondrugs (pB0.01). In the past six months, those on OST were less likely to seek emergency care (72% vs. 84%, p B0.05) and had fewer mean emergency care visits (2.77 vs. 4.57, p B0.02) with no significant differ- ences in mean ambulatory visits (1.78 vs. 0.59, p /C300.11) or hos- pitalizations (0.53 vs. 0.34, p /C300.36).Those on OST were more likely to be engaged in HIV care, as evidenced by higher rates of antiretroviral therapy ART (37% vs. 26%, p /C300.08), recent CD4 p Number of self-reported symptoms was higher in the non-OST group compared to those on OST (10.46 vs. 7.75, p B0.01). Limitations include cross-sectional design and potential for recall and social desirabilitybiases. Conclusions : Despite higher rates of incarceration and more years of opioid injection, those therapeutic on OST were less likely to seek emergency care than those not on OST and more likely to beengaged in HIV care with fewer overall symptoms. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20435 MOPDD0102 The effects of opioid substitution treatment and highly active antiretroviral therapy on the cause-specific risk of mortality among injection drug using people of PN services at 22 B/C27sites.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 971BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.2Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.3UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States.4Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, United States.5Division of Aids, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver,Canada. Presenting author email: bnosyk@cfenet.ubc.ca Background : Prior studies indicate that opioid substitution treatment (OST) reduces the risk of mortality and improves the odds of accessinghighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), however the relative effects of these treatments for injection drug using people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) are unclear. We aim to determine the independentand joint effects of OST and HAART on mortality, by cause, within apopulation of injection drug using PLHIV initiating HAART. Methods : We used a linked population-level administrative data- base for British Columbia, Canada (1996 /C12010) to form a cohort of injection drug using PLHIV. We selected all individuals identified as HIV-positive and either having a history of OST at initial HAART receipt, as indicated by methadone or buprenorphine dispensationrecords in the BC PharmaNet database or having an indication ofinjection drug use before HIV infection, as indicated in the HIV testing database. We employed time-to-event analytic methods, including competing risks models, proportional hazards models withtime-varying covariates, and marginal structural models, to identifythe independent and joint effects of OST and HAART on all-cause, as well as drug- and HIV-related mortality, controlling for covariates. Results : Among 1727 injection drug using PLHIV, 493 (28.5%) died during a median 5.1 years (interquartile range: 2.1 /C19.1) of follow-up: due to HIV-related causes,and 25.6% due to other causes. Standardized mortality ratios were 12.2 (95% CI: 9.8, 15.0) during OST, and 30.0 (27.1, 33.1) during periods out of OST. Both OST (adjusted hazard 0.34 (95% CI: 0.23,0.49)) hazard of all-causemortality; however, individuals were at lowest risk of death when these medications were used jointly (0.16 (0.10, 0.26)). Both OST and HAART independently protected against not only HIV-related death,but also drug-related death and death due to other causes. Conclusions : While both OST and HAART are life-saving treatments, there is an urgency to ensure joint administration to protect againstboth drug and HIV-related mortality. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20436 MOPDD0103 Assessing the HIV prevention potential of Mexico's ''narcomenudeo'' drug law reform: implementation challenges among people who inject drugs Leo Beletsky1,2; Patricia Gonzalez-Zuniga2; of Law, Northeastern University, Boston, United States. 2Global Public Health, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, United States.3United States-Mexico Border Commission, Tijuana, Mexico. Presenting author email: lbeletsky@ucsd.edu : Mexico's innovative 2009 ''narcomenudeo'' law decrimi- nalized small-scale drug possession, mandating drug treatment diver-sion in lieu of incarceration and reframing drug policy to facilitate HIV prevention. However, the US-Mexico Border region continues to ex- perience elevated HIV risk related to syringe sharing, while evidence-based addiction treatment and other prevention services targeting people who inject drugs (PWID) remain critically under-resourced. We designed a longitudinal cohort study to assess the implementation ofthis structural intervention among at-risk PWID in Tijuana.Methods : This mixed-methods research programme integrated a structured questionnaire and laboratory testing with qualitative inter-views assessing legal knowledge, police encounters, drug and sex risk behaviours, and infectious disease status. At baseline, 737 PWID were recruited in Tijuana; 32 participated in qualitative interviews. Results : Between 2010 and 2013, only 11% of PWID respondents reported being aware of drug decriminalization; virtually noneexperienced drug treatment diversion or the law's other operationalcomponents. Interviews underscored the law's irrelevance to PWID; 699 (98%) characterized police practices as typically inconsistent with formal law. Instead of diversion to addiction treatment, multivariatemodelling suggested that police encounters are independentlyassociated with increased HIV risk behaviours such as syringe sharing use (OR /C302.11; 95% CI/C301.38/C13.22). Qualitative data underscored the dissonance be- tween the formal legal standards for drug and syringe possession, treatment diversion and other public health-oriented legal provisions on the one hand, and the lived experience of drug users on the other.Interviews mapped out a number of pathways by which arbitrarypolice enforcement severely undermine drug users' ability to engage in protective HIV behaviours. Mixed-methods findings reveal that, just as housing instability can aggravate HIV risk, the lack of pre-dictability in one's legal environment *also known as a ''weak rule of law''*can compound HIV risk. Conclusions : Formal drug policy reform may be necessary in many settings to reduce HIV risk among PWID, but appears insufficient as astand-alone intervention. As policy interventions intended to facil-itate HIV prevention gain global momentum, ancillary structural reforms such as police training to improve the rule of law are needed to unlock their public health potential. Operational partnerships withlaw enforcement are discussed. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20437 MOPDD0104 Low threshold services for females who inject drugs: reducing gender inequities in methadone enrolment AIDS, United States.2Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California,San Francisco, United States. 3Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.4Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, United Republic ofTanzania. 5Department of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, United States.6Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, United Republic of Tanzania.

However, enrolment of females who inject drugs into MAT has lagged behind that of males. To address this inequity, the methadone clinic at Mwananyamala RegionalReferral Hospital (MRRH) introduced low threshold services forfemales in January 2013, allowing women to bypass the historically required attendance at community-based organizations prior to enrolment. Furthermore, existing female clients were encouragedto recruit their peers and one-day of the week was set aside forenrolling female clients only. Methods : We conducted an interrupted time-series study to evaluate the impact of implementing low threshold services forfemales enrolling into MAT, using de-identified, routinely collected data from November 2012 to October 2014 at MRRH. Prais-winsten regression models were utilized to estimate the mean change in theproportion of clients that were female and the weekly number offemales enrolling, adjusting for male enrolment and a period of MAT enrolment interruption form July /C1November 2013. Results : Overall, 759 clients enrolled into the methadone clinic during the study period. Of those enrolling, the mean age was 34 years. Themean number of people enrolling into methadone during the study period was 8 clients (95% CI: 7, 9) per week. After implementation of low threshold services, the proportion of female clients after the enrolment interruption, the proportion of female methadone clients decreased slightly to 22% (21 /C122%). Adjusting for male enrolment, the mean number of females enrol- ling per week was 2 (95% CI: 1 /C13; p/C300.001) people per week higher as compared to before implementation. Following the enrolment stoppage, the average number of female enrollees : Implementation of low threshold services improved enrolment into the methadone programme among women, thereby increasing the proportion of female methadone clients. However, thegains in enrolment were attenuated after an enrolment interruption,highlighting the importance of programme stability with this group of clients. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20438 MOPDD0105 Increasing rates of earlier antiretroviral treatment associated with elevated levels of optimal virologic response amongHIV-positive illicit drug users during a treatment-as- prevention-based initiative in a Canadian Hogg; Silvia Guillemi; Julio Montaner Evan Wood British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada. Presenting author email: uhri-mjsm@cfenet.ubc.ca Introduction : Among illicit drug users, renewed efforts to reduce high levels of HIV/AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and curbrates of viral transmission rely, in part, on earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, there are concerns that starting treatment prior to immunosuppression for members ofharder-to-treat groups could contribute to lower levels of treatmentadherence and lead to impaired virologic response. Thus, we sought to evaluate trends in CD4 cell count at ART initiation over time and rates of subsequent virologic response among HIV-positive illicit drugusers during a community-wide Treatment-as-Prevention campaign in Vancouver, Canada. Methods : We used data from the ACCESS study, an ongoing longitudinal cohort of HIV-positive illicit drug users linked tocomprehensive HIV clinical monitoring and pharmacy dispensation records. In this retrospective study, we included all individuals whoinitiated ART from 2005 onwards. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate differences in mean CD4 /C27cell count at initiation by year of initiation. To estimate time to plasma HIV-1 RNAviral load B50 copies/mL by CD4 cell count at ART initiation, we used Kaplan /C1Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. Results : Between 2005 and 2013, 357 individuals initiated ART. Median CD4 at initiation increased from 130 cells/mL (interquartilerange: 60 /C1205) in 2005 to 330 (205 /C1430) in 2013. In a linear regression analysis adjusted for age, gender and ancestry, year of initiation was positively associated with CD4 cell count at initiation (b/C3030.82 cells per year increase, p B0.001). Among 357 initiates, 184 (52%) reached non-detectable plasma VL within 360 days. In an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, CD4 cell count at initiation was positively associated with time to viral suppression (adjustedhazard ratio: 1.21 per 100 cell/mL increase; 95% confidence interval:1.13/C11.29). Conclusions : We observed substantial increases in CD4 cell count at initiation over time coincident with a community-wide TasP-basedinitiative. Individuals initiating ART earlier in the disease courseexhibited higher rates of optimal virologic response. These findings support earlier initiation of ART among illicit drug users to reduce levels of HIV/AIDS-associated morbidity and mortality and rates ofviral transmission. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20564 TU/C1TUESDAY TUPDA0101 Association between CSF and peripheral markers of immune-activation/inflammation and elevated intrathecalHIV-RNA levels in a cohort of of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University of Milan, Health Sciences, Milan, Italy.2Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.Presenting author email: esther.merlini@unimi.it Introduction : Since the association between high HIV-RNA replica- tion in central nervous system and immune activation/inflammation has not yet been established, we aimed to investigate the inflam-matory milieu in CSF and peripheral blood of HIV /C27antiretroviral- na\u00a8ve subjects with high CSF viremia compared to those with low CSF viremia, in the attempt to identify biomarkers that might be used asdiagnostic tools.Methods : A total of 150 HIV /C27cART-na \u00a8ve pts underwent to lumbar puncture for CSF HIV-RNA quantification and were tested for peripheral T-cell immune-phenotypes (CD38/CD45RA/CD45R0/CD127on CD4/CD8; flow cytometry).

H-CSF pts displayed higher plasma HIV-RNA (p /C300.002) and VE (p /C300.019).

We examined the secretion by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC),specialized cells that secrete high levels of IFN upon HIV recognition by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7. We showed previously that intracellular trafficking of HIV to early endosomes is associated with potent IFNsecretion but minimal NF-kB signalling, resulting in suboptimal pDC maturation; however, how HIV trafficking is determined and the causal link between HIV subcellular localization and differential TLRsignalling are currently unknown. Methods : Human pDC were purified from peripheral blood and were stimulated with GFP labelled: HIV, HIV pseudotyped with influenza hemagglutinin PR8 influenza. TLR7 stably transfected with CD4 mutantswith cytoplasmic tails directing trafficking to early endosomes (EE) or lysosomes, were activated with HIV and controls. Analysis included ELISA, flow cytometry and florescent microscopy. Cells were imagedusing the Advanced Precision imaging system and images wereanalyzed using ImageJ. Results : We compared the effects and spatiotemporal trafficking in pDC of HIV, influenza and HA-HIV. We demonstrate that HA-HIV strongly activates maturation pathways (NF-kB) in pDC and traffics rapidly to lysosomes, similarly to influenza but unlike HIV, suggesting thatviral envelope directs trafficking and resultant phenotype of ssRNA virions in pDC. We studied HIV-CD4 interactions in a HEK reporter cellsystem expressing TLR7 with functional NF-kB signalling, which we co- transfected with CD4 mutants whose cytoplasmic tails either directedCD4 trafficking to EE or lysosomes. We show that wild type (WT) CD4 localizes to EE, whereas CD4 mutated with or LAMP1 tail localizes to HIV traffics to EE in WT CD4 expressing TLR7HEK cells and fails to stimulate NF-kB signalling, whereas HIV traffics tolysosomes in DEC-205/LAMP1 expressing TLR7 HEK cells and stimulates NF-kB signalling, suggesting that rerouting of HIV (via CD4) to lysosomal compartments triggers NF-kB rather than IFN pathways. Conclusions : CD4 receptor mediated endocytosis targeting early between BST2 and the ILT7 receptor to inhibit innate sensing of infected T cells byplasmacytoid dendritic cells Mariana G : Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) constitute a major source of type-I interferon (IFN-I) production during acuteHIV infection. Their activation results primarily from TLR7-mediatedsensing of HIV-infected cells. BST2/Tetherin is a restriction factor that suppresses HIV release by cross-linking virions at the cell-surface. HIV-1 BST2 antiviral activity through Vpu, which partiallydownregulates BST2 cell-surface expression. Apart from its directantiviral BST2 was shown to bind the ILT7 pDC-specific inhibitory receptor and repress IFN-I production by activated pDCs. Here, we examined whether Vpu-mediated BST2 antagonism couldmodulate innate sensing of HIV-infected cells by pDCs. Methods : PBMCs or isolated pDCs were co-cultured with T cells infected with wild type or Vpu-defective HIV-1 and innate sensing wasevaluated by monitoring IFN-I production. BST2-mediated activationof ILT7 signalling was analyzed using an ILT7-reporter cell system. Results : We show that Vpu attenuates the production of IFN-I during sensing of HIV-1 infected cells by pDCs. This control of innate sensingby Vpu could be prevented by: 1) depletion of BST2 from infecteddonor cells; 2) depletion of ILT7 in pDCs; or 3) blocking BST2-ILT7 interaction using anti-BST2 antibodies or soluble ILT7. Using a BST2 mutant that cannot cross-link budding virions but yet retains the capacity to repress IFN-I production by pDCs, we show that virion trapping on infected donor cells prevents BST2 from eliciting aninhibition of IFN-I production by pDCs. Interestingly, confocalmicroscopy analysis of virus producing cells reveals that in presence of Vpu there is a residual pool of surface BST2, which is excluded from viral budding sites and thus potentially accessible for interac-tion with ILT7 on pDCs. Lastly, using an ILT7 reporter cell system, weprovide evidence that Vpu-mediated BST2 antagonism modulatesthe levels of available surface BST2 capable of engaging and activating ILT7 upon cell-to-cell contact. Conclusions : Overall, this study sheds light on a novel Vpu-BST2 interaction that allows HIV to control innate sensing of infected cellsby pDCs via the negative signalling exerted by the ILT7-BST2 pair. Thismechanism of innate immune evasion is likely to be critical for efficient viral dissemination and establishment of viral reservoirs during acute infection. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.204418th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 100TUPDA0104 HIV-1 transcriptional silencing caused by TRIM22 inhibition of Sp1 binding to promoter Biosafety Unit, of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele ScientificInstitute, Milan, Italy. 2Molecular Medicine PhD Program, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.3Service of Molecular Virology, University of Bruxelles, Gosselies, Belgium. 4Center for Infection and Immunity Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

We have previously described the interferon-inducible restriction factor TRIM22 as a suppressor of As basal HIV-1 transcription ismainly driven by the binding of the cellular transcription factor Sp1,we have investigated whether TRIM22 could interfere with such Sp1-driven transcriptional activation of HIV-1 LTR.Methods : 293T cells, lacking endogenous TRIM22, were co- transfected with a TRIM22-expressing plasmid together with repor-ters vectors driven by the HIV-1 promoter containing either wild-typeor mutated Sp1 binding sites or lacking of either one or twosites; reporter expression was assessed 48 hours post-transfection.Endogenous TRIM22 was knocked-down (KD) in SupT1 cells thatwere subsequently infected with HIV-1 molecular clones engineeredto be dependent on an incorporated Tet-On gene expression systemfor activation of transcription while being independent of Tat/TARinteraction. Virus replication was monitored up to 32 days post-infection. Cell extracts from TRIM22-transfected 293T was subjectedto 1) immunoprecipitation, 2) Western blotting, 3), pull-downand 4) chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Results : TRIM22 overexpression suppressed Sp1-driven transcription of HIV-1, as its inhibitory activity was lost in the absence of Sp1binding sites. In contrast, TRIM22 KD increased the replication ofinfectious clones that were exclusively dependent upon Sp1 binding to the promoter. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TRIM22 and Sp1 can interact physically although thisinteraction does not affect the level of expression of endogenousSp1 or its phosphorylation state. TRIM22 did not directly bind tothe HIV-1 LTR by either in vitro pull-down experiments or in ChIP experiments, however TRIM22 expression drastically prevented thebinding of Sp1 to the HIV-1 LTR. Conclusions : TRIM22 inhibits Sp1-dependent transcription by inter- acting with Sp1 and preventing its binding to the HIV-1 LTR. Our findings bear relevance for the discovery of new pharmacologicalapproaches aimed at targeting the reservoir of cells latently infectedwith replication-competent proviruses. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20442 TUPDA0105 Polymorphisms in Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.2Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia, Serrekunda, Gambia. Presenting author email: shmona.simpson@trinity.ox.ac.ukIntroduction : Tripartite motif-containing protein 22 (TRIM22) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with activity against HIV-1: high levels of TRIM22expression are associated with reduced viral set-point following acute HIV-1 infection. The TRIM22 gene has been greatly shaped by positive selection, and its expression is sensitive to retroviral infection, Type Iand Type 2 interferon. The mechanism by which TRIM22 exerts itsantiviral effect is poorly understood. Further, the impact of TRIM22 genetic variation in the context of HIV-2 disease is unknown. Methods : To test the hypotheses that TRIM22 expression antagonizes HIV-2 infection and that polymorphisms in TRIM22 significantly modulate this effect, we conducted three studies. Firstly, TRIM22was genotyped in 60 HIV-2 patients, comparing viral controllers andrapid progressors, and a similar number of age and sex matched controls from the same community in rural Guinea-Bissau. Using regression modelling, polymorphisms were analysed alongside im-munological and virological data. Secondly, a model of TRIM22 was constructed using computational methods and the polymorphisms observed in vivo were mapped and analysed. Finally, baseline cDNA and protein levels of TRIM22 from C8166 cells were measured usingquantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively. The cells were subsequently infected with HIV-2, and measurements repeated to determine whether TRIM22 gene expression is sensitive to HIV-2infection.Results : The data show that TRIM22 polymorphisms rs1063303 and rs7935564 are significantly associated with HIV-2 acquisition and disease progression. Further, polymorphisms observed in vivo cluster in functional regions that our modelling studies suggest may interactwith the HIV-2 capsid. Finally, we show that TRIM22 gene expression is upregulated in the presence of HIV-2, in a lymphocyte cell line. Conclusions : Taken together, our data show that TRIM22 expression is sensitive to HIV-2 infection and that polymorphisms in TRIM22 genes are significantly associated with HIV-2 acquisition and disease progression. Further the study has computationally characterizedpositively selected polymorphisms observed in vivo and the data show that these polymorphisms have the potential to significantly alter protein structure and function. These data provide the first analysis of TRIM genetic variation in the context of HIV-2 infection. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20443 TUPDA0106LB The negative checkpoint receptor TIGIT marks exhausted T cells during SIV infection and correlates with SIV disease progression Gabriela M Webb1; Glen M Chew2; Tsuyoshi Benjamin J Helen L Wu1; Katherine B Ndhlovu2and Jonah B Sacha1 1Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton, United States.2Department of Tropical Medicine, Hawaii Center for HIV/AIDS, John A.

ExhaustedT cells increase the expression of negative checkpoint inhibitors suchas PD-1, which raise the threshold for activation and contribute to suppressed immune responses. Another recently discovered immune checkpoint receptor, TIGIT, is upregulated on T cells in neoplasms andchronic LCMV infection. We hypothesize that TIGIT functions as a negative checkpoint receptor marking dysfunctional T cells during SIV8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 101infection and that modulation of TIGIT would restore anti-SIV-specific T-cell responses. Methods : Spleen, lymph from SIV-na \u00a8ve and for surfaceexpression of TIGIT. cytokine production was assessed via Proliferative capacity was determined through CFSE dilution of (anti-TIGIT mAb significantly upregulated on CD8 /C27T cells derived from the spleen and LN but not on PBMC in SIV-infected animals. The frequency of TIGIT/C27CD8/C27T cells in the LN significantly correlated with SIV viral load, and TIGIT drivenprimarily by g-chain cytokines such as approximately 40% of SIV-specific CD8 /C27T cells, even in animals with full cART suppression of viral replication. While Ki-67 expression didnot differ between TIGIT /C27and TIGIT/C28CD8/C27T cells, TIGIT-CD8/C27T cells produced significantly more IFN-g compared to TIGIT/C27CD8/C27T cells. Single and dual blockade of TIGIT and/or PD-1 signallingpathways restored proliferative capacity of SIV-specific T cells in vitro. Conclusions : TIGIT is a negative checkpoint receptor that marks a novel population of functionally exhausted SIV-specific CD8 /C27T cells and is associated with SIV disease progression. The enhancement ofvirus-specific T-cell proliferative responses in the presence of singleor dual blockade of TIGIT and/or PD-1 suggests that targeting the TIGIT pathway is a viable therapeutic approach to reverse T-cell dysfunction. Given the high sequence homology of rhesus andhuman TIGIT, this provides a platform to further investigate TIGIT,along with other checkpoint inhibitors, as potential targets for mediating a functional cure for HIV. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20561 TUPDB0101 Prolongation of QTc interval in HIV-infected individuals compared to the general population is not caused by antiretroviral therapy Stefan Esser1; Marie Henrike M Geisel2; Marina Study Group and Heinz Nixdorf Recall Investigative Group 1Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University of Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.2Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (IMIBE), University of Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.3Department of Cardiology, West German Heart Centre, University of Diusburg Essen, Essen, Germany.4Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, University Leipzig, Coordination Centre for Clinical Trials(ZKS Leipzig /C1KKS), Leipzig, Germany. 5Department of Sexual Health and Medicine, Clinic of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany. 6Department of Internal Medicine, City Hospital Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany. Presenting author email: stefan.esser@uk-essen.de Introduction : Prolongation of the QTc interval (QTc) increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVE). The incidence of CVE is higher in HIV- infected (HIV /C27) patients compared with the general population. The impact of different antiretroviral therapies (ART), co-medicationand HIV-infection on the electrical activity of the heart is rarelyinvestigated in large HIV /C27cohorts. Methods : We compare QTc of HIV /C27outpatients of the HIV HEART study (HIVH) and of controls of the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study (HNR), both recruited from the German Ruhr area since 2000. HIVH cases were age- and sex-matched with HNR controlsin a 1:2 ratio. QTc was measured and corrected using the Bazett's formula. We used crude and adjusted linear mixed models to accountfor the matched design and adjusted for QTc interval prolonging medication (QTc-PM, no ART). Differences in QTc between HIV specific factors and ART were evaluated using ANOVA in the HIVHsubpopulation. All analyses were stratified by sex.Results : 496 HIVH participants (83.3% male, aged 54.5 96.7) were matched with 992 HNR controls. We observed a longer QTc in HIVH subjects compared with HNR controls: 424 923 ms versus 411 915 ms for male and 435 920 ms versus 416 917 ms for female subjects (pB0.0001 for both sexes). HIVH males used QTc-PM more often (22.3% vs. 17.6% than HIVH (13.3% vs. 24.7% for HNR). However, adjusting for QTc-PM the mean differences in QTcremained significant with 13 (95% CI: 11, 15) ms for male and 19 (95% CI: 14, 24) ms for female subjects. Prolongation of QTc (male /C21440 ms, female /C21460 ms) was pathologic in 22.8% versus 3.9% of HIVH and HNR males and in 12.1% versus 1.8% of the females. Nodifferences in the QTc were observed within the HIVH population for different ART medications, for the clinical and immunological HIV status and for the route of HIV infection in both sexes. Conclusions : HIV/C27patients have longer mean QTc and more often pathological prolonged QTc compared with age- and sex-matched controls from the general population even after adjustment forintake of non-antiretroviral QTc-PM. ART, HIV stage and HIV trans-mission route are not associated with QTc prolongation. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20444 TUPDB0102 Favourable effect on vitamin D and bone after switching from Atripla to darunavir/ritonavir: a randomised controlled clinical trial Lisa Study Group 1Renal Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom. 2Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guys and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.3Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom.4King's Centre for Global Health, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.Presenting author email: lisa.hamzah@kcl.ac.uk Introduction : Efavirenz has been associated with reductions in vitamin D (25[OH]D) and Tenofovir with increased bone turnover, reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) and renal tubular dysfunction (RTD). We hypothesized that switching from Atripla toDarunavir/Ritonavir monotherapy (DRV/r) might increase 25[OH]D, and improve BMD and RTD. Methods : Patients with HIV RNA B50 copies/mL on Atripla for ] six months were randomized 1:1 to receive ongoing Atripla or DRV/r(800/100 mg once daily) for 48 weeks. Primary endpoint was change from baseline in 25[OH]D at week 48. Secondary endpoints included changes in BMD, bone turnover markers and RTD. Linear regressionestimated the mean difference in 25[OH]D in patients on Atriplaversus DRV/r. Secondary endpoints were expressed as the mean (95% CI) observed between-arm difference from baseline. Results : 70 subjects (86% male, 66% white, mean (SD) CD4 cell count 537.3 (191.5) per mm 3) were randomized, of whom 26 (DRV/r) and 31 (Atripla) completed the 48 week study on the allocated treatment. The mean (SD) difference between baseline and week 4825[OH]D was 5.0 (5.9) ng/mmol for DRV/r and 1.2 (6.0) for Atripla.After adjustment for baseline 25[OH]D and demographics, at week 48 DRV/r monotherapy was associated with a /C273.5 (95% CI: 0.5, 6.4)8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 102ng/mmol increase in 25[OH]D compared to Atripla (p /C300.02). Subjects in the DRV/r arm experienced increases in BMD (meanbetween-arm difference (0.02 (0.003, 0.04) g/cm the neck of /C2816.9 (/C2826.5,/C287.4) ug/L, p /C300.0008), as compared with subjects on Atripla. No significant difference in RTD (urineretinol-binding protein/creatinine ratio and phosphate reabsorption)was observed. Reasons for discontinuation in the DRV/r arm included side effects (n /C304) and virus load rebound (n /C302), all of which resolved with DRV/r discontinuation or regimen intensification.Conclusions : A switch from Atripla to DRV/r resulted in significant improvements in 25[OH]D and PTH, and a 2 /C13% increase in BMD. DRV/r monotherapy provides a bone-friendly treatment option topatients with osteoporosis or increased fracture risk. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20445 TUPDB0103 Long-term bone mineral density changes in antiretroviral- treated HIV-infected individuals Philip Grant1; University, Stanford, United States. 2Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, United States. 3Department for Pediatrics and Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, United States.4Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. 5Division of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Colombus, United States.6Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado, Denver, United States.7Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University, New York, United States.8New England Research Institute, Watertown, United States.9Viiv, Research Triangle Park, United States.10Medical Sciences, Gilead Sciences, Foster City, United States.11The Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States. Presenting author email: pmgrant72@gmail.com Introduction : Accelerated bone mineral density (BMD) loss occurs during the first two years of ART. Few studies have evaluated sub-sequent BMD changes, especially compared to uninfected controls. Methods : ACTG A5318 performed one follow-up and follow-up DXAs during the randomized treatment trial A5202/A5224s. As controls, we obtained DXA results from uninfected participants enrolled in BACH/Bone and WIHScohorts. Repeated measures analyses compared BMD change ratebetween HIV-infected and uninfected, adjusting for age, sex, race and body mass index (BMI). In the HIV-infected group, we performed multivariable analyses evaluating association of HIV-specific (baselineand time-updated CD4 and viral load), HIV treatment-related(randomized ART regimen, cumulative tenofovir (TDF) exposure) and non-HIV related factors (age, sex, race, relevant concomitant medication use, BMI, total lean body mass) on BMD change rate.Results : Baseline characteristics between HIV infected (n /C3097) and HIV-uninfected (n /C30630) participants were generally similar: median age, 40 versus 46; % female, 14 versus 14; % black, 34 versus 35; median BMI, 24 versus 29; and median years between first and lastDXA, 7.5 versus 6.9. Seventy-one percent of HIV-infected participants were on TDF at last DXA. Compared to controls, HIV-infected individuals had significantly greater adjusted BMD decline rate atlumbar spine (LS) and total hip (TH) during the first 96 weeks of ART (both pB0.001). Subsequently, on follow-up DXA, HIV infection remained significantly associated with greater adjusted BMD decline rate at LS ( /C280.29%/year; 95% CI: /C280.49,/C280.09; p/C300.005) but not at TH (p /C300.63). In the HIV group, the rate of BMD decline slowed after the first 96 weeks of ART (0 /C196 weeks vs. Late Change: B0.001). During the late period, no HIV-related characteristic was associated with BMD loss, but lower total leanbody mass (and not BMI) was associated with greater BMD loss at LSand TH (both p B0.001). Conclusions : Although the rate of BMD decline slowed after the first 96 weeks after ART initiation in HIV-infected persons, the rate ofbone loss at the lumbar spine was still significantly greater than HIV- uninfected controls. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20446 TUPDB0104 Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver 1Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.2Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.3HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross /C1AIDS Research Centre, Bangkok, Thailand.4Srinagarind Hospital, Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.6Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.Presenting author email: tavitiya@gmail.com Introduction : Liver disease is an important non-AIDS related morbid- ity in HIV-infected adults. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinical-pathological syndrome which may progress toward liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The study objective was to determine theprevalence of NAFLD and liver fibrosis among perinatally HIV-infected adolescents with a history of transaminitis. Methods : A cross-sectional study was conducted at 4 paediatric HIV centres in Thailand (Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen) and Indonesia (Jakarta). HIV-infected adolescents aged 10 to 25 years with virologicsuppression and had transaminitis (ALT /C2130 U/L or AST /C2150 U/L) within past 12 months were enrolled. Adolescents with history of hepatitis B/C co-infection or significant alcohol consumption wereexcluded. The assessments included liver ultrasonography (USG-evaluation of fatty liver); transient elastography Aspartate to-platelet ratio index (APRI-biomarker of liver fibrosis) was calcu-lated. Liver stiffness was defined as any liver fibrosis. (TE]5.1 advanced fibrosis, respectively. Correlation of APRI and TE result was assessed.

Research GmbH, Munich, Germany. Presenting author email: christoph.spinner@tum.de Introduction : The incidence of insulin resistance (IR) and diabetes mellitus in HIV-patients, both contributing to cardiovascular morbid- ity and mortality, has been associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Only limited data exists on metabolic effects of regimens in-cluding newer drugs such as fixed dose combination drugs, par-ticularly concerning IR. Methods : In this prospective, open-label, randomized phase-I- study we investigated the effects of the fixeddose combination established ART /C27lopinavir/ ritonavir (LPV/r, group II) and TDF/FTC /C27darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r, group III). N /C3030 healthy, male volunteers were randomly assigned into one of the 3 study arms. IR was measured using golden standard method of hyperinsulinemic eugylcemic clamp before and 14 days after initiation of study medication. Briefly, a constant insulininfusion (2 mIU/(kg*min)) was infused over two hours, glucoseinfusion was adjusted as necessary to achieve stable glucose levels (target 90 95 mg/dl). All volunteers took the study medica- tion, as verified by pill counting. IR was evaluated using themean glucose disposal rate normalized to body weight (M BW, (mg glucose/min*kg)), as calculated during the clamp. To test for sta- tistical significance of global and pairwise differences in IR ,analyses of variances and the Student's t-test was used. To test for significantchanges in IR within study arms, the paired t-test was used. Results : The enrolled volunteers were young, non-obese, healthy males; no significant differences were detected concerning base- line characteristics (Table 1). Mean IR did not differ between thegroups before treatment (I vs. II vs. III: 11.2 93.2 (SD, standard deviation); n /C3010 vs. 12.5 93.3; n/C309 vs. 11.6 92.5; n/C309). The medication was well tolerated; 2 patients were excluded from analysis due to medical (hypothyroidism) and technical (insulinpump error) reasons. TDF/FTC /C27LPV/r significantly affected IR after 14 day of treatment as compared to baseline (9.2 91.8 vs. 12.593.3; p/C300.037), but /C27DRV/r (11.3 92.4 vs. 11.6 92.5; p/C30n.s.) did.

Presenting author email: gknikolopoulos@gmail.com Introduction : New diagnoses of HIV-1 infections among people who inject drugs (PWID) increased in Athens metropolitan area, Greeceduring 2011. Our aim was to identify potential cross-group transmis- sions between PWID and other risk groups using molecular methods. Methods : HIV-1 subtypes were determined for 711 HIV-1( /C27) PWID sampled during 2011 /C12014. Cross-group transmissions among the PWID were those that originated from other groups as estimated by phylogenetic trees. Specifically cross-group transmissions corre- sponded to viral lineages from PWID that didn't fall into the outbreaktransmission networks or the PWID recombinants. Further phyloge-netic analyses were conducted for the sequences from cross-group transmissions. Results : Among the 711 HIV-1( /C27) PWID, 630 (88.6%) sequences fell within four IDU 6.3%); 48 (6.8%) were recombinants consisting of partial regions originating from the PWID-specific clades. On theother hand, sequences from 33 (4.6%) PWID didn't belong either to the PWID transmission networks or the recombinants, suggesting that they are evidence of potential cross-group transmissions.Phylogenetic analyses (n /C3028) for subtypes A and B detected most frequently among the cross-group transmissions suggested that most of these infections originated from non-PWID transmission networksin Greece and the former Soviet Union countries (A FSU). Specifically we found that nine (75.0%) of the subtype B infections originatedfrom Greece, whereas eight (50.0%) and seven (43.8%) of subtype A strains were of A FSUand Greek origin, respectively (Figure 6). The gender distribution didn't differ significantly between those infectedwithin PWID networks (F: n /C307; M: n /C3026). Conclusions : During the four year period of the HIV-1 outbreak among the PWID in Athens metropolitan area, we estimated that33 (4.6%) of the infections in this group are due to cross-groupinfections. Notably, half of these cross-group infections due to subtype A originate from the large IDU epidemic in Eastern Europe (A FSU). For subtype B, however, the majority of cross-group infections originated from Greece. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20449 TUPDC0102 Clusters of HIV transmission among high-risk populations in Pakistan Laura H Thompson1; Joel O Wertheim2; Tahira Reza3; Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.2Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, San Diego, United States.3Centre for Global Public Health /C1 Pakistan, Islamabad, Pakistan.4Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.5National HIV and Retrovirology Laboratory, JC Wilt Infectious Disease Research Centre,Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Canada. 6Centre for Global Public Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Presenting author email: laura.thompson@alumni.utoronto.ca Introduction : In Pakistan, people who inject drugs (PWID) have a high HIV prevalence ( /C227%), and the prevalence among sex workers (SW) has recently increased. There is considerable geographic hetero- geneity of HIV prevalence, which may reflect multiple subepidemics with unique trajectories, characterized by specific risk contexts,behaviours and sexual or syringe-sharing networks. This study usesgenetic clustering to identify and characterize these HIV subepi- demics of ongoing transmission. Methods : Mapping and integrated behavioural and biological surveillance took place among 16,756 PWID and male (MSW), hijra (HSW) and female (FSW) SW across Pakistan in 2011. Of the 1637persons who tested HIV positive (9.8%), we were able to analyzegp41 sequences from 1153. These sequences were aligned to a reference sequence: HXB2. We identified sequences that were highly similar (51% pairwise Tamura Nei 93 genetic distance) and deemed these persons potential transmission partners. Transmission clusterswere constructed by connecting persons who share potential transmission partners. Clusters were characterized in terms of high risk population group membership and city. Logistic regression wasused for tests of statistical significance. Results : The prevalence of HIV was determined to be 27.3%, 5.2%, 1.6% and 652 were clustered (56.5%) in 87 unique clusters ranging in size from 2 to 96 sequences. Average cluster size was 7.5 (s.d./C3015), although clusters of two predominated. Compared with MSW, PWID were more likely to be clustered (odds ratio /C301.6, p/C300.01). Larger clusters were more likely to span multiple cities and include SW, with an average mixed PWID/SW cluster size of 23.6, compared with cluster sizes of five or two for clusters composedentirely of PWID or SW, respectively. Most PWID who were in clusters were in large clusters of nine or more individuals, whereas HSW and MSW tended to be in clusters of diverse sizes. Abstract TUPDC0101 /C1Figure 1.

Presenting author email: k2tee@um.edu.my Introduction : The HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) is expanding at an alarming rate in Asia. Understanding the dynamics of HIV-1 transmission among MSM through viral sequence analyses may provide essential information on the origin of virallineages and the characteristics of disease spread.Methods : We determined transmission networks of HIV-1 among MSM across countries in East and Southeast Asia. A total of 1856 HIV-1 polymerase gene sequences were obtained from TREAT AsiaStudies to Evaluate Resistance-Monitoring (TASER-M) sites in Hong Kong,Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines between 2006 and 2011. Time-stamped sequence datasets of HIV-1 subtype B (n /C30144) and CRF01_AE (n /C30186) from antiretroviral-naive MSM were identified and subjected to spatiotemporal analysis using Bayesian phylodyna- mic methods. A transmission network was defined as a phyloge- netic cluster ( ]2 isolates) supported by /C2190% bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probability value of 1 at the tree node.Results : Phylogenetic reconstructions showed that 68% of HIV-1 subtype B and 46% of CRF01_AE sequences were grouped in 50 transmission networks of various sizes (mean size /C305.6, range /C30 2/C132 sequences), with subtype B sequences having higher ten- dency to form a network (p B0.0001). With additional representative sequences from China, Mongolia and Myanmar from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database, 34 networks involving154 subtype B-infected individuals and 16 networks involving 125CRF01_AE-infected individuals were observed. Location mapping showed that the MSM networks in East and Southeast Asia were mostly localized (78%) in their respective countries, with 22%spanned beyond a single country. Genealogy-based analysis to esti- mate the divergence time for each transmission network indicatedthe continued emergence of new networks over the past three decades. The uninterrupted growth of sub-epidemics of variouscluster sizes suggests the role of transmission networks as a con- tinuous driving force of the epidemic among MSM in Asia. Conclusions : Despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy in Asia, our analysis showed continued regional emergence of recentHIV-1 subtype B and CRF01_AE networks among MSM. Strategies such as early diagnosis and treatment as prevention to reduce transmission risks among sero-discordant partners need to beexpanded across the region. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20451 TUPDC0104 Estimating the size of men who have sex with men (MSM) using modified capture-recapture method based on network sampling in the capital city of Georgia in 2014 Tbilisi, Georgia.2Global Health Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.3Regional Knowledge Hub and WHO Collaborating Centre for HIV Surveillance, Kerman, Islamic Republic of Iran.4Center for Information and Counseling on Reproductive Health /C1 Tanadgoma, Tbilisi, Georgia. Presenting author email: l.sulaberidze@curatio.com Introduction : Estimates of the number of people at high risk for HIV infection are crucial for prevention, treatment and care planning. Taking into consideration that Georgia is the country, where HIV prevalence is concentrated among men who have sex with men(MSM) and information on the size of this key population waslacking, we conducted the study using seven different population size estimation methods in Tbilisi, Georgia. We want to focus on a new method proposed by Dombrowski among methamphetamineusers in 2012. This represents capture-recapture using networksampling technique. Among MSM, we first time applied this method with few modifications. Methods : Modified capture-recapture requires singe sample, which for our study was 210 MSM 18 years and older recruited throughRespondent Driven Sampling. The study participants were asked about their personal characteristics (approximate height, weight, hair colour and ethnicity) and so called ''telefunken codes'' derived fromthe last four digits of their own mobile number. In difference to the original method that used six personal identifiers, we dropped eye Abstract TUPDC0104 /C1Table 1.

This represented the capture. Afterwards, the study participants were asked to providethe similar characteristics appealing to their five MSM contacts randomly selected from mobile phone directories. This represented the recapture. Some respondents (2.38%) did not have mobilephones with them and some did not have five MSM contacts in theirmobile phone directory. To get to the final estimates Lincoln- Peterson method was used. Results : Using the four-identifier categorical variables and the ''telefunken code,'' we identified 36 matches between the two cap-tures (205 captured and 770 recaptured). This led to the population size of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9% /C11.6%) of the adult male population. The results were comparable to those from other methods used in ourstudy (see Table 1). Conclusions : Despite the study limitations /C1difficulty to get the ''tele- funken codes'' for the recapture phase /C1modified capture-recapture method provides reasonable population size estimates for MSM whencompared to the median estimates and their boundaries of other more established methods. Estimating size of MSM through modified capture-recapture method appeared to be feasible, simple, cost-saving and effective method that is valuable for future application. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20452 TUPDC0105 Network-level factors associated with IPV Behavior, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Durham, United States.2Maternal and Child Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Durham, United States.3Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Muhimbili University of Health andAllied Sciences, Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania. Presenting author email: mulawa@live.unc.edu Introduction : Research suggests that characteristics of an individual's social network may influence intimate partner violence (IPV) perpe-tration among men in sub-Saharan Africa. For example, studies indi- cate that network-level measures of gender norms or IPV acceptance may be associated with IPV perpetration. However, to date, no studieshave identified network-level factors associated with IPV among EastAfrican youth. We used data from our on-going HIV prevention trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania with 1268 men, ages 15 /C159 years (mean/C3026), nested within 60 networks of randomly selected social clubs called ''camps.'' The purpose of this study was to assess thedegree to which variance in men's IPV perpetration was attributed to camp membership and to determine the effect of camp-level norms (gender norms and IPV attitudes) on IPV perpetration.Methods : We used 2-level hierarchical linear models to model the relationship between individual and camp-level characteristics andpast-year physical IPV perpetration, assessed using an adapted version of the World Health Organization violence against womeninstrument. Camp-level gender norms were computed by averaging responses among all camp members to an adapted version of the Gender Equitable Men Scale. All individual-level variables weregroup-mean centred to facilitate decomposition of between andwithin-camp effects. We estimated an unconditional random effects model to determine the proportion of IPV variance attributable to camp membership. Subsequent models sequentially introducedindividual-level demographic/control variables, camp-level normsand individual-level norms. proportion of variance in IPV perpetration (3.1%) was due to between-camp differences ( t 00/C300.0054, p /C300.01). Increasing levels of camp equitable gender norms were significantly associated with decreasing IPV perpetration ( g/C30/C28 0.167, p /C300.04), and this association after controlling for individual-levelgender norms. Camp-level norms regarding IPV acceptance were notassociated with IPV perpetration. Conclusions : Studies have found a strong association between IPV and HIV. We found that membership in social groups with equitablegender norms reduced men's risk of perpetrating IPV, even afteradjusting for their own views about gender norms and the accep- tability of violence. This finding highlights the importance of multi- level HIV and IPV interventions that simultaneously addressindividual risk factors while making gender norms more equitable within social networks. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20453 TUPDD0101 Gender differences in HIV testing behaviours by community- level and individual-level stigma in rural South Africa Sarah Treves-Kagan1; Alison El Ayadi2; Audrey Lippman1 1Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco, United States.2Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Bixby Center for Global ReproductiveHealth, University of California, San Francisco, United States. 3Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States.4Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Clinical Medicine, Wits Reproductive Health and HIVInstitute (WRHI), University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 5Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Medical Research Council/Wits Rural Public Healthand Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt), University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 6Collaborative Research Network, University of New England, Armidale,Australia.Presenting author email: sarah.treves-kagan@ucsf.edu Abstract TUPDD0101 /C1Figure 1. Testing under various stigma scenarios.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 107Introduction : Despite national testing campaigns and increased access to HIV treatment, stigma remains a significant barrier totesting in South Africa. A nuanced understanding of stigma and testing is instrumental in refining intervention programming. Stigma can be examined at either the individual or community level and mayoperate differentially by gender. Further, estimating HIV testinguptake achievable through stigma reduction interventions is critical for understanding potential impact. Methods : We examined the relationship between anticipated HIV stigma at individual and community levels on recent HIV testing, stratified by gender, using data from a population-based sample of 1126 adults aged 18 /C135 residing in 22 villages in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Anticipated HIV stigma, or expectations of discrimina-tion should one become HIV positive, was measured using a 9-item scale and dichotomized as any versus nostigma. Community-level stigma was defined as the proportion of individuals within eachvillage reporting any anticipated stigma. We assessed associationsof community and individual stigma and HIV testing for men and women. We then used multi-level regression models to estimate the potential effect of changing community-level stigma to improvetesting uptake using the g-computation algorithm. Analyses were weighted to account for the survey design. Results : Men tested less frequently (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.14 /C10.33) and reported more individual anticipated stigma (OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.6 /C1 10.1) than women. Men reporting no individual-level stigma (vs. some) were 48% more likely to have tested (p /C300.08). For women, testing behaviour was not associated with individual anticipatedstigma but for each percentage point reduction in community-levelstigma the likelihood of testing increased by 3% (p /C300.03). We modelled gains in HIV testing at different levels of community stigma (Figure 1). For example, results indicate a potential 15% interven-tion gain in HIV testing among women if community-level stigma decreased by 5%. Changing community-level stigma did not result in significant gains for men. Conclusions : Our data indicates that HIV-related stigma influences HIV testing for men and women through different pathways. Stigma reduction programs may need to consider gender differences and tailor activities to the target population. Longitudinal research isneeded to confirm projections and direction of effect. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20454TUPDD0102 Men ''missing'' from population-based HIV testing: insights from Chamie3; Moses R Kamya2and Diane Havlir3 1Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, University of California /C1San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, United States. 2Infectious Disease Research Collaboration (IDRC), Kampala, Uganda. 3Medicine, University of California /C1San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, United States.4Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Kisumu, Kenya.Presenting author email: carol.camlin@ucsf.edu Introduction : Men's uptake of HIV testing will be critical to the success of test and treat strategies in generalized epidemics. We used qualitative research methods to identify cultural factors and com- munity level processes that influence HIV testing uptake in thecontext of an ongoing test and treat trial of 334,479 persons in EastAfrica (SEARCH, NCT #01864603). Methods : In-depth interviews, participant observation and focus group discussions were used to evaluate contextual factors in communities that influenced uptake of baseline HIV testing. The study used a hybrid model of mobile HIV testing including community healthcampaigns (CHC) followed by home-based testing (HBT) for non-CHCattendees. Data were collected in eight rural communities in Uganda and Kenya and interpreted using Atlas.ti software. Analytical codes were defined and applied by an 8-person research team on the basis oftheory and the empirical data, and iteratively refined during theanalysis process. Results : Structural barriers to male participation in community health campaigns led to reduced participation in CHCs and HBT: informal sector labour opportunities for men often require extended absences from rural households. Participants reported for example that duringplanting season, men needed to guard fields from monkeys fromdawn until nightfall; in lakeshore communities, fishermen travel long distances and off-load fish at multiple beaches, using multiple residences and temporary lodgings. Community leaders were criticalin outreach to promote CHC attendance, but power differentialsbetween elder and younger men may have contributed to hetero- geneous mobilization.

Men often tested ''by proxy,'' inferring their HIV status from the test results of wives. Yet debatesabout HIV risks were vigorous, with many men questioning traditional masculine gender norms; moreover, the promise of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prolong health appeared to motivate many men toparticipate in testing. Conclusions : Mobile testing reduces but does not eliminate barriers to men's participation; however, the promise of ART may be enablingchanges in male gender norms related to testing. Findings may be useful for developing novel strategies to improve male engagement in test and treat efforts. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20455 TUPDD0103 Examining the relationship between paediatric PMTCT outcomes and of partner Skowronska; Emeka Okonji and Esca Scheepers Department of Programs and Technical Support, mothers2mothers, Cape Town, South Africa. Introduction : The mothers2mothers' (m2m) Mentor Mother pro- gramme empowers pregnant women and new mothers to makeinformed decisions about their maternal and reproductive health as well as their infants' health, through provision of peer education and psychosocial support. The m2m's 2013 annual evaluation showed thatdiscordancy was negatively associated with the uptake of paediatric prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services. HIV- positive mothers who knew their male partners were HIV-negativewere less likely to bring their infants for PCR testing at 6 /C18 weeks (OR/C300.60, p/C300.005), or for a follow-up test at 18 months (OR /C300.75, p/C300.017), compared to mothers who knew their partners were HIV-positive. The aim of this study is to further investigate the rolethat knowledge of one's partner's HIV status plays in the uptake ofpaediatric PMTCT services. Methods : Secondary analysis of m2m's 2013 internal programme evaluation data was conducted. Data comprised of a representative random sample of 5592 HIV-positive clients' longitudinal records(routinely maintained by Mentor Mothers), enrolled from Marchthrough May 2012 in six African countries. The relationship between knowledge of partner status and uptake of paediatric PMTCT services was investigated through bivariate analysis (chi-square) and binarylogistic regression analysis using STATA 12. Results : Knowledge of partner HIV status was significantly associated with uptake of paediatric PMTCT services. Mothers who knew theirpartner's HIV status were more likely to take up paediatric PMTCTservices compared to those who did not know their partner's status. The likelihood of improved uptake of PMTCT services was the highest among mothers who knew they were in a concordant relationship.There was no significant relationship between knowledge of partnerstatus and uptake of infant ART.Conclusions : Additional primary research on the effects of con- cordancy and discordancy on PMTCT outcomes is recommended. Oursecondary analysis suggests that uptake of paediatric PMTCT services is more likely to occur amongst clients who know that they are in a concordant relationship. This evidence supports m2m's inclusion of atailored serodiscordant couples education and support interventionto facilitate mutual disclosure of HIV status in partners, especially in the context of Option B /C27, thus improving outcomes in the postnatal care cascade. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20456 TUPDD0104 Who benefits from partner services in Mozambique?

Presenting author email: golden@u.washington.edu Introduction : Notifying partners of persons newly diagnosed with HIV can help identify undiagnosed infections and link people to care.Assisted partner services (APS) offers persons with newly diagnosedHIV infection help notifying and getting sex partners tested. APS is not widely available in sub-Saharan Africa, including Mozambique. We explore who benefits from APS as compared to passive servicesthrough a pilot programme in an urban, public clinic in Maputo, Mozambique. Methods : Between June and September 2014, four community health workers (CHWs) offered APS to 223 index patients (IPs) with recently diagnosed HIV: 220 accepted and 206 (94%) were retained at eight weeks. CHWs used structured interviews to collect data atbaseline, four and eight weeks. At baseline, CHWs counselled IPs to notify partners and encourage their HIV testing, but did not offer to notify partners directly. At four weeks, with consent, CHWs notifiedpartners to encourage testing. We used logistic regression, adjustedfor clustering, to define the odds that APS increased HIV testing uptake and identified new HIV infections, setting significance at p50.05. Results : Of 206 IPs, 79% were female, 73% were married and 31% named/C211 sex partner. IPs named 283 partners, 278 had complete date: 59% are spouses. Of 192 people tested, 103 (53.6%) testedafter APS at four weeks. Of 103 HIV positive diagnoses, 55 (53.4) Abstract TUPDD0103 /C1Table 1.

APS appeared to increase bothpartner HIV testing and identification of HIV-infected partners across a range of subgroups (Table 1). The magnitude of impact varied. In multivariate analysis, APS appeared more effective among personsin ongoing sexual relationships and less effective among personswith multiple sex partners, a group in whom partner testing and HIV identification remained relatively low. Conclusions : APS significantly improves HIV testing uptake and case- finding among current sex partners: those in monogamous pairsbenefit most. These findings suggest that the model of APS piloted in Mozambique might be most profitably focused on persons in ongoing partnerships and highlights the need for better interven-tions for persons with multiple sex partners. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20457 TUPDD0105 Male partner acceptance of home-based syphilis and HIV testing offered to couples during pregnancy Jennifer Mark1; John Kinuthia2; Alfred Washington, Seattle, United States. 2Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya. 4School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. Presenting author email: jmark55@uw.edu Introduction : Testing partners for HIV in the antenatal period is an effective way to bring HIV services to couples. Leveraging antenatalHIV testing with point of care (POC) diagnostics for other sexuallytransmitted infections (STI) may improve male partner treatment services among couples. Methods : We conducted a prospective study among male partners of pregnant women who received home-based couple HIV testingand education (HOPE) following a first antenatal visit in Kisumu, Kenya. From April to July 2014, rapid POC syphilis testing (SD Bioline Syphilis 3.0) was added to the package of services for men and thosewith positive results were referred to the clinic for treatment. Weassessed men's acceptance of testing and intention to seek clinic- based treatment and calculated an odds ratio to examine correlation between uptake of syphilis and HIV testing. Results : Data were available for 73 (83%) couples receiving a HOPE visit. Men were on average 26 years of age (IQR: 22, 29). At study entry, most men reported having previously tested for HIV (93%, n/C3068), of whom 7% reported being of known HIV positive status (n/C305) and 80% reported knowing their female partner's HIV status (n/C3059). Of 73 men, 67 accepted syphilis testing (92%) among whom 64 intended to attend clinic STI treatment if they received a positive syphilis result (95%). HIV prevalence among the men was14.7% andone man ( B1%) was syphilis positive. In this group, 61 (83%) accepted both syphilis and HIV tests. Three men (4%) refused both tests and three men (4%) accepted HIV alone. Six men (8%) accepted syphilis alone, of whom two reported having been previously testedas HIV-positive. If a man accepted HIV testing, he was 10-fold as likely to accept syphilis testing, compared to a man who refused HIV testing (OR: 10.2; 95% CI: 1.05 /C189.3; p/C300.02). Conclusions : In a high HIV and low syphilis setting, home-based education and POC syphilis testing of male partners during preg-nancy is highly acceptable when coupled with HIV testing and may encourage men to seek clinic-based STI services. Integration with HIV testing appears feasible, and syphilis test uptake is highly correlatedwith HIV test uptake. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20458Abstract TUPDD0104 /C1Table 1.

Presenting author email: christopher.pina@med.einstein.yu.edu Introduction : Understanding factors influencing ART adherence is needed to optimize treatment responses for HIV infected men who have sex with men (MSM) and Hijra/transgender women (TGW) in India. The objective of this formative study was to determine rates ofART uptake and adherence and explore potential factors associatedwith adherence in Indian MSM and TGW. Methods : We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Hindi among all HIV positive MSM and TGW on ART accessing support ser- vices at a LGBT community based organization in Mumbai between July and September 2014. Non-adherence was measured by self-report and defined as missing any doses (i.e. B100% adherent) in the past one month and three months. Potential correlates of adherence assessed were soc iodemographics, medication side-effects, depression (CESD-10), self-efficacy (GSE), internalizedhomophobia/stigma and medication beliefs using chi-square ort-tests. Results : Of the 300 individuals registered in the organization's HIV support programme, 28.3% (85/300) were eligible for ART by current country standards (e.g. CD4 /C30350 or having an OI) with 22% (65/300) currently on ART. Of those most free ART through govern- ment clinics. Overall, 32% (21/65) were non-adherent in the past one month and 45% (29/65) in past three months. Correlates(pB0.05) of non-adherence were similar for one month and three months and were associated with younger age, non-Kothi identity (MSM subgroup), alcohol use, having sex with women, feelinghealthy and negative medication beliefs but was not directlyassociated with depression, internalized homophobia, or medication self-efficacy. Conclusions : In one of the first studies of adherence among MSM and TGW in India, ART treatment uptake and adherence were suboptimal. Modifiable factors associated with adherence may serve as targets for interventions to support adherence. Further work ishowever needed to verify self-report measures with biological out- comes and confirm findings in other samples of Indian MSM and TGW. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20459 WE/C1WEDNESDAY WEPDA0101 Evolution KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.2AIDS Virus Research Unit, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.3RagonInstitute of MGH, University of Cambridge, MIT & Harvard, Boston, United States.Presenting author email: bongiwendlovu4@ukzn.ac.za Introduction : The development of a preventative HIV-1 vaccine will most likely require induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies(BCN). Neutralizing antibodies develop in almost all HIV-1 infected individuals, however they develop months following HIV-1 infection and they are strain-specific. The development of BCN antibodiesoccurs only in 20 /C130% of HIV-1 infected individuals. However, the mechanism that leads to the development of BCN is unknown and not all epitopes have been identified. The aim of the study was to evaluate pathways and mechanisms that lead to the development ofbroadly neutralizing antibodies. Methods : Twenty individuals with acute HIV-1 infection were identified and followed longitudinally for three years in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. A panel of 18 viruses (6 subtype A, 6B and 6C) was used to screen thepatients for neutralizing antibodies at 2 /C13 years post-infection using the TZM-bl neutralization assay. The patients that developed broadly neutralizing antibodies were followed up longitudinally at 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 71, 88, 100, 124, 150, 200 weeks to determine the timing ofemergence of the BCNs. Specificity of BCNs was determined using single point mutagenesis at 3 years post-infection. Results : Three out of 20 individuals (AS3-268, AS2-1037, AS2-358) developed broadly neutralizing antibodies. AS3-268 developedpotent BCN at three years post-infection and it targets N276A glycan on the CD4 binding site of gp120. AS2-1037 developed potent broadly neutralizing activity peaking at two yearspost-infection and it targets N332A glycan on the V3 loop of gp120.AS2-358 developed BCNs peaking at two years post-infection and it did not map to any known specific epitope. Conclusions : Broadly neutralizing antibodies could be detected at approximately one year post-infection and they targeted differentepitopes on the viral envelope. Work is currently in progress to assess the maturation of breadth and to assess antibody-virus co-evolution. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20460 WEPDA0102 HLA-B*58:02-specific benefit of MRKAd5 Gag/Pol/Nef population Ellen Michelle Leitman1; Jacob Hurst2; Masahiko Mori1; JR 1Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.2Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Nuffield Oxford, United Kingdom.3Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, HIV Vaccine TrialsNetwork, Seattle, United States. 4South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa.5HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.Presenting author email: ellen.leitman@st-hughs.ox.ac.uk Introduction : The MRKAd5 Gag/Pol/Nef vaccine increased the risk of HIV acquisition. However, the Step study suggested an HLA-specificbenefit in viral setpoint to vaccinees who subsequently became infected. The Phambili trial, using the same MRKAd5 vaccine, presented an opportunity to investigate the existence of an HLA-specific effect in a genetically distinct South African population. Gag-specific CD8 T-cell responses restricted by protective South African HLA alleles such as HLA-B*57 are associated with successful control of infection, while disease-susceptible alleles such as HLA-B*58:02present non-Gag epitopes and are associated with rapid progression. We hypothesized that the MRKAd5 Gag/Pol/Nef vaccine might redirect responses towards Gag in HLA-B*58:02 /C27Phambili subjects who would not target it naturally.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 111Methods : Viral loads (VL), counts, HLA types and ELISpot anti-HIV CD8 T-cell responses were analyzed in subjects blinded to vaccine/placebo assignment. All data analyzed were from ART-na \u00a8ve subjects. Results : HLA-B*58:02 was the most prevalent allele (population frequency 23%). HLA-B*58:02 /C27vaccinees (n 215,500, lower VL calculated using all longitudinal pre-ART data via a mixed effects model (p B0.001, Figure 1a), reached CD4B350 cells/ ml slower (p /C300.002, Figure 1b) and showed an increase in Gag breadth in ELISpot assays (p /C300.04) compared to HLA- B*58:02 /C27placebo-recipients. Conclusions : In addition to the known increased risk of HIV acquisition resulting from the MRKAd5 Gag/Pol/Nef vaccine, these current data suggest a therapeutic effect of the same vaccine in subjects expressing HLA-B*58:02, an African HLA allele strongly associated withrapid progression in natural HIV infection. HLA-B*58:02 /C27vaccinees showed a lower viral setpoint and slower time to CD4 B350 cells/ ml, associated with increased Gag-specific ELISpot responses. Caveats tothe study include limitation of ELISpot assays to only 60 of 100 studysubjects, selected based on cell availability; and of HLA typing to 79 subjects, based on material availability. These factors potentially introduced unintended selection bias effects. Nonetheless, these dataon ART-na \u00a8ve subjects are consistent with Step studies, indicating a beneficial therapeutic MRKAd5 HLA-specific effect that in South Africa includes the most prevalent HLA-B allele, HLA-B*58:02. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20461 WEPDA0103 HIV-1 subtype C is subtypes Todd Demarco1; Wes Rountree1; Thomas Denny1and Feng Gao1 1Departments of Medicine, Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, United States.2Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, United States.Presenting author email: todd.demarco@dm.duke.edu Introduction : HIV-1 subtype C accounts for about 50% of the global HIV-1 infections. It is the predominant subtype in India,Ethiopia and countries in southern Africa. However, virologicalattributes to this unique epidemiological pattern have not yet been fully defined. Methods : A total of 207 HIV-1 positive plasma or established strains were cultured and expanded to higher titre stocks by culturing inPBMCs from HIV-1 negative donors. Near full-length genome (NFLG) sequences were obtained by amplifying two overlapping half genomes. The newly obtained sequences were aligned to the HIV-1whole genome reference sequences for subtyping. Viral genomecopy numbers, tissue culture infection doses (TCID) and p24 concentrations were determined for virus stocks and compared via linear regression among major subtypes. Mann-Whitney U testswere used for the infectivity comparisons at the alpha 0.05 level. Results : Analysis of NFLG sequences showed that these viruses belonged to subtype A1 (16), subtype B (48), subtype C (53), subtype D (10), CRF01_AE (12), other subtypes and CRFs (F1, F2 G, CRF02, and CRF022; each and URFs (45). Only subtypes with]10 NFLG sequences were subjected to further analysis. No biologically relevant differences (a 0.5 log 10difference) among all compared subtypes were observed for three measurements: viral genome copy numbers, TCID, and p24 concentrations. The onlyexception was that the TCID of subtype C was 0.51 log higher thanthat (p /C300.04). The infectivity per viral genome copy) was the highest for subtype C (0.00452 TCID/RNA copy) and was significantly higher than those of all four compared subtypes(A1, B, D and CRF01_AE; p /C300.0286, p /C300.0004, p B0.001 and p/C300.0205, respectively). The p24/RNA copy ratios of subtypes C and B (0.13 and 0.12 pg/RNA copy, respectively) were the highestand were significantly higher than those of subtypes A1 and D(pB0.05), but similar to that of CRF01_AE. Conclusions : The high infectivity of HIV-1 subtype C may give it more replication advantages and allow it to disseminate faster in HIV-1 infected populations in some geographic areas compared to othersubtypes. High infectivity may play a critical role in the globalepidemic of subtype C. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20462 WEPDA0104 Functional differences in the viral accessory protein Nef between major HIV-1 subtypes Aaron Johnson; Rajesh Jacob; Mansour Haeryfar and Jimmy Dikeakos Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.Presenting author email: aaronjohnson13@gmail.com Introduction : The HIV-1 accessory protein Nef is essential for HIV-1 pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. By hijacking the cellular trafficking machinery Nef is able to alter T cell activation, increaseviral replication and permit viral immune evasion via downregulationof the cell-surface receptors CD28, CD4 and MHC I, respectively. However, only recently have these functions been studied outside of Abstract WEPDA0102 /C1Figure 1.

This proposal aims to investigate how the high degree of HIV-1 genetic diversity impacts Nef function. Methods : An HIV-1 based lentiviral expression system was used to express Nef proteins from 10 group M subtypes (A1, A2, B, C, F1, F2,G, H, J and K) in the context of an HIV-1 infection. T cell lines wereinfected with pseudoviruses encoding Nef proteins and analyzed for surface levels of CD28 and MHC-I using fluorescent antibody staining and flow surface weremeasured transfecting CD4 /C27HeLa cells with expression plasmids encoding Nef-GFP fusion followed by fluorescent antibody staining and flow cytometry. Nef expression was determined by a combination of western blot analysis and flow cytometry to measurefluorophore fused Nef proteins.Results : Our results MHC CD28 CD4 are differentially downregulated between HIV-1 Notably, sub- type C Nef, the most common subtype globally, was significantly lessefficient at downregulating MHC I and CD28 when compared to the laboratory strain NL4.3. Subtype G Nef, found predominantly in Central and West Africa, was significantly less efficient at down-regulating all three cell surface receptors. Differences in down-regulation efficiency for all three receptors were attributed to variations in Nef protein expression. Conclusions : This study represents a comprehensive analysis of Nef function among 10 HIV-1 subtypes and adds to the growingevidence that HIV-1 genetic diversity impacts viral protein func- tion. Due to the pathogenic role Nef plays in an HIV-1 infection, these results may help explain recent studies that show differ-ences in disease progression in individuals infected with different HIV-1 subtypes. Finally, these findings support further study of all major HIV-1 subtypes and emphasize the need to consider subtypedifferences when developing alternative treatment options. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20463 WEPDA0105 Characterization of HIV-1C gp120 in recently Botswana.2School of Medicine, University Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana. Presenting author email: tmohammed@bhp.org.bw Introduction : Viral diversity provides a major challenge in the development of a vaccine against HIV-1. A potential target forHIV-1 vaccines is gp120 envelope protein, which is involved in viral entry and is a target of the host immune system. It has been shown that Envelope characteristics have a role to play in diseaseprogression. However some studies have demonstrated conflictingresults. In this study, we aim to analyze HIV-1gp120 characteristics, specifically: potential N- glycosylation sites, amino acid sequence length and net electric charge in cell associated and cell freeRNA derived from recently and chronically infected individuals inBotswana. Methods : This was a retrospective study using stored samples collected from treatment na \u00a8ve HIV-1C infected cohorts at Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership, representing recently infected and long term infection as determined by serological assays forrecency and longitudinal follow up. A 1200 base pairs fragment of V1to V5 region of gp120 was amplified by nested PCR and sequenced on both strands using Big Dye Technology in proviral DNA and cell free RNA. Potential N-glycosylation sites were determined using LosAlamos HIV sequence database while subtype was assigned using REGA HIV subtyping tool.Results : There was a significant increase in amino acid sequence length of V2 (p /C300.027) and V4 (p /C300.0099) in proviral DNA in the chronic stage as compared to the recent stage of infection. Similar changes were also observed in cell free RNA in V4 (p /C300.0074). In addition, the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites inproviral DNA was significantly increased in chronic infection in V4(p/C300.0253). No significant changes in net electric charges were observed. There was an association between viral load and V4 region (pB0.001). All samples were classified as subtype C. Conclusions : The increase in amino acid sequence length and potential N-Glycosylation sites in the V2 and V4 region may be essential in disease progression. The changes observed in V2 and V4 warrant further investigation. A clear understanding of envelopecharacteristics is important for development and design of new vaccine and therapeutics. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20464 WEPDA0106LB Early Quebec, Maladies Infectieuses, Quebec, Canada.2Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec, Quebec, Canada.3CNRS FR Paris Descartes, Paris, France. Presenting author Introduction : Follicular T of CD4 T lym- phocytes, are essential for B-cell activation and provide help to B cells in the production of antigen-specific antibodies. Although severalstudies have analyzed the dynamics of Tfh cells in the context of AIDSby analyzing peripheral blood and LNs of HIV-infected patients, para- doxically, none of these studies in HIV/SIV infection have addressed the role of Tfh cells in the primary organ of B-cell activation, the spleen.Methods : To address these questions, we have infected rhesus macaques with SIVmac251 (20 AID50). Animals were killed at different time points post-infection and lymphoid organs were recovered. Tfhcells (PD-1 highCXCR5/C27) subsets were also analyzed. CD4 T-cell subsets were sorted and SIV DNA was quantified by RT-PCR. Results : Herein, we demonstrated for the first time that the percentages and numbers of splenic Tfh cells decrease early duringthe acute phase in macaques infected with SIV. This profound loss and abnormal differentiation of Tfh is also associated with the loss of memory B-cell subsets. Moreover, SIV DNA is detected in splenicTfh cells early after infection. Finally, our results showed that thefrequency of splenic Tfh and memory B cells are higher in slow- progressor compared to rapid progressor RMs at the chronic phase. Conclusions : Altogether, our results demonstrate the drastic deple- tion of splenic memory B cells, which might be related to the loss of fully maturated Tfh cells. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20562 WEPDB0101 Reliability of rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 INSTIon plasma and capillary blood for diagnosis of non B subtypes andcirculating recombinant forms of HIV-1 circulating in de Re \u00b4fe\u00b4rence des Paris, nzenguig@yahoo.fr8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 113Introduction :Point-of-care or ''rapid'' serologic assays for HIV are widely used in resources-limited setting. Their evaluation in the fieldcarried out independently of the fabricant is crucial to assess their capability to accurately detect non-B subtypes or circulating re- combinant form (CRF) of HIV-1. Our objective was to evaluate the HIV-1/HIV-2 INSTI test (distributed by Nephrotec, Rungis, France) for the diagnosis of non-B subtypes and CRF of HIV-1 circulating in Gabon, a country of wide genetic diversity.Methods : A panel of 250 HIV-positive and 250 HIV-negative plasmas was prospectively collected after informed consent in adult patients attending the Laboratoire National de Re \u00b4fe\u00b4rence des MST et du SIDA, Libreville, as recommended by the WHO (Service deliveryapproaches to HIV testing and counselling: A strategic policy framework; 2012). The reference HIV serology consisted of Immuno- Comb II HIV1&2 BiSpot (Inverness Medical Innovations, Yavne, Israel)as screening test followed by confirmatory Western blot (New LavBlot I, Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). All HIV-positive plasma were to HIV genotyping by polnested amplicons sequencing, sequences byGenotyping software from NCBI. A subgroup of 1 out of 10 patientswas also tested in parallel with finger-stick whole blood INSTI test. Results : All HIV-1 belong to HIV-1 group M with broad HIV-1 genetic diversity as assessed 250 HIV-infected and 250 HIV-negative plasmas, 250 and 249, respectively, were positive or negative by INSTI. Thus, INSTI test sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 99.6%, respectively;positive and negative predictive values in Gabon were 91.5% and 100%, respectively. For the major subtype CRF_02AG, sensitivity and specificity were 100%. Finally, all 50 patients tested in parallel usingplasma and capillary blood and were identified similarly.Conclusions : HIV-1/HIV-2 INSTI test is highly reliable for the detection of various non-B HIV-1 antibodies, both in plasma and capillary blood; and it fulfils the WHO criteria for HIV test prequalifica-tion. The rapid INSTI test could be useful for HIV screening in Gabon, as well as in other sub-Saharan African countries. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20465 WEPDB0102 Evaluation of the Roche COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Qualitative version 2 assay onwhole blood Lancet Laboratories and BARC- SA, Johannesburg, South Africa.2Diagnostics Division, Roche Products (PTY) LTD, Johannesburg, South Africa. Presenting author email: carole.wallis@lancet.co.zaIntroduction : Roche recently been released fortesting of dried blood spot (DBS) for infants and plasma for adults that are antiretroviral (ARV) na \u00a8ve; however, ARV status of patients is often unknown. This study evaluated the use of whole blood (WB)for HIV-1 detection using TaqMan v2 qual. Methods : 133 samples (125 EDTA, 8 Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) WB) were used with known HIV-1 status (positive, n /C3075; negative, n /C3058) as per Roche Amplicor HIV-1 assay v1.5 (Roche v1.5). EDTA samples were split: 1 mL plasma, 100 mL WB and 70 mL DBS. Samples were processed using TaqMan v2 qual according to manufacturer's instructions and results com- pared to Roche v1.5. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for each sample type and compared to EDTA plasma viral load.Seven WB samples (HIV-1 positive, n /C304; HIV-1 negative, n /C303) were evaluated for reproducibility and precision using the TaqMan v2 qual. Results : Of the 69 Roche v1.5 HIV-1 positive samples, 68 were detected using TaqMan v2 qual DBS v2 qual plasma. HIV-1 positive samplesmissed had either a viral load of not detected or B20 RNA copies/mL. The TaqMan v2 qual plasma samples missed 13% of HIV-1 positive samples. No false positives were observed across the three differentmatrixes evaluated. Of the 8 VQA WB samples tested on TaqMan v2 qual and /C306, HIV-1 positive; n /C302, HIV-1 negative). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are detailed in the table below. Reproducibility and precision was100% for all samples tested. Conclusions : TaqMan v2 qual using DBS or WB had the highest sensitivity when compared to Roche v1.5 (98.5%). Plasma samples on TaqMan v2 qual missed 13% positive of microbicide use, pre-exposure prophylaxis and reportedpoor disclosure of prior ARV use, this study indicates that plasma samples are not the ideal sample matrix for testing adults when ARV exposure is unknown. The high percentage of adult samples thatwere missed would have serious implications for decreasing HIV-1transmission rates. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20466 WEPDB0103 CD4 count at antiretroviral therapy initiation and the risk of loss to follow-up: results from a multicentre cohort study Anna Grimsrud1; Morna Cornell1,2; Michael Schomaker2; (IeDEA-SA) 1Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.2Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology & Research, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. 3Center for Global Health & Development, Boston University, Boston, United States.4Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 5Department of Epidemiology, Boston University, Boston, United States.6Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.7Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch,South Africa. 8Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. 9Me\u00b4decins Sans Frontie `res, Cape Town, South Africa.10Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, University of KwaZulu-Natal,Mtubatuba, South Africa. 11Division of International and Environmental Health, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine,Abstract WEPDB0102 /C1Table 1.

However data on the relationship between CD4 count at ART initiation and loss to follow-up (LTFU) are limited and conflicting. We investigated the association between higher CD4 counts at ARTinitiation and LTFU in South Africa (SA). Methods : All adults initiating ART between 2008 and 2012 at 3 public sector sites in SA were included. LTFU was defined as no clinicvisit in the six months before database closure. The Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox's models examined the relationship between CD4 count at ART initiation and 24-month LTFU. Estimates of correctedLTFU were generated adjusting observed LTFU for unascertaineddeaths through linkage via identification numbers (IDs) with the SA National Population Register. Final models were adjusted for patient demographics, year of ART initiation, and programme expansion. Results : Among 17,038 patients, the median CD4 at initiation increased from 119 (interquartile range (IQR): 54 /C1180) in 2008 to 257 (IQR: 175 /C1318) in 2012. In unadjusted models, observed LTFU was associated with both CD4 counts B100 cells/mL and CD4 counts]300 cells/mL compared with a CD4 count 150 /C1 199 cells/mL. After adjustment, patients with counts ]300 cells/mL were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.12 /C11.63) times as likely to be LTFU after 24 months compared to those with a CD4 count 150 /C1199 cells/mL. Correction CD4 counts ]300 cells/mL and LTFU persisted (Figure 1). Increases in LTFU observed in patients with CD4 counts ]300 cells/ mL was greatest in the first three months on treatment. In sensi-tivity analyses imputing missing CD4 values at ART initiation andusing inverse probability weighting to account for missing IDs, the association between higher CD4 counts and increased LTFU persisted.Conclusions : Patients initiating ART at higher CD4 counts may be at increased risk for LTFU, particularly early after ART initiation. Withprogrammes initiating patients at progressively higher CD4 counts models of ART delivery need to be reoriented to support long- term retention. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20467 WEPDB0104 Clinical decision and outcomes of patients suspected of treatment failure and tested for HIV-viral load at the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), Kampala, Uganda Mark Steven Uganda.2Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.3Infectious Disease Institute, Kampala, Uganda.4PCT, Infectious Disease Institute, Kampala, Uganda.Presenting author email: mnsumba@idi.co.ug Introduction : WHO now recommends routine viral load (VL) mon- itoring, and the scale up of this has started in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent publications from the region suggest that often patients withdetectable VL delay switching to second line ART or are not switched.Objective : To evaluate the outcome of patients with a VL /C211000 copies/ mL accessing care at a large urban HIV Centre in Kampala, Uganda. Methods : At IDI VL tests have been available since 2005. Until December 2014 these were reserved for patients with documented immunological or clinical failure. Those patients with detectable VL are managed through a treatment failure path-way consisting of:1) review of the results by the clinician, 2) case discussion in theweekly multidisciplinary ''switch-meeting'' 3) follow up by a clinician and counsellor based on the decision reached during the ''switch- meeting.'' We performed a retrospective audit of a sample of patientson first line ART with VL /C211000 in 2014; data was extracted from 95 randomly sampled clinic files and the clinic database.

Median log 10VL was 4.9 (IQR: 4.7 /C15.3). The diagram summarizes the action taken for the 95 sampled patients stratified by referral to the treatment failure path-way. 60/95 (63.1%) were switched to 2 nd-line after a median time of 49 days (IQR: 14 /C184). Of note an action was taken for all patients referred to the treatment failure path-way. Conclusions : The majority (65%) of patients with a detectable VL were switched to 2nd-line, and an additional 28% had an action taken. This is a favourable outcome compared to outcomes in other treatment centres around SSA, and we believe that the ''switch meeting'' model has helped to ensure that action is taken. Weadvocate that this additional step be considered in WHO and national guidelines to ensure adherence strengthening and prompt switch to second line in patients failing ART. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20468 WEPDB0105 Classification of HIV virological failure using whole blood versus plasma viral load Lucia Hans2; Luis Gonzales3; Sergio Carmona2and Nei-Yuan Hsiao11Division of Medical Virology, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Service, Cape Town, South Africa.2Department of Haematology and Molecular Medicine, University of theWitwatersrand and National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa. 3Alere Health Care, Johannesburg, South Africa.Presenting author email: aabida.khan@nhls.ac.za Introduction : In resource limited settings, timely plasma separation and transportation to centralized laboratories is a major challenge to the scale-up of viral load (VL) testing. Whole blood (WB) collection and testing through either dried blood spots (DBS) or point-of-careVL assays are potential solutions. However, there is limited evidenceon the performance of WB-based VL assays. Methods : We evaluated three WB VL testing platforms, Alere q HIV- 1/2, DBS Abbott RealTime HIV-1 and Roche CAP/CTM HIV-1 (DBS, free virus elution protocol) using routine clinical samples across a wide viral load spectrum chosen from South African public sectorpatients on combination antiretroviral therapy. Abbott RealTime HIV- 1 was used as gold standard and virological failure (VF) was defined for plasma at 1000 copies/mL. Results : Of the 299 samples selected, 153 (51%) had plasma VL/C211000 copies/mL. Abbott DBS VL had the best overall VL correlation with its plasma counterpart (r 2/C300.76), followed by the Roche DBS HIV-1/2 (r2/C300.46). Abstract WEPDB0104 /C1Figure 1.

Roche DBS assay was only able to identify 53% of theVF samples correctly. For samples with plasma VL B1000 copies/mL there were upward misclassification due to further /C211000 copies/mL identified andAbbott DBS VL reference, while Roche DBS VL showed 99% agreement in this category. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the threshold of log 10 4.12, 3.43 and 2.60 copies/mL provided the best overall respectively. Conclusions Variability was noted between the different WB VL assays with difficulties assigning a uniform threshold across all platforms, reflecting the differences in sample treatment/processing(DBS versus fresh blood samples) and sample input volume. Theperformance at 1000 copies/mL of DBS protocols and point-of-care devices remains significantly varied and further development is required to ensure minimal VF misclassification. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20469 WEPDC0101 Geographic origin trends among HIV /C27mothers and children in Canada and impact on vertical HIV transmission rates Jason Brophy1,2; Terry Lee3; Laura Sauve4,5; the Canadian Pediatric and Perinatal AIDS Research Group 1Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Canada. 2Department of Pediatrics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.3CIHR/C1Canadian HIV Trials Network, Vancouver, Canada. 4BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre, Vancouver, Canada. 5Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.6The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. 7Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

Presenting author email: jbrophy@cheo.on.ca Introduction : Migration contributes significantly to new HIVcases in Canada. This study describes geographic origin trends amongHIV/C27mothers and perinatally infected children and the impact of geographic origin on vertical HIV transmission (VT) rates among HIV/C27mother-infant pairs (MIP) in Canada from 1990 to 2013. Methods : The Canadian Perinatal HIV Surveillance Program collects data at 22 centres. The primary focus is on MIP with an infant born inCanada and identified prior to/within three months of birth; MIPwith Canadian-born infants identified after three months and HIV /C27children born abroad are also tracked. Data reviewed for this study included: maternal country of origin, clinical characteristics, antire-troviral usage and infant outcome. Logistic regression determinedVT rate differences for foreign-born (FBM) versus Canadian-born mothers (CBM). Results : Among 2089 (53.9%) 20.1%, 17.7% and 16.7% came from East, Central, Horn and West Africa, respectively. CBM accounted for66.7% (971/1456) in Western/Central Canada, whereas FBM pre- dominated in Ontario (945/1357, 69.6%; greatest proportion East African, 25.0%) and Quebec (713/1020, 69.9%; greatest proportionCaribbean, 36.2%). The largest of from Haiti(12.5%), Ethiopia (8.7%), Congo (7.0%), Zimbabwe (5.4%) and Nigeria (4.6%). the era (1990 /C11996), contributed 29.9% of (62/782, 7.9%) predominated. VT rate among Canadian-born children from 1990 to 2013 was 3.8% (3.0% among FBM) and 1.2% from 2008 to 2013 (0.7% amongFBM). African mothers had lower risk of VT (1990 /C12013: OR /C300.45, 95% CI 0.12 /C11.08) compared to CBM; no differences were seen for other regions. Of 353 HIV /C27children (born in Canada or abroad) with FBM, the greatest numbers came from Haiti (48, 13.6%), Ethiopia (33, 9.3%),Burundi (30, 8.5%) and Congo (15, 4.2%). Conclusions : Geographic origins of HIV /C27FBM in Canada have changed over time, shifting from predominantly Haitian in the pre-cART era to predominantly African more recently. African mothers have lower VT rates than CBM. Understanding country-specific cultural and obstetrical/paediatric health issues is imperative toproviding optimal care. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20470 WEPDC0102 The Canadian perinatal HIV surveillance programme (CPHSP): programme description and trends in demographics, treatment and transmission Joel Singer1,2; Ari Bitnun3; Terry Lee4; Canadian Pediatric & Perinatal AIDS Research Group 1Methodology and Statistics, School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.2CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network, Vancouver, Canada.3Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.4CIHR Canadian HIV Clinical Trials Network, Vancouver, Canada.5Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.6BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre, University of British Columbia,Vancouver, Canada. 7Stollery Children's Hospital, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.8Hopital Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.

We describe the CPHSP 's evolving methodology and analyze mother- infant pair (MIP) demographics, antiretroviral treatment and verticaltransmission (VT) rates in Canada from 1990 to 2013. Methods : MIPs are identified at 22 centres following obstetric or paediatric referral for care. Data is entered via a secure web-based Oracle database, which is managed and analyzed by the CIHR-Canadian HIV Trials Network. A nationally representative steeringcommittee provides direction and oversight. Data collected include maternal characteristics, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and infant outcome. VT rates are based on data of MIP delivered in Canadaand identified within three months after birth; infants identifiedbeyond three months of birth are tracked separately. Results : Among 2914 MIP from the combination ART (cART) era (1997/C12013), the overall VT rate was 2.1% but only 0.7% in MIP receiving cART and 0.1% in women receiving /C214 weeks of cART. Of 200 identified HIV /C27women giving birth in Canada in 2013, 76% acquired HIV heterosexually, 17% through injection drug use(IDU) and 2% perinatally; 53% of mothers were Black and 23% Aboriginal. The proportion untreated steadily decreased from 20.3% in 1997 to 3.0% in 2013. Aboriginal women (7%) continued torepresent the largest proportion of untreated women (7%) in 2013,though this decreased from a peak of over 20% during the pe- riod 2005 /C12009. A similar improvement was seen among IDU, with only 3% untreated in 2013. In 2013, seven (3.5%) women had noantenatal cART or suboptimal treatment, the lowest annual number and percentage in the cART era, resulting in two children becoming infected. Conclusions : The CPHSP allows for comprehensive identification of perinatal HIV exposure and outcome trends in Canada. Ongoingchallenges include ensuring all MIPS are captured given Canada 's geographically and demographically diverse population and low HIV prevalence. Despite continued improvement in treatment access for pregnant HIV /C27women, VT continues to occur with Aboriginal women being at greater risk of inadequate treatment and VT. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20471 WEPDC0103 HIV acquisition after arrival in France among sub-Saharan African migrants living with HIV in Paris area. Estimationsfrom the ANRS PARCOURS Denis, France. Presenting author email: julie.pannetier@ceped.org Introduction : HIV acquisition among sub-Saharan migrants living in Europe has long been considered to predominantly occur beforemigration because of generalized HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africancountries. Recent evidence suggests that a substantial proportion have acquired HIV while they were living in Europe. In the UK, this proportion was recently estimated at 31% using a CD4-basedmodelling approach. Such an estimate is not currently available forFrance. Methods : We estimated the proportion of sub-Saharan migrants who acquired HIV infection after their arrival in France using life-event andclinical information on a random sample of HIV-infected hospitaloutpatients born in sub-Saharan Africa in Paris region. We assumedthat HIV infection had probably been acquired in France if at least oneof the following life-event criterion was fulfilled: 1) HIV diagnosis /C2110 years after arrival in France, 2) ]1 negative HIV test in France, and 3) sexual debut after arrival in France. If none of thesecriteria was fulfilled, we estimated the duration from HIV infection based on first CD4 count measurement using statistical modelling. Infection was assigned in France if, out of 500 durations estimated foreach individual, /C2150% (median scenario) or /C2195% (conservative scenario) fell within the period while individuals were living inFrance. Results : Of the 898 HIV-infected adults born in sub-Saharan Africa included in the analysis, we estimated that 49% (95% confi-dence interval: 45 /C153) in the median scenario and 35% (31 /C139) in the conservative scenario acquired HIV while living in France. This proportion was lower for women than men (30% (25 /C135) vs. 44% (37/C151) in the conservative scenario) and increased with duration in France. Conclusions : The proportion of sub-Saharan African migrants having acquired HIV infection while living in France is high, highlighting theneed for improved focused HIV prevention. This requires a better understanding of the determinants of HIV infection in France in this population. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20472 WEPDC0104 Evidence of local HIV transmission in the African community of King County, Washington Roxanne Kerani1,2; Joshua Herbeck3; 1Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. 2HIV/STD Program, Public Health /C1Seattle and King County, Seattle, United States.3Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.4Communicable Disease Epidemiology, Public Health /C1Seattle and King County, Seattle, United States. Presenting author email: rkerani@uw.edu Introduction : In many parts of the U.S., immigrants from sub- Saharan Africa comprise a large proportion of heterosexual HIVcases. However, little is known about the frequency of ongoing HIV transmission within these communities. Methods : Public Health-Seattle and King County staff routinely interview patients newly reported with HIV infection, and attempt to contact sex partners to ensure notification and HIV testing. We describe the characteristics, testing history and partner outcomes forAfrican-born persons newly reported with HIV infection in King County (KC), WA from 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2013. Additionally, we reconstructed an HIV-1 pol phylogeny for 1430 cases diagnosed in KC2008/C12014, with 100 sequences each from Kenya and Ethiopia added for African references. Results : During the study period, 1148 adults were reported with HIV in KC, including 101 (8.8%) born in Africa. Of 63 cases in African-born individuals with new HIV diagnoses, 49 (77.8%) were interviewed for partner services. Seven reported being diagnosed with HIV-infectionbefore U.S. arrival and were excluded from further analysis, leaving42 individuals. Median time from U.S. arrival to HIV diagnosis was 7.0 years (range: 8 days /C126.7 years). Most were born in East African countries (N /C3034, 81.0%). Twenty-seven (64.3%) were women; (range: 24.9 /C162.2). Sixteen (38.1%) cases reported at least one negative test prior to HIV diagnosis, and 11 (31.4%) reported /C211 negative HIV test after U.S. arrival. Pol genotypes were available for seven of these 11 cases; for six ofthese seven, a local case was the nearest phylogenetic neighbour, and two were infected with subtype B virus. This suggests local transmission sources for these six cases.

Presenting author email: mgrabows@jhsph.edu Introduction : National and district level HIV prevalence rates may obscure substantial variation of HIV disease burden at the commu-nity level. Understanding the extent to which HIV differs across communities and the drivers of disparities and similarities within individual districts may offer opportunities for a more effective,targeted HIV response.Methods : HIV prevalence and risk behaviours were assessed among 17,109 individuals (53.8% female vs. 46.2% male) in 40 communities in Rakai District, Uganda between August 2011 and October 2013through the population-based Rakai Community Cohort Study.Communities were classified as lakeside fish landing sites (n /C304), agrarian (n /C3027) or trading communities (n /C309) based uponoccupation analysis. HIV prevalence was geospatially mapped using Bayesian methods and variability across and within communityclassifications was characterized. Differences in risk behaviours between communities were assessed using modified Poisson reg- ression models.Results : There was large variation in HIV prevalence, ranging from 9 to 43%, across communities (see Figure below). Fish landing sites had a mean HIV prevalence of 41% (range: 37 /C143%). Mean HIV prevalence in trading communities was 17% with substantial variability (range:11/C122%) and 14% in agrarian communities, also with substantial variability (range: 9 /C126%). Agrarian and trading communities in close proximity ( B18 km) to fishing landing sites had HIV prevalence ranging from 11 to 26%. Overall, HIV prevalence was higher amongwomen than men (p /C300.01), and the disparity was greatest in the fish landing sites (49% vs. 34%). The proportion of males and females reporting /C304 sex partners in the last year was 6.4 (95% CI: 4.1 /C111.0) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7 /C13.8) times higher in fishing communities than in the agrarian/trading population, respectively. Levels of consistent condom use with non-marital partners were significantly lower in thefish landing sites (RR /C300.80, 95% CI: 0.69 /C10.94). Conclusions : Large variations in HIV prevalence and risk factors across communities in rural Rakai underscores the need for a granular approach to HIV prevention and response based on local assessment of HIV burden and risks and locally tailored interventionsthat may include targeting of high risk groups such as those in fishlanding sites. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20474Abstract WEPDC0103 /C1Table 1.

One million cases occur annually, representing 10 /C130% of HIV-related death in prevalent regions. Optimal interventions for CM preventionremain unclear. The recently developed serum cryptococcal antigen lateral-flow assay (CRAG-LFA) is highly sensitive and specific, and may allow early detection of subclinical cryptococcemia in those at risk ofdeveloping CM. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness ofimplementing CRAG-LFA screening for people living with HIV in Uganda compared to other interventions for CM prevention. Methods : A decision-tree model was constructed to compare three strategies for cryptococcal prevention among people living with HIV(PLWH) with CD4 B100: Standard of care (SOC, i.e. no cryptococcal screening), CRAG-LFA screening followed by evaluation and treat- ment of cryptococcemia or universal primary prophylaxis (UPP) withfluconazole for all patients and no CRAG-LFA screening. Primary outcomes were expected costs, DALY 's and incremental cost-effec- tiveness ratios (ICERs). In sensitivity analysis, we analyzed the impactof costs, prevalence and alternative clinical algorithms on the cost-effectiveness of CRAG-LFA screening. Results : CRAG-LFA screening was associated with an ICER of $5.88 per DALY averted compared to SOC, and was highly cost-effectiveat current willingness to pay thresholds for Uganda. CRAG-LFAscreening dominated the UPP intervention (i.e. both cheaper and more effective). Overall, implementation of CRAG-LFA screening was projected to cost $1.46 more per person than SOC, and could reducethe relative risk of cryptococcal-associated mortality by over 40%. When including the cost of lifetime ART, the ICER for CRAG-LFA screening was $557 compared to SOC and still considered cost-effective. In sensitivity analysis, prevalence of baseline CM and cost ofthe CRAG-LFA influenced cost-effectiveness. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the CRAG-LFA screening intervention was cost-effective in 100% of simulations, and cost-saving in 30% of simulations.Conclusions : CRAG-LFA screening is extremely cost-effective with the potential to prevent significant morbidity and mortality from CM in vulnerable populations, and represents excellent value for money as a screening intervention for HIV programs in Uganda. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20475WEPDD0102 Lost opportunities to identify and treat HIV-infected patients: results from a comprehensive study of provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) Saeed Ahmed2,4 1Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, United States.2Baylor College of Medicine /C1Abbott Fund Children's Clinical Center of Excellence, Lilongwe, Malawi. 3Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, United States.4Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative at Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, United States.5Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States.Presenting author email: monica.ann.schwarz@gmail.com Introduction : Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV improves patient outcomes and minimizes risk of transmission. Provider-initiatedtesting and counselling (PITC) is an effective case-finding strategy,but implementation models vary. Malawi Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines recommend routine opt-out PITC, in line with WHO recommendations for countries with generalized epidemics, but littleis known about its implementation. Our objective was to assess PITC implementation in Malawi. Methods : We conducted a cross-sectional study of PITC implementa- tion at 118 clinics and wards within 12 MOH facilities in central Malawi during June /C1July 2014. Qualitative data detailing PITC practices was collected through structured interviews with 71providers who conduct HIV testing at their facility, and characterized using standardized definitions (Figure 1). Quantitative data describ- ing patient visits and HIV tests recorded during 2013 was abstractedfrom MOH HIV testing reports. Results : Variable models of PITC were reported across facilities and departments (Table 1). Overall, symptom-based PITC was most commonly reported. Only antenatal and maternity (20/24) depart- ments reported implementing routine opt-out testing. Use of a PITCregister varied significantly according to department type. Only 7.7% (86,657/1,102,802) of patient visits in 2013 included an HIV test. Subgroup analysis of TB and antenatal clinics with available data demonstrated that HIV status was ascertained in 94.3% (5293/ 5615) and 86.8% (26,831/30,961) of patients, respectively. Providers most commonly cited test kit shortages (71/71 providers), inadequate physical space (58/71) and inadequate number of HIVcounsellors (32/71) as challenges in PITC implementation. Providers from inpatient units cited the inability to test on weekends (8/16). Conclusions : Various models of PITC concurrently exist at MOH facilities in Malawi. Only antenatal and maternity clinics demon-strated high rates of routine opt-out PITC. The low ratio of facilityvisits that included an HIV test suggest missed opportunities for HIV Abstract WEPDD0101 /C1Table 1.

We modeled progression or relapse of CM over a 5 year time-horizon for a cohort of PLWH with CD4 B100. In all model arms symptomatic patients at baseline receive evaluation for CM assumed to include a lumbar puncture (LP), and treatment ifdiagnosed with CM. We assumed ART initiation in all arms. The model explores three interventions for prevention of cryptococcal morbidity for those without a baseline diagnosis of CM: 1) SOC, in which patients receive no CM screening or prophylaxis 2) UPP, in which all asymptomatic patients (and symptomatic patients without CM diagnosis * as noted in the model) receive primary prophylaxis with 200 mg of fluconazole.3) CRAG-LFA, in which all patients receive serum CRAG-LFA screening. Individuals with positive CRAG were assumed to receive the WHOpreemptive treatment for cryptococcemia with fluconazole 800 mg for two weeks, followed by fluconazole 400 mg for eight weeks. CRAG- negative individuals receive no further antifungal therapy.8th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2015) Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 4) Poster Abstracts 122James email: birgit.schramm@epicentre.msf.org Introduction : CD4 count is essential to identify antiretroviral treat- ment (ART) eligibility. For over a decade, Me \u00b4decins Sans Frontie `res and the Ministry of Health provides ART in 10 rural health centres (HCs) in Chiradzulu District, Malawi. From June 2013, Alere 's PIMATM CD4 point-of-care (POC) test is being implemented in the HCs. Shortage of health care- and laboratory staff is an issue inthis setting. We assessed task-shifting of PIMA CD4 test operation to non-health workers living in the community around the HCs. Methods : Four non-health workers received a one-week structured training on PIMA CD4 POC operation. Between June 2014 and January 2015, 331 venous blood samples of pre-ART and ART-patients attend- ing routine CD4-testing in two rural HCs were included. Each samplewas assessed on site with PIMA by a lab technician (LT) and a trainedcommunity worker (TCW), and measured with PartecCyflow counter at district hospital. Kappa-coefficient and percent agreement for CD4-classification below and above relevant thresholds were obtained. Bias and limits of agreement (LOA) were assessed for absolute CD4 counts. PIMA error-rates and failed runs (2 consecutive errors) wererecorded and assessed.Results : Three-hundred-twenty-eight venous female) included. CD4 count (LT PIMA) was 425 cells/ mL (IQR: 323, 570). Error rates were low (LT: 1.2% vs. TCW: 2.4%, p /C300.34) and no failed runs occurred. Good agreement was achieved for PIMA results by LTs versus TCWs for by versus PIMA operation as very easy. Conclusions : Adequately trained community workers delivered CD4 results equivalent to lab technicians with PIMA POC in health centre laboratories. Task shifting of simplified CD4 POC-technologies totrained non-health care staff can serve as a key strategy to ensuresustainable provision of CD4-testing in support of ART-initiation in rural facilities. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20477 WEPDD0104 Improving dried blood spot transport logistics for early infant diagnosis in Nigeria: the Sciences for Health, Abuja, Nigeria. 2Laboratory System Strengthening, Management Sciences for Health, Ilorin, Nigeria.3Nigerian Postal Service, Expedited Mail Service, Ilorin, Nigeria.Presenting author email: nndulue@msh.org Introduction : WHO recommends that all children exposed to HIV be tested within four to six weeks of birth to ensure that all infected infants are identified and initiated on treatment early.

The objective of this study was to review the effect of utilizing an innovative DBS transport model in improving DBS transportation.Methods : We carried out a retrospective analysis of logistic data from 177 samples transferred from 28 PMTCT sites using the SPEEiD model over a 12 month period from March 2013 to February 2014 in Kwara state, North Central Nigeria.Results : A review of the data showed a reduction in turnaround time for return of results from 3 /C16 months to 3 /C14 weeks utilizing the SPEEiD Model. Results were received for 97% of samples (171/177) transported with this model, compared to 51% previously. Theaverage cost of sample transfer was estimated at between $20 and $40 per batch and remains comparatively less expensive to other models by at least 30%.Conclusions : The MSH SPEEiD model remains an indigenous, cost effective, sustainable and time-sensitive sample transfer modelwhich ensures that exposed infants are able to receive their EID test results quickly. This approach may be easily replicated by otherpartners working in similar resource limited settings, as it provides a practical solution for DBS sample transfer, which remains one of the major challenges affecting EID of HIV in Nigeria. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20478 WEPDD0105 Trends in early infant HIV diagnosis and treatment services in rural southwest Uganda (2011 /C12014) Juan Seclen-Palacin1; Eliab Natumanya2; Linda Nabitaka3; Edward Bitarakwate2and 1Elizabeth Glaser Pediatrics AIDS Foundation, Washington, United States.2Elizabeth Glaser Pediatrics AIDS Foundation Uganda, Mbarara, Uganda.3Ministry of Health of Uganda, AIDS Control Program, Kampala, Uganda.

Through implementation of Strengthening TB and HIV/AIDS response in Uganda Southwestern Region (STAR-SW) project, Elizabeth Glaser PediatricsAIDS Foundation (EGPAF) provides support to districts and sites tostrengthen and increase access to EIDT services. This includes training and mentoring site-based healthcare workers (nurses, clinicians) on proper utilization of EID guidelines (counselling and testing manuals,treatment protocols), optimizing patient care flow, expanding points of care, strengthening laboratory capacity, utilization of EIDT clinical registers and reporting and conducting regular data reviews forcontinuous improvement. This report describes trends of accessingEIDT services under this project. Methods : Using HIV programme data from the Uganda Health System for January 2011 to June 2014, we conducted an EIDTanalysis coveringall 192 supported sites. Indicators analyzed were number of HIV-positive pregnant women identified during antenatal care, HIV- positive mothers delivered at health institutions, HEI received ARV at birth, exposed infants tested for HIV within two months after birth.ARV uptake and HIV testing coverage were estimated by dividing number of HEI-received ARVs at birth and who were tested within two months between HIV-positive pregnant women in antenatal care(ANC), respectively. Descriptive and trends analysis were conducted.Results : By January 2011, HEI testing coverage was 17.8%, which increased to 47.5% in December 2012. With the rollout of the Option B/C27in early 2013, HEI testing continued to increase and reached around 63% in mid-2014 (trend R 2/C300.8174). Simultaneously, HEI receiving ARVs at maternity progressively increased over time from 17% (312/1799) in January 2011 to 32% at the end of 2012, peaking at 48% (966/2026) in June 2014.Conclusions : HIV testing and ARV uptake for HEI have progressively improved in STAR-SW catchment area.

The objective of this study is to determine if the proven early HIV antibody sensitivity of the 60- second INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody test is due to its ability to detectHIV-IgM antibodies. Methods : The INSTI HIV-1 gp41 recombinant antigen was applied to a HIV-IgM ELISA to demonstrate its ability to capture HIV gp41 IgM antibody. This HIV-IgM ELISA assay was run on six commercial early seroconversion samples, known to be HIV-IgM positive, and five long-term HIV-positive serum samples. A separate experiment to demon-strate that the dye-labelled recombinant Protein A-based colour developer (CD) used in the INSTI assay has affinity to human IgM was conducted. A quantity of 0.5 mg of purified human immunoglobulins (IgM, IgD, IgA, IgE and IgG) were blotted onto nitrocellulose (NC) and probed with the CD to observe for spot development. Finally, to determine if INSTI performance is affected by IgM removal, IgM wasremoved by human anti-IgM MicroBeads on 21 early seroconversionsamples with known or undetermined levels of HIV-IgM and with five samples from long-term HIV-positive samples. INSTI results were observed for reduced test spot intensity following IgM removal. Results : The gp41-based HIV-IgM ELISA was positive for the six early seroconversion samples that were known INSTI and HIV-IgM positive,and negative for the five long-term HIV-positive samples indicating the assay signal was due to HIV-IgM capture by the immobilized gp41 antigen. The dye-labelled recombinant Protein-A used in the INSTIcolour developer produced distinct spots for purified IgM, IgA andIgG blotted on the NC membrane. Following IgM removal from 21 seroconversion samples with known or undetermined HIV-IgM levels, 10/21 samples became INSTI HIV negative from INSTI HIV positive. In10/21 samples test, spot intensity was reduced by /C2150% and 1/21 samples slightly &lt;50%, while the five long-term HIV-positive samples showed no reduction (Table 1). Conclusions : The INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Test is shown to detect HIV gp41-specific IgM antibodies in early HIV infection, whichenhances its utility in early HIV infection. http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.5.20563Abstract WEPDD0106 /C1Table 1.
