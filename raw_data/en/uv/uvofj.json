Our preventive, behavioral approach can help you cultivate healthy behaviors and habits and manage stress skillfully. Integrative Mind-body skills can help promote health, prevent disease and manage stress. They may also provide safe, effective and affordable relief of chronic conditions that are often poorly controlled by conventional medicine alone. Tailored to your personal needs, we can help you develop these mind-body skills and integrate them with your conventional care.
