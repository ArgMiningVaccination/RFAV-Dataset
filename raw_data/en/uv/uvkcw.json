You will Learn: The Sattvic Awakening Touch Sattva is the guna of goodness, purity, and enlightenment. It is mostly depicted as a white swan treading through the contaminated oceans of misery, pure and untouched. The swan exists within the environment but is not effected by it. It partakes only in the nectar at the heart of the Lotus. Sattva is the goal towards purification and divinity. This Pranic method works on the subtle level of Consciousness and requires a special touch to affect tranquility and love. Benefits: - Sedates nervous tension (Grounding) - Opens cognitive cellular memory - Facilitates a meditative state - Aids in clearing the mind - Promotes Creativity - Helps decision making - Sharpens awareness and intuition The touch is gentle and effective. It is a series of slow, rocking movements which soothe the client with pure nurturing. Herbal medicated oils are then poured and massaged generously into the skin, focusing on the scalp, hair, face, neck, shoulders, and feet. Gentle, continuous movement caresses the client into a sedated mode of comfort. The Rajasic Kinetic touch sequence Rajas is the Guna of movement, change, passion, and internal/external activity. It is the tiger who surveys her domain for consumption. Kinetic works towards movement and transformation. Body mapping similarly is scanning the body tissue, state of mind, and aligning thought towards a spiritual purpose. Benefits: - Stimulates motivation - Nourishes the skin - Creates spiritual rhythm - Increases heat - Aids in the elimination of toxins - Addresses muscular tensions and chronic pain - Improves blood circulation to the body tissue The Active (Tamasic*) massage sequence: Kinetic touch inspires opening, and movement towards change; to increase movement with specific Marma points which cool and calm the physical body. The massage is firm and steady, stimulating the release of tension and opening higher levels of consciousness. It inspires the release of negative habitual patterns towards an individual's unique purpose. *Tamas is the mode of ignorance, stagnation, darkness, and inertia. This is a condition, which congests the mind, spirit and matter. Tamas can be likened to a turtle. The outer hardened shell protects the vulnerable flesh that lives within. It is a defense mechanism. Only when the turtle feels secure will she emerge. It is this move from darkness into light, from shelter into the open, which characterizes the soul's transformation from ignorance into knowledge. Thus the healing can begin. Students will receive a certificate of accomplishment upon completion for those studying the Ayurveda Spa Specialist program.
