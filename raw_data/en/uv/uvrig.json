Our herbs and spices are all grounded in solid science and formulated to safe, measured potencies. Indeed, we insist that our supplements are rigorously tested to ensure they don't contain toxic pollutants, such as heavy metals, PCBs, PAHS, and pesticides. You'll also be happy to hear that we never purchase off-the-shelf bulk tablets or capsules. We endeavour to provide sustainably-sourced, quality supplements to our customers. That's why all our products are UK-made, and the herbs we use are farmed commercially - not picked from the wild. Better still, we reject any raw materials that fail to meet our strict quality criteria. If you need any help designing a tailor-made supplement programme, please contact one of our Nutrition Advisors who can point you in the right direction. "}
