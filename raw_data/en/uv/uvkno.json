Page 44 3 1. STUDENT SUCCESS (3-5 pages) NOTE : Data -based evaluations are embedded within the following sub -sections. Student success policies/programs/initiatives implemented/continued during the reporting year . First -time, Full -time Degree -seeking Students Retained to Fall Semester - Prior to the start of the Fall 2013 semester, preliminary enrollment data suggested we might not meet our 1st-to-2nd year retention rate target. Thus, we began taking additional steps to improve retention rates before the final data became available in Fall 2013. Non -returning st udent surveys suggested multiple factors might have affected student retention. Thus, in addition to continuing efforts described i n prior reports and in the sub -sections below, efforts are being made to determine the most effective set of core strategies for addressing the problem. o July 2013: Retention and Progression Task Force appointed to identify 3 -5 core strategies for immediate implementatio n o October 2013: Noel -Levitz Retention Opportunities Analysis and consultation; Based on recommendations from Task Force and Noel -Levitz consultant, prov ided mid -term grade reports to freshmen with grades of D, F, and U in 100 -level courses (in the past, this was limited to Freshman success course, math, and English); implemented College retention plans for reaching out to students with D, F, U grades in 100 -level courses: o Spring 2014: Mid -term grades provided to students with D, F,or U grades in all 100 -level courses and in 200 -level courses with high rate of D/F/U grades, with the exception of lab/studio courses; created a new academic standing called \"Academic Warning\" (to inform students with a semester GPA of 2.0 - 2.4 they are in danger of going on Probation); created new process by which students with an Academic Warning and those on Probation are notified of standing; provided faculty with a University Academic/Career Resources information sheet to aid with outreach to students in academic danger; contracted additional Noel -Levitz consultations for April, May, and June to focus on Advising, changes to Freshmen Success course, Retention Data Collection and Use, and Orienta tion o Throughout 2013 -2014, various meetings and Campus Updates from the University President regarding the importance of retention - related efforts and plans: October 28, 2013 Campus Update ; December 16, 2013 Campus Update ; March 6, 2014 Campus Update Modifications of Exi sting University -Wide Student Success Policies/Programs/Initiatives - Criteria for Admission Standards Exceptions. Prior to 2011 -12 and in accordance with the 2006 \"Master Plan Issues\" document, Southeastern allowed up to 10% of its entering class to be adm itted as exceptions. In 2011 -12, as per BOR policy, that was changed to a maximum of 8%. That policy has been continued in 2013 -14. Students are admitted as exceptions based on pre -determined criteria ( 2009 -10 criteria ; 2010 -11 & 2011 -12 criteria ) Southeaste rn increased its pre -determined criteria standards for Fall 2010 admissions and maintained those standards through 2011 -12 admissions. Students who meet neither regular admission criteria nor the exception criteria may appeal admission denial through the A lternative Criteria Appeals Committee. To achieve the change to a maximum of 8% exceptions, Southeastern again raised the standards of its pre -determined exceptions criteria for students applying for admission in Fall 2012 (2012 -13). The predetermined exceptions criteria for both Louisiana and out -of-state high students include higher grade point average requirements. In Fall 2013 ( 2013 -14), Southeastern added another tier for out -of-state students. - Criteria for Southeastern Academic Scholarships. For the second consecutive year, in Fall 2013, Southeastern partnered with Noel -Levitz for an extensive review of its institutional scholarships as they relate to student access and retention: (a) the beginning freshmen Southeastern Honor Scholarship, (b) the Senator Ben Nevers Transfer Scholarship, and (c) the Progression Scholarship. A primary goal of the review was to consider the academic mix of an incoming class to identify areas where financial aid might contribute to student retention . As a result of 4 the Noel -Levitz research and recommendations, Southeastern has revised its scholarship packages, beginning with students entering in Summer 2014. Southeastern will continue its partnership with Noel -Levitz through Fall 2014 to monitor the effects of the changes. In Spring 2014, Best Colleges.com named Southeastern as one of the top 50 Best Colleges for Financial Aid . - General Education Requirements. In ke eping with changes to General Education requirements made by the Board of Regents (date) and the Board of Supervisors of the University of Louisiana System (date), Southeastern made the following modifications its General Education requirements to better m eet the needs of students across all disciplines and to thus positively impact retention and progression: o Changed 6 -hour mathematics requirement, with at least 3 hours of college algebra, to Mathematics/Analytical Reasoning requirement of 6 units, with at least 3 units of mathematics o Changed 6 -hour Social/Behavioral Science requirement with at least 3 hours at the 200 -level to simply 6 hours of social/behavioral sciences Continuing University -Wide Student Success Policies/Programs/Initiatives (examples, not all -inclusive) - Beginning Freshmen Admission Standards . For 2013 -14, Southeastern continued to apply the admission standards for beginning freshmen initially implemented for Fall 2012 admission. These standards are consistent with the Louisiana Board of Regents beginning freshmen admission requirements for regional public institutions. In 2013 -14, Southeastern identified beginning freshmen admission standards as an area to review further for its impact on student success. o Performance of Entering Fresh men Admitted via Regular Admission Standards Implemented in Fall 2012 vs. Prior. An analysis of various success indicators suggests a smaller perce ntage of entering freshmen admitted using the Fall 2012 admission standards were retained in their second year relative to freshmen in Fall 2011. Although the end -of-year GPA for students in Fall 2012 was similar to Fall 2011 students, the percentage of s tudents with less than a 2.0 GPA was higher. The data supports the 2013 -14 decision to review beginning freshmen admission standards for its impact on student success. - Transfer Admission Standards. For 2013 -14, Southeastern continued to apply the admissio n standards for transfer students initially implemented for Fall 2012 admission. These standards are consistent with the Louisiana Board of Regents transfer student admission requirements for regional public institutions. In 2013 -14, Southeastern identifie d transfer admission standards as an area to review further for its impact on student success. - Freshman Success Course (SE 101) . Southeastern continues to require entering students with fewer than 30 credit hours to enroll in its freshman success course, which focuses on topics such as academic advising, student responsibilities, meta -cognitive learning strategies, developing degree/career goals, personal responsibility and self -management. o Primary Goals of Freshman Success Course. Southeastern's most recent Freshman Success Course analysis of expected student learning outcomes was conducted using data from Fall 2012 and Fall 20 13. The analysis shows Southeastern's freshmen are able to: Explicate the student's role and responsibility in academic advising vs. the advisor's role and responsibility Complete a four -to-six year academic plan, including an academic timeline and propose d graduation date Demonstrate knowledge of effective study behaviors (e.g., note -taking skills, critical reading, test prep, retrieval strategies) Demonstrate realistic expectations of the time and effort required to make successful academic progress - Continual Contact between Freshmen and Center for Student Excellence (CSE) Advisors in Student's First Semester (e -mail and a minimum of 2 face -to-face meetings). This contact involves reviewing (a) an integral assignment for the Freshman Success course and ( b) career and academic plans, study skills, or other student concerns, including course scheduling. 5 o Intervention: Students with (a) undefined career goals, (b) low confidence in choice of major, (c) low commitment to college, (d) inability to forecast gra des and calculate GPA, and/or (e) poor time management or study plans/skills are given appropriate assignments, assessments, referrals (depending on the identified impediment) and follow -up meetings are scheduled to monitor progress. o Students complete poin t-of-service surveys, rating the interactions with their advisor and helpfulness of the information provided for resolving immediate concerns. In Spring, Summer, and Fall 2011, 2012, and 2013 , freshmen generally rated the services as excellent. - Continual Contact between Freshmen and CSE Advisors in Student's Second Semester. The process described in the prior bullet concerning the freshman students' first semester is repeated. In addition students who are on probation are targeted in collaboration with their academic department. Advisors send e -mail messages and phone those students to arrange a meeting with their CSE advisor and/or departmental Undergrad uate Coordinator. Those who agree to the meeting are referred as appropriate to tutoring services; academic, career, or personal counseling services; the I -Roar program (a psycho -educational support program); academic workshops; academic accountability groups; and/or develop an individual \"Probation Recovery Plan.\" Continuing Individual Department/College/Division Progression and Graduation Initiatives (just a sampling) - Board of Regents Developmental Education Pilot Study. Southeastern's Mathematics Department participated in 2012 -13 and 2013 -14, combining developmental math education with college algebra in a single course format. Data analyses conducted thus far and p resented in the January 2014 Developmental Education Pilot Report submitted to the BoR hold promise: 61% of developmental math students in the pilot project passed College Algebra and were able to progress to th eir next math courses, saving them a semester of math preparation. Typically, fewer than 50% pass the regular developmental math course. The Developmental Education Pilot Report includes the results of a dditional data analyses. - Modification of Nursing BS Program Progression Policy. Cumulative GPA was found to be statistically significant predictor of student success in Nursing course work. Prior policy required a 3.0 or higher GPA in degree prerequisite courses to progress to 200 -level nursing courses; mod ified policy requires cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. - More Flexible Natural Science General Education Requirements for Communication BA Program. Prior General Education Natural Science options for Communication majors specified lower level science course s for non -majors, causing a problem for former science majors changing their major to Communication. New requirements simply mirror BoR requirements for this General Education cate gory. - Curricular Progression Policies Implemented in 2011 -12 and Continued t hrough 2012 -13. Based on analyses indicating that students who do not complete certain key courses in a timely manner are not likely to progress and graduate in a particular major, cur ricular progression policies were implemented in the following programs . Students with exceptional circumstances may appeal to the appropriate department head for an alternative plan. Students who do not meet the tenets of the policies or an approved alternative plan are not allowed to continue in the major and are advised re garding alternative majors that better suit their strengths and interests. o Chemistry BS Program Curricular Progression Policy ; Computer Science BS Program Curricular Progression Policy ; Mathematics BS Curricular Progression Policy ; Physics BS Program Curricular Progression Policy - Southeastern Writing Center. The Writing Center provides writing tutoring/feedback to university students requestin g such. - College of Business Academic Success Program (ASP) and Probation Workshop Program (PWP). The ASP and PWP programs identify, advise, and track the performance of at -risk Business students. Targeting students who have been readmitted after academic suspension, the ASP includes one -on-one academic advising to identify circumstances that led to suspension and the development of a written 6 plan for improving academic performance. The student and program advisor sign a contract outlining actions the stude nt will take to achieve academic success. As an extension of the ASP, the PWP addresses academic deficiencies and challenges early in a business student's academic career. This preventative effort is designed to help students on academic probation avoid s uspension. - Project PULL, Multicultural/International Student Affairs. Project Promoting Unity through Leadership & Learning is an academic and leadership development program. The program consists of weekly workshops that are designed to help ease the coll ege transition for freshmen of color by providing study sessions, mentoring, leadership training, service opportunities, and fun activities. As of 2012 -13, the Fall 2008 Project PULL participants had a 5 -year graduation rate of approximately 61% (11 of the 28 Fall 2008 members have graduated). The attached tables show retention and progression rates to -date for the Fall 2008 through Fall 2012 PULL partici pants. Tracking/monitoring/reporting mechanisms implemented/continued during the reporting year . - Freshman Cohort Tracking. For each cohort student, Southeastern assigns a data element named 'cohort year' in the student administration system. This is u sed for tracking and reporting progress of students in the cohort. Through its Academic Degree Audit System , initially implemented in Summer 2005, Southeastern continues to provide students and academic departments with an online advising and planning tool indicating the degree requirements the student has and has not met. With its Student Progress Summary page, originally implemented in Spring 2011, Southeastern continues to provide within its student information system (PeopleSoft) a quick reference on student degree progress. The Student Progress Summary page provi des students and authorized academic per sonnel with information such as the percent of degree completed, hours earned toward degree, cohort year, and expected graduation term. The page is updated at least once a semester, typically after semester grades have been submitted. Southeastern continue s to use its Registration Tracking System , initially implemented in Fall 2005, to provide authorized academic personnel with information for monitoring undergraduate and graduate student advising and registration activities. Authorize d personnel use this information to contact students who are not being advised or who have not registered in a timely manner. The report is update d weekly, beginning a few weeks before priority registration until registration is closed. Within the Registration Tracking System , deans and departments have access to detail reports that include the student's cohort year, major, and personal contact information. At the end of each semester, deans are provided a Student Degree Completion Report indicating the percentage of degree completion for each student majoring in the degree programs offered within their college. The reports include the cohort year and are helpful in monitoring students' time to completion. Based on the information in the report, students may be contacted for academic advising. As indicated in the first subsection of this narrative, upon the recommendation of the Retention and Progression Task Force and a review of data for undergraduate \"bottle -neck\" courses (i.e., courses with high rates of D, F, U, W grades), the number of courses required for mid-term grade input was increased. Prior to Fall 2013, mid -term grades were required of specific English, Math, a nd freshmen seminar classes. In Fall 2013, all 100 -level courses required mid -term grade input. This was expanded in Spring 2014 to include several 200 - hundred level courses as well. Students with D/F/U grades received a letter and email from their dean di recting them to consult with their course instructor(s) for help with course -specific challenges and for guidance to relevant resources such as the Southeastern Writing Center, tutoring labs, etc. In addition, the Center for Student Excellence and academi c Department Heads were notified to ensure student advisor follow up. After the week of priority registration, Enrollment Services staff conduct a registration call campaign to contact cohort students who have not registered for the next semester (fall or spring). This campaign encourages students to register for the next semester and helps troubleshoot challenges students may be facing. The campaign usually continues off -and-on until the week before final adjustments to 7 schedules can be made. Enrollment Services focuses on students targeted in the 1st to 2nd year and 1st to 3rd year retention targets. This campaign is in addition to student contact made by academic areas. Cohort students are included in communications regarding the Progression Scholarsh ip. This scholarship promotes the completion of a baccalaureate degree in four -years. Students receive the first letter in their first semester and continue to get reminder letters as long as it is feasible for the student to receive the scholarship. Le tters are mailed before Priority Registration for the next semester (fall and spring). Cohort students are included in mass communications reminding eligible students of registration (postcards, emails, phone calls). Development/use of external feedback reports during the reporting year . - General High School Feedback Reports. Southeastern holds an annual workshop for high school counselors and provides the counselors with a feedback report for their school . The report includes but is not limited to preparation, performance, and retention data from their former students who enrolled in Southeastern the prior Fall as well as information about the majors their former students have chosen. - Dual Enrollment Feedback Reports. o Dual Enrollment Expansion. Southeastern's Dual Enrollment Program is designed to enable eligible high school students to earn college course credit and to help high school teach ers better prepare students for the expectations and rigors of college and university work. Southeastern faculty create and grade all course work used for determining the grade for the college course, and Southe astern textbooks are used for instruction. Hi gh school teachers deliver the course and Southeastern faculty provide regular feedback regarding student performance to the students and high school teachers. Participating high school teachers are required to at tend a 2 -3 day course -specific workshop led by Southeastern faculty and have continual face -to-face meetings and electronic contact with Southeastern faculty throughout the semester. Program enrollment has grown steadily since the 2011 -12 expansion - 2011 -12: 31 courses, 3,300 students, 34 public a nd 4 non -public high schools; 2012 -13: 31 courses, 4,384 students, 41 public and 9 non -public high schools; 2013 -14: 24 courses, 4,356 students, 40 public and 14 non -public high schools. o Dual Enrollment Overall Student Performance Reports. At the end of Spring 2013 and Fall 2013, Southeastern sent to each Principal and Dual Enrollment coordinator of each high school an overall student performance report including the percent of Dual Enrollment students at the school who earned grades of A, B, C, D, F, and W. Anonymous versions of the data in those reports are linked: Composite Spring 2013 Grade Report, Composite Fall 2013 Grade Report. o Southeastern faculty also provide feedback to individual students: Sample English 101 feedback: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Sample Math 162 assignment results Sample Math 162 student assignments due Sample Math 162 overall student score 8 a.

ARTICULATION AND TRANSFER (2 -3 pages) Articulation and transfer policies/programs/initiatives implemented/continued during the reporting year, especially as they r elate to the Louisiana Transfer Degree programs . - Transfer Admission Standards. For 2013 -14, Southeastern continued to apply the admission standards for transfer students initially implemented for Fall 2012 admission. These standards are consistent with the Louisiana Board of Regents transfer student admission requir ements for regional public institutions. In 2013 -14, Southeastern identified transfer admission standards as an area to review further for its impact on student success. - Transfer Counselor Workshop. For the second consecutive year, in Sp ring 2014, Southeastern hosted a workshop and luncheon for two - year institution administrators and academic counselors. Participants were guided in discussions regarding the Louisiana Tra nsfer Degree programs, the statewide articulation matrix, and other transfer related topics. Evaluation feedback indicated a positive response from the participants and requests for continuing, expanded events in the future. - Transfer Student Orientation Program. The Transfer Student Orientation Program was revised in Summer 2013 to provide an experience more relevant to the transfer student's needs. Sessions were included to cover topics such as how to read a transfe r credit summary, what the university transfer equivalency policies are and the importance of establishing degree plans early in the academic career. S tudents were also provided with their individual transfer credit reports prior to the orientation advisi ng sessions. This ultimately gave both the student and their advisor the most up -to date information leading to a more accurate and productive advising experience. - Connect to Success program with Northshore Technical Community College (NTCC). In 2013 -14, Southeastern and Northshore Technical Community College continued with its expanded partnership , which was initially implemented in Spring 2011, to include an broader range of general education courses that students could use to satisfy the 18 hours of coursework required for transfe r to a four -year institution. Additionally, Southeastern continued to assist NTCC with faculty selection and curriculum design as they seek SACSCOC accreditation. Southeastern continued to provide NTCC with classroom facilities and pedagogical equipment (computers, projectors, etc.) as w ell as office space for an NTCC advisor and for NTCC faculty. NTCC hired 7 full -time instru ctors for English, history, math, and music and continue to use qualified Southeastern faculty as part -time faculty, as necessary, which ensures comparability with Southeastern courses. NTCC now has the capacity to offer twenty general education courses, one introduction to business course, one computer science course and two developmental courses. During Fall 2013, NTCC expanded its course offerings at the St. Tammany Center in Covington to th ree general education courses and one developmental course and during spring 2014, the offerings were further increased to eleven general education courses and 5 developmental courses. NTCC students enrolled in the NTCC classes conducted on Southeastern's campus in 2013 -14 have access to Southeastern student support facilities (library, computer labs, textbook rental, etc.) and campus amenities (student union, food services, shuttle servic e, Counseling center, Health center, etc.). Additionally, NTCC students have the option to purchase tickets to Southeastern spor ting events and join the Pennington Student Activity Center at a reduced rate. Southeastern and NTCC also developed an addendum to the Connect to Succe ss program whereby students NOT admitted to Southeastern's BS in Nursing program could enroll in an accelerated LPN program through NTCC. Physical space at Southeastern is utilized for the program with NTCC providing funds for equipment and salaries. This program will allow highly qualified nursing applicants the ability to become an LPN within a year and then be eligible to be placed into the clinical portion of the RN program at South eastern. This 22 agreement allows both institutions to receive acknowledgem ent for granting a credential to the student. With the implementation in Spring 2014, seven students have enrolled. - Transfer Student Web Page. As a proactive means designed to minimize challenges transfer students might encounter, Southeastern continues to update and maintain its Transfer Students web page , which includes information such as transfer admission standards, the Louisiana Transfer Associate Degree programs, and advising templ ates associated with programs at community colleges throughout the state. During the 2013 -2014 academic year, Southeastern accepted seven Louisiana Transfer degree students in the Fall and two in Spring. All nine students are currently enrolled and seeking a baccalaureate degree. Data -based evaluation, including student performance, conducted to ascertain effectiveness during the reporting year . - Partnership with Northshore Technical Community College. The number of students enrolled under the partnership a greement between Southeastern and Northshore Technical Community College has continued to increase since its inception: Semester Number of Students Spring 2011 12 Summer 2011 34 Fall 2011 103 Spring 2012 135 Summer 2012 54 Fall 2012 151 Spring 2013 126 Summer 2013 45 Fall 2013 200 Spring 2014 198 Once students enrolled under the partnerships agreement transfer to Southeastern, we will monitor their performanc e. In the 2013 -14 academic year, 34 NTCC students transferred to Southeastern through the partnership. Tracking/monitoring/reporting mechanisms implemented/continued during the reporting year, especially as they pertain to stude nt transfer issues . - Transfe r students are tracked in the same way cohort freshmen students are. See narrative for Student Success section. The only differences are o Southeastern assigns a data element named 'transfer standing term' in the student administration system to capture w hen the student transferred to Southeastern. These data can be used for tracking and reporting progress of transfer students. o Queries are available to academic colleges to identify new transfer students for timely review of the student's transfer reco rd. - Review of Southeastern Admission's Staff Responsibilities and Supervision . In an effort to more efficiently address the needs of transfer students, in 2012 -13 the Office of Admissions reviewed its processing structure for transfer counseling and admissio ns. As a result of the review, changes were made in staff responsibilities and line of supervision. The Office of Admissions has reduced the time t o produce official evaluations of transfer credit by several days and has increased time available to consu lt with and monitor the progress of students intending to transfer to Southeastern. In 2013 -14, Southeastern continued these efforts to monitor timely responses to transfer student inquiries, challenges with transfer transcript evaluation, and questions fr equently asked by transfer students. 23 Development/use of agreements/external feedback reports during the reporting year . What articulation agreements were in effect in AY 11 -12? Any articulation agreements newly developed or expanded? How many students to ok advantage of articulation agreements? - Previously Established Dual Admission Partnerships with Community Colleges for Students Who Do Not Qualify for Admission to Southeastern. Southeastern has a history of working with community colleges to help studen ts who do not qualify for admission to the university to attain access to post -secondary education and work toward admission to the university. Our dual admission partnerships allow applicants who are not eligible for immediate admission to Southeastern t o be seamlessly admitted to either River Parishes Community College or Delgado Community College and pre -admitted into Southeastern upon attaining eligibility as a transfer student. The partnership with River Parishes Community College and the partnership with Delgado have been in e ffect since 2005. - Referral Agreement Process. Once an admission application is processed and it is determined the applicant does not meet Southeastern's admission criteria, the applicants are mailed a letter inviting them to come to campus to meet with one of our Admissions Counselors. Counselors are trained in providing multiple options that can assist these students in beginning their post -secondary education, with the hope of ultimately providing a pathway for their future enrollment at Southeastern. The first option provided to these students is enrollment through Northshore Technical Community College (NTCC). During th e 2013 - 14 academic year, 251 students were referred to NTCC and 239 ultimately enrolled there. Those choosing not to take advantag e of the Connect to Success partnership with NTCC are advised of the Dual Admissions Agreements between Southeastern and Delgado Community College and between Southeastern and River Parishes Community College. - Community College Feedback Reports. In Sprin g 2014, Southeastern provided community colleges with feedback reports containing the following information regarding their former students' performance a t the university: o 1st to 2nd year retention at Southeastern (F11 to F12) o Cumulative GPA at end of 2011 -12 academic year o Cumulative GPA at end of 2012 -13 academic year o Total Southeastern baccalaureate recipients through Spring 2013 who transferred from the community college in 2011 -12, and the degree programs they graduated from o Total number of Louisiana Transfer Degree Students transferred during 2011 -2012 separated by degree type (AA/LT, AS/LT) o Total number of 2011 -12 transfer students with an Associate D egree o Total number of 2011 -12 transfer students o Number and percent of transfer students from the community college admitted as exceptions o Grades in first attempts of freshmen -level English and math classes 24 a.

A \"What's Moodling?\" email campaign was launched at the beginning of the fall semester to provide faculty a Moodle tip of the day. The faculty support site for Moodle continues to support facu lty via tip sheets and other training resources. As of March 20, 2014, a total of 225 of the 267 DE faculty (84.3%) have accessed the site during the 2013 -2014 time frame. Interestingly, over 20 administrators (department heads, directors, asst. deans, dea ns & asst vice presidents) have also used the site. The Center continued the Certificate of University Teaching and Learning (CUTL) for Moodle, an intense, six -week certificate program to train e -learning faculty (those teaching 50 -100% online). An additi onal 93 faculty completed the program in 2013 - 2014. Quality Matters at Southeastern Training. The number of faculty completing Quality Matters training to improve distance learning offerings increased 92.2% from 2011 -12 to 2012 -13 (from 116 in Spring 2013 to 223 in Spring 2014). The Center continues to support faculty's use of the Respondus LockDown Browser, a custom browser licensed by Southeastern to increase the security of online testing in Moodle. In an effort to increase authentication and security i n online courses, the Center is supporting the pilot of Respondus Monitor -- a feature that uses a webcam and microphone to record students during online, non -proctored exams. After the exam is complete, an instructor can review details of the assessment, even the recorded video. In addition to organized training and online resources, Center staff also support distance education faculty through emails, phone calls, and one -on-one consultations. Sign -in sheets in the Center's lab indicated 258 visits for issues related to distance education. One of the three coordinators documented assisting 286 distinct individuals with on -line or distance education - related matters from June 1, 2013 through March 20, 2014. Currently, the Center has offered 44 workshops to support distance educatio n during 2013 -2014. Based on responses to workshop evaluations, 100% of participants selected Agree or Strongly Agree to both, \"I learned new skills and strategies tha t I can readily put to use,\" and, \"The workshop impacted my professional growth.\" o Purch ases for Enhancing Distance Learning. Software purchases in the Center's lab included Camtasia Studio Electronic Version 8.1 (3 @ $150.00 = $450.00) and Adobe Photoshop (6 @ $68.15 = $408.90). The Center continues to offer online, university -wide access t o the following.

Institutional Efficiency and Accountability Narrative Report (1-2 pages) Preparation/progress during the reporting year for the elimination of developmental course offerings and associate degrees, including collaboration with 2 -year colleges . o Associate Degree Programs Southeastern offers only one associate degree program - the AAS degree in Industrial Technology. Once NTCC has the capacity for offering the program, Southeastern plans to recommend its transfer to NTCC, even it if means providing NTCC with the current phy sical facilities and equipment on the Southeastern campus to offer the program. o Developmental Course Offerings Excluding the developmental Math course sections that were part of the BoR Developmental Education pilot study, Southeastern offered 20% fewer stand -alone developmental courses in 2013 -14 (36) than in 2012 -13 (45). Including the developmental math course sections that were part of the BoR Developmental Education pilot, we offered 7% more developmental course sections in 2013 -14 (48) than in 2012 -13 (45) and in 2011 -12 (45). Thirty -two of the developmental course sections offered in 2012 -13 were regular developmental math or developmental English courses taught in the traditional manner; 4 were Dual Enrollment sections ; 12 were developmental math sections that were part of the BoR Developmental Education pilot. Southeastern enrolled 3% fewer students in developmental courses in 2013 -14 than in 2012 -13 (1,342 vs. 1,381); 11% fewer than in 2011 -12 (1,342 vs. 1,509). Progress toward increasing non -resident tuition as compared to SREB averages during the reporting year; impact on enrollment/revenue . o 2013 -2014 Out -of-State Tuition Schedule. In Spring 2013, the Board of Supervisors for the University of Louisiana System approved Southeastern's out -of-state tuition schedule (see table on following page), which results from a five -year implementation plan to bring Southeastern's non -resident tuition to the SREB average. Note that the final non -resident tuition and fee rate was $17,734 due to the increase a nd/or implementation of certain fees that took place after the original approval of $17,614. Impact on Non -resident Enrollment: Non-resident enrollment at Southeastern decreased by 4.1% from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014 (1,161 vs. 1,113 non -resident students). Revenue Resulting from Increase in Non -resident Tuition: $505,929 (Note: Includes gross revenue not adjusted fo r enrollment shift.) 40 Southeastern Louisiana University Approved Out -of-State Tuititon Schedule Approved Out -of-State Tuition Schedule Approved Out -of-State Tuition Schedule Proposed Out -of-State Tuition Schedule Prop osed Out -of-State Tuition Schedule FY 2010 -11 through FY 2015 -16 FY 2011 -12 through FY 2015 - 16 FY 2012 -13 through FY 2015 - 16 FY 2013 -14 through FY 2015 - 16 FY 2014 -15 through FY 2015 16 SREB $17,344 Category 3 Category 3 SREB Category 3 SREB Category 3 SREB Category 3 Proposed Tuition based on Estimated SREB Tuition Increases1 Proposed Tuition based on Estimated SREB Tuition Increases2 Proposed Tuition based on Estimated SREB Tuition Inc reases3 Proposed Tuition based on Estimated SREB Tuition Increases4 Proposed Tuition based 5.41% SLU Approved SREB Target SLU Approved SREB Target SLU Proposed SREB Target SLU Proposed FY 2010 - 11 $ 15,604 $ 12,469 FY 2010 - 11 $ 15,549 $ FY 2010 - 11 $ 16,224 $ FY 2010 - 11 $ 16,224 $ FY 2010 - 11 $ 16,224 $ FY 2011 - 12 $ 16,317 $ FY 2011 - 12 $ 16,294 $ 13,905 FY 2011 - 12 $ 17,142 $ 14,109 * FY 2011 - 12 $ 16,718 $ 14,109 * FY 2011 - 12 $ 16,718 $ 14,109 FY 2012 - 13 $ 17,063 $ FY 2012 - 13 $ 17,074 $ FY 2012 - 13 $ 18,113 $ FY 2012 - 13 $ 17,622 $ FY 2012 - 13 $ 17,344 $ FY 2013 - 14 $ 17,843 $ FY 2013 - 14 $ 17,892 $ FY 2013 - 14 $ 19,138 $ FY 2013 - 14 $ 18,576 $ FY 2013 - 14 $ 18,334 $ FY 2014 - 15 $ 18,658 $ FY 2014 - 15 $ 18,749 $ FY 2014 - 15 $ 20,221 $ FY 2014 - 15 $ 19,581 $ FY 2014 - 15 $ 19,381 $ FY 2015 - 16 $ 19,511 $ FY 2015 - 16 $ 19,647 $ FY 2015 - 16 $ 21,365 $ FY 2015 - 16 $ 20,640 $ 16 2004 -05 through the increase in SREB out -of- state tuition was 4.57% per year across all categories.
