I'm sure you have all noticed the crazy weather changes the past couple of weeks and you are all getting excited for spring! Spring cleaning in the home and perhaps a little spring cleansing in the mind and body? [Thanks to our nutrition department here at Physio Logic](https://physiologicnyc.com/integrative-medicine/clinical-nutrition/), we have had a staff-wide cleanse that has been infectious and passed onto our patients.

In cleanses it is very common to have withdrawal headaches and just feeling not that great. The reasoning behind this is because your body is not getting what it is used to and it starts to release toxins that will be excreted.
