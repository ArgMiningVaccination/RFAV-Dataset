Getting a vaccine is not one-size-fits-all and I learned this the hard way. Once I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, my understanding of the unique characteristics of the human body (our epigenetics, genome, cellular health, toxic burdon, pathogen exposures and more) dramatically changed. My western medicine trained brain turned to an integrative one, and that's when I really started diving deep into vaccine safety (or in some cases, a lack there of). I have honest conversations with my patients about the pros and cons of vaccinations. They get to make the empowered decisions based on the knowledge they have and on their specific bodies. Some people are 'forced' to receive injections in order to meet school and employer requirements. Even if people are hesitant or unsure, they often get vaccinated in fear of the unknown consequences. I always hope that you have a choice in what goes in and on your body... It is YOUR temple, not anyone else's. Just remember, other people can tell you what to do with your body, but your the one left to live in it. I developed this guide to help get your body ready to start effectively detoxing weeks prior to the shots and then extra antioxidant and detox support leading up to the vaccine administration. With the mRNA covid vaccine, we do not know how or if it will alter gene expression in an auto-immune type way (ie: Phenomenons like pathogenic priming, molecular mimicry). So, I can't guarantee the outcomes of what will happen to each individual body, but I can at least give you an idea of where to start. Begin 2-4 weeks prior to any scheduled vaccine and continue 2-3 weeks post vaccine: [Vitamin A 25,000 IU daily](https://select-balance.com/products/vitamin-a.html) (*Warning: Stop high doses of Vitamin A if pregnant) [Fish Oil Triple Strength](https://select-balance.com/products/omega-3-fish-oil.html) 3 caps twice daily [Vitamin C 1000mg ](https://select-balance.com/products/vitamin-c.html)twice daily (Do this up to bowel tolerance 3 days before and 3 days post vaccine) [Probiotic (Megaspore) ](https://select-balance.com/products/probiotic-60-billion.html)2 caps daily Detoxing 1 week before and 1-2 weeks after is REALLY Important (can do longer) * Epsom Salt Bath 2 cups Epsom + 1/4 cup Baking Soda * [Sauna (Infrared is best)](https://www.relaxsaunas.com/?tap_a=23244-5e6530&tap_s=208553-96119e). I love Relax Brand Sauna, this is what we have at our clinic. It's the hottest sauna on the market and heats up super quick so that you only have to stay in 20-25 min. It also has very low EMF radiation. * MAKE SURE BOWELS ARE MOVING DAILY. Use [MoveEeez](https://select-balance.com/products/move-eeez.html) or Magnesium oxide to go daily if you're not having full bowel movements 1 or more times a day. * [Coffee Enemas](https://select-balance.com/products/detoxing-coffee-enema-kit.html) if able (this helps boost your Glutathione in your body by 600%. Glutathione is an antioxidant that helps you detox). Diet: * Decreased processed foods and sugar 1 week before and after vaccine. NO sugar on day of injections. Sugar decreases immune function. What NOT to do: *Do NOT take APAP (tylenol, acetaminophen), it reduces glutathione decreasing your bodies ability to detox * Do not get vaccines when sick - You want your immune system to be in top shape when receiving an injection * Avoid chemical exposures (personal care products, cosmetics, smoking, etc.) days after shot * Avoid moldy buildings and people that are sick post vaccine, again you want to keep immune system strong If you like this free content, please consider supporting my small business supplement line [Select Balance](http://www.select-balance.com) when choosing your detox needs.
