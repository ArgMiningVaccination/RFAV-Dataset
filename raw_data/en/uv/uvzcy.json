Low stomach acid levels have been linked to immune and thyroid dysfunction as well as depression. Many of these dysfunctions are a direct result of compromised nutrient absorption. Chronically low stomach acid levels impairs the absorption of proteins, folic acid, vitamin B12, iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, beta-carotene and more.1,2,3,4 How do you improve your stomach acid levels without feeling the burn? Check with Your Doctor If you suffer from heartburn, consult with your doctor to confirm whether you have low stomach acid. There are simple tests your doctor can order. Also make sure to rule out hiatus hernia, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, ulcer, gallbladder disease, gastritis, pancreatitis, food allergies and stomach cancer. Address the Root cause If it is determined that you have low stomach acid production, you need to also identify the root cause. H. pylori infection, Candida yeast overgrowth, chronic use of antacids and acid blockers, chronic stress, highly refined diet, excess alcohol consumption and tap water that contains chlorine and fluoride all reduce stomach acid production. Once you understand the primary issue, it is much easier to focus on healing. There will be different protocols - from elimination of certain substances to inclusion of particular nutritional therapies - based on the underlying cause. Still, there are basic nutrition strategies you can take before knowing the cause or diagnosis. Eat Slowly. When you eat fast you put your body in a stress response. This slows down the digestive process, including stomach acid secretions, and allows food to sit in the stomach too long. Additionally, when you gulp down your food with little thought of chewing, the large particles will put extra burden on the stomach to break down the food. Both of these lead to putrefaction and fermentation, gas and bloating, and heartburn. When you eat slowly you stimulate the cephalic phase of digestion which increases stomach acid production to prepare for the food about to enter. Plus, isn't it more enjoyable to actually taste your food? Enjoy Smaller Meals. Similar to gulping food down, if you eat large quantities of food at one sitting, it puts a huge burden on the stomach. When you eat slowly to start, it will be much easier to be satisfied with smaller meals. Reduce Trans Fats and Damaged Fats. Trans fats are now known for their oxidative damage to the body. Healthy fats can also generate free radicals if they become rancid by overheating or being stored too long. Both of these fats damage tissue. Whether you are healthy or in the process of healing, there is no reason to include these damaging fats in your diet. Reduce Sugars and Refined Foods. There are multiple reasons for avoiding sugar and refined foods that go beyond reducing heartburn. Both sugar and refined flours are considered anti-nutrients. This means, the body needs to use its own nutrients just to process and eliminate these foods from the body. These foods also create inflammation in the body, directly irritate tissues, feed yeasts to allow for overgrowth, and inactivate white blood cells meant to help protect us against pathogens.5 For heartburn sufferers, especially diabetics, reducing sugars is critical. High blood sugar actually relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter which increases the risk of heartburn and reflux. Eat More Raw Foods. Raw foods are full of active enzymes. They will help ease digestion, repair tissue and feed the good bacteria in the gut. Drink More Water in Between Meals. If you suffer from low stomach acid production, drinking water with meals can dilute stomach acid and make the situation worse. However, water intake is crucial to stomach acid production. The key is to drink wisely. Drink water in between meals but be very conservative during meals as well as a half hour before and after. Exercise Daily. Exercise has been linked to a reduced risk of heartburn. However, if you do suffer heartburn, avoid heavy lifting or very high exertion levels within 2 hours of eating a meal. The suggestions above work well for anyone, whether you suffer from heartburn or not. If testing from your doctor confirms low stomach acid, below are some additional suggestions: Take a quality multivitamin. As mentioned above, low stomach acid depletes the body of many critical vitamins and minerals. A quality multivitamin will help restore the body back to optimal levels. Consume probiotics through a broad spectrum supplement and/or fermented foods. The good bacteria help support the immune system and fight off Candida overgrowth or H. pylori infection, both of which can compromise stomach acid production. Take a quality fish oil supplement. Omega-3 fatty acids are known for their anti-inflammatory effects. Incorporating fish or fish oil supplements will help heal any inflamed tissues caused by heartburn. Consider taking Colostrum. Colostrum has been shown as a powerful supplement that aids in tissue healing and recovery. This includes recovery of the delicate lining of the esophagus, the stomach lining and the entire gastrointestinal tract. It also improves the viability of probiotics so you get a one-two punch combining this with a quality probiotic. \"First Collection Colostrum\" has the highest Zinc-Carnosine. Both DGL (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) and zinc-carnosine have been shown to heal and protect the tissues of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Take Digestive Enzymes with a meal. Consuming digestive enzymes with a meal helps take some of the burden off the stomach and aids in digestion of all the macronutrients. Use Bitters before a meal. Bitters help to stimulate stomach acid secretion and aid in digestion. Bitters include chamomile, dandelion, milk thistle, goldenseal, wormwood and peppermint. Alternately, use vinegar or lemon juice before a meal. Although these are known as more acidic, they help alkalize the blood and stimulate acid production. Some heartburn sufferers do have issues with vinegar or lemon juice, so stop this method if you have any issues. Heartburn should not be something you \"just live with.\" Through simple dietary changes and pointed nutritional support you can stop heartburn...for good!
