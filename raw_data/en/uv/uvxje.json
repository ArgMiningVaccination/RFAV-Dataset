Vitamins are specific nutrients that our bodies need to function properly and maintain good health and wellbeing. Because our bodies can't produce these nutrients on their own, we have to get them either from the food we eat or in pill or tablet form (i.e., \"taking our vitamins\"). What are supplements? The term \"supplements\" is quite broad. It includes vitamins as well as other kinds of nutrients that aren't vitamins. Examples of popular non-vitamin supplements include coenzyme Q10, magnesium, and fish oil. Do I need vitamins and supplements?

It's always best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat, but if that's not possible, supplements are a great way to make sure you're getting what you need. However, it's important not to \"double up\" or exceed the recommended dosage of specific vitamins. Side effects and interactions with other medications Even though vitamins and supplements may seem completely natural and safe, that's not always the case for specific individuals. Some vitamins and minerals can cause side effects, especially if taken in too-large doses. Additionally, a vitamin or supplement may be inadvisable because of a pre-existing medical condition (such as heart disease or even pregnancy) or because of other medications. It's always a good idea to tell your doctor or other health care provider what vitamins and supplements you're taking and get medical advice for the best results. Allergies Sometimes, food allergies make it tough to get your necessary vitamins and minerals from your diet. If you're allergic to dairy products, for example, you might need extra Vitamin D and calcium supplements. Or if you're allergic to fish, it'll be tough to get those necessary omega-3 fatty acids anywhere other than through supplements. Price The cost of multivitamins vary, but generally, a month's supply will cost between $10 to $25. Most individual vitamins and supplements cost about the same. Sam's Club offers exclusive members-only prices for even greater savings and everyday value. Expiration date Like most things that we can eat or drink, vitamins and supplements usually come with expiration dates stamped on the bottle. These dates are determined to err on the side of caution. However, it's never a good idea to take any substance, including vitamins or supplements, past their stated expiration date. What Brands of Vitamins and Supplements Does Sam's Club Sell?
