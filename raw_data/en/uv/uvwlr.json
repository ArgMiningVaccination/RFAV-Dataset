Each partner focuses on one or more of the Ecom objectives, but we have a strong emphasis on collaborative work to strengthen the interdisciplinary nature of the project. More information on each of the partners is given below. Go directly to Erasmus MC A healthy population and excellent healthcare. This is what the Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands stands for. Conducting ground-breaking work, pushing boundaries, and leading the way in research, education, and healthcare. WHERE ARE THEY FROM? The Department of Public Health aims at conducting eminent research and providing excellent education with a discernible impact on population health at the local, national and international level. THEIR ROLE AT THE ECOM PROJECT? Using focus groups and Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs), the Erasmus MC research group determined what aspects (attributes) of pandemic-related vaccination programmes were considered important by people in four European countries, and to what extent these persons traded-off vaccination risk versus disease risk. Using a DCE design, respondents were asked to repeatedly choose between several vaccination alternatives. By analysing the respondents' choices using regression models, the relative importance was determined of vaccination programme characteristics (effectiveness, safety, advice, media attention, and out-of-pocket costs of vaccination) on preferences, and the uptake was predicted of several vaccination programmes for different disease scenarios. Prof. dr. Jan Hendrik Richardus Scientific coordinator of the Ecom project. He is a public health physician, epidemiologist and professor in Infectious Diseases and Public Health at Erasmus MC. He is also staff member at the department of Infectious disease control of the Rotterdam-Rijnmond Public Health Service (GGD Rotterdam-Rijnmond).

In the Health Sciences Department, undergraduate and postgraduate training is offered to students seeking to specialize in epidemiology, health promotion research and public health. Infectious disease policies are a primary research focus of the Health Science Department. In the past 10 years, research has specifically focused on analysis of health systems, international pandemic preparedness and response, burden of infectious diseases among minority groups, and infectious disease surveillance in Europe. THEIR ROLE AT THE ECOM PROJECT? The HAW Hamburg research group, together with the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the Erasmus MC, aims to assess in a time-series analysis: 1) what actually happened during the A/H1N1 epidemic (epidemiology); 2) what the people knew (media attention); 3) what was officially recommended (health protection measures); and 4) what the people actually perceived and did (vaccination uptake and risk perception). The results of the time-series analysis give valuable insight into the time-dependent influence of the above factors. The perception of health officials involved in pandemic management in terms of the risk communication difficulties faced and their recommendations on what could be improved are also explored. Prof. dr. med. Ralf Reintjes Professor in Epidemiology and Public Health Surveillance at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and visiting professor at the Tampere School of Public Health. He is leader of WP1. He has extensive research experience in the field of infectious disease control. ralf.reintjes@haw-hamburg.de Amena Ahmad, MD Senior researcher and lecturer at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.

Research efforts centre around fourteen themes, ranging from Language and Communication, Brain and Cognition, to Society, Economy and Politics and the Digital World. WHERE ARE THEY FROM? At Radboud University, the Persuasive Communication group of the Centre for Language studies focuses on how argumentative, narrative, and stylistic message features evoke and guide cognitive and affective processes that ultimately determine the audience's attitudes, intentions, and behaviour. The group employs corpus-analytic research employing a cognitive linguistic approach to chart the verbal and visual characteristics of persuasive messages, and experimental research to assess the impact of message variations on the persuasion process. THEIR ROLE AT THE ECOM PROJECT? The Radboud University research group, together with the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, assessed how different European media (television, newspapers) reported about A/H1N1 during 2009/2010. By analysing the amount of media coverage, the content of media reports, and the tonality of these reports, our understanding of the role of the media in times of epidemic outbreaks is enhanced. Media attention for A/H1N1 across time will be combined with epidemiological data about infection and mortality rates from the HAW Hamburg group, showing important lags between the media agenda and the agenda of public health officials that governments and health institutions need to be aware of.

THEIR ROLE AT THE ECOM PROJECT? The work of Strategic Social Marketing for the Ecom project is focused on a social marketing informed analysis of vaccination behaviour, audience segmentation, and service delivery. This work applies the principles of social marketing and behavioural economics to the subject of outbreak management. A behavioural analysis was performed indicating how new and emerging understanding about influencing behaviour can be used to design behavioural interventions to promote service uptake. This included a review of the use of incentives, conditional payments and rewards, and disincentives or penalty motivators. A review was conducted of vaccination service delivery in three European countries, including segmentation and customer journey mapping, i.e. describing the path and critical touch points with service providers, including communication touch points and physical interactions with the service. A prototype was developed of a consistent set of SMART behavioural objectives for pandemic management, that could be tested in practice. Prof. dr.

THEIR ROLE AT THE ECOM PROJECT? The CBSSM research group aims to test the effectiveness of communication strategies to understand how health professionals may counter problematic media messages, manipulate uncertainties in outbreak communication, and develop strategies to counter dramatization of risk, while appropriately engaging the public in outbreak information. The CBSSM research group has extensive experience in health communication, risk and crisis communication, risk communication graphics, omission/action tendencies, self-other differences, and social cognition. The CBSSM research group will test communication strategies in experimental designs using an Internet sample. One study aims to test uncertainty during the beginning stages of a pandemic. A second study will test the use of visualizations as tools to communicate information about incidence, mortality, and spread of the flu. Two other studies will test the effectiveness of metaphors and testimonials as communication strategies to target segments of the population, convey emotionality in an outbreak situation, as well as test communication strategies for healthcare workers in the event of a pandemic.
