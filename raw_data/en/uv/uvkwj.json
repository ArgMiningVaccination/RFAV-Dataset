It truly felt like he was reading my soul. From start to finish I was in a trance like state, soaking in everything he was telling me, knowing that I was hearing truth. It gave me such clarity on my purpose as well as timelines in my life. I felt energized and empowered after the session. Ashish reads to you like an old friend, there is a comfort about his presence and you get the feeling he truly understands your being. I highly recommend him if you're looking to get more clarity on your life's purpose as well as all other matters, love, business, health... Thank you Ashish.Thank You so much sandi for such a beautiful comment. We are always here to help you when needed.Written June 14, 2021This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited May 2021Traveled soloWritten May 12, 2021 - Very accurate readings, Best Vedic astrologerI am very impressed with Ashish's readings and advice - they have proven to be highly accurate and his advice has also helped me to better understand and respond to issues that have been bothering me. He takes time to explain in detail and also shows great empathy in listening, which I really appreciate. Although with the pandemic we can't have the readings in person we are able to do it via video call and he accompanies his readings with detailed notes and is always punctual. I have done 2 readings with Ashish and these won't be my last readings for sure! Highly recommend Ashish to anyone who is looking for a professional in Vedic astrology. Thank you so much Ashish! Hope to see you in Bali once travel returns.thank you grace. be in touch. i am always happy to help you.Written April 29, 2021This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited April 2021Traveled soloWritten April 14, 2021 - Life purpose and general astrology readingOMG sooooo good. Very in depth reading and when i realised we wasn't recording the call, he went over it all again. It made so much sense and gave me comfort in knowing I'm heading in the right direction. He started off by saying I'd make a good coach, counsellor, healer and that I'm a chief / boss. Last year I stepped away from my coaching business as i didn't know I was following the right path. He immediately started off with that and I hadn't said a word. He wrapped me up in my personality perfectly. Everything he said was spot on and my predictions for the remaining 2021 / 2021, we'll just have to see but I certainly feel more content. Absolutely would recommend if you're confused, not sure what path to take or have questions about your life in general.

I am a very spiritually minded and self aware person so was simply doing it for the experience. What I can honestly say is that his reading was spot on in every aspect of my life... things no one could ever know about me, was clearly written in the stars. I highly recommend Ashish if you are feeling stuck and needing direction or purpose in your life Hi Lauren, greetings. thank you for trusting in me. i will always try to help you with the best of my knowledge.Written April 29, 2021This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited February 2021Traveled soloWritten February 7, 2021 - Best experience in BaliI can't believe I haven't written a review for Ashish, I have always been interested in esoteric subjects, that's why when I first came to Bali in 2018, I looked for a Vedic Astrologer, I assumed there will be a good one in Ubud :) so i searched on the internet and I found Shriman Healing and Vedic Astrology. Meeting Ashish has been one of my best experiences in Bali, this man is a true master of his domain, so intuitive, so precise, extremely knowledgeable. For the past two years I have not made any radical decision without consulting Ashish. A Vedic astrological chart is a true blue print to your life, it provides guidance and it shows the most successful path to live your life and carry your purpose with grace and ease. I am Ashish number one fan! Every friend I have sent for a reading has always comeback extremely satisfied, I can't recommend his services enough. Thank you Ashish, for everything you do, I am forever thankful to you and your family.thank you patricia for the review. such a beautiful soul you are. grateful to have a friend like you.Written April 29, 2021This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited February 2021Traveled soloWritten February 9, 2021 - Wow! Awesome!I was very impressed with Ashish and the reading I received. It's amazing how accurate it was about my personality and interests. I came with a burning question about a new career path... I had something specific in mind (that I didn't share with Ashish) and the reading made it very clear that I should pursue it. I will definitely come back for more readings when I need some clarity. Highly recommended!thank you for rating us 5 star. Love to do reading for you. all the best and good luck.Written April 29, 2021This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited February 2021Written February 25, 2021 - Accurate ReadingI had a great experience with Shriman. I particularly enjoyed discussing my general life chart with him. Although I had previously read my chart from Western astrology, the Vedic chart felt more intuitive to me. Also, the future predictions are yet to be seen, but some of them were aligned with the big plans I had in mind for the next 6 months before the call. I had some trouble hearing due to sound issues or white noise, so I had to ask a few questions to clarify what he was explaining. However, he made sure to record it so I could listen again and understand it better. Shriman, I appreciate your guidance and for reminding me of my inner strength in seeking balance in life. Thank you once again.Visited July 2023Written July 28, 2023 - Great Astrologer/ Fortune TellerI was highly impressed with Ash and his Ayurvedic astrology skills. I'd go so far to say he was 95% accurate in his depiction of my personality, background, current life and family. He was also very skilful at picking pivotal moments in my life so far and I'm looking forward to what the next 4 years my hold. Ash is a very personable and friendly practitioner of his art. I'd recommend him to anyone!Visited August 2015Traveled soloWritten August 18, 2015 - Ashish was great!I happened to find Ashish on my trip to Bali in June. He was wonderful enough to squeeze me in to see him. He gave me such insightful information that about my life, career, health...everything. I was (and still am) very much appreciative of his guidance. If you are fortunate enough to get in to see him, definitely do so. Blessings to you, Ashish!Visited June 2017Traveled soloWritten October 8, 2017 - Nice guy, generic readingI saw Ashish for an astrology reading as I have been interested in seeing an astrologer for some time, so when I saw the great reviews I thought why not give it a go. I have to say I was really disappointed and couldn't understand what people had been raving about. Yes, he had named two things which were correct about my personality (human beings are much more multi-faceted than that aren't they?) but when he went through my chart a lot of it was just generic or very non-specific. I left feeling confused and basically did not really get anything out of it. At no point did I feel that the reading had resonated with me. He is a nice guy and I think he does know a lot about Vedic Astrology but it didn't work for me and I thought it was overpriced for just over 30 mins of reading.Sorry for the disappointment to you Sandra. But I am not God. I am a simple person. I never got this kind of bad comment in my whole life. But people are people, your bad comment proved I am someone to whom god really loves. Even all great and simple people were criticized in the world. Those people who wrote about me something good, may be, they are idiots. Those visitors who visited me were stupids and you are the most correct person. For those who have the sense of who is correct this client or the most of people, are welcome. Those who think that is too expensive, I say please don't come to me.

Apr 2021 This was my second Vedic reading with Ashish - and it was very valuable! I think Ashish does a great job in making sense of one's chart, and giving advice that help out where one is stuck (at least that is my experience). I feel much more at ease after my reading, and are looking forward to what's to come next in my life! :) Written May 2, 2021 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
