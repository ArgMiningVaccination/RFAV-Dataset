I started seeing Jason Wilson for acupuncture treatments in October 2010. By December, I was so much better, that I and my family couldn't believe the results. I have Spondyolistesis, which is a condition where the disc has been worn away so badly because of degenerative arthritis that the disc actually slips out of place. This causes great pain because the disc then touches the nerve. I also have 3 herniated discs which also cause severe pain. The fact that I have not had serious pain for several months now has been wonderful. I believe that Jason works wonders. He has helped me so much with my thigh, hip and back. I would, and do, recommend Jason Wilson for acupuncture treatments to anyone that is having problems. G.P After a few acupuncture treatments, my pain is gone. It's the best thing I have ever done. I am currently recommending acupuncture from Jason to all my friends. M.G Let me just say, right of the bat, I wish I would have found this place first before I went the surgical route. I had hand pain so I had an operation which made it worse. I then went to the University of Chicago and had another operation. One year of therapy later, I still had no relief. I then found this clinic, and the pain is dramatically better. The swelling has also vastly improved. I am very pleased and would recommend Jason to anyone with a post operative pain issue and any health problem for that matter. J.F Without the help of Acupuncture, I truly don't believe I would have been able to conceive my son. I have suffered with migraines for most of my life and tried to conceive a child for 2 years unsuccessfully . After only two months of acupuncture, my daily migraines disappeared and I finally was able to conceive a child. It is now one year later and I am still migraine free and I have a healthy, beautiful 3 month old baby boy. I am thankful to Jason for his expertise in Chinese Medicine. B.L.D I was having problems getting pregnant and was going to a fertility clinic for help. It was then that I decided to try acupuncture for stress in my life, not to mention the stress of trying to get pregnant. I saw Jason, at Alternative Healing Works in 2013 prior to having an IUI procedure done, the first one was not successful. After seeing Jason, my next IUI took and I became pregnant. I continued my acupuncture throughout my pregnancy which was very calming for me. I did the exact same thing 2 years later with success. I was apprehensive at first, then I met Jason. He was kind, understanding and most importantly, highly knowledgeable. He made me feel comfortable and I truly believe had I not seen him and had this amazing experience, I wouldn't be where I am today, with two healthy, beautiful baby boys. I also saw him during my second pregnancy after having some back problems and they went away very soon after that, which I don't believe was a coincidence. K.E My name is Gail, and I'm from Dyer, IN.
