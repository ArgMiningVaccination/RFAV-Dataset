Dr. Mengarelli evaluates and treats patients based on the concepts of oriental medicine. Acupuncturists complete their evaluations by getting a patient history and looking at and touching the body. Then, they place very fine acupuncture needles into specific points on the body. Stimulating these points and nerves is how Dr. Mengarelli treats the patients condition. Many of the bodys systems respond to acupuncture, and it can treat physical pain as well as emotional stress.

In the case of chronic headaches, 20 treatments at twice per week is a good base to stabilize the condition at low to zero occurrences. With Balance Method Acupuncture you should see results immediately upon insertion of the needles. This relief usually lasts 1 to 3 days then pain gradually returns as the body has not healed after only one or two treatments. Acupuncture is a cumulative therapy to address not only the symptom of pain but also the underlying causes of the pain. Hope this helps. To find a practitioner of Dr. Tan's Balance Method Acupuncture would be the wisest choice for results immediate and long term. Hope this helps.

Acupuncture treatment administered by a credentialed professional (4 year post graduate Masters Degree in Oriental/Chinese or Traditional Chinese Medicine) will not cause the body to malfunction, which is the definition of negative side effect. This does not hold true for \"dry-needling\" however, which is a term used by uncredentialled persons placing needles only in area of pain without any knowledge of the Chinese medicine concepts underneath the needles. ie: Meridians, qi, yin/yang energetics, and much more. Acupuncture, especially the very first treatment, may cause a healing crisis in client and symptoms may increase for a few hours. This is natural healing and is not a \"negative side effect\". The increased symptoms dissipate quickly after rest and usually do not recur with subsequent acupuncture treatments. One may experience a small bruise at needle insertion site after removal of needle, that is neither painful or damaging. Also, a drop or two of blood may escape at certain needle sites after removal. This is expected and actually encouraged to allow old blood to move and new blood to be formed. I urge you to seek an acupuncturist who is trained in Dr. Richard TehFu Tan's Balance Method Acupuncture and enjoy instantaneous results within the first treatment. Moreover, not one needle will be placed in the area of pain to achieve this immediate result. Even the worst HA does not stand a chance with Balance Method Acupuncture techniques applied by an experienced acupuncturist. Hope this helps, Mari [READ MORE](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/what-are-negative-side-effects-of-acupuncture) [Does a daith piercing help with migraines?](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/does-a-daith-piercing-help-migraines) May help moderately and for the short term. Chinese medicine does not endorse \"piercing\" since it allows Qi to leak out of the body. To really deal with chronic migraines commit to at least 20 acupuncture treatments 2 times per week from a skilled acupuncturist who employs Dr. Tan's Balance Method Acupuncture techniques. You will be well pleased and quite surprised at how fast your headaches go away and stay away. Hope this helps.

It is difficult to give a concrete answer to how many treatments will be needed. I would suggest at least 20 treatments if condition is chronic just to stabilize the condition then maintenance at two to three times per month. For best results find an acupuncturist who is skilled in Dr. Tan's Balance Method acupuncture technique. You should feel results during the first treatment but this will not be permanent until you have had at least 20 treatments at 2 treatments per week minimum. Hope this helps.

Is acupuncture dangerous for me?](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/i-take-blood-thinners-is-acupuncture-dangerous-for-me) If blood thinners were a problem then how could you have blood drawn or have an injection? This is an absolute fairy-tale, that one should not have acupuncture because of taking blood thinners. The acupuncture needle is only the thickness of a couple of hairs and designed to slide through the skin cells without causing damage, or making a hole in the body to extract or to introduce some type of fluid. Tell your doctor that he cannot give you an injection or draw your blood because it isn't a good idea because you are on blood thinners. See what the reaction is. This is a silly and preposterous assumption that does many people who could gain great benefit from acupuncture a great disservice.

Do not look for success until after at least 3 months of therapy. You have to give your body at least 3 months of treatment to begin to stabilize. Female hormonal issues are a cyclical issue. At least 3 months are necessary to judge change for the better.During this time you should abstain from intercourse. Otherwise you will be depleting the energy being built up by the acupuncture therapy. A skilled acupuncturist is imperative. NO DRY NEEDLING. Chinese herbal formulas are highly effective for fertility when combined with acupuncture so find a practitioner who has been well trained in Chinese Herbology. Hope this helps.

It is more a feeling of relaxation that you are describing as lethargy. Acupuncture immediately takes the brain out of fight-or-flight and puts it into normal function/relaxation mode. If you have been stuck in fight-or-flight/stress mode for any length of time, this sudden shift to relaxation mode feels like fatigue. It is only your brain discontinuing pouring stress hormones throughout your body that keep you on alert and looking for the next attack, as is normal in fight-or-flight, and instead, your brain is now able to produce endorphins, the body's natural pain killing/relaxation inducing substances. This causes one to feel relaxed when one may not be used to feeling relaxed both in mind and in body. We are not designed to be in fight-or-flight 24/7, however, most of us are, preventing deep recuperative sleep, preventing proper digestion/elimination and of course curtailing ability to creatively think while in stress mode. If you are feeling \"lethargic\" after acupuncture, enjoy and prolong the sensation by taking it easy for a few hours. This is an absolutely normal and much needed effect of a good acupuncture treatment. Hope this helps.

Western medicine names for diseases are irrelevant to be able to benefit from acupuncture therapy. Hope this helps.

Should I see an acupuncturist?](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/acupuncturist-treat-migraine-problem) Acupuncture is extremely effective in minimizing and eliminating migraine problems. Always the underlying causes of the migraine problem are addressed, rebalanced and the body retrained to function normally using acupuncture and Chinese medicine. Pain is a message from the body to the consciousness/mind that there is something wrong. Pain meds simply stop the brain's ability to interpret the messages. The pain is still present along with the underlying causes, you just can not feel it. I have found in my practice that even with strong prescription pain meds, the pain of migraines remains, just as you say they are not working. Acupuncture applied by a competent and well trained acupuncturist (not a western medicine practitioner with a weekend seminar in acupuncture) is very effective in eliminating or at least drastically diminishing occurrences of migraines. Included with this result is an overall higher functioning physical, mental and emotional body in general. A feeling of well-being, increased immune function, reduced symptoms of stress, better sleep, digestion and mental function are \"side effects\" of regular acupuncture treatment. Choose an acupuncturist who has a Master's degree in Chinese medicine and has been certified by the national board exams for Oriental medicine (NCCAOM diplomate). In addition, I strongly suggest finding an acupuncturist who employs Dr.Tan's Balance Method as this method is highly effective in immediately stopping pain of a migraine while working on readjusting the body function to prevent further attacks. You are very wise to want to stop prescription meds, but do not do that without professional help from a well trained and experienced accredited acupuncturist. Bottom line: absolutely seek help from acupuncture and Chinese medicine. I can assure you, you will benefit greatly. Thank you for your question.

In Chinese medicine, there are many modalities to employ in the treatment. Acupuncture is the strongest treatment method and would be augmented by blood strengthening Chinese herbal formulas that have been used for thousands of years to treat blood related problems like anemia.

I have treated many clients over the last 14 years with this issue and have had 85% success rate. Acupuncture increases energy and blood flow throughout the body and acupuncture point placement focuses the treatment on individual organ systems. Emotions and stress response are soothed and equalized, allowing the brain to get out of \"fight-or-flight/stress\" mode and remain in \"normal function/relaxation\" mode. When stressed or emotionally tight, the body is not able to perform optimally. Acupuncture eliminates imbalances and increases normal function. Acupuncture also stimulates and balances the endocrine/hormonal system. When there are imbalances within the physical or emotional bodies, energy and therefore information transmission between cells, tissues organs is lacking, causing dysfunction. Acupuncture moves and strengthens energy and therefore the flow of vital information within the body for maximum health. There are many different underlying issues that may cause fertility problems, and once a Chinese medicine diagnosis is made identifying the root problems, treatment is begun. The normal length of time necessary for treatment depends on the diagnosis. With fertility issues, 4 months of treatment is usual. Acupuncture will be the main treatment modality. I may also employ Chinese herbs, food therapy (using foods as medicine), acupressure and reflexology TaiJi and Qigong exercises. I hold a Masters in Oriental Medicine and have studied extensively over the years with Dr. Richard Tan, a master acupuncturist and instructor.
