This analysis is not a part of the legislation n or does it constitute a statement of l egislative intent.House Bill Report HB 1638 - 1 -of the initiation and comp liance with a schedule of immunization; or (3) a ce rtificate of exemption. Full immuniz ation includes chickenpox, diphtheria, measles, German measles, haemop hilus influenza type B dis ease, hepatitis B, mumps, pneumococcal disease, polio, tetanus, an d whooping cough. The c ertificate of immunization status form published by the Departm ent of Health allows labo ratory evidence of immun ity (titer) to substitute for the required immunization. The form also allows a verified his tory of chickenpox to substitute f or the chickenpox vaccin e. In order for a child to be exempt from all or part o f the immunization requir ement, one of the following must be presen ted: \u009f \u009f \u009fa written certification sig ned by health care pract itioner that a particular va ccine is not advisable for the child (the child must receive th e vaccine if it ceases to be contraindicated); a written certification sig ned by a parent or legal g uardian that the signator's religious beliefs are contrary to the required immunization; o r a written certification sig ned by a parent or legal g uardian that the signator h as either a philosophical or person al objection to immunizat ion of the child. An exemption form must also include a statement signed by a health care pr actitioner stating that he or she provided th e signator with informatio n about the benefits and r isks of immunization, unless the parent or guardian demo nstrates membership in a religious body or church in which the religi ous beliefs or teachings p reclude a health care prac titioner from providing medical treatm ent to the child. \"Health care practitioner\" is defin ed as a licensed allopathic or osteopathic physician, naturopath, ph ysician assistant, or advan ced registered nurse practitioner. --------------------- ------------ Summary of Bill: A philosophical or person al objection may not be u sed to exempt a child from the measles, mumps, and rubella vacci ne.

Fiscal Note: Available. Effective Date: The bill takes effect 90 days after adjournment of the session in which the bill is passed. Staff Summary of Publi c Testimony: House Bill Report HB 1638 - 2 -(In support) This issue cr osses all lines. The meas les outbreak in Washingto n is larger and faster than any in history. Measles can spread quic kly leaving the vulnerable unprotected. Adverse health impacts o f measles can include hea ring loss, pneumonia, enc ephalitis, or even death. Measles is also ex traordinarily contagious. Measles is a serious caus e of death for children worldwide. The current measles outbreak is diverting needed healt h care and community resources. Pe ople are afraid of going o ut in public. People who have compromised immune sy stems depend on the rest of us to stay safe; this is k nown as community or herd immu nity. Ninety-five percent of people need to be vacc inated to achieve community immu nity. People who choose not to be vaccinated are p utting infants and cancer survivors at ri sk. The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective; ad verse effects are rare. The measles vaccin e has no relation to autism . States with tighter exem ptions to the vaccine have fewer infect ions. Most of the people who were infected in this current outbreak were unvaccinated; this w as a preventable outbreak . (Opposed) Vaccines are c lassified as unavoidably u nsafe. This is not a one in a million issue. Ten to 15 percent of peop le can be adversely affect ed by vaccines. The cons equences can include encephalitis and e ven death. More kids die from vaccines themselve s than measles. The number of deaths fro m the measles is overstate d and the number of death s from vaccines is understated. This is de liberate. Vaccine manufa cturers are protected from legal liability under federal law. Congr ess is in the thrall of the v accine manufacturers. El iminating vaccine exemptions puts a large minority of people at risk. The problem is n ot low vaccination rates, it is hig h vaccination rates. Mea sles is no longer dangerou s because of modern health care. Infa nts are already protected because of passive immu nity. Prior to the measles vaccine, immuni ty rates were already high . Washington already has high vaccination rates, but ign ores the unintended conse quences of this type of bi ll. States that have removed the person al exemption do not have 100 percent vaccination rates. Removing exemptions will force peo ple to go underground. V accines are not perfect pr oducts. Not everyone who receives a vaccine will become imm une, so you cannot achiev e herd immunity through vaccines. People who come from outside o f the country cause outbre aks. Disease control is the key. This b ill forces medical interven tions on people without in formed consent. The increase in the numb er of mandatory vaccines has caused an explosion of diseases, including food allergies a nd autism. Vaccines are n ot subject to double-blind placebo studies and have inadequate safe ty testing. People who ob ject to vaccines are not fr ee riders; they are people with strongly h eld objections to vaccines .
