These days, however, we're experiencing another, more welcome, feeling: optimism. Thanks to the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and the massive effort we and others have made to administer them, we're seeing real progress in containing the pandemic. At RWJBH, we always strive to be proactive, positive and energetic in our response to issues and events. We acknowledge that disparities in healthcare for Black and brown communities exist, and we're making every possible effort to address this issue throughout our entire organization. We've developed a far-reaching initiative, Ending Racism Together, to ensure that our organization is anti- racist in everything we do. At Newark Beth Israel Medical Center and Children's Hospital of New Jersey (NBI), we will never stop addressing racism and working to create equity for the communities that we serve. In this issue, you will read about our personal commitment to ending racism. Earlier this year, we appointed our first Chief Equity Officer. We have created platforms for employees and clinicians to engage actively on issues of racism, inclusion and equity. In addition, you will learn about how our $150 million expansion project will spur lasting economic growth in our community and create opportunities for NBI to invest in local and minority-owned businesses. In the end, it's the resilience and strength of our healthcare providers, staff and patients that continues to inspire us.

The cake is presented on the day of a patient's discharge from the postpartum unit at NBI. Some moms dig right in. Others take it home to freeze so they can have it on the child's first birthday. All are touched by the gesture, which shows that their delivery at NBI was anything but routine for the staff. \"The birth of a baby is such a special time,\" Jemison says. \"We want every patient to know that we as healthcare providers are here to support them.\"TEAM APPROACH That support begins even before the baby is born, with childbirth preparation classes and a tour of the maternity unit. When it's time to deliver, a mother at NBI will have a private labor room with a private bathroom. The newly renovated postpartum unit has 34 private, spacious rooms. Infants room in with their mothers unless they require special care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. \"As soon as the new mother comes to the postpartum unit, she is welcomed by the unit secretary, and the staff comes to meet her and her partner,\" Jemison explains. \"They meet the whole team\u2014the healthcare providers, the dietary aide, the environmental services worker\u2014so they feel secure and comfortable.\"New mothers usually stay in the postpartum unit for 48 to 72 hours. \"There's a lot of work to be done during that time to be sure the new mom is ready to go home with her infant,\" Jemison says. That includes support and education for everything from dressing an infant appropriately for the weather to breastfeeding to safe sleep practices. Mothers are screened for depression and anxiety\u2014not uncommon reactions to pregnancy and childbirth, especially during a pandemic\u2014and provided with resources that can help. A social worker is available to provide referrals if the new mother will need financial, housing or other assistance. One or two days after discharge, a staff member will call the family to find out how they're doing and see if they need further assistance. \"We've been doing this for a long time,\" says Jemison, \"and we do all we can to support our families' success.\" SPEAK UP FOR SAFETY Maternal care providers at NBI practice the \"Stop. Look. Listen!\" program to ensure safety and a positive experience for all mothers. \"That means we stop what we're doing when a patient tells us she thinks something might be wrong,\" says LaShawn Jemison, MSN, MBA, RN. \"We listen to the patient because she knows her body best. And we look by conducting an examination to see if a problem is developing.\" Too often, pregnant women and new mothers develop medical issues that could have been avoided if the woman's concerns hadn't been dismissed as typical complaints of pregnancy. \"Always be persistent. Be your best advocate,\" Jemison advises women. \"If things are not the way you think they should be, you need to speak up for your own safety\u2014 and see the issue through until it's resolved to your satisfaction.\" To learn more about the award-winning maternity care at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, call 973.926.7108 or visit www.rwjbh.org/maternity.

Healthy Together | PB | Summer 2021 Newark Beth Israel Medical Center | YOUR HEART' Bernard China is singing again after a successful heart transplant at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Healthy Together | 6 | Summer 2021 Newark Beth Israel Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/NEWARKBETH 7 NBI_HeartTransplant_Sum21_Final.indd 6NBI_HeartTransplant_Sum21_Final.indd 6 6/3/21 9:43 AM6/3/21 9:43 AMA HEART TRANSPLANT HELPS A NEWARK MAN KEEP THE SONG ALIVE. At 1:30 a.m., a nurse holding a glowing cell phone approached Bernard China's hospital bed at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBI) and gently woke him. \"Mr. China, Dr. Kapoor is on the line,\" she said. The 58-year-old Newark resident jolted awake. If the person on the other end was transplant cardiologist Saurabh Kapoor, MD, Interim Director of Advanced Heart Failure Treatment and Transplant at NBI and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group, it could mean only one thing. Bernard took the phone. \"Mr. China,\" Dr. Kapoor said, \"we have your heart.\" Bernard barely had words. He dialed his wife, Constance, on his own phone. \"Just listen,\" he said, and let Dr. Kapoor repeat his message. Five hours earlier, Bernard had been despondent in a call with Constance. It was the evening of December 29, 2020, and he'd been in the hospital with advanced heart failure since early September, waiting for a donor heart. Constance urged him to rely on the faith they shared, she as a preacher and he as a singer with the Mighty Royal Travelers, a gospel group that has performed across the United States and has songs on the Spotify streaming music app. \"I didn't want to hear what she was saying because I just wanted to go home,\" Bernard says. Constance insisted: \"Bernard, it's going to come.\" Now, just hours later, Dr. Kapoor explained what was to happen. \"They are going to prep you now,\" he said. \"I'll see you at 7 a.m.\" Bernard raised his eyes. \"When Dr. Kapoor hung up, all these people came into my room,\" he says. STUNNING DIAGNOSIS The long road to that moment began in August 2017, when Bernard woke during the night and found it hard to breathe. Alarmed, he told Constance he was heading to the hospital, but encouraged her to stay home with their five children. Tests at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston showed fluid buildup in his lungs\u2014a sign of heart failure. \"With the condition my heart was in, they could not discharge me,\" Bernard says. \"I was stunned. I'd never had a problem with my heart before.\" Diuretic medication drained fluid from his body, but the treatment wasn't enough. He was referred to the Advanced Heart Failure Treatment and Transplant program at NBI. \"When Bernard came to us, his heart was very weak, and he was short of breath in his normal day-to-day activities,\" Dr. Kapoor says. A weak heart does not supply the body with enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, the body begins to retain fluid, which can back up into different organs, including the lungs. Normally, the heart's pumping chamber ejects 65 to 75 percent of its blood with each heartbeat. Bernard's heart was pumping just 8 percent. Oral medications helped at first, but by November 2018, the blood- pumping capacity became so poor that Bernard was put on an intravenous drug administered continuously to help the heart contract. His condition was now serious enough that he began tests to qualify him for a heart transplant. Unfortunately, he was found to have prostate cancer, which required four months of radiation treatment before a transplant could be considered. During that time, he also had a stroke. \"For a long time, I wasn't eligible for a transplant because of all the other stuff going on,\" he says. Finally, around Labor Day 2020, he learned he'd qualified for the transplant list and doctors would commence their donor search. \"That was a real exciting day,\" Bernard says. The all-clear came just in time. ANOTHER WAIT BEGINS \"Bernard was on the cusp of cardiogenic shock, when organs can start to fail,\" Dr. Kapoor says. \"He was very sick and needed to stay in the hospital.\" Even the intravenous medication was failing, and Bernard was placed on a balloon pump that supported his heart until a match could be found. Thus began the long wait in the hospital. Due to the pandemic, family visits consisted of Bernard looking out his eighth-floor window to see Constance and the kids waving from the parking lot. The momentous call telling Bernard he had a donor was joyous for Dr. Kapoor as well. \"It's an amazing feeling to call someone who is at risk of losing everything and say we found a match,\" Dr. Kapoor says. Bernard's transplant, which took place on December 30, was one of six transplants performed in six weeks at NBI. \"NBI has an experienced team at a high-volume center that has done more than 1,100 transplants,\" Dr. Kapoor says. \"Bernard has been a trouper through this ordeal and has done very well.\" Bernard now says he's getting back to normal activities such as attending church services and easing back into singing. \"I'm looking to get back not just to 100 percent,\" he says, \"but 200 percent, where I come back stronger than ever.\" SAURABH KAPOOR, MD Whoever your heart beats for, our hearts beat for you.

Healthy Together | 6 | Summer 2021 Newark Beth Israel Medical Center | 7 6/3/21 9:43 AM6/3/21 9:43 AMOutdoor fun in the summer can be just what the doctor ordered for cooped-up kids\u2014 but supervision and safety measures are essential. More than 200,000 children get treated in emergency departments each year for playground-related injuries, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians. \"In our Emergency Pediatrics Center, we see a greater number of fractures in summer,\" says Adam Sivitz, MD, Division Director, Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Children's Hospital of New Jersey at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. \"Some are caused by falls or contact injuries from running around and playing sports; others come from children falling or jumping from tall objects.\" To ensure safe playtime, Dr. Sivitz recommends the following guidelines to parents and caregivers:1Supervise young children at play. \"An injury or drowning can happen quickly, sometimes when you turn your back for even a couple of seconds,\" he says. 2Read posted rules with your children. Look for signs with pool rules and playground signs that explain which equipment is appropriate for children of certain age groups. Also, look at the playground's condition. \"If the equipment is old, needs repair or has broken or sharp edges, don't let your kids play on it,\" Dr. Sivitz says. 3Teach your children safe playground behavior. \"Anything can be dangerous if it has more kids on it than it should, or if children are roughhousing around the equipment,\" Dr. Sivitz says. 4Make sure children wear safety gear. In New Jersey, children under age 17 must wear an approved helmet when cycling, roller skating, in- line skating or skateboarding. \"Wrist, elbow and knee protection can prevent fractures, too, especially for children on scooters or hoverboards,\" Dr. Sivitz says. 5Have kids use sun protection. \"Playing outdoors in the sun helps the body make vitamin D, which most people are deficient in,\" Dr. Sivitz explains. However, to avoid sunburn, children should always use a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. \"Reapply it every 90 minutes,\" he says. 6Be creative to keep kids active. No playground or pool nearby? \"Even jumping rope for just five to 10 minutes is good for a child's cardiovascular health,\" Dr. Sivitz says. \"I recommend any activity that gets children outside and gets their heart rate going.\"EXPERT EMERGENCY CARE FOR CHILDREN The Emergency Pediatrics Center at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center\u2014the largest pediatric ED in New Jersey\u2014is open 24/7. \"We see 35,000 children each year and care for all kinds of pediatric illnesses and injuries,\" explains pediatric emergency medicine specialist Adam Sivitz, MD.

We treat everything from chronic illnesses and complex physical disabilities, like brain and spinal cord injuries, to a full scope of developmental, behavioral and mental health concerns. We have convenient locations throughout the state: Bayonne, Clifton, East Brunswick, Egg Harbor Township, Hamilton, Jersey City, Mountainside, New Brunswick, Newark, Somerset, Toms River and Warren.In May 2019, Carol Backle of Toms River noticed drooping on the left side of her son Jayson's face. After evaluation by a doctor, the athletic, high- energy 13-year-old was diagnosed with Bell's palsy, a weakness in facial muscles that's usually temporary. One day, however, Jayson experienced sudden weakness in his left leg and hand. At the local emergency department, tests revealed the reason: a tumor in his brain that was causing hemiparesis, a partial paralysis on the left side of his body. In July, Jayson had surgery to remove the tumor. The family's insurance carrier, unsure of how significant the teen's recovery would be, strongly recommended that he be admitted to a long-term care facility. \"I was not OK with that,\" Carol says. She immediately began to research other options and soon decided that an inpatient rehabilitation program at Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH) in New Brunswick offered the type of care Jayson would need. UP FOR THE TASK \"Hemiparesis can be very frustrating, especially for someone of Jayson's age and high activity level,\" says Zack Gubitosi, DPT, CSCS, a pediatric physical therapist at CSH. \"I could tell this was a scary experience for him and his family, and I wanted them to be as comfortable as possible from day one.\" Gubitosi incorporated elements of the sports and games Jayson loves into their sessions. \"He would have me balance on one leg while we played Uno. We would play catch,\" says Jayson. \"It was awesome!\" \"Jayson was always so motivated to get better,\" Gubitosi says. \"There were understandably some difficult days, and those were the days I would challenge him to fight harder. He was always up for the task.\" After seven weeks of inpatient care, Jayson was able to go home. He continues to receive occupational therapy as an outpatient at the CSH Toms River location, working on fine motor skills. He's able to enjoy his former activities, such as going to the gym, playing video games and hanging out with friends. He's also involved in the Youth Advisory Council at CSH, which meets once a month to discuss ways to create the best possible experience for patients. \"We're just so grateful for the care that Jayson was given,\" Carol says. \"We know this whole experience could have been so much worse if we had not chosen to go where we did.\" With the wisdom of experience, Jayson offers advice for anyone who is on their own recovery path. \"Don't dwell on any of your bad thoughts,\" he says. \"Think about all the good that is happening, even the littlest progression in recovery. Focus on that!\" For more information about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.rwjbh.org/childrensspecialized.A DETERMINED YOUNG ATHLETE BATTLES BACK FROM PARTIAL PARALYSIS.'FOCUS ON THE GOOD' An RWJBarnabas Health facilit y From left, Jayson at CSH with his sister, Samantha; on the mend; and with his parents Frank and Carol at his 8th grade graduation. Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | AM6/3/21 11:47 AMRacism has been described as a public health crisis. What does that mean? [BARRY OSTROWSKY] We start with the proposition that there is structural racism in our society. The data show that whether you're talking about food insecurity, housing, education, employment or financial and economic development, the majority of people who aren't doing well are people of color, particularly Black people. When it comes ENDING RACISM TOGETHER RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), the largest academic healthcare system in New Jersey, is addressing equity and systemic racism and promoting an anti- racist culture throughout the organization and the communities it serves. Here, Barry Ostrowsky, President and Chief Executive Officer of RWJBH, and DeAnna Minus-Vincent, Chief Social Integration and Health Equity Strategist, explain what the system's Ending Racism Together initiative entails.to healthcare, disparities of outcome for people of color, and particularly Black people, are deeply harmful. That is not a political statement. It is a data-driven statement. [DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT] Research shows that 80 to 90 percent of health outcomes are a result of social determinants of health\u2014the conditions in which a person lives, works and plays. That's important, because race itself has RWJBARNABAS HEALTH IS ON A JOURNEY TO CREATE TRUE EQUITY IN HEALTHCARE. Healthy Together | 10 | Summer 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | found to be a social determinant. When we look at the data, even when all other things are equal, people of color, in particular Black people, still have poor health outcomes. What are some examples of how racism plays out in healthcare? [DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT] Statistics show that even Black women with more education and more income tend to lose their babies more often than white women who have less income and less education. This is due to the chronic stressors of being Black in America and what chronic stress does to our bodies. It creates a fight-or-flight syndrome at all times. Therefore, we're more susceptible to losing our babies and to chronic diseases. Countless research studies show that pain levels expressed by Black people are not believed, and so prescription pain medicines are not given in the same amount. Even Black children with fractures aren't given the same level of medication as white children. When a Black person goes into an emergency department, people assume we are substance abusers. I remember going to an ED with an asthma attack and the nurse saying, \"Do you have any clean veins?\" I work in healthcare and so I was able to navigate the system and march upstairs and talk to the CEO. But I shouldn't have to do that, and neither should anyone else. What is the role of a healthcare system in combating racism? [BARRY OSTROWSKY] We realize that when we construct healthcare delivery mechanisms, we have to consider the ability of everybody to access them. It's not equitable to simply say, \"Anyone can walk into our clinic between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.\" Many people, particularly Black people in urban communities, can't take time off for a healthcare visit during those hours. From an operational standpoint, we're reviewing key policies and procedures such as the refusal of care policy. We've conducted Listening Tours to afford employees at all levels of the organization the opportunity to provide input, and we held focus groups in April and May so that employees could have a say in the strategic planning process. [DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT] We hold monthly educational sessions for employees, called \"Equitable Encounters: Real Talk About Race,\" where issues of racism are discussed. Training is forthcoming for all employees. We're also thinking about how to serve people in the way they want to be served. For example, historically, if someone has a need, we send an outreach worker to their house. But if you work two jobs and only have a few hours with your kids, maybe you don't want outreach workers coming to the house. Maybe you'd prefer email or phone-based support. If you do need an outreach worker for complex problems, how do we coordinate services with our community partners so you can have just one outreach worker, instead of several? In addition to the practices you mention, how will a patient at an RWJBH facility become aware of the anti-racism initiative? [BARRY OSTROWSKY] When patients come to our facilities, they'll see posters and messages on video screens, and will experience an environment of respect. When we admit patients, we'll make the point that we're an anti- racist organization and if they have any experience that's inconsistent with that, please tell us. The journey to end racism requires everybody's effort and commitment. We know that we can't send out a memo saying, \"We're anti-racist, and by the end of the year there'll be no racism.\" We invite patients and all our employees to speak up and engage as we make more progress toward becoming an anti-racist organization.WHAT IS A MICROAGGRESSION? As part of Ending Racism Together, RWJBarnabas Health conducts regular trainings and other educational events for its employees. A recent session focused on the topic of microaggressions. What is a microaggression? Microaggressions are the everyday verbal and nonverbal slights and indignities that members of marginalized groups experience in their day-to-day interactions. Often, individuals who engage in microaggressions are unaware that they have said something offensive or demeaning. The accumulated experience of receiving microaggressions can lead to depression, anxiety and effects on physical health. What are some examples? Mispronouncing a person's name even after he or she has corrected you. Asking an Asian American where she's \"really\" from. Clutching your purse or wallet when a Black or Latino man approaches. Assuming a person of color is a service worker. How can a person avoid committing a microaggression? Think before you speak. Reflect on whether your brain is \"stuck\" on the racial or other differences between you and another person. If confronted on a microaggression, try not to be defensive and to understand the other person's point of view.

BARRY OSTROWSKY DEANNA MINUS-VINCENT REFUSAL OF CARE POLICY RWJBarnabas Health will not accommodate requests for or refusal by a patient for the services of RWJBH workforce members based on a personal characteristic, such as race or ethnicity, except in the limited situation where the patient (or other individual on the patient's behalf) requests that an accommodation based on gender only is necessary to protect a patient's religious or cultural beliefs.

Healthy Together | 12 | Summer 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 13 System_COVID_Cardio_Sum21_final.indd 12System_COVID_Cardio_Sum21_final.indd 12 6/3/21 11:54 AM6/3/21 11:54 AMNot only is it safe for cardiovascular patients to get any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines\u2014 it's especially important that they do so, according to Partho Sengupta, MD, MBBS, FAAC, the newly appointed Chief of Cardiology at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Why is it so important for cardiovascular patients to get the vaccine? \"People with cardiovascular disease are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19,\" Dr. Sengupta explains. \"That's because it causes a state of inflammation to the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to a greater likelihood of abnormal heart rhythm, blood clots and heart attacks. Clinical studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with cardiac conditions have a higher risk of needing to be put on a ventilator. Vaccination protects people from these severe effects.\" What kind of side effects can be expected? \"Normally, people may or may not get a tiny bruise and short-term pain at the site of the shot,\" Dr. Sengupta says. \"If you're on a blood thinner, you may get a bigger bruise. Normal side effects, especially after a second dose, may include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever or nausea. Some people have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, but those are extremely rare.\" After a person is fully vaccinated, can he or she resume normal activities? \"Clinical trials have shown 90 to 95 percent protection, but there's a possibility that some people may develop COVID-19 even after being vaccinated; the infection runs a milder course,\" Dr. Sengupta says. \"The CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines on masking are evolving. However, patients may still choose to be additionally cautious and wear a mask and practice social distancing, as we wait to see the impact and evolution of the most recent CDC guidelines.\" What else should cardiovascular patients do to protect themselves? \"Get outdoors and exercise\u2014walk, bike, experience nature,\" says Dr. Sengupta. \"The pandemic has made a lot of people very fearful of any outdoor experience. At least 50 percent of my patients have given up any form of activity. The result is that they gain weight, become deconditioned, and conditions like hypertension and blood pressure become uncontrolled. \"I advise patients to avoid crowds and clusters of people, but not to avoid being physically active. Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on most days. All of this will help you feel better and build your resilience.\" If you've been skipping physician visits, as many have during the pandemic, be sure to get back in a regular routine as soon as you can, Dr. Sengupta advises. \"People have put off procedures and elective interventions and even allowed their symptoms to worsen for fear of going out during the pandemic,\" he says. \"This is your chance to resume your relationship with your doctor and get back on track. \"In fact, you may find that you can do many routine checkups remotely, thanks to all the progress taking place with telehealth and remote monitoring devices,\" he says. \"The pandemic has sparked a lot of innovation, which is allowing people to get care while still in their homes, and that trend is going to continue.\"RWJBARNABAS HEALTH: YOUR HEART-HEALTH DESTINATION Whether you're in need of care for high blood pressure, require heart surgery or are interested in ways to help keep your heart healthy, RWJBarnabas Health's heart, vascular and thoracic care programs are here for you.

A wide range of treatment options for both adult and pediatric patients is available at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston and at satellite locations throughout New Jersey. Here are just two examples of patients whose lives have been transformed through our world-class care and the generosity of organ donors. BACK IN ACTION AFTER A DOUBLE TRANSPLANT RONALD PELLETIER, MD Dillon Devlin, 29, had Type 1 diabetes, but that didn't stop him from traveling the country with a friend between 2014 and 2018. They hit 38 states, ending up in California for a while before coming home to New Jersey. Along the way, Dillon went to pharmacies to get his insulin prescription refilled, but his increasingly high blood pressure was never addressed. By the time he got back to his home state and met with an endocrinologist and a nephrologist, he was shocked to learn that he was in stage 4 kidney failure and would need both a kidney transplant and a pancreas transplant. \"Kidney failure alone is an older person's disease. A kidney and pancreas transplant is more typically needed in a younger person who has Type 1 diabetes,\" explains Ronald Pelletier, MD, Director of Transplantation at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. \"That's because the pancreas is not making enough insulin, a hormone that controls the blood sugar level in the body.\" THE WAIT BEGINS Dillon went from working at an auto salvage business, hoisting transmissions onto pallets, to needing three- times-weekly dialysis. For eight months, he awaited a suitable kidney and pancreas for transplant. Six different possibilities fell through, one as he was actually being prepared for surgery. Finally, in November 2020, Dr. Pelletier successfully transplanted a new kidney and pancreas. \"All of a sudden I was waking up from surgery and my mom was saying, 'You did it!'\" he recalls. \"I was standing up within six hours and out of the hospital in six days.\" A subsequent period of rest and recovery synced up well with the pandemic-related lockdown. Now he's back to lifting weights and going for hikes, and is actively seeking to get back into the workforce. \"It's so strange to wrap my head around not having to take insulin,\" he says. \"Modern medicine is a complete marvel.\" \"What I really love about kidney and pancreas transplantation is that you get to transform someone's life,\" Dr. Pelletier says. \"Not only do they not need dialysis afterward, they're no longer diabetic! That's fantastic.\" Dillon's advice to others awaiting transplant: \"Don't let hopelessness consume you. It can happen anytime. The seventh time I got a call, it was a miracle match.\" Healthy Together | 14 | Summer 2021 RWJBarnabas Health LIFE-CHANGING IMPACT OF A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT During a transplant, the new kidney is placed in the lower abdomen. Timothy Collins, 60, of Westfield, was diagnosed in 1996 with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which causes kidneys to enlarge and lose function over time. \"PKD is hereditary,\" he explains. \"My father had it, my grandmother had it and my brother has it.\" In 1998, Timothy got a kidney transplant from his younger sister. The kidney functioned well for almost 18 years, but in 2016 an infection caused his body to become severely dehydrated. Timothy needed to be on hemodialysis\u2014in which blood is pumped out of the body, filtered through an artificial kidney machine and returned\u2014three days a week for two months. After that, he had a catheter placed in his stomach so he could do at-home peritoneal dialysis, which uses the lining inside the belly as a natural filter. He did this nightly for 16 months. \"Even though you're on dialysis, it's not like having a kidney,\" Timothy says. \"There's still poison in your body and you have a yellow look. I gained weight and my creatinine levels [a measure of kidney function] were way too high.\" MEDICAL ADVANCES \"We're so fortunate that in kidney failure, there's the option of dialysis,\" says Francis Weng, MD, Chief of the Renal and Pancreas Transplant Division at Saint Barnabas Medical Center (SBMC). \"It keeps people alive. However, dialysis doesn't replace the full function of the kidney. For most patients, the better option is a kidney transplant.\" Timothy's niece, who was 21 at the time, offered to donate a kidney to him. At Timothy's insistence, they waited until she graduated from business school and law school, which she was attending simultaneously, in May 2018. Though her kidney wasn't a match for Timothy, she became part of the kidney transplant chain at SBMC: She donated to someone for whom her kidney was compatible, and Timothy was given a kidney from another donor. \"Living donor programs like the one Timothy was in are one of the significant advances in kidney transplantation that we've seen over the past 15 years,\" says Dr. Weng. \"We also have many more choices in the kind of medications we use to prevent rejection of the transplant and minimize side effects. The vast majority of patients do quite well after transplantation.\" \"It's a wonderful thing,\" says Timothy. \"I have so much more energy now, and I have so much more time to myself since I don't have to plan my days around getting to a machine at a certain time. I've been able to be the project manager on several commercial renovation projects, and that was the best therapy ever. I love life, and I've been very blessed.\" FRANCIS WENG, MD To learn more about kidney and pancreas transplantation at RWJBarnabas Health, visit www.rwjbh.org/kidneytransplant. LOVING LIFE WITH A NEW KIDNEY Damaged Kidney Transplanted Kidney Bladder Healthy Together | 14 | Summer 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | AM6/3/21 11:58 AMFor decades, the cornerstones of cancer treatment were surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. In recent years, immunotherapy has risen to the forefront. \"What's remarkable about immunotherapy is the way it uses the immune system to specifically target cancer cells and not healthy cells,\" explains Christian Hinrichs, MD, Chief of the Section of Cancer Immunotherapy and Co-director of the Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Dr. Hinrichs, a world-class expert in cancer immunology and immunotherapy, was recruited from the National Institutes of Health to co-direct the center with Eileen White, PhD, Deputy Director and Chief Scientific Officer at Rutgers Cancer Institute. \"Immunotherapy has been a real game-changer for systemic cancer therapy for two reasons,\" Dr. Hinrichs says. \"First, it creates a very strong attack against cancer. Second, it has remarkably few negative side effects.\" However, some cancers respond well to immunotherapies, but others don't respond at all. Why? To answer that question, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey established the new Center of Excellence. The $50 million effort, fueled by an anonymous gift of $25 million, is poised to lead the immunotherapy revolution and transform cancer treatment. \"We are putting into place key expertise and facilities for 'first in human' clinical trials in immunotherapy and cell therapy,\" Dr. Hinrichs explains.The program is also serving a large and diverse patient population in New Jersey, Dr. Hinrichs notes. \"That's so important in cancer research,\" he says. NEW CONNECTIONS The Center of Excellence takes a novel approach by uniting its strengths in cancer immunology and metabolism under one umbrella. \"Few, if any, institutions have this capability,\" says Dr. White, Co-director of the center. Dr. White is a globally recognized expert in the study of metabolism\u2014the way cells grow by using energy and nutrients for sustenance\u2014 and how it contributes to cancer. \"By focusing our efforts on determining how tumor metabolism drives growth and suppresses the immune response, we can begin to develop new immunotherapies and make existing immunotherapies more effective,\" she says. The center is also focusing on the development of new cellular therapies for common types of cancer, a particular area of expertise for Dr. Hinrichs. \"We are focused on the discovery and development of new T cell [immune system cell] therapies, particularly gene- engineering approaches that allow T cells to specifically and powerfully target tumors,\" he says. These new therapies are made in a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which follows stringent FDA regulations to ensure the quality of the manufactured therapies. \"A GMP facility is absolutely critical for what we do,\" says Dr. Hinrichs. \"It enables us to produce personalized cell therapy products for each patient right here. We can actually discover and develop new cancer therapies at Rutgers Cancer Institute that no one can do anywhere else.\" Many of these new therapies will be available to patients at Rutgers Cancer Institute and throughout the RWJBarnabas Health system.Eileen White, PhD (left), and Christian Hinrichs, MD, Co-directors of the Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence, a groundbreaking collaboration with a mission to develop new immunotherapies To learn more about the Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence, visit https://cinj.org/immunology-metabolism.

Terry Sr., President and CEO of NBI and Children's Hospital of New Jersey. \"But we know that it's not enough to not be racist. It's important that we are intentional about what we do and how we do it.\" At NBI, that commitment is demonstrated in many ways and as part of RWJBarnabas Health's larger antiracism effort, Ending Racism Together. POWER OF TALK Immediately following the murder of George Floyd, NBI held a series of town hall discussions to give employees a forum to discuss race, including talks with nationally known anti-racism activists. \"Employees were able to express themselves and share their own experiences with racism and that of their families, and I think that was pretty cathartic,\" Terry says. \"We didn't stay silent on this issue and we addressed it head-on.\" The senior management team also held extensive discussions about how to support Black employees as well as each other. \"The expectation that we're just going to carry on and go to the next meeting is not realistic,\" he explains. \"We need to support each other during these times, and we'll continue to discuss equity, racism and discrimination.\" To ensure that the conversations go on, NBI weaves continuing education and action into many critical aspects of life at NBI. Supported by the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, the medical center has a number of Business Resource Groups, in which employees come together to raise awareness around issues of importance to diverse and marginalized populations. In 2020, following the social unrest in our nation, a Social Justice Business Resource Group was formed. NBI also has an active White Coats for Black Lives movement. \"We started an educational series for clinical equity to focus on healthcare disparities and social determinants of health,\" explains Atiya Jaha- Rashidi, RN, Chief Equity Officer at NBI. \"We had originally scheduled a series of six sessions, but we ended up hearing from so many doctors and clinicians who wanted to share their research that we are now planning to host additional sessions.\" \"Racism is embedded in our nation's healthcare delivery system and it fosters and often creates the healthcare disparities that we struggle to address. These disparities were made painfully clear during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we witnessed the disproportionate impact of the virus on Black and brown communities,\" Terry says. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES Senior management is actively pursuing the question of equity throughout the medical center's operations. \"When making critical decisions that impact our patients and the overall operations of our hospital, we use the RWJBH Racial Equity Assessment Tool that includes a series of questions to make sure we consider the impact on equity, disparities and our community,\" Terry explains. \"The tool ensures that all of our decisions, partnerships, vendor choices and investments are in alignment with our core values. We ask questions such as, 'Will this help eliminate a disparity in healthcare?' and 'How will it specifically impact the community?'\" In fact, equity and community investment are key components of the hospital's $150 million expansion project. It is the largest expansion of the facility in the last 50 years, which will include a new glass- enclosed lobby, an expanded emergency department, a new intensive care unit and a new physical center for all cardiac care. NBI aims to ensure that this expansion project is a catalyst for economic development in the surrounding community. The hospital has already committed to invest 30 percent of construction costs in Newark-based businesses, as well as other minority-, female- and veteran-owned businesses in connection with this project. \"Newark Beth Israel is an anchor institution and we understand that the investments we make in our community today will have a lasting impact on social determinants of health such as unemployment, underemployment and food security,\" Terry says. \"The issue of disparities in healthcare is ongoing, and our efforts to create true equity for our community will never stop.\" HOW A BOLD PLEDGE IS TRANSFORMED INTO ACTION.

The pandemic has been a scary and often confusing time\u2014but hope is here. Vaccines that protect against COVID-19 are safe, they work and they're ready for you. When you get the COVID-19 vaccine, you're taking care of yourself and the people around you, too. That's because the more people who are vaccinated, the more difficult it is for the coronavirus to travel from person to person. For now, we still need to wear masks in crowded settings and wash hands frequently, even after getting vaccinated. But the day when we can hug and shake hands freely again is coming ever closer. At Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, we want you to stay safe and healthy, and we've rolled up our sleeves to prove it, as these photos of some of our leaders show.DO YOUR PART. GET THE SHOT!

COVID-19 vaccines provide protection from serious illness, hospitalization and death. These vaccines were studied in clinical trials with racially diverse populations. You should receive the vaccine even if you have already had COVID-19. After you are vaccinated, you should continue to wear a mask, wash your hands and physically distance in public. You will have full protection from the vaccine two weeks after the date of your last injection. The COVID-19 vaccine will not change your DNA. The vaccine cannot give you COVID-19. The vaccine does not affect fertility. The vaccine does not contain microchips or tracking devices.COMMON SIDE EFFECTS Itchiness, redness or pain at the injection site. Headache. Fatigue. Body aches. Fever or chills. There is a small chance the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction, but those reactions are very uncommon. Side effects can last 24 to 48 hours after injection. The vaccine is a crucial tool in the fight against COVID-19. Widespread vaccination is key to achieving \"herd immunity\" and ending this pandemic for all of us. As more of us become vaccinated, the safer we'll all be.Please consult with your physician if you have questions or concerns about being vaccinated.

The cancers tend to show up in women who are younger, and the cancers are often more aggressive,\" says Luke M. Partyka, MD, Section Chief of Breast Imaging for NBI. \"Unfortunately, our patient population is under-screened, and we really wanted to improve patient access to these potentially lifesaving exams.\" That's why the Breast Health Center makes a priority of educating the community about breast health. \"Before COVID-19, we would give talks at churches and schools about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and encourage people to sign up for a screening mammogram, and we hope to be able to start doing that again when it is safe to do so,\" says Dr. Partyka. During Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, the hospital also offers several events for the community, including free breast cancer screenings and breast education programs. COMFORT AND CARE Before the breast center opened, patients had to get mammograms done in the general radiology department of the hospital. \"We wanted the exams to be performed in a dedicated workspace and in a calm and quiet environment,\" says Dr. Partyka. It started with a vision: to have a dedicated space within Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBI) devoted to breast cancer screening and diagnostics. That vision became a reality in 2016 with the opening of the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey Breast Health Center, made possible in part by a $1.3 million grant from the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey. The Breast Health Center is one way that NBI is proactively addressing high rates of breast ONLY THE BEST FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH LUKE PARTYKA, MD RWJBarnabas Health and the Frederick B.

Cutting-edge screening technology includes 3D mammography, which uses multiple low-dose X-rays to create a three-dimensional picture of the breast and improve cancer detection. Other diagnostic tools include breast ultrasounds, breast MRIs and breast biopsies. Genetic counseling and testing services are also offered to assess inherited cancer risks. The center has been designated as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology. In the event that cancer is diagnosed, patients are guided through all the stages of care by a breast health navigator. Treatment is provided by a multidisciplinary team of technicians and board-certified, fellowship-trained breast surgeons and mammographers. GROWING AND EXPANDING \"Within the first couple of years, we saw a 15 to 20 percent growth in screenings,\" says Dr. Partyka. \"And we've been able to detect breast cancer earlier in many cases, which can help improve survival rates.\" This year the center will receive a third 3D mammography machine that will also have the capability to do biopsies with 3D imaging. \"This will add a room for us to do screening mammograms and diagnostic workups and will increase our capacity by about one third,\" says Dr. Partyka. The center has received many accolades from the community over the years. \"We get letters and positive feedback all the time,\" says Dr. Partyka. \"Many of our staff members at Newark Beth Israel use our center for their own breast care, which is a testament to the quality we provide.\"At left, the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey Breast Health Center was designed with tranquility and patient comfort in mind. An NBI employee and breast cancer survivor tells her story. Lisa Crapps, 58, has worked as a community relations manager for Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBI) for two decades. However, her connection to the hospital isn't just professional\u2014it's deeply personal, too. A breast cancer survivor for almost five years, Lisa credits the hospital for both detecting and successfully treating her cancer. In 2015, Lisa began noticing discharge coming from the nipple of her left breast, but she didn't think much of it. Though she'd been faithfully getting annual mammograms, she missed her screening that year. \"That one year made a difference,\" Lisa says. \"I was doing self-exams, checking for lumps, but I had no idea discharge could be a sign of cancer.\" She went for her next mammogram in 2016 at NBI's Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey Breast Health Center. Those results didn't show anything unusual, but additional tests were ordered because of the nipple discharge. A breast biopsy performed at the center revealed that Lisa indeed had cancer. \"I had no family history. The news definitely made my head spin,\" she recalls. \"But I just asked my doctor what the next steps were and where we go from here.\" MOVING FORWARD A few weeks later, in September 2016, Lisa had a mastectomy performed on her left breast at NBI. At that point her cancer was at Stage 2B, and 12 weeks of aggressive chemotherapy followed. \"I lost my hair, but chemo didn't take me down,\" she says. \"I would go right from chemo to my desk and work the rest of the day.\" Lisa completed a second round of less aggressive chemotherapy in early 2017, and since then her cancer has not returned. Lisa continues to get her routine mammograms at the Breast Health Center. \"I've been blessed to have a great circle of family and close friends, and I have a stellar team of physicians,\" she says. \"The years ahead of me are about living my life with meaning and purpose. God has given me a second chance at life, and now I know I have the strength to fight any battle.\" To schedule a mammogram at the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey Breast Health Center, call 973.926.7466 or visit www.rwjbh.org/mammo.
