Menthol has a soothing, cooling effect and possesses quantifiable antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, making it ideal as a component of balms, lotions, creams, and other kinds of medicinals and cosmetics. Menthol has become virtually synonymous with throat care for its widespread effectiveness and ability to be applied in a variety of ways, but this natural substance has far more utility than simply a way to reduce the symptoms of sore throats. There's a reason why so many products seem to contain menthol, it's extremely effective at what it does and has zero side effects for most people. A safe and effective natural remedy for everything from cold symptoms to razor burn sounds almost like a made-up cure-all from a fantasy novel, but menthol is every bit as useful as it seems. Actually, there are several practical uses for this amazing natural substance that most people are hardly aware of. Its uses extend past merely being useful for eliminating certain kinds of irritation or bad breath. Menthol crystals can even be used to craft cleaning solutions and are used as natural pesticides. In this guide on the practical holistic uses of [menthol crystals](https://www.makeyourown.buzz/menthol-crystals/), we're going to look at the many medicinal applications of this amazing plant-based substance, as well as other interesting uses that might surprise you. Menthol's Many Medicinal Applications Menthol has been used for decades as a reliable ingredient in several mainstay medicines, such as cold and flu remedies, throat lozenges, nasal sprays, lip balms, moisturizing skin creams and more. Though somewhat popularized through its use in menthol cigarettes in order to improve taste and reduce throat irritation, in recent years menthol has been popping up in a larger selection of products, recognized for its ability to reliably reduce certain cold symptoms, skin issues, and even digestive upset. Perhaps the greatest benefit of using menthol in your own balms, creams, and fragrances, is that it is such a safe substance considering its effectiveness. Menthol is a non-toxic and cruelty-free alternative to some of the harsher and chemically-laden products out there on the market today. If you're interested in making your own medicinals using natural substances and ingredients like the kind you can find right here in our store, menthol is an excellent choice. Here are just some of the many ways in which you can use menthol crystals in your creations. Keep in mind that in most cases, the crystals will only make up roughly 2.5% to 5% of the total end product, so you want to make sure you are pairing menthol with the appropriate substances that complement its effectiveness Natural Throat and Sinus Medicine Menthol, in various forms, has long been a reliable way to soothe an irritated or sore throat. A staple in cold and flu medicine such as throat spray and cough drops, it also works great as a way to relieve sinus congestion. Because menthol helps with breathing and works well for clearing the airways, it's also effective solely as a decongestant for those who suffer from allergies and sinus issues. It works well in spray form but can also be diffused into the air as a potent aromatherapy treatment. People often find that the stimulating scent of menthol opens up their airways better than the concentrated sprays. An Underrated Stimulator for Hair Growth Not only is menthol used in a variety of hair care products for its soothing and cooling properties, there's evidence that it actually assists in hair growth. While it is certainly known more so for its oral applications, its unique properties make it a potent treatment for other areas of the body as well. Menthol is able to promote hair growth because it is known to clear debris from hair follicles and control the oiliness or dryness of the scalp. This creates the perfect conditions for stronger, healthier hair. You'll find menthol as a common ingredient in everything from shampoo to hair gel because of how effective it is. A Dependable Shaving Cream Ingredient Another common use for menthol is in shaving creams and aftershaves. The cool feeling associated with this substance helps with redness, itchiness, and irritation that often accompanies shaving. The fresh minty scent in many shaving creams is also derived from natural menthol. Can Relieve Fever and Tension Headaches Many of us suffer from headaches caused by everyday stress, and they can range from mildly annoying to downright debilitating. One of the worst feelings is having to deal with a tension headache that you can't seem to shake no matter what you do. Scientists are unsure exactly what causes these headaches but it is generally believed to be a combination of eye strain and over-tensing of the muscles in the neck, which are all signs of dealing with stress. Being able to relieve these kinds of headaches without resorting to pain medicine like aspirin is important if you are concerned about your health. These kinds of holistic remedies are more gentle on your body and don't have the potential for dangerous side effects. Menthol diluted properly with high-quality oils can be applied directly to the skin on the temples, cheekbones, neck, and even under the nose as a means of relieving pressure and pain. The refreshing feeling of menthol in the air as used in aromatherapy can also be an effective means of naturally reducing headache symptoms. Menthol has been known to even be effective in treating migraines, making it a potent. Other Practical Uses While menthol shines as a natural remedy for an impressive number of ailments and maladies, it has other uses and benefits as well, some of which may surprise you if you're not already familiar. Truthfully, menthol crystals have a large degree of adaptability, making them easy to incorporate into a wide array of different kinds of homemade medicinals and cosmetics that treat a seemingly endless number of practical issues. Gentle Air Freshener The refreshing scent of mint is always a welcome addition to any space. Not only can menthol be used as a means of freshening the air of your home, but the crystals themselves also have the added effect of deodorizing the area they are placed in. Menthol is an excellent non-toxic solution that can replace your aerosols and other artificial air fresheners. This is the preferred and environmentally conscious way of deodorizing and freshening the air of your home, rather than relying on aerosol sprays and other harmful chemicals, because not only do these products adversely affect health and cause potential respiratory complications, they only contribute to further ecological harm. By utilizing a natural air purifying agent such as menthol, you essentially have a solution that's both more affordable, just as effective, and far better for the world we live in Non-Toxic Pesticide and Insect Deterrent It's also known that menthol crystals are a viable pest deterrent, specifically when it comes to certain kinds of mites. Dust mites don't appreciate them, but they are most effective against the tracheal mites that attack honey bee species in their hive. The crystals can be placed around or in close proximity to the hive itself and this is enough to control the spread of the mites and keep them from ruining a hive. As an added bonus, mosquitoes are also put off by menthol and will not stick around in an area where it's being diffused. You can also literally place these crystals in select locations around the perimeter of your property, near your garden, on your porch, or anywhere else you might want an added layer of protection against pesky bloodsuckers. The crystals are also somewhat effective at repelling moths as well. Menthol's ability to deter pests is important because just as with air fresheners, bug sprays typically contain a ton of chemicals that are not only bad for the environment, they are also dangerous for us, our pets, and our gardens and laws. Avoid the use of unnatural pesticides and bug sprays whenever and wherever possible. There are far better alternatives and ways of shooing away unwanted insects, and you can create your own with the ingredients we have here in our store if you're feeling ambitious. Natural Antibacterial Cleaners Menthol has natural antibacterial and antimicrobial properties that make it desirable as a non-toxic and gentle cleaning agent that can be used for a variety of practical purposes. Menthol and citric acid together form a potent natural antibacterial bathroom and kitchen cleaner that kills germs just as well as most supermarket products and is completely free of harmful chemicals. Menthol can also be used in soaps for an extra level of clean. Menthol's incredible natural properties don't stop there, as the substance is also antiviral as well. You will often find menthol as a helpful and tasty component to herbal teas designed to fight off the flu and other viral infections. Safety Tips When Working With Menthol The peppermint plant, or more specifically Mentha Arvensis, may be completely natural, but as with many varieties of plants, that doesn't mean its oils and other substances should be taken lightly. In fact, as with most essential oils, their potency can irritate the skin and may be harmful if consumed. [Menthol crystals](https://www.makeyourown.buzz/menthol-crystals/) specifically may cause skin irritation and should not come into contact with broken skin and definitely should not be ingested without dilution. Proper care should be considered when pregnant or nursing as well with any substances that are as concentrated and pure as menthol. In general, the crystals should never be used as the sole ingredient of a product or as the majority substance. A proper concoction of any sort using menthol should have no more than a 5% concentration, which should give you an idea as to the amount you should aim for depending on what you are trying to create. As always you can contact us for specific advice on creating your own soaps, balms, and other natural products.
