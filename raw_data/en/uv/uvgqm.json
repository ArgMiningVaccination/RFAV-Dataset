Are you Experiencing Chronic Pain, Depression, Anxiety, No Ambition, or Lacking Energy? We are here to help you Are you Experiencing Chronic Pain, Depression, Anxiety, No Ambition, or Lacking Energy? We are here to help you Crystal Creek Wellness is a women-founded and led Holistic Wellness Center. Our focus is to give back to the community, and help the collective healing. We firmly believe that one has to be proactive to maintain good health, and this can be achieved by actively practicing healthy habits that will keep the mind, the body, and the soul youthful and radiant. From ancient times to the present day massage therapy has been used as means of healing the body to maintain good health and well-being. Massage therapy can help to treat a wide range of medical conditions such as anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, insomnia, and soft tissue injuries. During a massage therapy session, a licensed massage therapist manipulates muscles, soft tissue, and the joints of the body to treat injuries and promote general wellness. The word Reiki means Universal Energy. Reiki is a Japanese healing technique used to bring physical and mental well-being. It's based on the belief that an unseen \"life force energy\" runs through the body and keeps us alive; If one's \"life force energy\" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, but when this life force is high-flowing, one is more capable of being happy and healthy. A Reiki session lasts 45 to 60 minutes, and there is no need to get undressed. Energy Medicine is a healing art and the scientific understanding of health and healing that utilizes techniques from ancient healing traditions such as acupuncture, yoga, and Qigong to balance the energy systems that make up our energetic body. An EM session involves discussion, muscle testing, and the application of hands-on energy-balancing techniques. Because our energy systems intertwine and interact with our physical body, using EM can enhance our physical, mental, and emotional health. Life Coaching resembles talk therapy because the focus of the sessions tends to be on you and what's happening in your life. A life Coach can help you clarify your goals, identify the obstacles holding you back, and develop strategies for overcoming each obstacle. Past Life Regression is a therapeutic technique that involves accessing and exploring one's past lives to gain a deeper understanding of their current life to heal emotional and psychological issues. It is based on the belief that our souls reincarnate and carry with them the experiences and memories of previous lives. During a past life regression session a trained practitioner guides the client into a hypnotic state and helps them recall and explore memories of their past lives. Our guided meditation classes are held in a small group setting, in which we explore different meditation practices. We believe there is no one right way but instead many ways to meditate, it's a matter of just finding what best suits you. Emergence is a women's circle and an intuitive dance class held once a month. Intuitive dance has no set form and is instead an individual expression of the dancer as they are being present with themselves and with music. In this class, we will be cultivating a space of safety and non-judgment that allows all participants to express themselves openly thru movement. Our hula-hoop dance classes are family oriented and open to all ages. This is the perfect opportunity to spend time outside with the family and to connect with the community. *Hula hoops and snacks are provided.
