Thebombardment ofuranium byE.Fermi in1934 produced puzzling which were reacting toneutron absorption bysplitting into twovery large fragments. This suggestion initiated rapid andvery intensive study in many laboratories, which developed details ofthefission process. Asa result ofthese studies offission that these interactions offered apossibility fornewenergy sources.

The Americans andtheMarshallese quickly oflarge nuclear weapons, local fallout hadtobeconsidered asapotentially serious hazard. Major research programs were instituted oraugmented bytheAEC, various branches of theDepartment ofDefense (DOD) ,other government agencies such asthe National Bureau ofStandards (NBS) andtheU.S. Weather Bureau, andmany university laboratories. Topics ofintensive included theformation and nature offallout materials, effects ofweather ontheir transport, anticipated andactual radiation fields, andbiological effects onman, animals, and plants. These researches were largely conducted inconjunction with thetest programs oftheAEC,which utilized asubstantial proportion oftheavailable scientific manpower areas. Perhaps summary ofthese investigations rays, andx-rays. Thealpha andbeta rays donot generate structure shielding problems because they aretotally absorbed in, say, apane ofglass. X-rays contribute only toshielding offallout togamma rayshielding Atthesame time, problems doarise inconnection with beta rayproduction byfallout components. These include ingestion hazards andbiological damage occurring when fallout isincontact with, orinclose proximity totheexposed skin. Ingestion hazards also involve alpha rays. Atthetime ofthefirst nuclear explosions, thecapability forassessing gamma-ray hazards wasalready \"exposure,\" \"spectra,\" ofradiation measurements, wesketch here thedevelopment andother detectors doexist, andhave been used inthelarge effort, extending over this century, toexplore both physical andbiological properties ofgamma rays. Photographic emulsions are affected, andthis was, infact, what called Roentgen's 9 crystals scintillate when exposed toradiation. There were measurement techniques devised over thenext 2decades which used these effects, andthere exist photographic effects, airionization follows rather simple laws, and itsmeasurement with precision andreproducibility isnotdifficult.

Perhaps themost versatile, however, arethesolid state detectors, represented bytheuseofthethermoluminescence effect.

Spectral measurements have become routine with thedevelopment ofmultichannel pulse-height analyzers.^ approximately inproportion toenergy andmultichannel pulse-height analyzers toprovide spectral from distributions tospectra requires afurther mathematical analysis ordinarily called \"unfolding.\" This is because agiven pulse size canresult from anyofaband energies, i.e.monoenergetic systems, andtheir sensitivity to different components ofradiation. Radiation biology studies overmany decades have resulted inmany generally accepted concepts oftheaction of radiation oncells. Section III.D introduces some aspects ofthis subject. ^Inthese instruments, photomultiplier tubes magnify thepulse size to produce effects measureable with ordinary electronic equipment; multichannel analyzers sort thepulses Gamma-Ray ofphoton energies E.^ Such data have been available with steadily increasing accuracy andcompletness throughout this century. Beginning about 1950, G.White theavailable experimental studies ofgamma-ray interactions. Theresulting tables, published in1952, represented amajor advance both inaccuracy andincomplete- ness [11-13]. These tables have since been ofthedetector response byinterposition oflayers thickness, quantitative work ordinarily requires better data than arethus provided. But there never hasbeen asystematic experimental effort toprovide fundamental broad-beam attenuation data formonoenergetic sources. Instead, most broad- beam experiments have been performed configurations, andfor inwhich BEAM CASE configuration (case a)excludes radiation not proceeding directly along theline from source todetector.

Suchbroad-beam data are specific tothesource spectrum andgeometry used. These data have been useful formedical purposes, inconnection with x-ray machines ofstandardized construction andtherefore reasonably standardized source spectra [16,17]. Most broad-beam penetration data useful forshielding purposes have been calculated bynumerical ofintegro-dif ferential became widely available theextensive computations required toobtain accurate broad-beam attenuation datawere notvery feasible until about 1952. very thick barriers waspublished Associates andL.V.Spencer ofNBS, [25,26], speed computers intheearly 1950' s. Many Other methods depend oncomputer capabilities have since been developed, buthave notmademuch contribution asyettofallout shielding 9problems. From thatwhile capabilities for measuring gamma-ray dosewith accuracy have been available since the1930' s, corresponding capabilities forperforming accurate calculations date from the early 1950' s.Thus atthetime (1954) that themagnitude ofthefallout hazard wasfirst attempt inthis country toestimate theshielding properties ofstructures against fallout radiation seems tohave been that initiated in1952 attheNaval Radiological Defense Laboratory.

Shapiro used simple assumptions about theattenuation offallout gamma rays. Because hedidnothave data heperformed calculations forboth 0.5MeVand1.25 MeV,with thethought that these provide oftheactual spectrum. Forpenetration data, heused acombination from these factors; andbyadding contributions from point sources located indifferent positions, hesimulated thedetector response dueto fallout fields extent. fallout fields offinite andinfinite extent gave data forfallout fields beginning beyond \"cleared areas.\" From these data Shapiro calculated detector response duetofallout produced byunscattered Useofpoint tosimulate wall (byShapiro) reports inthis period oftime onprotection against initial radiations, which later turned outtoberelevant tofallout shielding problems [30].

TheFederal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA) interest anevacuation policy. Aconcurrent effort inEngland waslikewise initiated following the hydrogen bomb test of1954. Unlike thestudies intheUnited States, this development depended onexperiments performed British with^Co sources. Experiments the\"point kernel\" method, waspublished [35]. in1957, gave procedure andusing awidevariety ofdata types, including radiation angular distributions. Angular intheother studies was limited bytheapproximation thatphoton trajectories realistic spectra- Forthese reasons, usable data became available atNBSonly late in1957, andafull report was only begun atthat time andwasnotpublished until 1962 [38]. Although there wasnotagreat deal ofcollaboration among thedifferent projects, many ideas thatwere inonestudy were either identical with, or very similar tothose should also bementioned. There was little available experimental information about spectra, andalmost no experimental information about thepenetration offallout gamma rays. There were nounclassified experimental ontheshielding properties ofbuildings, although ofstructure shielding were being developed, there waslittle procedures, andknowledge about andtheir product radiations. Allofthese developments were actively being pursued during themiddle and latter 1950' s,hence therather late date forgood-quality Onemight have tests toinclude experiments inwhich buildings were exposed tofallout.

Following thedevelopment ofthermonuclear weapons, with accompanying regional andeven country-wide fallout threats, aswell asthedevelopment of missile delivery systems withmuch shorter warning times, there wasapolicy review bytheEisenhower administration. Thepolicy declared inthespring of1958 placed primary civil defense emphasis onthefallout threat, and essentially ignored theprompt effects. Thepolicy specified that there was tobea)Federal encouragement ofpersonally financed home fallout shelters, b)subsidy ofshelter construction buildings, construction measures. stating that acyclone cellar with anearth covering 3ftthick would reduce theradiation level byafactor ofabout 5000, which would be completely safe, even inthemost heavily contaminated areas [40,41]. Following this suggestion, theFCDA heavy construction. Requirements forincorpor- ation offallout shelters infuture Federal buildings stated that allexposed walls surrounding theshelter would have tobewindowless andnotless than 26 inches (~66cm)ofconcrete. Overhead wall thickness hadtototal (~51cm)ofconcrete. These figures ofcourse, andlittle construction ofthis kind wasfinanced despite thepolicy from surveys ofapilot nature and design research of1959 and1960 covered levels ofprotection inwhich the official criterion represented almost anupper, rather than alower, limit. Eventually, studies were made, using hypothetical nuclear disasters, of thesensitivity ofshelter effectiveness, response ina\"standard unprotected .New shelter construction shelter construction which result ofitem c)oftheEisenhower policy statement produced little oflasting value. Thiswasdueinpart tothe fact thatmany designs were of10in1960. Ontheother hand, thesurvey activity insupport of theEisenhower policy ofmore lasting consequence. Between 1958 and1961 atotal offive pilot surveys were conducted inmedium-sized metropolitan areas parts ofthecountry toidentify potential theNBScalculations. Asalready stated, shelter categories covered the complete range from thin-walled structures giving virtually noprotection, to heavy structures giving protection factors effectively infinite. These surveys notonly provided information onthedistribution ofshelter PFvalues existing succession distributed over around, andontopof,astructure experiments were performed byStewart, gamma rays were inallcases. Soon thework just mentioned, experiments onbuildings byCunningham, frommany such sources, itispossible to simulate anarea source. Data provided bytheBritish experiments were inthedevelopment survey published 1958, andprovided agreat deal ofinformation theshielding source effort wasbased ontheassumption, later verified rather impressively, that^Co gamma rays were suitably representative ofthe fallout spectrum intheir penetration andscattering properties. When the1958 Federal policy onfallout protection fortheU.S. was announced, there were nopublished experimental data ontheprotective properties ofU.S. buildings, light were theequivalent oftheearlier British experiments. They were conducted primarily with point^Co sources onlight structures. Because thedevelopment ofanalysis procedures wasalready in progress, some features were included inthis series ofexperiments thatwere suggested byengineering problems already encountered. Forexample, in addition tothebuildings, measurements were also carried outona\"phantom\" ofplastic which were positioned tosimulate line sources [55]. Although the\"May\" experiments represent thefirst attempt tomeasure the shielding properties ofU.S. structures, there were similar butmore general \"blockhouse\" studies already inprogress attheEdgewood Arsenal inMaryland. Werefer elsewhere tothese experiments with this same designation, which was adopted byparticipants. 29 These experiments were supervised byR.E.Rexroad andM.A.Schmoke, at what wasthen theNuclear Defense Laboratory under circumstances thatwould permit close comparison between theory andmeasurement. Point sources were used inthese experiments until the\"tube\" source became available. Agreat advance inexperimental technique occurred late in1958with the development byJ.Batter E.Clarke, ofTechnical Operations, Inc. (T/0), ofthetube source. Instead ofusing many small radioactive sources tied together, orasingle large source positioned many times, theBatter-Clarke tube source uses asingle large source thepossibility ofstopping, orchanging velocity exists [58]. With this device, simulation ofanarea source requires only theposition- ingofthetubing along lines closely spaced relative tosubstantial variations ofthedetector response with thetube position. Inanearly experiment with used experiments (see figs. 1.6and1.7). Thetube source rendered measurements onlarge buildings really feasible forthefirst time, because ofthetremendous simplification ofprocedure and 30 onlarge buildings which were in suitably locations. Onesuch building wasalarge, former army barracks intheLosAngeles area, andincluded various types ofmodern construction [60] .Another series ofexperiments on residential structures, variety ofexperiments onboth light and heavy structures existed, which included some experiments forsuch elementary configurations asavertical onecangetusable which problems \"lip effects\" do notscale Experiments components ofbuildings, inmore refined tests ofdifferent analysis procedures. Inthis direction, perhaps most important were early experiments by Schmoke were well underway by1960; andinlater experiments which made useofthetube source they performed related studies which included investigations ofthe\"in-and- down\" problem, inwhich radiation which haspassed through suchvertical shielding byfloors asitpenetrates downward tothe basement orlower floors [65]. Other studies components were carried outataspecial facility designed forthis purpose, theRadiation Test Facility atFt.Belvoir, Virginia [66]. This was concrete elementary studies, such asmeasurement ofeffects duetoaninterface between regions ofdifferent density (e.g. earth performed byC.E.Clifford oftheDefense Research Board ofCanada many studies gave important phenomena (see chapter XI). 34 Studies offull-scale, complex structures were also further extended. AtKansas State University, measurements were made onaspecially constructed blockhouse with basement [72]; andalightweight building wasalso constructed whose floor could beraised From itisclear that after establishment ofthe Federal policy inMay1958, many agencies besides thefederal agency forcivil defense participated inthedevelopment (DOD) andprivate contractors working forOCDM andtheDefense Atomic Support Agency, nowtheDefense Nuclear Agency (DNA). Beginning about mid-1958, theanalysis procedures began showing agreater degree ofsophistication. InJuly 1958, F.C.Brooks andothers issued a report guidance defense planning [32]. Anappendix tothis report, \"Shielding Factors andShelter Protection from Fallout,\" presented general analysis procedures based on^Co data andpoint kernel concepts. Procedures forestimating protection factors inbasements included, forthefirst time In1959 Putz acomputer program based onthepoint kernel technique described intheir earlier report [35] .With this they analyzed thedata from the\"May\" experiment [75]. Theywere able toreproduce data forabove-ground locations fairly well, buthadnoprocedure for estimating protection inbasements. Reasonable fallout gamma-ray spectra became available early in1958, these which could beused forpurposes of shielding analysis. These included computer programs togenerate penetration data forpoint andplane sources ofvarious types, including angular distributions ofthegamma rays. important type ofdata calculated wasforpenetration through bygamma ofstructure. These together with data andgeneral definitions were described inamonograph byL.V.Spencer which wasincirculation indraft form bylate 1959 and finally published in1962 [38]. Avery early application required survey procedures, forwhich methods aspreviously mentioned. Shielding estimates obtained using these procedures were compared with data from the\"May\" experiment. Afull setofengineering procedures which could using both stimulated many more recent research projects whose results arealso discussed inappropriate sections ofthis text. Concepts originally employed inthe Project Civil method, totrace thehistory oftheidea. Numerical data from these reports have largely been superceded. Hence there isnoattempt to make intercomparisons ofcalculations performed according tothedifferent publications embodying these methods. Some procedures, such asthepoint kernel approach, have been used inmore recent calculations [29] andwill be explained later (see Fallout Shelter While drafts ofearly versions oftheStandard Method were still circulating, President Kennedy announced, onJuly 25,1961, acivil defense program that strongly implemented theEisenhower fallout-shelter policy, except that itshifted emphasis from individually financed shelters inhomes, toshelters inexisting andexplained inchapter of this text. tolocate theshelter areas, with afollowup program tomark andstock these shelter areas.

Energy intervals were selected ofapproxi- mately equal size inlog(E) rather take account both ofmore data onfission yields andofnewknowledge of nuclear shell structure [41]. This resulted mainly inamodified Glendenin's rule fordetermining Z^, reduction problem from thepoint ofview probability distribution p(Z) of ref [35] could betaken seriously enough tohelp refine the values [43]. With this approach, plus some additional data, newcharge probability data were deduced.

Results ofearly scaling studies but W.W.Kellogg, inhis1957 testimony toCongress, documented thediscouragingly poor agreement among different fallout prediction systems atthat time [115]. Afallout symposium held inMarch 1957 concluded ofthemechanics [116]. Much early work onfallout models wasincompletely published, partially classified, orsuited only tosome highly specialized application. The1957 Congressional Hearings areagood forearly andgeneral presentation [115], andSchuert's discussion [117]. Unclassified andreasonably complete presentations discussed onthebasis ofhypothetical burst conditions previously circulated tointerested groups. This conference wasfortunately followed up byextensive analysis of18ofthemodels, even though many models were still notwell documented [119,120]. Comparisons again showed thatpredictions of different models were very diverse. 127 Athird symposium washeld inApril, 1966, andwasfarbetter focussed on thebasic physics problems fundamental totheimportant processes [121]. By this time itwasclear that only afewmodels would receive extensive additional development anduse. Infact, much ofthesymposium consisted ofreports about work awafer system intended requirements of oftheexisting models. Intheremaining paragraphs ofthis section wesketch four systems for calculating fallout intensities andspectra which remain relevant tocurrent applications. These aretheWSEG theDELFIC 21versions ofolder models. Further, nosystematic study tohave been made ofanymodel incomparison with data frommost ofthetests which have been conducted. This islargely because ofthestate about the test systems toadequate, incontrovertible data leads totheopinion that these systems have their main application in hypothetical attack studies, andthat theywould notbedependable asasole basis Sensitivity studies were included, with data oncloud radius, cloud height, particle fall rate, refractory mass fraction, andparticle frequency distribution. Comparisons ofTINCAN with the other models described here were made. 128 a.TheWSEG Model Ofthescaling models, that ofG.E.Pugh andR.J.Galiano isthe currently most important because itisused nearly universally inthehypo- thetical attack studies which model; andthecloud isnotdivided detonation which byuseofaneffective wind speed.

Contributions toexposure arefunctions of particle size expressed through fall speed; andatanylocation, thefallout varies between minimum andmaximum fall Model Beginning about 1965, aneffort wasinstituted bytheDefense Atomic Support Agency (now theDefense Nuclear Agency) todevelop asingle model for allapplications. Itwasintended that this model, called DELFIC, would combine thebest features available. Butthemodel would have tobeacompromise in many respects andinthis regard onemore among many systems. DELFIC consists offive principal Initial Conditions, Cloud Rise, Transport, Particle-activity, andOutput-processor. The\"Initial Conditions\" particles. code, itwaseventually concluded that thenatural size distribution ofsoil particles could beused except possibly forlarge-yield detonations. Most relationships water andwater vapor kinetic energy density. thecloud canchange duetoentrainment near 1673 K)orcalcareous (melting temperature near 2887 K). 131 through changes inshape which arenototherwise considered. Cloud volume and mass arerelated through assumption ofanexpanding oblate spheroidal shape. Inthesecond areidentified attheinitial time bysubdividing thecloud into horizontal disk segments and assigning toeach segment asetofwafers, eachwith characteristic particle size interval. Thewafers intohorizontal to permit horizontal distributed vertically andsuitable forthetransport process. Wafers with different particle size intervals will beatdifferent heights after cloud rise. The\"Atmospheric Transport\" module utilizes anatmosphere divided into sub- volumes, eachwith uniform throughout. Large cells areused totake account ofregion ofmacro-meterorological phenomena, while small cells canbe used totake account oflocal circulation systems such asthose affected by topographical features such asamountain. With this approach, wind-patterns characteristic ofcertain regions andhaving considerably complexity, including vertical components, canbeutilized. Standard settling rates areused based onformulae forspheres ofdifferent sizes. Wind effects andfallout during cloud rise aretaken into account. The\"Particle Activity\" module distributes activity with particle size according Fractionation isthus 132 nuclides canbemade aswell asfortotal activity. Induced activities are also included. 3ftabove asmooth plane asedetermined according permitted, this same implies long andcomparatively expensive runs. Other requirements forfast andcheap computations ledtoattempts to develop simplified versions ofDELFIC, incompetition with theWSEG Model but hopefully giving results more nearly equivalent tothose ofDELFIC forthe intended applications. TheSEERModels (Simplified Estimation ofExposure to Radiation) areofthis type, with running times forasingle case 1/50 to 1/100 that ofDELFIC, andwith rather good agreement forsample cases. Toachieve short running times assumptions such asthefollowing are used: Starting point atstabilized cloud, with parameters from DELFIC- generated library, wind profiles constant intime andspace, alog-normal particle size distribution, precalculation offalling times fordeposition of cloud wafers, uniform cloud, anduseofstandard function types torepresent lateral distributions relative tothe\"hot-line\" foracloud layer. 2.Continuing Problems ofFallout Phenomena Research into different of touseincalculations forlowaltitude bursts, with andwithout andother projecting Soil type isimportant fortworeasons: Different soil types have different natural particle size distributions; andsoil types with different 25dominant consituents have different Thus toattachment byvolatile chains isinprinciple affected, asisthefraction ofradioactivity which is deposited with local fallout. Examination ofavailable test data, which include tests over soil, hard rock, wetcoral, andwater, show differences which aresuggestive butnot conclusive. While scavenging. studies distribution ofthe soil issignificantly modified Theassumption that thefallout physically unchanged during transport ignores effects whose importance hasnever been established. The observed dispersion ofparticle sizes islarger than that indicated byterminal velocity beduetofurther fracture ofthemore particles inaturbulent wake. Inaddition, airheavily weighted with particles undergo mass Thescavenging byprecipitation includes animportant setof interrelated problems onwhich (see ref. [137]). While local fallout occurs sorapidly that concurrent precipitation is comparatively unlikely, rain- scavenging isadominant forlong changes ofsource configuration affect theradiation field. Investigation of these effects hasbeen atbest exploratory. e.Long Term Fallout Problems Auseful ofmagnitude. conflict far removed from radioactive hazards canraise questions ofpossible remedial actions. Todate, this class of problems hasreceived limited attention only. E.BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS FROM FALLOUT RADIATIONS Because intensities arehighest atearly fission wedescribe ways inwhich radioactive fallout canbeasource ofinjury. Some aspects ofthis subject have been discussed intwoimportant symposium reports [138,139]. These other hazards require counter-measures rather different from shielding. Perhaps themain alternative countermeasure isdecontamination. While theeffort todevise andevaluate decontamination procedures hasbeen 136 much less than theeffort directed towards shelter studies, enough literature natural decontamination theobvious process bysurface water, canberemoved bythewinds anddisseminated intheatmosphere. These processes operate toreduce arerelatively intense. Bycontrast, thevarious categories ofhazard which wenext discuss often totheproblem identified. 1.TheDirect External Threat There isevidence thatheavy fallout observed during atmospheric nuclear tests hasbeenvisible asindividual 137 From such anargument andfrom experience with nuclear tests, the supposition isstrong that indaylight, with nocompetitive precipitation such asrain orsnow, offallout would beobservable without special instrumentation. Butinbadweather, oratnight, other indicators of hazard must beavailable. There areseveral types ofnatural \"shielding\" against fallout gamma rays. Ground roughness including grass coverage, which will bedescribed in greater detail insection VI.D,isoften considered toreduce byabout thedose con- siderably; andtrees could thedose significantly, although foliage retention also hastheeffect ofeliminating theground roughness effect for theelevated particles. Ground contours operate toshield against part ofthedirect radiation Thesmaller the visible source area thesmaller H.A.Knapp that film badge readings onpeople living inthe vicinity oftheNevada Test Site were no doubt largely asaresult ofresidential structure shielding. Ifonecombines this factor with ground roughness, oneobtains anatural dose reduction by about 1/2from anestablished standard value 3ftabove asmooth plane. For greater dose reductions, special measures must betaken. 138 11.10 Summary ofrelationships between brief radiation exposure andacute [148], Type ofInjury A.Brief, wholgbody, gamma raysProbable Condition ofMajority during Emergency Care Required 50-200 R Acute radiation sickness, Level I sickness, Level II sickness, Level IIILess than 5% Less than 50% More than 50%Deaths will oc< Deaths will oc< 30to60days.

Wefirst Inthecase ofdrinking water, exposed reservoirs cancollect fallout particles. Buttheheavier particles would rapidly settle; andthe small fraction ofthetotal. Preparation ofsolid foods should remove fallout particles, with careful washing ofuncooked fruits and vegetables. More subtle hazards arise because some ofthefission products are gaseous, andsome arequite soluble. Inparticular, three capture in Uandis notgaseous norparticularly soluble, because ofitsspecial properties.

Contaminated drinking water results from theconcentration ofsoluble 131materials such as IandSrinreservoirs which utilize surface, rather than ground sources ofwater. Butstandard water treatment methods provide a substantial degree ofdecontamination; andwhile theresulting dose canbe very significant, overall dose accumulation. 3.Food Chain andOther Indirect Hazards'^ Several early indirect radiation hazards should benoted. Exposed farm animals maybekilled; andfood crops maybeeither tobe generally similar tothose forman. Animals under cover would receive lower direct radiation doses than animals intheopen; andthere exist natural ravine-type ground configurations inwhich animals would beless exposed than Seereferences {139,143,153,158-161]. Forcontamination studies on inanopen field. Inaddition, animals fedstored silage would avoid the large internal radiation dose expected foranimals grazing onopen pastures. Studies ofcrop reduction indicate that would beexposed beta rays andgamma rays from allnearby contaminated surfaces; also retain some particles inparticularly lethal ontheir ownfoliage. Significant crop reductions canresult, particularly attimes ofthe when of Iinthemilk consumed bychildren ingest fallout asthey eatpastureland grass; theywould drink surface either temporarily block elimination along afood chain which canresult in unusual concentrations ofsome radioactive element. Many such cases are known; andsome general rules forpredicting theeffect have beenworked out [139]. Problems Ecological problems first came topublic attention whereas lethality forbirds occurs atabout conversely, many types ofinsects would tend toremain atalltimes in extremely close proximity toanyparticular fallout material, with correspon- dingly large doses. Ecological systems apparently recover from nuclear disaster along a pattern very similar tothat observed inother massive disasters such as fires, droughts, etc. Devastated areas arereinvested with atime sequence of plant andanimal short-lived mainly anexceptionally large fraction of theavailable ground area. There hasbeen special attention toinsect populations, partly aspests which destroy thecrops, andpartly aspollinators necessary forplant fertilization. Note thatpollinating insects include crawling insects which have special vulnerability. Sterilization reduces insect populations and, because ofdifferential radiosensitivity between species, some species are more vulnerable than others. Widespread radioactive fallout hasthusbeen likened toinsecticide use. Insect species whose natural enemy populations arereduced undergo explosive multiplication, which saturates andreverses as other oranimal andthese begin with theuptake ofradioactive materials through plant root systems, rather than from fallout retained onfolliage. Different plant species exhibit great differences inchemical uptake through root systems, just as there aregreat difference intheproclivity forfoliage retention. Oftheisotopes constituting major late hazards because oflong half- 137lives, Csisagamma which behaves Also, ofthepenetrability ofthegamma rays byradioactive tends indosage show radioactive strontium. Itslifetime ismore than 1000 times longer, with a corresponding reduction inrelative dose rate forequal concentrations. Also, ittends toberather tightly bound inthesoil. Butthis comparison does not take account oftwofactors: Buildup ofplutonium contamination must be evaluated over time periods centuries; andtheenergy emitted inthe form radiosensitive rayexposure, including formation ofcataracts, cancers, leukemias, and genetic problems should benoted.

There isaninteresting between factors ontheone hand, andbarrier andattenuation factors ontheother hand. Thelatter are basically functions oftheindependent variable (which isusually X,theeffective mass thickness). Ontheother hand, geometry factors are basically power lawfunctions ofdistance.

Also, their spectra measured by Huddleston, etal[34] atdifferent places andtimes energy from 0.1to1.33 MeV. They used themoments method with a reconstruction technique suggested byM.J.Berger [36] .Their results give agood estimate ofthegeneral nature ofthese distributions. However, in regions where angular distributions varying, bytheMonte Carlo method [37], showed large statistical fluctuations.

Lastly, itmust bepointed out that fallout shielding analysts vary widely intheir understanding of radiation transport under thecomplicated conditions, frequently encountered inpractice; andtheir judgments will also vary correspondingly. Nevertheless, itisimpossible toavoid theuseofjudgment insolving real fallout shielding problems. Those whohave thestandard procedures have notconsidered every oftranslating analysis, ofjudgment enters primarily intheselection ofthe proper data. Butthecomputer programs always involve adegree of simplification ofthecomplete method, andsuch simplifications also require theexercise ofconsiderable judgment. 82] This chapter will first discuss certain factors inpractical fallout shielding problems which arenoteasily resolved interms ofprecise rules and therefore require engineering judgment. Following this, thesubject of accuracy oftheStandard Method andsimplified methods derived from itwill B.FACTORS RELATING TOTHESOURCE 1.Non-Uniform Deposition Itisunlikely always bedeposited uniformly onhorizontal planes andhorizontal projections ofsloping planes. Furthermore after initial deposition, climatic orman-produced influences will cause subsequent movement from theoriginal position. Totheextent that such change from theuniformity assumption ispredict- able, existing techniques forlimited source asanegative from decontaminated. mayserve only tochange thelocation ofthesource completely remove it. Under such acircumstance, thecontribution from there-positioned source must betaken into account. Ifthenewlocation isbetter shielded from thestructure being analyzed, e.g. behind acurbing side ofanadjacent onemight consider iteffectively factor; and therefore, fallout occurs, ignoring theroof source maybejustified. Ifweareconcerned with protection mainly forthefirst hour ortwo after theinitial fallout deposition, nofallout movement which occurs later than about anhour after initial deposition hassignificance intheshielding analysis. Non-uniform deposition offallout caused byinteraction of around structures tends toleave radiation fields unchanged ontheaverage, aspreviously indicated. However, some situations deserve special consideration. Basement area-ways andwindow-wells, which are lower than theground outside, are great reduction intheamount ofshielding provided bythestructure. Figure XI.1 gives theretention offallout particles bytrees andshrubs must begiven serious consideration, perhaps requiring aspecial protection factor calculation.

Detailed studies giving practical guidance inthis respect arelargely structures.

Onemaytherefore \"smear andzones tobetreated individually. Experience andgood shielding judgment will usually indicate where such simplifications arepossible. Ignore contributions fromwalls ofstories distant from thedetector story :This isconsistent with above. Inthis case, the standard methodology hasafixed rule: ignore contributions from outer walls twoormore stories distant from thedetector story. There maybeunusual cases inwhich this rule isinappropriate, andtheanalyst should watch for such possibilities. Assume internal partitioning ofother stories tobethesame asthat assumed forthedetector forallormost stories. Asstated before, there maybeoccasions inwhich this simplifying rule notbeobeyed. Itisseldom valid forabasement detector location, anditsvalidity doubtful forafirst story location. Analyze sectors involving large contributions before those involving little :Especially ifoneismaking adesk calculation, oneshould analyze first those sectors (and zones) which areexpected tomake relatively large contributions tothedetector response. Onewill usually find, asone progresses inturn toanalyze adjacent sectors, that these contributions will become smaller andsmaller. Eventually, onerealizes that thecontributions insource lead to their initial division. This involves anexercise ofjudgment which is flat elements used, themore closely is thecurved element approximated. Because, this also entails more computational effort, acompromise between accuracy andeffort must bemade. There isanexception totherule that with flat elements. Asindicated insection IX.C.3.C, avertical cylinder is more basic than nocircumstances should a vertically cylindrical structure beapproximated with onehaving flat walls. 3.Unusual Shapes ofWall Panels, Roof Panels, andApertures Frequently structures, even though ofsimple configuration inthemselves, have panels orapertures ofshapes which donotfitthestandard methods of fallout Acircular panel floor orhorizontal roof, with thecenter ofthepanel directly above thedetector, andperpendicular tothe main lines assumptions, butashasbeen shown inchapter VIIthis case canbereadily treated shape ororientation, asnoted insection Overhead panels which conform of asector ofanannulus with itscenter directly Apanel byoneoftheabove types, upintomore than oneofsuch types, each analyzed separately. 4.Small, Irregularly Placed Masses Small, placed masses aremost consid- eration. manner, asfurniture orpeople.
