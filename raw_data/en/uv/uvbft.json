I struggled for years to get pregnant, and within just a couple months of seeing Ivy for acupuncture, I got pregnant naturally!!! Ivy provided such valuable support throughout my entire pregnancy. Her acupuncture sessions helped tremendously with nausea, insomnia, back pain, and also for anxiety and worry I had during pregnancy. Ivy gave me so much guidance and wisdom for nurturing healthy pregnancy both physically and energetically, preparing for labor and birth, and the huge life transition of becoming a mother. My family and I are eternally grateful for Ivy!\" - Michelle \"Ivy saved my life and helped me bring in a healthy new life. She is worth a million times the investment. I originally started seeing Ivy in desperation for help in women's health. I had been to 10+ practitioners around the Bay Area and they all told me I was \"un-helpable\". I had never received acupuncture before and was not sure if I could afford the cost. Ivy was the 1st person to listen that truly help my overall wellness and health far beyond what I ever expected. She helped me build my mind/body connection, reduce stress, and set boundaries around my energy and time at work. After just a month, I received a promotion and a $10,000 raise. Ivy helped me prepare my body / mind and my partners to conceive successfully, healthy issue free- pregnancy, a low trauma pandemic birth, post-partum healing, and more. I have since moved to the East Coast and highly recommend the virtual sessions and the calming oil is a daily essential. I've since tried several LACs in Philly/NYC area and none even come close. I'm so grateful for Ivy. She is such a caring and gifted healer with a wealth of knowledge. I truly believe she saved my life in more ways than one and her practices with continue to improve my wellbeing for many years to come.\" - Carin \"I've been to a lot of acupuncturists before throughout many years and I have to say that Ivy is the BEST! She is exceptionally intuitive and skilled. She really cares and you can feel that every session. I highly recommend booking a session with Ivy right now!\" - Jesse \"Ivy is an incredible practitioner. I worked with her for several months and our sessions were so therapeutic both mentally and physically. She's so knowledgeable when it comes to stress relief and womens health and fertility - I HIGHLY recommend her, especially if you consider yourself a high-achieving woman and/or a mom. And definitely buy some of her custom essential oil mists, they are divine!!\" - Monique \"Ivy is the acupuncturist you need to see! I saw her initially for help with my menstrual cycle because I saw her IG post that it's actually not \"normal\" to have painful cramps and PMS according to Chinese Medicine. After a few months of acupuncture and herbs, all I can say is, wowww! I never knew it was even possible to have regular timely periods without huge mood swings and debilitating cramps! I continued seeing her weekly for acupuncture sessions because I could really feel how much my overall health was improving and the wisdom and energetic practices she shared was incredibly helpful for any stress at work or relationship difficulties that I was going through. And then, when my husband and I were ready to get on the journey of parenthood, we got pregnant the first month we tried!! I was so surprised because for many of my friends it took them a long time to get pregnant. I heard stories about pregnancy being uncomfortable and full of crazy symptoms, but thanks to Ivy, I've been feeling great and I'm totally enjoying pregnancy! Ivy is an amazing practitioner and amazing person. I am so happy to have her in my life!\" - Maya \"Ivy embodies the wisdom of a gifted healer on every level--in her ability to listen with utmost care, to treat root causes of symptoms with extraordinary depth and precision, and in crafting the ethics of her business, which includes sliding scale offerings. I started seeing her in early March for hormonal imbalance and stress (I hadn't had a regular period in years), and within two weeks I was challenging and releasing all sorts of old relational patterns, stepping into the strength of a deep inner knowing with confidence and ease. I had no idea that this would be an effect! All I wanted was to get my period (which I got, within 2 weeks), but Ivy, and her holistic vision (ancestrally guided...this matters!), knew all the while that I wasn't simply suffering from a physical imbalance, but also emotional and spiritual. Ivy is extraordinary and my life is forever changed after a few months of working with her. I can't recommend her enough.\" - Kristi \"I have been seeing Ivy for a few months and recommend her with enthusiasm to my own clients and friends as I appreciate her unique treatments and how they have supported me in my healing and managing stress. I always feel very calm and balanced after our sessions. Having seen a few different local acupuncturists and experienced acupuncture over the last 20 years, her style is different in that she uses fewer needles and sound healing in her treatments. They are a little shorter than most sessions I have received, but they are extremely potent. The sound can be felt through the needles and that feels incredible!! That saying quality over quantity resonates here. I am grateful for her support and knowledge especially around fertility, pregnancy and postpartum care. She also carries her own beautiful handmade herbal products and has a wonderful blog that shows her dedication to her wisdom and tradition.\" - Ariel \"Ivy is not only a great acupuncturist but a kind, warm and caring human being. She came recommended by my prenatal yoga instructor to treat my low lying placenta when I was a little over 30 weeks pregnant. I was not expecting it to fix the problem but really enjoyed the relaxing sessions with her. I had another ultrasound appointment about three weeks later and just like that my placenta had moved up from 1.7cm to 3.5cm away from the cervix!!! How incredible is that!!!?? I couldn't believe how effective her treatments were. I am so grateful for Ivy's help during the last couple months of my pregnancy. Thanks to her (and my wonderful OB), I had a natural birth and a very healthy baby girl :)\" - Carol \"Ivy is absolutely INCREDIBLE!! from the moment I walked in, to the moment I left I just felt like I was in the presence of a healing angel. I've been dealing with a shoulder injury due to nerve damage. I've done weekly physical therapy for about a year now and its helped but only to a degree. Within one treatment with Ivy I felt like I made more progress than I had with a year of physical therapy. Pain decreased and my range of motions significantly improved. I would highly recommend her to anyone regardless of their condition. She was also very helpful in referring me to other alternatives to further supplement my healing process. Very knowledgeable, nice and caring!\" - Fillipi \"I initially scheduled an appointment with Ivy to help my work through some chronic achilles tendinitis that I just could not seem to shake. A friend had referred me to Ivy and suggested that I give acupuncture a try. Ivy has helped me so much with my tendinitis and I'm finally walking pain free. Further, Ivy has encouraged me to consider my overall health and wellness more holistically. I look forward to every visit to Luminae Wellness and feel 10x better after every session. Ivy is a gifted healer who brings such calmness, no judgment, and encouragement to every session.\" - Laura \"Ivy is a blessing to this community. I met Ivy through my role as a birthworker so we first connected about our love for supporting birthing people and their support systems. When I began working with Ivy, I was looking for support around an inflammatory response I was experiencing on my scalp. I had tried everything possible to address this inflammation and was beginning to try to accept this as my new normal or a chronic condition, but then I started working with Ivy. After month or two of acupuncture sessions, herbal remedies, and emotional/spiritual recommendations, my scalp had cleared completely. Ivy goes beyond the physical body to address the mind and spirit just as deeply. Sessions with Ivy include beautifully present check ins met with her deep knowledge and wisdom, along with soothing sound baths and of course nourishing acupuncture treatment. Under Ivy's care and at the Luminae Wellness space, I feel grounded, heard, supported, warm, and deeply cared for. Ivy is a practitioner that works with reverence and integrity. I HIGHLY recommend Ivy to ALL PEOPLE.\" - Stella \"I recommend Luminae Wellness for those who are looking for a multi-sensory approach to their healing and wellness. Ivy's support throughout the past 6 months has helped me understand a lot more about my own mind+body connection. The ancestral wisdom she is influenced by is so grounding and it's made leaning into this type of modality a lot easier, as someone of Chinese descent. The way she holds space and asks you to set an intention prior to each session (plus sound meditation to ease you into each) is designed ever so intentionally- she genuinely cares. Originally, I'd gone to Ivy for womxns health and lung support during an extremely stressful time in my life. She's supported me through a major life transition and has helped me identify stagnant energy/emotions. I've learned so much from Ivy and I'm incredibly lucky to have found this practice.\" - Candace Therapeutic Healing Modalities - Acupuncture is a traditional modality of Chinese Medicine that has been practiced for over 2,000 years and is is an effective treatment for a variety of symptoms and conditions. Very fine needles are inserted into specific points on the body to influence the physiological functioning of the body, promote balanced flow of energy, and influence overall health and vitality. - Gua Sha involves using a tool with a rounded edge in a pressed stroke technique on the skin. This technique has many versatile uses such as to increase qi circulation, relieve muscle tension, break up fascia, and alleviate symptoms. - Cupping involves the application of suction cups on the skin to reduce muscle tension, increase blood flow, help clear stagnation, inflammation, and toxins. - Moxibustion involves burning of a Chinese medicinal herb to stimulate and warm acupuncture points and body regions, which promotes circulation of qi and blood along the meridians. - Shonishin is used in pediatric treatments and is a non-invasive needleless technique to activate the acupuncture points and meridians. It can involve rhythmic stroking, brushing, tapping, and pressing on the skin with special metal tools, crystal points, or seashells. - Tuina Massage is a Chinese form of bodywork that works with the muscles and joints as well as acupuncture points and energy pathways. There are various techniques used to promote qi circulation, address organ meridian systems, and balance the body. - Infrared Light Therapy uses a heat lamp with light from the infrared spectrum to penetrate below the surface of the skin and promote warming, reduce inflammation, and provide pain relief. - Herbal Medicine is the use of plant, animal, and mineral substances in an herbal formula. Herbs are used in groups, not individually, to create a more balanced treatment that minimizes side effects and produces more effective results. Herbal formulas are prescribed with a detailed health intake to ensure precision and safety. Herbal formulas come in capsules, tablets, granule powder, tincture, or raw herbs. - Diet and Nutrition is integral in Chinese Medicine to restore and enhance health. The optimal diet is unique for each person and personalized guidance is provided on foods to eat or avoid based on your unique constitution, condition, and present symptoms. - Sound Healing is one of the oldest forms of energy medicine and promotes healing in the physical, emotional, and spiritual planes. Singing bowls produce harmonious tones that entrain the brain to move into Theta brain wave frequencies, which induces relaxation, deep meditation, and mental clarity. Immersion in sound vibrations affects the nervous system and encourages dis-eased cells and organs in the body to resonate at a healthy vibration. - Stone Medicine uses crystals and stones to balance the chakras and subtle layers of the body. Each crystal stone has a different chemical composition and essence from the land which creates a unique vibration that acts as a conduit for energetic alignment and balance. - Essential Oils are highly concentrated volatile aromatic compounds of a plant. Ivy uses handcrafted pure essential oil blends in aromatherapy and topical application to facilitate wellbeing. Through smelling the chemical compounds of the plant, essential oils enter the olfactory system and directly activate the limbic system of the brain, which can have a profound effect on emotions, physiological functions, and spiritual development. - Flower Essences are the energetic imprint of a flower that has been infused in water. Each flower essence has a unique vibrational signature that supports emotional balance, energetic alignment, and spiritual development. - Sacred Scents in the form of incense, smudge, and resin are used to clear space and energetic field, and encourage positive effects.
