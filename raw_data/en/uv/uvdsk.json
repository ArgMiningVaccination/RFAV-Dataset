Information about healthcare worker masking recommendations can be found [here.](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/hcp/hcwrecs.pdf) - Can Chiropractors Issue a Mask Exemption? If one of your patients asks you for a mask exemption and you give them one, you will need to have the following in case someone files a complaint against you: - The knowledge and training to diagnose the patient with something that would need the exemption and be able to prove you have that knowledge. - You will have to have chiropractic patient records showing the diagnosis and need for the exemption. - Since you are a chiropractor, the patient records should show chiropractic need, or you may be considered to be practicing outside of the Scope of Chiropractic. Please be aware that even if you have the above, and give the patient the exemption, there is no requirement for any establishment to accept it.

The sick leave is equivalent to normal hours worked (full-time = 80 hours; part-time average number of hours) for 2-weeks. This applies to any time off, due to Covid-19, during April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021. This is required regardless of length of employment. The pay is up to $511 per day with a $5,110 overall limit for an employee directly affected by the virus and up to $200 per day with a $2,000 overall limit for an employee that is a caregiver. The IRS does credit the total amount you pay to employees for Emergency Paid Sick Leave (except employees' portion of Social Security). These amounts will need to be classified differently on the form 941, so you can get the credit. Employees who qualify for this option are: - The employee is subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 - The employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19 - The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking medical diagnosis from a health care provider - The employee is caring for an individual who is subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 or has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19 - The employee is caring for a son or daughter whose school or place of care is closed, or the childcare provider is unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19. A school is considered closed if the physical location is closed. Therefore, if instruction is only being provided online, the school is considered closed for purposes of providing paid leave (DOL FFCRA FAQ 70) Emergency Family and Medical Leave Act If you have less than 500 employees, but more than 50, you are required to provide the Expanded EFMLA. If you have less than 50 employees, you can still utilize this and receive the credits. The compensation is two-thirds of the employees pay and cannot exceed $200 per day and $10,000 in the aggregate per employee. The employee must be with your company for at least 30 days. Employees qualify for this option if they are caring for a son or daughter whose school or place of care is closed, or the childcare provider is unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19. A school is considered closed if the physical location is closed.
