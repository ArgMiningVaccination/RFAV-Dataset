What Is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is one of the best-known and most widely used treatments derived from traditional Chinese medicine. During an acupuncture session, you'll have very thin needles inserted into your skin in a number of specific areas on your body. These points are based on the flow of energy derived from the traditional medicinal practice. According to traditional Chinese practitioners, this energy (called qi (\"chee\") flows through your entire body. The direction of this energy flow is what they believe plays a major part in your well-being. Even apart from the traditional aspect of acupuncture, many modern practitioners have recognized the benefits of acupuncture. The needles are inserted at points that encourage the stimulation of nerves, muscles, and various connective tissues. A number of studies have shown the benefits of acupuncture, especially for relaxation. Does It Hurt? If you're someone who hates needles, you're probably immediately put off the idea of acupuncture. At Meek Integrative Health Center, we totally understand. Our aim is to make sure you're comfortable with whichever therapy you choose, whether it's acupuncture, chiropractic, therapeutic massage, or any other services we offer. Although everyone is different, the majority of people who undergo acupuncture don't experience pain \u2014 especially not the kind of pain associated with more typical needles like syringes or IVs. Unlike medical needles, acupuncture needles don't need to have a hollow space to inject/extract fluids. This means they're extremely thin \u2014 usually about the width of a human hair. There's much less resistance when a needle this thin is inserted, which means little-to-no pain. Most patients describe the sensation of acupuncture treatments as: - Tingling - Warmth - Pulsing - Dull aching - An \"electric\" feeling Again, everyone's experience is different. Your Meek Integrative Health Center therapist will be there throughout your treatment to help you relax and get the most out of the experience. What Can Acupuncture Help With? Acupuncture has had positive effects for people living with a wide variety of conditions. These include: - Anxiety and depression - Headaches or migraines - Insomnia - Arthritis - Weight loss These are just a few examples. Part of what makes acupuncture effective is the individual approach to each patient. This means that your treatment can be tailored and combined with other treatments at Meek Integrative Health Center for a fully holistic approach. Is It Safe? When acupuncture is carried out by a qualified practitioner in the right environment with single-use, sterile needles, it is generally safe for everyone. Some medical conditions such as hemophilia can present a risk when it comes to acupuncture treatment, so it's important that you talk to the staff at Meek Integrative Health Center about any conditions that you have before you start. Your acupuncturist will also perform an assessment to determine what works best for your body.
