Malaria remains one of the world's most rampant diseases, with an estimated 241 million cases in 2020, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO). Most incidences of the disease occur in Africa, which sees 95% of all cases. Some 96% of deaths from the disease also happen there (602,000 in 2020), of which 80% are among children under the age of five - a cohort that has an especially high risk of severe infection. Even in Africa, malaria can often be prevented simply by avoiding mosquito bites, mostly achieved with basic measures such as the widespread use of nets, insecticides and repellents of various sorts, though these steps are not foolproof, particularly when it comes to protecting young children. A vaccine against the disease could be the answer, though it has proved notoriously difficult to formulate anything passingly effective - until now. Initial trail results Following decades of research, a vaccine has emerged from the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute. Called R21, the initial trial results for the vaccine among young children in Africa have looked so promising that it just been licensed for use in Ghana. While R21 is not the first vaccine to be approved for malaria, it is the first to meet the WHO benchmark of at least 75% efficacy. An earlier vaccine, known as RTS,S, was approved in 2015 and underwent pilot trials in 2019 in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. Though it has reached 1.5 million children in those countries, its efficacy falls well short of the WHO target. R21 has so far recorded an efficacy figure of 77%. One of the researchers who has been involved in the development of the vaccine is Katie Ewer, Professor of Vaccine Immunology at the Jenner Institute. She says that producing an effective against the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria has been a tough challenge. \"It's more complex than viruses or bacteria, with a much bigger genome, which makes identifying targets for protective vaccine responses more difficult.\" \"It's just a very complicated organism to make a vaccine against and requires high-level antibody responses\" The complicated life cycle of the parasite is also a factor, as part of it occurs in the mosquito and then another part in an infected human. \"It's just a very complicated organism to make a vaccine against and requires high-level antibody responses to get protection.\" How it works R21 works by targeting the sporozoite stage of the parasite's lifecycle, which starts the moment after a mosquito bite. \"It injects the sporozoites into the blood and they travel from there to the liver. That stage lasts only about half an hour to two hours, but it's a good time to try to eliminate the parasite before the infection gets established. So we produce antibodies against a protein that's on the outside of the sporozoite.\" Producing a vaccine for such young children brings further challenges. \"The target group are children in sub-Saharan Africa who are most at risk, who in their first five years can't produce their own immune response to malaria,\" says Ewer. \"This is where the R21 vaccine steps in and hopefully gives them enough protection to get them through to the point when they can start to generate their own immunity.\" Those strong efficacy scores came from the 2019 phase 2 trial - double-blind, randomised and controlled - which was carried out in Burkina Faso and involved just under 500 children aged five to 17 months receiving three vaccinations at four-week intervals ahead of the malaria season, with a fourth dose a year later. \"Some of the children in our control group would expect to get five or six or seven episodes of malaria in a single season,\" says Ewer. \"But comparing the rates of malaria between those who were vaccinated and those who received the control, we got that really high efficacy figure. RTS,S has about 40% efficacy in the same sort of population. Given the burden of malaria that's still really useful, but we wanted to improve on that.\" Phase 3 trials More data will soon be emerging from the much bigger phase 3 trials. \"These involve 4800 children at five sites in East and West Africa, seeing how the vaccine works in different settings with different levels of malaria transmission. That data is just being prepared for publication and it's looking really exciting.\" The team is currently working with WHO to get its approval for the vaccine. In the meantime countries are free to license the vaccine themselves, which is exactly what Ghana has just done. \"We give them the exactly same data that we give WHO,\" says Ewer. The latest news is that Nigeria is also set to license the vaccine. This is a crucial step for R21, as Nigeria is one of the countries most affected by malaria. \"It has around 27% of malaria globally, 60% of hospitalisations there are a result of malaria, and a third of childhood deaths are associated with the disease. It's a massive problem there, so Nigeria signing up for this is fantastic.\" Professor Katie Ewer - 2000 Undergraduate degree in biomedical science, De Montfort University - 2000 Joined the John Radcliffe Hospital microbiology department, trained as a biomedical scientist - 2004 Completed a PhD in immunology at The Open University - 2008 Joined the Jenner Institute as Senior Immunologist working on malaria - 2022 Professor of Vaccine Immunology. Produced at scale However, for the vaccine to be truly effective among such large populations in Nigeria and Ghana it needs to be produced at scale and it has to be affordable. \"You've got to be able to make a lot of it,\" says Ewer. \"There are probably a hundred million children in sub-Saharan Africa, each of them needing four doses of the vaccine.\" At an early point in the development process, when the team at Jenner knew things were looking good, a partnership with the Serum Institute of India was struck. \"They are one of the world's biggest vaccine manufacturers, so we will have hundreds of millions of doses ready to go.\" While RS1 has the clear potential to make a hugely positive difference in the fight against malaria in Africa, more work is needed. \"We have ongoing trials looking at safety in different populations, such as children living with HIV,\" says Ewer. \"Also, R21 only targets the P. falciparum version of malaria. There's also P. vivax malaria, which causes less death but is still a big problem across Asia. A P. vivax vaccine would be the next big target, but it'll probably take a while!\" Image "}
