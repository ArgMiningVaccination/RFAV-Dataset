What is stuffing made of? To make this herb stuffing, you'll need dried bread, butter, onion, celery, fresh herbs, eggs, and chicken or vegetable stock. Herbs for Stuffing If possible, use fresh herbs. Dried herbs are more potent than fresh so keep that in mind if using dried. The herbs I like to include in my stuffing are: - Parsley - fresh parsley has a clean, almost peppery taste. - Sage - also slightly peppery, fresh sage has hints of lemon & mint. - Rosemary - a little goes a long way with rosemary because it has a strong smell and taste. It also has peppery, minty, sage-like flavor. - Thyme - thyme is a great balance between savory and sweet, floral and woodsy, minty and earthy. How much liquid do you put in stuffing? The bread crumbs in stuffing should be moist, but not dry, and not wet. In this herb stuffing recipe, we use 1.5 cups of either chicken or vegetable stock. Is it ok to prepare stuffing the night before? Thanksgiving is known for being a busy kitchen day so it helps to prep what you can the night before. Prepare and bake it the day before then just warm it up for the big meal. Should you put egg in your stuffing? The egg acts as a binder in this stuffing recipe to hold everything together. I've never tried to make it without egg. Should stuffing be moist before baking? Yes, your stuffing should be moist before baking, but not wet! Too much liquid and it will be soggy. Not enough and it will be dry. 1.5 cups of liquid works perfectly in this recipe. Is stuffing unhealthy? Stuffing isn't exactly health food, but it's also not the worst thing on the table. It's carb loaded with the bread, but you need carbs for energy! Can I use a loaf of bread? Yes! If you want to use a loaf of bread instead of rolls, that will work as well. One French loaf should be about 10 cups of chopped cubes.
