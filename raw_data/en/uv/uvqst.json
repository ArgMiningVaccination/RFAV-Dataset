To make silver durable enough for use in jewelry, pure silver, which has a 0.999 fineness (99.9%), is often alloyed with small quantities of copper or other metals (7.5%). The copper or other metals are added to strengthen the silver and the resulting product is 0.925 sterling silver (92.5%). Acceptable quality marks for sterling silver are sterling, sterling silver, ster, and 925. 950 Platinum Considered among the most pure and precious metals used in modern-day jewelry making, platinum has become synonymous with luxury and longevity. Because of its hardness and durability, pure platinum is often mixed with other metals to make it more malleable. The most common alloy metals paired with platinum are copper, palladium, rhodium, iridium, and titanium. Four times stronger than gold, platinum is renowned for its hardwearing properties, resistance to damage and wear, and its substantial heft. Pieces marked with a 950 purity are a blend of 95% Platinum and 5% alloy metals (usually ruthenium, copper, cobalt, iridium, rhodium, or palladium). Only metals marked with a 950 purity designation are considered high-grade platinum. 950 Palladium 950 Palladium alloys developed for jewelry typically contain 95% Palladium and about 5% Ruthenium and have trace amounts of other alloy metals. 950 palladium furthermore does not require rhodium plating, and has desirable, platinum-like setting and forming characteristics. 500 Palladium Palladium falls within the platinum group of metals and shares the same chemical properties with Platinum, but is softer and more convenient in price. It can be used as a bleaching within the manufacturing of white gold. It's natural, lustrous, and silvery - white colour does not need to be plated. 500 Palladium contains 50% Palladium and the rest is composed of other elements. The remaining metal alloys are usually silver and zinc. 600 Platinum Platinum is considered the world's most precious metal and it is very rare to see %100 pure Platinum as the remaining metal is usually composed of other elements. It is ultimately precious not only because of its exquisite beauty and durability but also because it is not easy to locate Platinum in many parts of the world. Did you know that in order to produce a single ounce of Platinum, a total amount of 10 tons of ore must be mined? 600 Platinum is equivalent to 60% pure Platinum while the rest of the metal is composed of other elements. At GLAMIRA we gather our metals, used in our production process, from the most trusted suppliers worldwide and with great care and value.
