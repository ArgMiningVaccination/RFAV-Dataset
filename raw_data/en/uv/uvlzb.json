The United States is experi - encing re -emergence of these diseases, in part due to fact ors such as un -immunized and under -immunized persons and global travel. The American College Health Association (ACHA) strongly supports the use of vaccines to protect the health of our indi vidual students and our campus communities. In recognition of the vital role that vaccine coverage plays in community immunity (herd immunity), ACHA discourages use of nonmedical exe mptions to required vaccines. This guidance is provided to facilitate implementation of a comprehensive institutional immunization policy. Best practices for institu - tions of higher education include the following Immunization Recommendations for College Students (IRCS) , encouraging students who request nonmedical exemptions to required vaccines to be counseled by a health service clinician, and considering exclusion of un - immunized students from school during outbreaks of vaccine -preventable diseases. Institutions may also be subject to additional requirements for pre -matriculation vaccinations and the granting of exemptions by state law . The ACHA Vaccine -Preventable Diseases Advisory Committee updates this document in accordance with changing public health rec - ommendations. These guidelines follow Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations published by the U.S. Cente rs for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Links to full information regarding ACIP provisional and final recommenda - tions, including schedules, indications, precautions, and contraindications, are available at the CDC Nationa l Immunization Program websi te: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html . In addition to implementing a comprehensive instit utional immunization policy, institutions are also encouraged to screen for tuberculosis (TB) infection, e specially those students who are at increased risk, as this is a key strategy for controlling and preventing infection on college and university campuses. ACHA Guidelines for Tuberculosis Screening and Targeted Testing of College and University Students are available at www.acha.org/guidelines . VACCINES TO REDUCE OUTBREAKS Outbreaks, although much less common than sporadic disease occurrences, cause great disruption and emotional and financial bur - dens for c ampuses, student s, and their families. Assuring compliance with the following immunization recommendations is particularly important in preventing disease clusters and outbreaks on campuses. INFLUENZA VACCINE Inactivated influenza vaccines: Trivalent (II V3) or Quadrivalent (IIV4) or Recombinant (RIV 4) Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; licensed for healthy, nonp regnant persons age 2 -49 years) * Adjuvanated inactivated influenza (aIIV3) VACCINATION SCHEDULE : Annually (recommendation applies to any an d all flu vaccines) MAJOR INDICATIONS : All members of a campus community age 6 months or older should receive annual vaccination. College students at high risk of complications from the flu due to asthma, diabetes, or certain immuno -deficiencies; and stu dents with contact with a high-risk individual. Students enrolled in health care professional programs should receive annual influenza vaccination. CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS : History of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine (appl ies to any and all flu vaccines) Note that persons allergic to eggs may safely receive flu vaccines. *CDC's ACIP includes LAIV as an option in the 2018 -19 season for those whom it is appropriate. I MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBE LLA (MMR) VACCINE VACCINATION SCHEDU LE: Two doses of MMR at least 28 days apart after 12 months of age. MAJOR INDICATIONS : All college students born after 1956 without lab evidence of disease. All health care professional students without other evidence of immunity should receive two dose s of MMR. A 3rd dose should be given in a mumps outbreak when the individual is considered, by public health authorities, to be part of a gro up or population at increased risk Those born before 1957 without other evidence of immunity should receive one do se; two doses in an outbreak. CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS : Pregnancy, history of hyper -sensitivity or anaphylaxis to any of the components in the vaccine. Receipt of blood products and moderate or severe acute infections. Guidelines exist for vaccina tion of persons with altered immunocompetence. MENINGOCOCCAL C W, Y) VACCINE Conjugate Note: Polysaccharide vaccine is no longer available VACCINATION SCHEDULE : Initial dose of conjugate vaccine: 11 -12 yrs . of age Booster dose: 16 yrs . of age If initial dose given age 13 -15 yrs .: booster dose at 16 -18 yrs . of age If initial dose given age 16 yrs ., no booster dose required Persons with persistent comp lement compo nent deficiencies or asplenia should re ceive a 2 -dose primary series ad ministered 2 months apart and then receive a booster dose every 5 years. Adolescents aged 11 through 18 years with HIV infection should be routinely vacci nated with a 2 -dose primary series. Other persons with HIV who are vaccina ted should receive a 2 -dose pri mary series ad ministered 2 months apart. All other persons at increased risk for meningococ cal disease (e.g., microbiologists or travelers to an epi demic or highly endemic country) should receive a single primary dose. For colleges and university with meningococ cal vaccine policies as a requirement of en rollment o r on-campus living: students 21 years of age and younger should have documentation of a dose of conjuga te vaccine at 16 years of age. The booster dose can be ad ministered any time after the 16th birthday . The mini mum interval between doses of meningococ cal conjugate vaccine is 8 weeks. Routine vaccination of healthy persons who are not at increased risk for exposure is not recommended after age 21 years . MAJOR INDICATIONS : Adolescents 11 -18 years of age and other populations at increased risk, including college students living in residence halls/similar housing, etc., person s with persistent complement deficiencies or asplenia, labo ratory personnel with exposure to aero solized meningococci, and travel ers to hyperendemic or endemic areas of the world. Non -freshmen college stu dents may choose to be vaccinated to reduce their risk of meningo coccal disease . * CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS : History of hypersensitivity or serious adverse reaction to any of the components in the vaccine. Avoid vaccinating persons who are known to have experienced Guillain -Barre (GBS) syndrome. There is a theoretical risk of increased rates of local or systemic reactions when two diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccines are administered within a short interva l (i.e., on different days). Ef forts shou ld be made conjugate (MCV4) vaccines simulta - neously if both are indicated. If simultaneous vaccination is not feasible, Td ap and MCV4 vaccines (which con tain diphtheria toxoid) can be administered in any se quence. *Colleges may target all matriculating freshmen if targeting those in residence halls/similar housing is not feasible. SEROGROUP B dose series) VACCINATION SCHEDU LE: For MenB -4C: 0 -2 months (Category A or B below ) For MenB -FHbp: 0 -2-6 months (Category A below ), or 0 -6 months (Category B below ) MAJOR INDICATIONS : Category A: Should be administered to p ersons at increased risk due to : Outbreaks of serogroup B meni ngococcal disease Persistent complement component deficiencies Treatment with eculizumab for hemolytic uremic syndrome or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Anatomic or functional asplenia including sickle cell disease Laboratory workers routinely expose d to isolates of N. meningitis [Category A: Recommendations made for all persons in age or risk -factor group. ] Category B: May be administered to: Adolescents and young adults age 16-23 for short term protection (preferred age 16 -18) Serogroup B vaccines m ay be administered with Men ACW Y but at different anatomic site, if possible. [Category B: Recommendations are made through consultation and discussion between the individual and their health care provider . CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS : Defer in pregn ant or lactating females unless at increased risk. History of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine. MenB -4 (Bexsero\u00ae): use with caution if hypersensitive to latex. The two vaccines are not interchangeable, so the same product must be u sed for all doses. TETANUS, DIPHTHERIA, PERTUSSIS VACCINE DT: pediatric (<age 7 years) , preparation of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. DTaP: pediatric (<age 7 years) , preparation of diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis. Td: 7 years and ol der, preparation of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid s. Tdap : adolescent and older , preparation of tetanus , diphtheria toxoid s, and acellular pertussis. VACCINATION SCHEDULE : Primary series in childhood (4 doses: DT, DTaP, DTP, or Td) Booster doses: For adolescents 11 -18 and adults 19 -64: single dose of Tdap. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccine. Routine booster dose intervals: Adults should receive Td boosters at 10 year intervals , beginning 10 years after receiving Tdap. Tetanus prophylaxis in wound management : For all age groups, patients who require a tetanus toxoid containing vaccine as part of wound man - agement should receive Tdap instead of Td if they have not previously received Tdap. If Tdap is not available or was administered previously, Td should be administered. MAJOR INDICATIONS : All college students. One dose of Tdap for all individuals ages 11 -64 regardless of interval since last Td booster. CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTI ONS: History of hypersensitivity or serious adverse reaction to any of the components in the vaccine. There is a theoretical risk of increased rates of local or systemic reactions when two diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccines are administered within a short interval (i.e., on different days). Efforts should be made to administer Tdap and tetravalent meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) vaccines simulta - neously if both are indicated. If simultaneous vaccination is not feasible, Tdap and MCV4 vaccines (which cont ain diphtheria toxoid) can be adminis - tered in any sequence. VARICELLA VACCINE VACCINATION SCHEDULE : Two doses of varicella -containing vaccine at least 12 weeks apart if vaccinated between 1 and 12 years of age and at least 4 weeks apart if vaccinated at age 13 years or older. MAJOR INDICATIONS : All college students without other evidence of immunity (e.g., born in the U.S. before 1980, a history of disease, two prior doses of varicella vaccine, or a positive antibody). All health care professional stude nts with only one documented dose of vaccine or with a negative antibody titer should receive a total of two doses of vaccine . CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS : Pregnancy, history of hyper -sensitivity or anaphylaxis to any of t he compo nents in the vaccin e, and severe ill ness. Guidelines exist for vaccination of persons with altered immunocom petence. OTHER VACCINES RECOMMENDED FOR ADULTS The following vaccines are recommended for adults . College matriculation provides the opportunity to assure that stud ents rec eive the appropriate vaccines . HEPATITIS A VACCINE VACCINATION SCHEDULE : Given as a series of 2 doses (given at 0, 6 -12 mo. ) for age 12 months or greater. * MAJOR INDICATIONS : Recommended for routine use in all adolescents through the age of 18 an d in particular for adolescent and adult high -risk groups (i.e., persons traveling to countries where hepatit is A is moderately or highly en demic, men who have sex with men , users of injectable and non-injectable drugs, persons who have clotting -factor dis orders, persons working in hepatitis A research laboratories and with hepatitis A infected nonhuman primates, persons with chronic liver dis ease, and close personal contacts with international adoptees within 60 days after arrival from highly endemic coun tries). CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS : History of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine. *Combined hepatitis A and B vaccines may be given as a series of 3 doses (given at 0, 1, and 6 mo.) for 18 years of age and o lder.

(immunization recommendations for health science students continues) APPENDIX C Recommend ations for Immunizations and TB Testing for Health Science Students Overview Influenza: 1 dose of inactivated Influenza vaccine yearly. Hepatitis B: a primary series AND documented quantitative hepatitis B surface antibody titer consistent with immunity after the appropriate vaccines series. Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR ): 2 doses of MMR vaccine at le ast 28 days apart after 12 months of age OR 2 doses of measles and 2 doses of Mumps at least 28 days apart after 12 months of age and one dose of rubella after 12 months of age OR laboratory proof of immunity to measles/mumps/rubella. Tetanus/Diphtheria/P ertussis : In addition to primary series, all Health Care Personnel (HCP) should receive 1 dose of Tdap and have documentation of a Td or Tdap within the past 10 years. Tuberculosis Testing: The CDC recommends initial base line testing with a 2 -step TB skin test or a blood test for TB infection. Subsequent annual or serial screening is determined by state regulations or risk assessment . Varicella: 2 doses of varicella vaccine given at least 4 weeks apart OR laboratory proof of immunity for those with a his tory of disease. If titer is negative or equivocal, give 2 -dose varicella vaccine series. Do not repeat titer after series completion. Note: Local requirements and clinical circumstances should be taken into consideration when using these guidelines to de velop an institutional immunization policy for health science students. Hepatitis B : Students must have a primary hepatitis B series AND a positive (10 mIU/mL) serological quantitative Hepatitis B surface antibody titer (anti - HBs or HBsAb) that was performed at least 1 -2 months after the final dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. A positive titer without documentation of the primary series will not be accepted. For students with remote history of documented vaccine series completion without titer : Draw anti -HBs titer upon matriculation If the anti -HBs titer is negative or equivocal, administer 1 dose of a hepatitis B vaccine and re -titer at least 1 -2 months after the dose. If the second anti -HBs titer is negative, the student will need to complete this second hepatitis B series . Students should pay particular attention to the type of the hepatitis B vaccine they are receiving and the date ranges in between the hepatitis B vaccine doses to ensure that they are given appropriately for compliance consistent with CDC recommendations . A final anti -HBs titer should be performed 1 -2 months after the final vaccine in the repeated hepatitis B series. If the student has received 2 complete series of hepatitis B vaccine and does not have a positive anti -HBs titer, they are considered a \"non - responder\" and must be evaluated by student health personnel for further evaluation and recommendations. HCP who are non -responders should be considered susceptible to hepatitis B infection and should be counseled about precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to receive hepatitis B Immunoglobulin upon exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen positiv e (HBsAg) blood or fluids or blood or fluids with unknown HBsAg status. Non -responders should also be tested for HBsAg to evaluate for chronic hepatitis B infection. HCP who are chronic hepatitis B carriers should be counseled as to local and state guideline s for the safe provision of healthcare. For unvaccinated HCP students or those with recent history of documented vaccine completion Administer a 3 -dose series of hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months AND perform anti -HBs titer 1 -2 months after dose # 3 to document immunity. If anti -HBs is greater than or equal to 10 mIU/ml, the HCP is considered immune and no further testing or vaccination is recommended If the anti -HBs titer is less than 10 mIU/ml, the student should receive 3 additional doses of vacc ine per the usual schedule of 0, 1, and 6 months, and a repeated titer should be performed 1 -2 months after dose #3. Influenza : It is strongly recommended that all healthcare personnel receive the influenza vaccine yearly and many clinical sites require it as a condition of rotation for students. (immunization recommendations for health science students continues) Measles/Mumps/Rubella: Students must meet any of the following 3 options to meet the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine requirement: 1. 2 doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart after 12 months of age. 2. 2 doses of measles vaccine and 2 doses of mumps vaccine at least 28 days apart after 12 months of age and 1 dose of rubella vaccine after 12 months of age 3. Laboratory proof of immunity (blood titer) to measles, mumps and rubella. If titers are negative or equivocal, the student will re ceive the MMR series with at least 28 days between each dose. No titer is required after the MMR vaccine series. Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis : Students must have had 1 dose of Tdap, the tetanus/ diphtheria/pertussis vaccine (brand name Adacel or Boostrix). If the student does not have documentation of receiving a Tdap vaccine or is unsure if they have received it, a Tdap vaccine should be administered as soo n as feasible without regard to the inte rval since the previous dose of Td. A Td booster or a Tdap is required within 10 years prior to matriculation. Tuberculosis Screening Upon matriculation, health science students should undergo baseline testing for tuberculosis with either a 2 -step Tubercu lin Skin Test or a blood test for TB infection (Interferon Gamma Release Assay [IGRA ]). Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) - 2-Step Initial repeat testing is recommended for persons with a negative TST who are to undergo periodic TST screening and who have not be en tested with tuberculin recently (within 1 year). This is intended to avoid \"booster phenomenon\" a misclassification of a subsequentl y reactive TST after initial testing as a TST conversion indicating recent infection. The criteria for positivity is bas ed on risk factors. HCP are at intermediate risk. Individuals who have received the BCG vaccine should have their results interpreted according to standard criteria 2-Step TST is performed by intradermal injection of PPD (purified protein derivative) with the student returning in 48 -72 hours to record induration and interpreted according to risk factors. If negative, a second TST is placed on the opposite forearm 7 -21 days after initial negative results and the results are interpreted in the standard fash ion If the repeat TST is positive, this is a true positive result and the student should be evaluated for latent or active TB. IGRA CDC now endorses IGRA for initial screening and surveillance of HCP Two tests are available, Quantiferon Gold and T -spot Do not require a second patient visit Considered as sensitive as TST but more specific IGRA preferred to TSTs in persons who have received BCG or who are unlikely to return for a test reading in 48 -72 hours Serial Testing Utilize same testing methodology TS T or IGRA Utilize same brand of IGRA for serial testing Varicella : Students must have either 1 of the following 2 options to meet the varicella vaccine requirement: 1. 2 documented varicella vaccines that were given at least 4 weeks apart. 2. Laboratory proof o f immunity (blood titer) to varicella. If the varicella titer is negative or equivocal, the student will re ceive the varicella series with the doses at least 4 weeks apart. No titer is required after the varicella vaccine series. An affidavit or documentat ion of the student having had varicella disease (i .e., chicken pox or shingles) will not be accepted for any Health Science Student. Health Science Initial Immunization Record Student Name: ____________________________________________ ID#:________________ ______________________ Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis : 1 dose of adult Tdap.

If series was com pleted in the remote past, and i f the titer checked upon matriculation is negative, student will get 1 h epatitis B vaccine dose (#4) and re -titer at l east 1 -2 months after vaccine. If the second titer is negative, student will get 2 additional h epatitis B vaccines (#5 and #6) per the standard schedule. A final titer should be done 1 -2 months after the 6th vaccine and if this is negative, the student should be considered a non - responder and evaluate d and counseled appropriately. Those students recently vaccinated with a negative titer after the 3rd dose can receive a second ser ies with a re -titer 1 -2 months after the 6th dose.
