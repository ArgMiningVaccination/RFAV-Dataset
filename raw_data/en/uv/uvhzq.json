Ingredients Homeopathic ingredients: Hydrastis Preserved in a mild alcohol base. Alcohol / Spring water How to use Immune Tonic comes in a liquid form, as we find this is the easiest way to administer. It is preferred that it is put straight into the mouth of the animal making sure not to contaminate the dripper. This can be done by adding the drops to a teaspoon, lifting the lip and place in the mouth. But we do realise that this is not always an option, it can therefore be added to food and is just as affective. Dosage: 4 drops, 2 times daily for upto 14 days. How long will a 25ml bottle last: (based on 14 days as 1 course) Cats and Dogs : 3.3 courses per bottle All instructions are on the bottle.
