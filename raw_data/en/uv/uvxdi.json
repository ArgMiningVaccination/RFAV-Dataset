Please give us a call (866) 434-3727 to answer any other questions you may have. Yes and it is recommended to eat while cleansing. The cleanse requires consuming a raw foods diet that consists of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and raw nuts and seeds, along with distilled or alkaline water for the entire 20 days of the Cleanse. Please check out our [Full Body Cleanse Approved Recipes](https://www.dherbs.com/tag/full-body-cleanse-approved/) for meal ideas in our recipe section. We recommend only consuming: Distilled or Alkaline Water, Hot or Iced Herbal Teas (without caffeine), Homemade Fruit Infused Waters or Any Freshly Squeezed Fruit or Vegetable Juice. Weight loss is a side effect of cleansing but not the main purpose. While cleansing, people who have excess weight to lose do experience weight loss as the cleanse progresses. People who do not have excess weight to lose may experience a minor loss as the body rids itself of toxins and waste. About one to three days before you start your cleanse, eliminate the following items from your diet:Alcohol, Added/refined sugars (both natural and man-made), Refined carbohydrates (instant oatmeal, white flour, or bread), Processed Foods (pretty much anything that is boxed, bottled, or canned), Any artificial colors, flavors, or additives (these are found in processed foods listed above), and Caffeinated beverages (energy drinks, caffeinated teas, or coffee). Lastly, don't binge-eat the night before your cleanse because you'll regret it the following day. Yes. If you are working out while cleansing, we do recommend protein powders (hemp or green pea) if needed, which you can add to smoothies, that are raw and PLANT BASED. We only recommend consuming supplements that are plant based and not synthetic. The cleanse has a colon and digestive formula that helps the body release waste. It is the last formula you take for the day. That formula encourages your body to have a bowel movement first thing in the morning. During the beginning stages of cleansing you may visit the restroom more frequently if you normally experience constipation. This may be one of the smartest investments you make for your health. Give your body a break from all the processed foods, harmful sugars, meats, and dairy and reset the clock. You're only 20 days away from a better more vibrant you. So what are you waiting for?
