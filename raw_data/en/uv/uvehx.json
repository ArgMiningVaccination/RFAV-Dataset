INTENDED USE Tetanus toxoid was provided to NIBSC by Aventis Pasteur MSD, France. The product was freeze -dried in a medium containing glycine in November 2002. It is been confirmed as suitable for use as a control antigen in immunodiffusion identity assays. 2. CAUTION This preparation is not for administration to humans or animals in the human food chain . The material is not of human or bovine orig in. As with al l materials of biological origin, this p reparation should be regarded as potentially hazardous to health. It should be used and discarded according to your own laboratory's safety procedures. Such safety procedures should include the wearing of protectiv e gloves and avoid ing the generation of aerosols. Care should be exercised in opening ampoules or vials, to avoid cuts. 3. UNITAGE Each ampoule 900 Lf units of t etanus toxoid , non-adsorbed. 4. CONTENTS Country of origin of biological material: France . The material is purified tetanus toxoid, of purity >1000 Lf/mg pN, stabilized with glycine. The material was provided by Aventis Pas teur MSD in one glass bottle containing 800 ml of toxoid with an internal code number FA082448 , with specifications of 5000 Lf/ml (4.42 mg protein Nitrogen (25 mg/ml protein by BCA assay). The product fully meets PhEur specification s for purity, safety an d toxicity/toxicity reversal for use in manufacturing of adsorbed vaccines. Material (750 ml) was diluted 1/5 with 400 ml of 1M sodium chloride (0.1 M final concentration), 2000 ml of 10% glycine (5% final concentration) and 850 ml distilled water , and 1. 0 ml was filled into ampoules for freeze -drying. The average weight of the ampoule content was determined as 0.0631 g of dry weight \u00b1 0.38%. The residual moisture is less than 1% and samples measured were in the range 0.07% to 0.6%. 5. STORAGE Unopened ampoules should be stored at -20\u00b0C. Please note: because of the inherent stability of lyophilized material, NIBSC may ship these materials at ambient temperature. 6. DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING DIN ampoules have an 'easy -open' coloured stress point, where the narrow ampoule stem joins the wider ampoule body. Va rious types of ampoule breaker are available commercially. To open the ampoule, tap the ampoule gently to collect material at the bottom (labelled) end and follow manufactures instructions provided with the ampoule breaker. 7. USE OF MATERIAL No attempt should be made to weigh out any portion of the freeze -dried material prior to reconstitution The entire contents of each ampoule should be completely resuspended in an accurately measured amount of a suitable solution (e. g. saline). A suspension of the total content of an ampoule will contain 900 Lf in the total volume. The suspension should kept at 4 \u00b0C and should not be frozen. 8. STABILITY Reference materials are held at NI BSC within assured, temperature - controlled storage facilities. Reference Materials should be stored on receipt as indicated on the label. When stored unopened at the recommended temperature ( -20\u00b0C), th e freeze -dried material is highly stable with a predicted degradation rate of 0.003% loss of activity per year [ 2]. Once reconstituted, 02/232 has been confirmed to be stab le for up to 12 months in in vitro assays at NIBSC following storage at +4 \u00b0C. However, users are encouraged to determine the stability of the material according to their own methods of preparation, storage and use. Users who have data supporting any chang es in the characteristics of this material are encouraged to contact NIBSC. 9. REFERENCES 1.
