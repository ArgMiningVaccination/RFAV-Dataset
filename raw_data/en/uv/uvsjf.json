Are you finding it difficult to believe and trust in yourself or those that surround you? I will help you uncover the parts within you that bring light to the authentic YOU waiting to be discovered. HELLO! I'M ALISSA I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). Anxiety has a way of exhausting us and inevitably overwhelming us in a way that causes doubt in most every category of our lives. As a fellow anxious person myself, I deeply understand the pain that comes with experiencing persistent [anxiety](/services) and [self-doubt](/services). I know the level in which it can impact any and all relationships in life. Having confronted this within myself has given me the profound ability to access the parts within that are already built into us. I'm so often motivated by the beauty that is found only by understanding and accepting the pain that we live. My Specializations MY APPROACH Through psychotherapy work, there is a depth of reflection and understanding that can ultimately teach you a greater sense of awareness, safety, and an appreciation of your whole self. My hope is to provide you with an open space for conversation that is shared equally around the bad and the good, the heavy and the light, the serious and the humorous (a good LOL goes a long way). I continually find that where comfortability is a priority, openness and growth closely follow. I specialize in the treatment of [anxiety, self-esteem, and relationship issues](/services). It's important to know that there is no \"one size fits all\" approach in therapy. Therefore, as a modern psychotherapist, I enjoy an integrative approach that allows me to use a combination of [therapeutic modalities](/services), only those of which will be catered to your specific needs. You don't have to keep letting your anxiety and self- doubt control you. I can help you change the negative patterns and access your ability for growth. How can I support you? The idea of change, redevelopment, and growth can feel scary. I believe it's important to create a space that is both efficient and laid back, with the intention of making the process of therapy less intimidating. So, how can I begin to support you on your journey? Join me on Instagram where I share psychoeducation about mindfulness and mental health "}
