Within CSA, City Performance ensures the City's financial integrity and promotes efficient, effective, and accountable government. City Performance Goals: City departments make transparent, data -driven decisi ons in policy development and operational management. City departments align programming with resources for greater efficiency and impact. City departments have the tools they need to innovate, test, and learn. Executive Summary Background and Purpose of the Report San F rancisco hosts a variety o f special events throughout t he year, f rom ico nic street fairs t o annual concerts t o large athletic events t o neighborhood block parties. S pecial events w ith ex pected attendance or participation o f 2,5001 people or mor e must h ave a medical plan t hat d escribes t he emergency m edical services (EMS) that w ill be available at t he event. M edical plans ar e important because they p rovide a detailed d escription o f the resources r equired t o provide timely an d adequate EMS to event attendees. This also minimizes or prevents impact o n the 911 system, as first responders and ambulances can respond to other emergency medical incidents throughout the City. Recognizing the criticality of and current process challenges with special events permitting and medical plan coordination, the Department of Emergency Management (DEM) requested that the City Performance Unit of the Controller's Office (City Performance) analyze the current process of special event permitting an d medical plan co ordination therein as well as identify improvements in medical plan development, tracking, and communication between permitting departments and DEM. Key Findings Key findings o n special events p ermitting an d medical plan co ordination in clude: S pecial event permitting is a decentralized process, which can involve multiple permitting departments and committees, each of which may have their own ability to issue a separat e p ermit without an approved medical plan for the event. The lack of standardized procedures regarding the medical plan requirement results in inconsistent and informal processes for medical plan submission, receipt, and review. As a r esult, DEM may learn of special events requiring a medical plan through ad hoc sources, may receive an inadequate medical plan just prior to the event, and/or may not receive a med ical p lan at all for an event. Permitting departments and event organizers may be unclear regarding the purpose of and requirements within a medical plan; thus , event organizers may not submit an adequat e m edical plan or fail to submit a medical plan at all. Furthermore, DEM and other permitting departments' websites provide unclear, inconsistent, and, in some cases, no information regarding medical plan requirement s. 1 This report references special events with 2,500 or more expected attendees as the threshold for the medical plan requirement because in practice this is the current threshold used by DEM's Prehos pital Coordinator and other permitting agencies, as well as the threshold implied in Policy 7010's EMS resource matrix. However, it should be noted that Section 802 of the Administrativ e and Traffic Code states that a \"major event\" is one that has \"expected attendance or participation of more than 1,000 people at any one time.\" Standardizing the terminology for a major/special event and clarifying the expected attendance threshold is discussed throughout the report, and stated as a recommendation. The above challenges cause DEM's Prehospital Coordinator to spend significant time and energy co ordinating with permitting departments and event o rganizers to learn about upcoming special events, determine if these special events require a medical plan, and to ensure that medical plans are developed with adequate EMS resources. Without DEM Prehospital Coordinator's notable efforts in recent years to establish these relationships and informal processes with permitting departments, event organizers, and emergency medical resource providers, many special events likely would have occurred in San Francisco without an adequate medical plan, which could potentially im pact the 911 system. Priority Recommendations In addition to highlighting best practices by peer jurisdictions, the last section of this report identifies nine priority recommendations that fall within two issue categories: i) standardizing special event permitting and medical plan requirement processes; and ii) clarifying medical plan requirements. The former category's recommendations require significant buy -in from and coordination between various special event permitting departments, may have political implications, and are therefore more difficult to implement in the short -term. The latter category's recommendations are wholly within DEM' s control to implement in the near term and should be prioritized accordingly. City Performance analyzed these nine recommendations by the level of impact and effort required. The below subset of recommendations includes those that have been prioritized as \"quick wins\" and \"medium projects\" (i.e., high -medium impact, low -medium effort) and could be implemented by DEM in the near- term: Issue Area(s) Recommendation for DEM Decentralized & Inconsistent Permitting Process Create a standard work agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DEM and Presidio Trust and NPS to route permit applications with expected attendance greater than 2,500 to DEM for review. Work with REC to develop an automatic email notification that is sent to DEM whenever an event organizer submits a REC permit application for an event with expected attendance over 2,500. A similar notification is currently implemented with the Department of Environment (ENV). Medical Plan Inefficiencies and Confusion Develop clear medical plan definition and statement of purpose and importance; use this standard language when introducing or discussing medical plans with event organizers, City departments, and other agencies. Update DEM's S pecial E vents & M ass G atherings website to include m edical p lan definition, purpose an d importance, an d submission timeline, and overview instructions. Update DEM's Event Medical Plan website to include these features. Display P olicy 7010 matrix t hat s hows t he E MS r esources required based on event size and event type p rominently on DEM's Special Events & Mass Gatherings website and on DEM's Event Medical Plan website. In Closing The Controller's Office would like to express our sincere appreciation to DEM, City staff, and other key stakeholders for their significant contribution of time and energy to this project. Their expertise shared during our interviews and follow -up meetings was indispensable, and their graciousness deeply appreciated. We were continuously impressed by their preparation, candor, and keen desire to improve special events permitting and medical plan coordination in San Francisco. This commitment will serve as a strong foundation as DE M and the City move towards implementing improvements that will keep the City's special events process customer -focused, sustainable, and safe. 6 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Table of Contents Executive Summary ............................................................................................................................3 Background and Purpose of the Report ................................................................................................ 3 Key Findings .......................................................................................................................................... 3 Priority Recommendations ................................................................................................................... 4 In Closing ............................................................................................................................................... 5 Table of Contents ...............................................................................................................................6 List of Figures ........................................................................................................................................ 7 List of Appendices ................................................................................................................................. 7 Introducti on ......................................................................................................................................8 Overview of Special Events and Medical Plans ..................................................................................... 8 Project Background ............................................................................................................................... 9 Project Objectives and Scope .............................................................................................................. 10 Project Methodology .......................................................................................................................... 10 Findings and Opportunities for Improvement ................................................................................... 11 Current State: Process ........................................................................................................................ 11 Current State: Information Sharing by Permitting Agencies' Websites .............................................. 16 Other Stakeholders' Perspective ........................................................................................................ 18 DEM Event Medical Plan Website Overview ...................................................................................... 21 Summary of Special Events Permitting and Medical Plan Process Issues .......................................... 23 Opportunities for Improvement ......................................................................................................... 26 Prioritized Recommendations .......................................................................................................... 29 7 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination List of Figures Figure Number Figure Name 1 Example Medical Plan Content: Kaiser Half Marathon, 2015 2 Approved Medical Plans by Primary Permitting Agency, 2015 3 Events by Attendance Range and Event Type, 2015 4 San Francisco Special Events Permitting and DEM Medical Plan Coordination Process Map 5 Recreation and Parks Department Special Events, \"Other Required Provisions\" Website 6 DEM's Mass Gatherings & Special Events Webpage 7 Consistent Process Issue Themes and Specific Examples from Stakeholder Interviews 8 Infographic on Process Pains Points and Areas for Improvement 9 DEM Event Medical Plan Home Page 10 DEM Event Medical Plan Website: Medical Plan Development Interface, Asset Section 11 What DEM's Event Medical Plan Website Addresses and Issues Still Outstanding 12 Issue Matrix: Special Events Permitting and Medical Plan Process 13 Best Practices Benchmarking 14 Action Priority Matrix 15 Prioritized Recommendations by Issue Area List of Appendices Appendix Letter Appendix Name A EMSA Policy 7010 B Kaiser Half Marathon, 2015 - Approved Medical Plan (Full Sample) C San Francisco Special Events Permitting and DEM Medical Plan Coordination Process Map D Website Research on Special Event Permitting Procedures in San Francisco E Stakeholder Interview List F San Diego's Medical Plan Guidelines G Benchmarking Analysis 8 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Introduction Overview of Special Events and Medical Plans San Francisco hosts a variety of events throughout the year, from iconic street fairs to annual concerts to large athletic events to neighborhood block parties. Mass gathe rings designated specifically as \"special events\" are typically those that use more than five street blocks or re- route more than three transit lines, have expected attendance or participation of more than 1,000 people at any one time, have amplified sound , require set -up of stages, tents or barricades, and/ or plan to sell food, alcohol or merchandise.2 Special events with expected attendance or participation of 2,500 people or more at any one time must have a medical plan that describes the emergency medic al services (EMS) that will be available at the event. Medical plans are required per San Francisco's Emergency Medical Services Agency (EMSA) Policy 7010, but this requirement is not codified in the City's Administrat ive Code or in any City ordinance (see Appendix A, EMSA Policy 7010) . Moreover, t he special events permitting process is not coordinated and is confusing for the end user. Hence, it is challenging for the Department of Emergency Management (DEM ), who is responsible for reviewing and approving submitted medical plans as well as for ensur ing that minimum EMS standards are met per EMSA policy , to enforce the medical plan requirement . Figure 1 below is an example of the key sections of a medical plan that detail EMS resources that will be provided at a special event. A complete, sample medical plan is provided in Appendix B. Figure 1. Example Medical Plan Content: Kaiser Half Marathon, 2015 2 This de finition represents a subset of the criteria noted on the Department of Emergency Management's Mass Gatherings & Special Events webpage ( http://sfdem.org/mass -gatherings -special -events ). 9 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Medical plans are important for two critical reasons. First, medical plans provide a detailed description of the resources required to provide timely and adequate medical response for special events attendees and participants in the case of an emergency. Second, s pecial events should have no or minimal impact on the 911 system - that is, first responders and ambulances in the 911 system should be available to respond to emergency medical incidents throughout the City. Having adequate medical resources on -site at a special event ensures that the 911 system can prioritize serving the full citizenry of San Francisco. Project Background Special event permitting in San Francisco can involve multiple departments and committees, each of which may have the ability to issue a separate permit and/or approve a requirement for the event. In the example of a street fair, the Interdepartmental Staff Committee on Traffic and Transportation (ISCOTT) permits the event space (the temporary closure of a City street); the Entertainment Commission (ENT) permits amplified sound; the Department of Public Health (DPH) permits food sales; and the Fire Department (FIR) permits the use of outdoor flame. If this street fair had 2,500 or more expected attendees, the event organizer should submit a medical plan to DEM, but there is currently no formalized mechanism in the special events permitting process t o ensure that medical plans are submitted and approved prior to the issuing of the above permits (or the event itself) , if at all. The lack of standardized procedure s for medical plan coordination within the special events permitting process across City de partments results in inconsistent and informal processes for medical plan submission, receipt, and review . Further, it leads to these key process issues for DEM: Due to the decentralized special event permitting process, short notice about special events often precludes DEM from having sufficient time for medical plan review, which can make it difficult to ensure that an event has adequate medical resources. An inconsistent process increases the likelihood that a special event occurs without an approved medical plan; if a major medical emergency occurs, adequate EMS resources may not be immediately available to respond, which could have fatal consequences. DEM's Prehospital Coordinator spends significant time and energy coordinating with permitting departme nts and agencies to learn about upcoming special events and to determine if these special events require a medical plan per EMSA Policy 7010's 2,500 expected attendance threshold. DEM's Prehospital Coordinator spends significant time and energy following u p with event organizers to first ensure that medical plans are submitted and subsequently ensure that medical plan content includes adequate EMS resources . There is currently no formalized mechanism in the special events permitting process to ensure that medical plans are submitted and a pproved . 10 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Project Objectives and Scope Recognizing the criticality of and process challenges with medical plan coordination in special event permitting, DEM requested that the City Performance Unit of the Controller's Office (City Performance ) analyze the current or \"as -is\" process around medical plan coordination and special event permitting . Specifically, this project aims to: Understand and identify the key issues impeding efficiency and effectiveness in the current special events permitting process Standardize workflows and protocols for medical plan receipt and review to ensure the health and safety of all sp ecial event and mass gathering participants while minimizing the impact on the 911 system to the extent possible Prioritize improvements in medical plan triggering and tracking as it relates to special event permit issuance, coordination, and communication between permitting departments and DEM City Performance conducted research on special events permitting more broadly in order to understand and analyze the context of medical plan coordination; however, in -depth process analysis on special events permitti ng is beyond the scope of this project. Project Methodology City Performance's analytical methodologies include: Benchmarking analysis of special event and medical plan coordination best practices of peer jurisdictions Review of special event permitting procedural information on the websites of permitting departments and agencies Process mapping analysis of current state medical plan coordination Quantitative analysis of medical plans approved by DEM in 2015 (analyzed by primary permitting agency, event t ype, and event attendance) Stakeholder interviews with 24 permitting departments and agencies, event organizers, and ambulance providers Attendance at one ISCOTT meeting Review of San Francisco's Administrative Code, EMSA Policy 7010, Transportation Code, and other official documents for medical plan requiremen t documentation Impact/ Effort analysis to prioritize key recommendations 11 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Findings and Opportunities for Improvement Current State : Process Background. City Performance conducted an analysis of medical plans approved by DEM in calendar year 2015 to determine how DEM learns of special events that require a medical plan. City Performance mapped each event with an approved medical plan back to its primary pe rmitting agency via the master calendars of the permitting agencies . City Performance selected 2015 as the sample year because San Francisco hosted Super Bowl 50 and associated events in 2016, making 2016 an anomaly year . In 2015, there were 133 special events with an approved medical plan. Eighty -six percent of these special events were mapped back to the master calendars of ISCOTT, which permits street closures , and the Recreation and Parks Department (REC) , which permits special events in City parks. Ci ty Performance refers to REC and ISCOTT as the \"primary\" permitting agencies because both organizations permit the most critical aspect of a special event - its geographic location. A portion of special events are \"legacy\" events, meaning that they occur a nnually . These events are easier for DEM to monitor, as they can be roughly mapped to an annual schedule, and the event organizers are aware of the medical plan requirement and process. Figure 2. Approved Medical Plans by Primary Permitting Agency, 2015 Figure 2 shows the breakdown of primary permitting agency for all special events with a medical plan approved by DEM in 2015. Forty -five percent of approved medical plans were mapped to events on the ISCOTT master calendar, 24 % were mapped to events on the REC master calendar, 17 % were mapped to both the ISCOTT and the REC master calendars, and 14 % were mapped to events permitted by other agencies (e.g., the Police Department, Presidio/National Park Service , Port, Mayor's Office, etc.). For the 17 % of events that are noted on both the ISCOTT and REC master calendars , DEM finds out about the event via ISCOTT; hence, the ISCOTT calendar accounts for 62 % (45% plus 17 %) of special events with an approved medical plan. The \"Unknown\" category represents special events that are not included in this analysis - events that may meet the expected attendance threshold for the medical plan requirement, but because of inconsistent and decentralized medical plan coordination with agencies such as the Police Department and the Port , DEM may not have know n about the event , and no medical plan was submitted. 12 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination 65% 32% of the special events with approved medical plans in 2015 had expected attendance over 2,500; the majority of events with expected attendance less than 2,500 were athletic participation events, which due to their nature , may warrant EMS resources and a medical plan. Figure 3 below shows the percentage of events by attendance range and by event type, as well as a breakdown of attendance range by event size. 3 Figure 3. Events by Attendance Range and Event Type , 2015 Events by Attendance Range Events by Event Type Roughly 6 1% of events had expected attendance between 2,500 and 24,999 . 65% of events were classified as \"festivals,\" which includes concerts and street fairs . Event Type by Attendance Range Festivals with 5,000 to 25,000 expected attendees are the most frequently occurring special event. Events that have a medical plan yet expected attendance is below 2,500 are generally athletic participation events, which by nature may warrant a medical plan. 3 Methodology notes: 1) City Performance used the upper bound number if there was an expected attendee range (e.g., 10,000 to 12,000) ; 2) City Performance used the maximum expected attendance for one day for events that span multiple days (e.g., 50,000 would be used if the medical plan or calendar noted 10,000 on Friday and 50,000 on Saturday) ; and 3) The ISCOTT calendar does not have a field for expected attendance . If the event with an approved medical plan was noted in the ISCOTT calendar, the number of expected attendees comes from DEM's medical plan; if the event was no ted on the REC calendar, City Performance used the number in REC's calendar, cross -referenced with DEM's medical plan , for the expected attendance at that event. Athletic, Spectator 13 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Process. Understanding the channels through which DEM learns of special events that require medical plans provides the background for a nalyzing the current medical plan process in San Francisco. Lea rning the end -to-end medical plan process entails determining how the requirement is publicized as well as how the medical plan itself is developed, submitted , reviewed, and approved. Working with DEM's Prehospital Coordinator, City Performance iteratively developed the below high -level \"as-is\" process map to represent how medical plans are currently developed, received, reviewed, and approved in San Francisco. This process map is also included as Appendix C, San Francisco Special Events Permitting and DEM Medical Plan Coordination Process Map . Figure 4. San Francisco Special Events Permitting and DEM Medical Plan Coordination Process Map Ideal State (happens rarely ): The event organizer submits the medical plan directly to DEM 60 to 90 days before the event , in the initial stage s of the permit application process with the primary permitting agency (e.g., REC, ISCOTT) . This allows time for DEM to evaluate the medical plan and provide recommendations on EMS resources, the promoter to make plan revisions and hire the appropriate EMS resources , DEM to evaluate the plan again, as necess ary, and then approve it. This is represented by the green i nitial step above . 14 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Current State - Primary Permitting Agency (happens often) : REC and ISCOTT both coordinate with DEM around medical plans, but these coordination processes are built primarily on pre -existing relationships and implicit steps rather than standardized mechanisms. These processes are represented by the purple initial steps above. REC and DEM. REC permits roughly 50,000 events annually , and approximately 1,200 of these events are \"special events \" based on REC's definition .4 To obtain a special events permit, an event organizer completes the online permit application on REC's Special Events website. The application contains a field that indicates the number of expected attendees . REC staff review the permit application and, based on the event characteristics noted in the application, send the event organizer a customized Permit Clause Addendum that states the additional permits and requirements that must be in place before the permit is issued. Based on the \" expected attendee \" field, REC emails or calls DEM to inform DEM of events that may require a medical plan , and DEM is tasked with following up with the event organizer; alternatively, REC instructs the event organizer to email or call DEM directly . The Addendum does state that an \"Appro ved copy of Emergency Medical Services Plan \" must be received prior to permit issuance, but in practice, permits are sometimes issued before this requirement has been fulfilled. ISCOTT and DEM. ISCOTT is a committee that approves and coordinates street closures and is composed of members from Municipal Transportation Agency, Public Works, Police, Fire, Entertainment Commiss ion, Public Health and the Port . ISCOTT convenes twice a month and the meetings are formatted such that e vent organizers present proposed special events to the committee to receive approval. DEM attends ISCOTT to learn about events that may require a medical plan and have not yet submitted one a s well as to distribute contact information for medical plan follow- up as necessary. ISCOTT typically permits special events before ot her secondary permits and plans are in place . After correspondence with REC or attendance at an ISCOTT meeting , DEM's follow -up process often includes contacting the event organizer about medical plan submission, working with the event organizer to develo p a medical plan, and reviewing and assisti ng with revisions as necessary. Current State - Ad Hoc Information (happens occasionally) : DEM learns of some events informally through various channels, as denoted by the orange initial step in the process map above. There is no standard process through with DEM finds out about events that are permitted, supervised, or authorized by the agencies listed below, and DEM often finds out about these events when they are occurring imminently. 4 REC and DEM have different criteria for the special event classification, which is an issue amongst all departments in the special events permitting process. REC defines a special event as having over 1,000 expected attendees, whereas DEM's medical plan threshold is 2,500 expected attendees. Due to the informal coordination processes between DEM and the primary per mitting agencies, DEM often finds out about special events that require a medical plan less than the ideal 60 -day window 15 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Police Department. DEM may find out about events through station contacts at the Police Department (POL) , or about events that are occurring imminently through POL operational orders, which are issued the day before an event. POL supervises rallies, political demonstrations and para des, freedom of speech event s that do not officially require a permit; however, event organizers of these events will sometimes submit a medical plan if they have done so prior o r have a relationship with DEM. Federal or Other Land. Other agencies that permit event location s - albeit for fewer events than ISCOTT and REC - include the Port of San Francisco, Treasure Island, and Presidio Trust and the National Park Service (NPS), which share governance of the Presidio of San Francisco. DEM finds out about events at these locations on ad hoc basis. For example, some of these events may go through ISCOTT, DEM may happen to hear of an event through contacts at these agencies, or DEM may learn of an event through Presidio Trust's weekly event email, meaning tha t the event is occurring imminently. Mayor's Office. The Mayor's Office oversees large- scale citywide events as well as high -profile events such as America's Cup and the PGA Tour. The Mayor's Office handles the citywide coordination for these events, which means that permits and other requirements like medical plans may be waived or tailored to the specific dynamics of the event. 16 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Current State : Information Sharing by Permitting Agencies ' Websites City Performance analyzed City permitting agencies' website s to understand what it is like to navigate special events permitting procedures and obtain information on the medical plan requirement and process. Obtaining comprehensive information on special events permitting procedures and requirements is difficult b ecause there is no central department \u2014or website \u2014that consolidates event permitting information. Therefore, an event organizer must review multiple departments' websites to understand the full process and various requirements . The websites of the followin g agencies are included in this review: REC, ISCOTT (primary permitting agencies); and POL, Fire Department (FIR), Department of Public Health (DPH) and Entertainment Commission (secondary permitting agencies ). City Performance found that the information p resented on City permitting agencies' websites regarding medical plans is often unclear, inconsistent, and/or inaccessible. Examples are listed below. See Appendix D for the complete summary of this website research. Only the REC and ISCOTT websites mention medical plans or link to DEM's Mass Gatherings & Special Events webpage , and the sites provide inconsistent information (e.g., incorrect expected attendee threshold of 1,000 people , no submission timeline). See Figure 5 below. Figure 5 . Recreatio n and Parks Department Special Events, \"Other Required Provisions\" Website The web sites that list other agencies that may require a secondary permit or have other requirements are not comprehensive. For example, the \"Apply for Permits\" section on ISCOTT' s \"Apply for a Temporary Street Closure - Special Events\" webpage links only to FIR, DPH, and Entertainment Commission because these departments permit for other requirements, such as food trucks, music, and open flames for cooking, that are typical at street fairs and neighborhood block parties for which ISCOTT issues permits . The webpage does link to DEM's \"Mass Gatherings & Special Events\" website, but this reference is not until the \"Links and Resources for Street Closures\" section at the bottom of the \"Apply for a Temporary Street Closure\" webpage. 17 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination DEM's Mass Gatherings webpage should also be revised to increase clarity, usability , and accuracy . The below numerical bullets correspond to the number call outs in Figure 6. 1. The page does not define and reference \"special events.\" Instead, these events are called \"major events\" and are not referenced until partway down the page. 2. Major events are not defined until the bottom of the page. If the major event is defined as such based on expected attendanc e, the webpage inaccurately notes that the threshold is expected attendance of more than 1,000 people. 3. No timeline for medical plan submission is noted. Furthermore, the webpage instructs that an applicant should submit the plan to ISCOTT, whereas DEM's Pr ehospital Coordinator noted that direct submission to DEM is the preferred method. 4. The webpage is text -heavy , but lacks clear definitions and instructions. There is no definition of a special event, a medical plan, or a medical plan's purpose. There is no upfront resource matrix to help event organizers determine the EMS resources necessary to complete a medical plan for his or her particular event. 5. The first link on the page is to Mass Gathering and Special Events Policy [7010] . Policy 7010 is written in EMS medical terminology that may be difficult for event organizers to understand, and it does not define a special event or explicitly state the 2,500 expected attendee threshold. Policy 7010 does include a resource matrix which, as stated in 4 above, should be accessible directly on the webpage. 6. The Mass Gatherings & Special Events webpage is somewhat buried in the DEM website. If an event organizer did not link from another page or have the specific URL, s/he would have to navigate from About > EMS Agency > Mass Gatherings & Special Events to find the webpage. 18 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Figure 6. DEM's Mass Gatherings & Special Events Webpage Other Stakeholder s' Perspective City Performance conducted stakeholder interviews with City department staff, regional agency staff (i.e., National Park Service, Presidio Trust) , event organizers, and ambulance providers. Figure 7 below shows some consistent themes and specific examples around special event permitting and medical plan coordination issues that emerged when City Performance asked, \"What are the major pain points in the special events permitting and medical plan coordination process?\" See Appendix E for full list of stakeholder interviews. 1,3 2 4 5 6 19 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Figure 7. Consistent Process Issue Themes and Speci fic Examples from Stakeholder Interviews # Stakeholder Issues 1 Event Organizers Permitting. Difficulty navigating t he permitting system without a specific contact or pre -established relationship ; lack of customer/client service; no central department, person, or website to provide comprehensive information ; no department designated to convene City agency meetings for large scale events Medical Plans. No information on the definition, value, and purpose of a medical plan ; Policy 7010 does not have clear EMS requirements and thresholds and lacks instructions and step -by-step directions ; lack of clarity on the purpose of medical plans as it could be seen as another City fee Example. One event organizer offers permitting as a service to other event organizers because the system is so difficult to navigate, especially for a new event organizer who has no City contacts 2 City Departments Permitting. No internal master calendar that all permitting departments can reference to know what events are going on when and where ; ISCOTT is not comprehensive; no Special Events Task Force to address permitting and planning and convene citywide meetings, particularly for large -scale events that warra nt central direction ; difficult to obtain information, and information is inconsistent Medical Plans. Permitting departments are not clear on the medical plan purpose and definition and hence are unable to share standardized information with event organize rs; primary permitting agencies lack the resources to ensure that a medical pla n is submitted prior to permit issuance Example. The ISCOTT Program Manager often serves as an event organizer's first point of contact and permitting resource with in the City, yet lacks the jurisdiction and resources to be a comprehensive, central City special events permitting \"concierge\" service 3 Ambulance Providers Medical Plans. Event organizers tend to rely solely on DEM's Prehospital Coordinator to navigate medical plan requirements; ambulance pr oviders expend significant resources explaining the medical plan purpose and advising on EMS resources needed to organizers; s maller events ( that are typically not re -occurring) are most at risk for non -compliance with the City's confusing special events process and medical plan requirement Example . Event organizers may often refer their colleagues to a large ambulance provider in the City for more information special event requirements; often this is how event organizers come to realize that a medical plan requirement event exists 20 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Figure 8. Infographic on Process Pains Points and Are as for Improvement 21 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination DEM Event Medical Plan Website Overview To streamline medical plan creation , submission, and review, DEM recently developed a semi -automated online EMS medical planning platform for special events and mass gatherings. The anticipated go -live date for this website is July 2017; after go -live, paper medical plans will no longer be accepted. DEM's event medical plans application allows medical plan creators - event organizers or EMS providers - to easily and quickly add new plans, explore and copy existing plans, and track the status of plans in -process. The application also functions as a database: anyone can browse previously approved plans and specify search criteria as desired. It also includes a \"Learn More\" page that directs users to resources like EMSA Policy 7 010, Sobering Center Protocols, and Mass Casualty Incide nt (MCI) Capabilities Reference. Figure 9 below includes a screen shot of DEM's Event Medical Plan website's home page. Figure 9. DEM Event Medical Plan Home Page Medical Plan Development and Submis sion: Medical plans can be submitted by event organizers or EMS providers; medical plans can be created by multiple collaborators. Users can easily create new plans using step -by-step prompts, and most fields have dropdown lists for intuitive entry. Based on the expected attendance at the event, the system will recommend EMS resources or \"assets\" that should be present for proper compliance. Comment threads in each section capture all interaction between collaborators and DEM's Prehospital Coordinator. User s can create a complete medical plan within the site, upload supplementary documents, and assign the after -action report to a designee. Figure 10 below shows the website's medical plan development interface. 22 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Figure 10. DEM Event Medical Plan Website: Med ical Plan Development Interface , Asset Section DEM's Event Medical Plan website is intended to be a comprehensive medical planning platform and City Performance anticipates that it will mitigate many of the issues in DEM's current information sharing practices. However, there are some outstanding issues that this application will not address. A summary of th is website 's impact on the medical plan development process is summarized in Figure 11. 23 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Figure 11. What DEM's Event Medical Plan Website Addresses and Issues Still Outstanding What DEM's Medical Event Plan Website Addresses Issues Still Outstanding The submission process is streamlined and all online Event organizers can now search, view, and duplicate previously approved plans; legacy and new event organizers alike can leverage previous content and structure Parties involved with medical plan development, including event organizers, EMS providers, and DEM's prehospital coordinator can collaborate on a plan Customized recommended medical resources appear based on the \"expected attendance\" field Many entry fields are drop down e ntry to promote intuitive entry and to collect consistent data Prompts and notifications serve to assist and remind users throughout the process There is no definition of a medical plan or an explanation of its purpose and importance Even though customized medical resources appear based on entry in the \"expected attendance\" field, there is no reference to the Policy 7010 matrix , which lays out how the number and type of resources is determined The resources page lacks introductions and description s of the linked policies and references, which contain EMS medical terminology that warrants some explanation Even though it is beneficial that multiple partners (e.g., event organizer and EMS provider) can collaborate on plan development, there are no prot ocols at this time that describe what the role of each partner should be The homepage lacks a submission timeline or overall flow chart describing the steps in the process Summary of Special Events Permitting and Medical Plan Process Issues The matrix below summarizes key issues identified through City Performance's qualitative analysis . Issues are grouped into three major areas: decentralized permitting process, inconsistent permitting process, and medical plan inefficiencies and confusion. The matrix hi ghlights issues in special events permitting as a whole , yet focuses primarily on issues in medical plan coordination. 24 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Figure 1 2. Issue Matrix: Special Events Permitting and Medical Plan Process Issue Area Issue Examples Current State Result 1 Decentralized Permitting Process Lack of coordination between permitting agencies No central source of information (e.g., master calendar or Special Events Office ) or first point of contact Difficult for permitting agencies and event organizers to get c onsistent information No single, comprehensive \"master\" special event permit ; once individual permits have been issued , they cannot be rescinded Primary permitting agencies issue permits before secondary permits or medical plans have been issued or approved Event organizers have little incentive to submit medical plans after permits have been issued DEM relies on established relationships with legacy event organizers so they follow through with the medical plan requirement 2 Inconsistent Permitting Process Medical plans are inconsistently required Permitting agencies may (1) not require a medical plan for an event whose expected attendance exceeds 2,500, or (2) may require a medical plan for an event whose expected attendance is less than 2,500 DEM (1) may not receive a medical plan or (2) follows -up with the event organizer even though a medical plan is not required Large citywide events are managed by the Mayor's Office and abide by separate permitting standards DEM may not receive medical plans for these events Freedom of speech events that POL supervises such as parades, rallies and demonstrations cannot require permits or medical plans DEM may learn of these events ad hoc from POL contacts or through POL operational orders the week of the event; DEM may not receive medical plans for these events The Presidio/ NPS and Treasure Island do not formally coordinate with City agencies beyond weekly event emails DEM learns of these events ad hoc from various contacts or through the weekly emails when the events are occurring imminently 3 Medical Plan Inefficiencies and Confusion Specific challenges for various stakeholders Event organizers may not submit an adequate medical plan or a medical plan at all with a permit application DEM often must call and email event organizers repeatedly to get a medical plan, especially for new events DEM often does not have sufficient time to review a medical plan and ensure an adequate plan is in place DEM, ambulance providers, and event organizers must scramble to find medical resources, or an event occurs without an adequate medical plan Medical plans require specific concept of operations language and event organizers do not know how to create a comprehensive plan DEM must often assist new event organizers in developing an event medical plan There is no City ordinance or code that codifies the medical plan requirement DEM has no mechanism to enforce the medical plan requirement 25 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Issue Area Issue Examples Current State Result 3 Medical Plan Inefficiencies and Confusion Specific challenges for various stakeholders Event organizers do not know what a medical plan is or why it is important Event organizers are wary of the requirement because they feel it is additional City paperwork and fees Department websites, including DEM's webpage, provide unclear, inconsistent or no information on the medical plan requirement Event organizers do not have access to clear, accurate guidelines on the medical plan requirement; lack of customer service Similarly, Policy 7010, the EMSA policy on medical plans, contains guidelines written in EMS medical terminology but no logistical instructions Event organizers may be unable to understand EMS medical terminology and lack simplified instructions Other permitting departments are also unsure of the medical plan requirements Departments may route event organizers to DEM incorrectly or fail to route event organizers to DEM when they should 26 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Opportunities for Improvement This section discusses the key opportunities for improvement that were reported by stakeholders as well as gleaned by City Performance's process analysis and best practices research from online survey and phone interviews with the following peer jurisdictions : Austin, TX Boston, MA San Diego, CA Seattle, WA Increase Central Agency Involvement in Special Event Permitting and Coordination. In San Francisco, there is no established executive presence or central City department (e.g., Mayor's Office/City Administrator) that centralizes spe cial events permitting information and the coordination amongst relevant departments. As shown in Figure 13 below, all the jurisdictions included in our best practices research have a central entity that facilitates interaction between event organizers and the city, as well as coordinates with permitting departments. This model is referred to as a \"hub and spoke\" model in which the central agency acts as the hub amongst the permitting department \"spokes.\" Figure 1 3. Best Practices Benchmarking5 5 Peer jurisdictions were selected on criteria like pop ulation and event -hosting profile; however, most importantly, these jurisdictions were selected because they are exemplars for an effective permitting and medical plan system. City Office Located in Central Agency Hub and Spoke Model Single Special Events Website Medical Plan Required Medical Plan Legislation Austin, TX Austin Center for Events (ACE) X X X X Boston, MA Tourism, Sports and Entertainment X X X X San Diego, CA Special Events and Filming X X X X Seattle, WA Special Events Office X X X X 27 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination These entities sit within a central executive or administrative agency - or did at one point - and all peer jurisdictions cited executive backing as an important component of a cohesive and coordinated special events permitting process. See Appendix G for the full benchmarking analysis of special event and medical plan coordination best practices, including more detailed notes on each jurisdiction. Update Legislation to Enforce Medical Plan Requirements . It is challenging for DEM to enforce medical plan submission because this requirement is not codified by ordinance or in the Administrative Code. Legislation that clarifies the City's medical plan requirements for special events would legitimize the process changes needed to effectuate improved coordination with special events permitting and medical plan requirements across City departments and stakeholders. Seattle, WA. Seattle' s City ordinance pertaining to special events includes specific provisions on when special events permits are required, the powers of the Special Events Committee, and most significantly, conditions authorized under which an applicant must prepare and impl ement various plans for approval by the Committee. In the early 1990s, Seattle rewrote its special events ordinance language and fees to carefully articulate the rationale for its central Special Events Office and its authority to coordinate with various permitting departments as a committee with the goal of increasing transparency for the public and reducing the process inefficiencies with siloed permitting departments. Provide Better Medical Plan Information. DEM should clarify medical plan purpose and requirements for both event organizers and other permitting departments . This information should be correctly linked from all permitting agencies' websites. DEM's Medical Events Plan website will assist event organizers and other permitting departments in obtaining information, but the online portal still lacks key information such as a medical plan' s definition, purpose, and importance, a submission timeline, a chart describing the steps in the process, and a medical resources matrix . San Diego, CA. Like Austin and Seattle, San Diego has a comprehensive special events handbook availabl e online for event organizers . San Diego's handbook includes a two -page standalone section on medical plans that concisely explains the requirement and includes a n EMS resource matrix, based on event type and event size, which describes the medical resources required (the EMS resource matrix in Policy 7010 is based on San Diego's matrix ). See Appendix F for San Diego's medical plan guide . Best Practice : Create a short infographic or standalone handout on medical plan purpose and requirements 28 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Improve Medical Plan Coordination . DEM learns about special events through multiple sources in San Francisco's decentralized special events permitting process . Below are examples of how other jurisdictions' EMS agencies that fulfill the same role as DEM are informed and consulted about special even ts that may need a medical plan. However, it is importa nt to note that these jurisdictions both have central permitting agencies that coordinate with their respective EMS agency. Boston, MA. The [Mayor's ] Office of Tourism, Sports and Entertainment requires that all events submit an EMS Permit to Boston EMS. For events that do not require medical resources, the Boston EMS Special Events Coordinator writes \"No Detail Required\" on the permit; however, the permit still serves as a notification tool for Boston EMS, and documentation that the event organizer has no tified Boston EMS. Austin, TX. Austin -Travis County EMS (ATCEMS) is notified about an event when an event organizer fills out the \"Event Medical\" section of the master permit application . The \"Event Medical\" section functions as a partial medical plan, requiring that the event organizer fill out limited information with the expectation that ATCEMS will review, supplement , and work with the event organizer as necessary. 29 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Prioritized Recommendations Synthesizing information from the as -is process analy sis, stakeholder interviews, and benchmarking best practice research, City Performance developed recommendations for improving San Francisco's special event permitting process and medical plan coordination therein. City Performance used the below Action Priority Matrix (see Figure 14) , a simple diagramming technique that prioritizes recommendations based on impact and effort, to classify each recommendation as a \"Quick Wi n\" (High Impact, Low Effort), a \"Major Project\" (High Impact, High Effort), a \"Medium Project\" (Medium Impact, Medium Effort), \"Low Hanging Fruit\" (Low Impact, Low Effort) , or \" Not Worth Doing \" (Low Impact, High Effort) . Recommenda tions that provide high or medium impact ( i.e., Quick Wins and Medium Projects ) and are relatively low effort should be prioritized by DEM6 and the City. Figure 14. Action Priority Matrix 6 The San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency (EMSA) oversees event medi cal plans and is currently in DEM's Division of Emergency Services . In fiscal year 2017- 18, it is anticipated that EMSA will move to the Department of Public Health (DPH) ; the DEM recommendations noted throughout this report may remain in EMSA's purview. 30 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination I n addition to prioritizing recommendations based on the Action Priority Matrix, Figure 15 below groups recommendations based on the major issue areas identified in Figure 12 , Issue Matrix: Special Events Permitting and Medical Plan Process . The last two columns in the summary table below indicate whose involvement is critical to implementation: there are some recommendations that DEM can directly implement, and there are some that require all special events agencies (\"All SE\"). The summary table below aims to assist DEM in prioritizing recommendations to implement by issue area, highlighting recommendations that are DEM -owned, and to state recommendations that are key to improving the citywide special events permitting process. Implementing some of these recommendations requires coordination and buy -in amongst all the agencies involved in special events permitting, including REC, ISCOTT, ENT, FIR, POL, DPH, Presidio Trust , and NPS. Undoubtedly, citywide coordination presents significant challenges and that is why these recommendations are classified as \"Major Projects.\" Through the Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation's Civic Bridge program, the San Francisco Entertainment Commission and volunteer consultants produced an evaluation report titled \"Fostering, Promoting, and Sustaining Outdoor Events in San Francisco.\" This report similarly emphasizes the need for increased centralization, greater transparency, and improved coordination in San Francisco's special events permitting process. City Performance has consulted with the Entertainment Commission, and we agree that developing the strategy for implementing the citywide recommendations noted below should utilize the findings of both reports, and explore synergies and opportunities between ideas and stakeholders. 31 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Figure 1 5. Prioritized Recommendations by Issue Area Implementing Departments Issue Area (s) Recommendation Prioritization DEM All SE 1 Decentralized & Inconsistent Permitting Process Lack of coordination between permitting agencies Create a central permitting office or agency to serve as the \"hub\" coordinating with the permitting agency \"spokes,\" and as the main point of contact for City departments and event organizers alike. Major Project (High Impact, High Effort) X X Create a comprehensive website that includes clear and transparent instructions on special events permitting , links to relevant departments, contact information, and other online resources . Major Project (High Impact, High Effort) X X Create a master calendar to be used by all City departments as the singular source of special event information. Major Project (High Impact, High Effort) X X Create a Special Events Task Force to lead plan ning and coordination. The Task Force could function as a pilot for and, after scoping, the initial development of , the central office described above. Major Project (High Impact, High Effort) X X Create a standard work agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DEM and Presidio Trust and NPS to route permit applications with expected attendance greater than 2,500 to DEM for review.7 Medium Project (Medium Impact, Medium Effort) X Work with REC to develop an automatic email notification that is sent to DEM whenever an event organizer submits a REC permit application for an event with expected attendance over 2,500. A similar notification is currently implemented with the Department of Environment (ENV). 8 Medium Project (Medium Impact, Medium Effort) X 7 Prior to implementing this recommendation, DEM would have to work with Presidio/NPS to align the currently required Presidio/NPS \"safety plan\" with the medical plan, and Presidio/NPS would have to formally enforce submission of the safety/medical plan wit h the permit application for events with expected attendance greater than 2,500. 8 ENV currently receives an email whenever an event organizer submits a REC permit application for an event with expected attendance greater than 1,000. 32 | Special Events & Medical Plan Coordination Implementing Departments Issue Area (s) Recommendation Prioritization DEM All SE 2 Medical Plan Inefficiencies and Confusion Specific challenges for various stakeholders Develop clear medical plan definition and statement of purpose and importance; use this standard language when introducing or discussing medical plans with event organizers, City departments, and other agencies.

Appendix A. EMSA Policy 7010SAN FRANCISCO EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AT SPECIAL EVENTS Policy Reference No.: 7010 Effective Date: January 30, 2017 Supersedes: May 23, 2013 APPENDIX B DEFINITIONS SPECIAL EVENT MEDICAL RESOURCES CPR & 911 Access: Event staff and/or safety personnel have the capability to notify 911 of any medical emergency and to provide CPR/AED access per San Francisco EMS Agency System Standards [within five (5) minutes in 90% of occurrences]. First Aid Station with Emergency Medical Technician (EMT): A fixed or mobile facility with the ability to provide first aid level care staffed by at least one EMT or higher skill level personnel. First Aid level care is defined as treatment of minor medical conditions and injuries by care providers that have received training in First Aid, at the EMT level. Examples of First Aid care are cleaning, bandaging and treating simple wounds such as scrapes and shallow cuts, providing cold packs for musculo -skeletal strains and bruises, and giving drinking water and a place to rest for patients who are mildly dehydrated. Each Fixed First Aid Station shall have an AED and MCI Kit present at all times. Examples of a First Aid Station are a tent, a clinic, an ambulance or vehicle of some type. The first aid station must have 911 communications capability. EMTs who are employees of locally permitted ambulance provider agencies are recommended due to their familiarity with local policy, procedure and protocol. It is also recommended that any event employing multiple First Aid Stations also have a designated Event Physician Medical Director and establish a liaison with the Emergency Communications Department and the Fire Department to improve coordination with 911. First Aid Station with Paramedic, Nurse, or Physician: A similar facility to a First Aid Station with an EMT, but staffed by at least one Accredited Paramedic, Registered Nurse or Physician, holding a current California license. It is preferred that the Nurse and Physician be experienced in emergency medical care and triage of seriously ill or injured patients to higher levels of care. Examples would be RN's with Emergency Medicine, Critical Care, or Urgent Care backgrounds, or Nurse Practitoners or other mid-level provider licensees. Examples of appropriate Physicians would be those with Emergency Medicine, Family Practice, Sports Medicine, Internal Medicine or Trauma Care specialization. Physicians and/or Nurses are recommended for larger crowd sizes or events needing sobering services; Paramedics may be substituted for smaller size crowds as outlined in the Guidelines for Medical Resource in Special Events Matrix in Appendix A. BLS (Basic Life Support) Ambulance: An ambulance staffed by two EMTs or Paramedics working at a BLS level. BLS units may be utilized for first response (as a Mobile Team) or to substitute for a fixed First Aid Station with an EMT, but may NOT transport unless the following criteria are met. BLS units, in accordance with the City of San Francisco Ambulance Ordinance, may not Appendix A. EMSA Policy 7010 transport the ill or injured from a venue to a receiving hospital unless directed to do so by a designated Event Physician in accordance with EMS Agency Policy 4042. In cases where a patient has a life-threatening condition, a dedicated BLS Ambulance may transport only if the ETA to the closest receiving hospital is less than the ETA of responding ALS resources. ALS (Advanced Life Support) Ambulance: An ambulance staffed by at least one Paramedic and one EMT (ALS) or two Paramedics. An ALS Ambulance is a dedicated transport unit, and must be available for any patient within the event footprint. ALS Ambulances may NOT be utilized as both transport unit and fixed First Aid Station. Mobile Resource(s): Mobile or \"Roving Medical Resource(s)\" are non-ambulance based EMTs and/or paramedics, or higher -level interventionists, that are deployed throughout the footprint of a special event and may be on foot, bicycles, or motorized transport cart/vehicle (Gator, Moped, Motorcycle, etc.). Mobile Resource(s) must be able to provide, AT MINIMUM, First Aid Care at a BLS level, and must have communication capability, by radio, cell phone, or other medium (See Appendix D). Each Mobile Resource must carry at least one AED at all times. EMTs, that are dedicate d resources within an approved medical plan, may respond, evaluate, and create Patient Declines Transport (PDT) documentation (NOT AMA), for patients that do not qualify under the guidelines in EMSA Policy 4040, Section E.3.a)(1- 11). Water -Based Resource(s) : A medical response resource (BLS or ALS), that is based on a boat, Personal Water Craft (PWC), or other water -based vessel (Kayak, Surf-Ski, etc.), that is capable of providing medical interventions and rendezvous with another vessel of higher -level care, or a ground- based transport unit. Any ALS Resource must be located on a vessel that has an accessible deck, and room/equipment to perform ALS/ACLS interventions (See Appendix D). Each Water -Based Resource(s) must have communication capability, by radio, cell phone, or other medium. Appendix A.

No Appendix D : Website Research on Special Event Permitting Procedures in San Francisco DEM's Mass Gatherings Website Located at DEM Homepage > Programs > EMS Agency > Mass Gatherings & Special Events Link: http://sfdem.org/mass -gatherings -special -events Observations: The page does not reference and define special events. Instead, these events are called \"major events\" and are first referenced in the second paragraph (the definition and what is required of event organizers for these events should be the first sentence on the website). Major events are defined at the bottom, and if classifying a special event based on expected attendance, the website notes that the threshold is expected attendance of more than 1,000 people, which is different than the 2,500 expected atten dance that DEM's Prehospital Coordinator noted. No timeline for how soon before an event a medical plan should be submitted is noted on the website. Furthermore, the website notes that an applicant should submit the plan to ISCOTT, who will forward to DEM Director. DEM's Prehospital Coordinator noted that the preferred method is to get the plan from the event organizer directly. Appendix D : Website Research on Special Event Permitting Procedures in San Francisco Preliminary Findings Primary Permitors REC, ISCOTT Secondary Permitors FIR, DPH, Entertainment Commission, POL Only two sites (REC and ISCOTT, the primary permitors ) mention medical plans, and the sites have inconsistent information. o REC: No timeline is given for submitting a medical plan. Description of when a medical plan is required is 1,000 (rather than 2,500) expected attendees. o ISCOTT: Link to DEM site is only available under the \"Links and Resources for Street Closures\" section, which is a ways down the page. No information on attendee threshold or timeline is given. The sites that do list other agencies that might require a permit do no t have a consistent list; the list of other agencies includes only those agencies that permit for similar events (for example, ISCOTT links only to FIR, DPH, and Entertainment because street fairs/block parties generally have food trucks, music, and open flames for cooking). If sites do have timeline information, it is inconsistent. No site lists that a medical plan should be received 60 -90 days before the operational period of the event, as specified by DEM's Prehospital Coordinator , or that an approved medical plan should be in place prior to the permit application submission. Policy 7010 Review Policy 7010 does not explicitly list the 2,500 attendee threshold, or define a special event. The Appendix below is the closest thing to denoting an attendee threshold. Appendix D : Website Research on Special Event Permitting Procedures in San Francisco Notes on Procedure section below: No timeline (e.g., medical plan should be received within 60 -90 days of event operational period) is listed anywhere in Policy. Submission method is different than the ideal method specif ied by DEM's Prehospital Coordinator (yet the same/similar as that specified on the DEM Mass Gatherings website - the promoter shall submit to ISCOTT or the relevant permitting agency, and the agency will forward along to EMS Agency).

The most basic plan for small events with a low medical risk assessment is the designation of an event representative to call 911 and a representative onsite with CPR training certification. Events with a higher potential for risk are required to implement an appropriate medical plan to address the specific needs of the attendees and/or participants. Should Advanced Life Support (ALS) transport be needed at your event, your medical service provider is required to use San Diego Medical Services Enterprise or the City of San Diego 911 system. Your medical service provider should be familiar with this requirement. It is your responsibility to ensure that all medical support personnel whether paid or volunteer has the appropriate licensing, certifications, and insurance to provide services at your event. The City of San Diego has final authority over your event medical services requirements and will evaluate these requirements based on a number of factors related to your event. To assist you in determining the appropriate type of medical services for your event, the City of San Diego has developed the following matrix of emergency medical services resources which can be used as a guideline in developing your medical plan: Emergency Medical Services Resource Matrix Event Type Anticipated Crowd Size Knowledg e of 911 Access and CPR Basic First Aid Station(s) First Aid Station(s) Including Nurse First Aid Station(s) Including Physician Basic Life Support (BLS) Ambulance(s ) Block 9 2,500\u2014 15,000 9 15,000\u2014 9 > 50,000 Athletic/Sporting Event < 2,500 9 2,500\u2014 15,000 9 9 15,000\u2014 50,000 City of San Diego 1 Special Event Guidelines OSE 1.10.1 Appendix F.

City Stage is the applicant intake page for ACE. Permit applicants use City Stage to a) submit applications online; b) learn about other permits s/he may need and locate other websites as necessary; c) contact someone in the office in ACE with questions. Comprehensive handbook for applicants: http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/fil es/CityStage/CityofAustin_AustinCenterforEventsGuidebook.pdf All events with a street closure must contact Austin-Travis County EMS (ATCEMS). ATCEMS has its own special events page. The master permit application has a section on EMS resources and EMS contact information. Appendix J of the special events handbook includes a matrix that summarizes the EMS resources required at an event (pg. 42). ATCEMS works with both the event organizer and government agencies to ensure that adequate medical resources are available at each event. https://austintexas.gov/citystage Austin uses the hub and spoke model. Comprehensive special events handbook that includes a medical plan section with an accessible EMS resources matrix. Applicants can submit applications online, and the City Stage website is the clear first point of contact, listing out: a) other necessary permits and b) a number to contact with questions. ACE was established at the direction of the Austin City Council, so there is high-level support. There is no ordinance that codifies the medical plan requirement. Boston, MATourism, Sports, and EntertainmentY Boston uses the hub and spoke model: the [Mayor's] Office of Tourism, Sports and Entertainment is the central entity that serves as the initial point of contact for event organizers and coordinates amongst all permitting departments and agencies. The website clearly describes when permits are required and important deadlines, and serves as an online portal where event organizers can create an account and submit applications online Once an event organizer fills out the master permit application, someone from the office a) contacts him or her to provide information on next steps, b) informs about other permits or services necessary, c) sets up a meeting with public event committee, if necessary. There are regular event committee meetings that include FIR, POL, EMS, MTA, DPW, REC. Event organizers meet with individual departments or this full committee, depending on the event. No explicit mention of medical plans on the initial website, but this is a component of the event specific follow-up after an event organizer submits the permit application. All permit applications are routed to EMS and the master permit is not issued without EMS sign- off, and EMS issues its own permit for the events that require a medical plan. Boston EMS has a page within the same website and a specific link to apply for medical resources for special events. https://www.boston.gov/departments/tourism-sports-and- entertainment Boston uses the hub and spoke model.

Regular established committee meetings amongst various departments in the special events permitting process. Customer-service focused. Even though the system is effective in providing information and a first point of contact, there are minimal established processes such that permitting is conducted on a case-by-case basis. This is similar to Chicago. Appendix G.
