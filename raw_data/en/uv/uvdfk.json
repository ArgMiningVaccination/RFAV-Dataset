Increased focused and deepened relaxation is something that can be very useful for someone who is new to meditation or is finding it challenging to focus or relax. ] Can you tell me about your product and how it can help a person focus during meditation? Dr. Williams: Well, we did our best to include in Meditonin only ingredients that have been scientifically proven to have a significant benefit in treating things like anxiety and depression. Also, I included ingredients that have been shown to induce the alpha brain-wave state, which is the brain-wave state observed in people experiencing deep relaxation and/or meditation. Therefore, we are doing our best to imitate the benefits of meditation on the brain. However, just as one cannot stop eating food just because they are taking vitamins, it is best to meditate along with using Meditonin for the maximum benefits. Is your product just useful for someone who practices meditation? Dr. Williams: [Meditonin](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=270564&c=ib&aff=193088) can benefit those that meditate regularly, meditate infrequently, or do not meditate at all. The purpose of Meditonin is to mimic the effects that meditation has on the brain, however, modern science can only go so far. Just as one cannot replace food with vitamins and supplements, you will achieve the maximum benefits while practicing meditation along with your use of Meditonin. What inspired you to create your product? Dr. Williams: I hear all the time about how people want to meditate, but claim that they are unable. There is a lot of flawed thinking in this statement, which we can discuss further if you would like, but the point is that Meditonin can not only mimic the benefits of meditation, but can also give you a quick \"boost\" of focus and concentration to get you over that hump and onto the meditation cushion as soon as possible, helping you build a regular meditation practice of your own. In this respect, Meditonin can \"help you help yourself\", in a matter of speaking. Can you tell us about your background and your current meditation practice? Dr. Williams: I have been working as a biochemist and molecular biologist in the medical field for over 10 years. I have a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cell Biology and have very a strong interest in the inner molecular workings of the cell. Also, I have been interested in meditation for over 10 years now, having a fairly good practice for the last 5 years or so. Even with my practice I still have a lot of room for further development. This is why I felt that I was in a particularly good position to develop this type of product. By combining my knowledge and experience in both scientific lab work and meditation, I could develop a product that could give its users maximal benefits for their meditation practice, based on proven scientific data for the ingredients included in the Meditonin complex. How long does it take for a person to start experiencing the effects of your supplement? Dr. Williams: Like most things in this world, each individual experience varies. Some people experience a sense of calm and relaxation after the first dose, then experience increased focus and concentration as their use of Meditonin continues. Many users report experiencing some benefits right away, and maximal benefits after about 2 - 3 weeks. That has probably been the closest to my experience as well. Should a person consult a physician before taking your supplement? Dr. Williams: Like anything that you decide to put into your body, a physician should always be consulted when considering to take any vitamins and/or supplements. However, the ingredients in Meditonin have been widely available for many years now and have stood the test of time in regards to their safety and efficacy. Are there any side effects to taking Meditonin? Dr. Williams: There are very little side effects associated with the ingredients included in the formulation of Meditonin. To be honest, I have not gotten any feedback from any clients yet regarding any unpleasant side effects. Who would benefit the most from taking your product? Dr. Williams: Again, I think people who meditate regularly can significantly deepen their meditation practice with Meditonin. However, I also think that meditation novices can also benefit significantly by getting from Meditonin a little bit of the assistance they need to get started with meditating and help them achieve the positive results of meditation a bit faster than they would otherwise. But again, even without meditation, Meditonin can induce a noticeable feeling of decreased anxiety, improved mood, and increased focus, concentration, and motivation.
