Haier Biomedical is the first brand to obtain this qualification in China, including the first in Asia, which represents China's global leadership in the field of biosafety cryogenic cold chain R&D and testing. UL Energy Star WTDP Laboratory Qualification, Speeding up Haier Biomedical's Global Market Coverage Energy Star is a voluntary energy conservation program led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. At present, many countries and regions including Canada, Europe, America, and Japan are participating, empowering the agency with high market recognition, which in the North American market exceeds 90%. Energy Star covers cryogenic cold chain products such as ultra-low temperature in laboratories, electronic products, home appliances, lighting equipment, construction products as key examples. As an authority in the field of safety testing and certification worldwide, UL has always been known for its strict certification testing requirements and rigorous evaluation and testing process. After Haier Biomedical obtained the qualification of \"UL WDTP Laboratory\", Energy Star directly undertake the test at the Haier Biomedical Laboratory (tests will be carried out by UL engineers), which is conducive to shortening the period of transporting samples and waiting for testing, improving certification efficiency, achieving high-speed connection between product development and international certification, and accelerating the deployment and expansion of Haier Biomedical product solutions around the world. At the unveiling ceremony, General Manager Shi Jun of UL China also stated that the two parties will open a new chapter of future cooperation through the WTDP laboratory qualification's at Haier Biomedical, and explore more cooperation in new industries, new fields, and new application settings, to jointly promote the development of biological safety industry to better serve human society. Strengthen Cooperation with UL, Haier Biomedical Focuses on the Best Experience for Global Users and to Promote Global Recognition of Its Brand Significance UL is an important organization engaged in safety testing and appraisal worldwide. It empowers trust by ensuring the safe commercial use of innovative technologies. The acquisition of UL Energy Star WTDP laboratory qualifications has built a bridge for Haier Biomedical's global brand promotion and expansion. In the path of global brand building, Haier Biomedical is committed to leading the industry standard and development by maintaining its global competitive advantage created in China through significant growth in the local market with R&D investment in the technological advancement of the biological cold chain solutions. For example, the solar vaccine refrigerator has been developed in response to the lack of electricity resources in Africa; and the cloud Internet of Things(IoT) ultra-low temperature refrigerator was developed for the European high-end market user. As mentioned by Dr. Liu Zhanjie, General Manager of Haier Biomedical at the unveiling ceremony, the acquisition of the qualification of \"UL WTDP Laboratory\" is an important milestone for Haier Biomedical's development from IoT-enabled devices to applied environments to ecological development. In the future, Haier Biomedical and UL will carry out more cooperation in biosafety and low-temperature storage fields, centering on creating the best user experience to open a new channel for global user interaction. From China to the world, from leading the drafting of multiple industry standards to UL Energy Star WTDP laboratory qualifications, Haier Biomedical is using IoT-enabled devices as the basis to integrate with various biomedical environments to form an experience-orientated and all-stakeholders-linked ecosystem, continue to drive the self-evolution of technology and create the best experience for global users, for the Intelligent Protection of "}
