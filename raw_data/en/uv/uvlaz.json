However, because homologous recombination is efficient to integrate DNA segments into these genes in animals, new molecular tools are required to construct systems able to target molecules in the immediate vicinity of the rRNA genes. We investigated the properties of several DNA binding domains (DBDs) able to recognize specifically a motif within a 100-bp region of the rRNA genes that is 99-100% conserved among eukaryotes. Our findings demonstrate that two Myb-like DBDs originating from the endonucleases encoded by R2 non-LTR retrotransposons are promising candidates since they i) specifically recognize, with high affinity, a 20-bp binding site located within the expected genomic rDNA target, ii) act as monomers, iii) contain a nuclear localization signal, iv) remain functional when fused to another domain and, v) do not alter the functionality of the protein to which they are fused. However, results obtained in vivo with several R2DBD fusions reveal that two properties remain to be engineered before these DBDs can be integrated into a molecular targeting system directed into rRNA genes. The first concerns the ability of R2DBD to locate within the nucleolus, the organelle in which the rRNA genes reside. The second is the tendency of R2DBD to accumulate in certain parts of the nuclei, which limits its diffusion within nuclei. Solutions are discussed to circumvent these current limitations. Our results supply important information concerning the R2DBD properties and the targeting of plasmid DNA within nuclei. They will need to be further analyzed from three aspects; the unexploited advantages of the R2DBDs, the possibilities and limitations of fusion peptides for targeting integrations of non-viral vector, and the alternatives to fusion peptides for targeting vectors. *Corresponding author: Yves Tel: +33 2 47 36 70 63, Fax: +33 2 47 36 70 42, e-mail: yves.bigot@tours.inra.fr Received March 06, 2012; Accepted March 31, 2012; April 02, 2012 Bigot Y, Carnus E, Demattei MV, Casteret S, Carpentier G, et al.

Introduction The ability to use of DNA binding domains (DBDs) able to interact with a specific DNA target in order to develop synthetic proteins capable of modifying gene expression or the functioning of DNA recombination machinery, such as those involving endonucleases, integrases or transposases (Tpase), constitutes a major challenge in the post genomic era. From this perspective, a DBD added to an enzymatic system has to combine several qualities, including i) being bound to a DNA target large enough to ensure specific and high-affinity recognition, ii) having a controllable ability to assemble (or not) as homo-oligomer or with other cellular partners, and iii) having a known and modifiable propensity to locate to certain cell compartments when it has to be used in vivo. Here, our focus was on the characterization of DBD candidates able to bind in monomer form to a 100-bp DNA segment that is 99- 100% conserved among eukaryotes [ Figure 1b], and located in the tandemly-repeated genes that encode the ribosomal 18S-5.8S-28S RNA (rRNA), [Figure 1a]. Whether intended for bioproduction or gene correction in unicellular eukaryotes [1,2] or in mammalian cells [3,4], these repeated genes have been shown to be good target candidates for the insertion of DNA fragments encoding recombinant proteins. The fact that only a few rRNA genes are disrupted accounts for the absence of deleterious effects in genetically-modified cells. Indeed, genetic investigations have demonstrated that the disruption of < 70% of the rRNA genes by integration of DNA segments is not lethal and does not impair the viability of invertebrate genomes [5,6]. The expression of the transgene also persists for long periods, because integrated DNA fragments are rarely subjected to expression silencing [7], and their expression can be carried out by the RNA Polymerase I promoter, but also by RNA Polymerase II and III promoters [8,5]. However, their interest has been considerably reduced in mammalian cells because the integrative vectors functioning with passive homologous recombination (HR) have integration efficiencies ranging GeneTechnology ISSN: 2329-6682Gene Technology S, Carpentier G, et al. (2012) Characterization of Monomeric Protein Domains that Bind Specifically to a Highly-Conserved 100-Bp DNA Target within rRNA Genes. Gene Technol Page 2 of 14 Gene Technol ISSN: GNT, an open access journal Volume 1 Issue 1 1000101from 10-5 to 10-4 [8,5,7]. A way to e nhance HR at this target could be to increase the concentration of DNA fragments for insertion within the nucleoli where rRNA genes are located in nuclei. Such a targeting might be achieved by using, for example, two fused DBDs [9] or an oligonucleotide [10] cross-linked to a DBD, these molecules being able on the one hand to bind or anneal specifically to the DNA fragment to be integrated and, on the other hand, to bind to the integration target. Vectors derived from certain transposons could also be suitable. The Pokey DNA transposon [11], which is an element distantly related to piggyBac (PB) [12], has been shown to integrate frequently into rDNA in its host of origin. However, Pokey vectors are unable to transpose in vertebrate cell s (personal data). At least three innovative approaches have been developed to target transposon vectors, such as piggyBac [13] or Sleeping Beauty (SB) [14-16]. The first consists of fusing the Tpase to a DBD that specifically binds to the DNA integration target. The second and third approaches consist of using two fused protein domains in which the first domain specifically binds to the integration target, and the second to the transposon vector via a binding site contained in its sequence, or via an interaction with the Tpase bound to the end of the transposon (known as an inverted terminal repeat (ITR)). Overall, whatever the species and strategy used to integrate a DNA fragment into rRNA genes, it is noticeable that it always requires a protein domain that can target the enzyme and/or the DNA fragment in the proximity of the rRNA genes. To date, we have identified only two kinds of DBD able to bind it as a monomer to a motif present within the conserved 100-bp DNA target, this motif being so large (at least 18-bp) as to be nearly unique in a mammalian genome. The first are synthetic DBDs corresponding to polydactyl zinc finger domains (pZFDs; reviewed in [17-19]. pZFDs consist of the fusion of n peptides from thirty amino acids, each of which specifically recognizes a three base-pair DNA motif. Research carried out by Professor Carlos Barbas 3 rd and his colleagues has made it possible to develop a single ZF able to specifically recognize all GNNs, most CNNs and ANNs, and a few T NN DNA triplets [20]. Under these conditions, the fusion of n ZFDs theoretically permits the specific recognition of a 3n base- pair nucleotide motif [Figure 1c and S1]. In practice, the background knowledge that has been accumulating for more than 10 years now enables scientists to design pZFDs in silico using website facilities [20- 22], or to manufacture them by in-vitro selection [23]. The second category consists of natural DBDs that originate from the endonuclease encoded by R2 mobile genetic elements, non-LTR retrotransposons [24]. The R2 endonuclease is related to type-IIS restriction enzymes [25]. It specifically allows the integration of R2 non-LTR retrotransposons into a 20-bp target motif located within the conserved 100 bp DNA segment contained in rRNA genes [Figure 1b] [26,27]. The minimum DBD of this enzyme (R2DBD), without its homo-dimerization activities, has recently been characterized [28]. It consists of one ZF associated with a Myb-like sub-domain [29] [Figure 1d].a. retrotransposon rRNA genes, integration and cleavage sites, and the DNA binding domains targeted within the region encoding the 28S rRNA.

The probes were purified by electrophoresis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and then eluted in Tris-HCl 10 mM pH8, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl buffer. After precipitation using tRNA as a carrier, the probes were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of H 2O, and the DNA concentration was estimated by Hoechst as - say [31] using a Mithras LB 940 (Berthold Technologies France, Thoiry, France). Protein purification of bacterial recombinant protein Each of the five fragments encoding a DBD was cloned into the pET14b vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), in a frame with a Histidine tag (His 6) at the amino terminal end. The pET14b constructs were transformed in BL21 Escherichia coli bacteria containing a pRARE plasmid (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), which encoded rare tRNA E. coli codons. They were also cloned into the pMalc2 system (New England Biolabs France, Every, France), and fused in frame with theMaltose Binding Protein (MBP) at the amino terminal end. The pMalc2constructs were transformed in JM109 E. coli bacteria using the pRARE plasmid. Bacteria were grown at 37\u00b0C and 250 rpm either until the OD reached 0.4 to 0.6 (proteins tagged with His 6) or for 6 hours (proteins tagged with MBP). Expression was then induced by supplying 1 mM IPTG for 3 hours at 37 \u00b0C and 250 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifuging, resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) and ruptured by enzymatic diges - tion mg/ml lysozyme, for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifuging (15,000 g for 10 min, at 4\u00b0C) and the su - pernatant was used as a crude extract containing the expected fusion protein. The crude extracts were loaded in buffer A onto a HisLink Pro-tein Purification Resin (Promega, Madison WI, USA) for His-tagged proteins and onto amylose resin (New England Biolabs France, Every, France) for MBP-fused protein. After washing the column with buffer A, the proteins were eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole or 10 mM maltose, respectively. The protein concentration in each of the eluted fractions was determined by a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and the purification quality was checked by electrophoresis on a sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacryl - amide gel (SDS-PAGE) with Coomassie staining [32]. Proteins fused with MBP have a cleavage site for factor Xa located between the tag and the recombina nt protein. Proteolyses with factor Xa of the MBP fusions (New England Biolabs France, Every, France) were done ac - cording to the instructions of the enzyme supplier. DNA plasmid transfection in HeLa cells HeLa cells supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). About 1 x 105 cells were seeded onto each well of a 24-well plate, one day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with jetPEI (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) an N/P of 5, ac- cording to Manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasmid DNA (0.2 to 0.5 \u00b5g) and jetPEI were each diluted in 50 \u00b5l of 150 mM NaCl, then mixedgently together and incubated for 15 min. Cells were then incubatedfor 2 to 4 h with the complexes dropped into 500 \u00b5L of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom). The transfection solution wa s then discarded, replaced by fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. Protein expression in HeLa cells Each R2DBD fragment was cloned into the pCS2+ vector (Add -In this paper, we investigated the potential of three pZFDs and two R2DBDs. We first evaluated their specific and non-specific binding site numbers in the genome of models currently used for gene therapy and bioproduction purposes. We then compared their binding specificities to about 20-bp binding sites contained within the 100-bp DNA target. Under these conditions, the best candidates were both R2DBDs. In a second step, we analyzed the activity of fusion peptides made from R2DBD in vitro, and in vivo in HeLa cells, using integration vector systems. Finally, we have found that R2DBDs combine several properties that ensure accurate nuclear traffic to rRNA genes within the nucleolus. Potential solutions to circumvent the current problems encountered are discussed. Materials and Methods pZFD design An optimal motif was first calculated using the Zinc Finger Tools website (http://www.scripps.edu/mb/barbas/zfdesign/zfdesignhome.php) [20] to target a synthetic pZFD within the 100-bp region shown in Figure 1. This 22-bp motif is located 11-bp upstream of the R2 endonuclease binding site. DNA fragments encoding pZFD able to bind to this 22-bp motif were designed using facilities available at websites proposing three calculation methods. The first pZFD, designated ZFDBarbas, was designed using the Zinc Finger Tools website. Two other pZFDs, designated ZFDSangamo and ZFDToolgen respectively, were designed at the ZiFiT V3.0 website (http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/ZiFiT/) [21], following the website/ (http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu:8080/Z iFDB/controller/ searchObjects) [22]. DNA fragment synthesis DNA fragments containing the 100-bp segment including the binding sites of the pZFD and the R2DBD proteins [Figure 1b] were synthesized by (Merzhausen, Germany) and cloned in pUC57 (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The fragments encoding pZFD and the R2DBD proteins [Figure 1d] were designed and synthesized with a codon usage avoiding codons that are rare in human cells. The R2DBD originated from sibling endonucleases encoded by the non-LTR R2 retrotransposon of Bombyx and Drosophila melanogaster. They were designated BmR2DBD and DmR2DBD respectively. The LexA binding site was cloned into the EcoRI pBS-SK- plas - mid. The DNA segment encoding the LexA-NLS was designed on thebasis of data in the literature [14]. DNA probes A 150-bp fragment containing the 100-bp segment with the pro - tein binding sites was purified after plasmid digestion with KpnI and SalI, separation on an agarose gel and elution with the Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system kit (Promega, Madison WI, USA). This probe was designated the R2site. A variant fragment of 240-bp was obtained by PCR using M13 universal and reverse primers. A 51-bp fragment containing the LexA binding site (LexA-BS) was similarly purified us - ing EcoRI plasmid digests. A 70-bp fragment containing the 3'-ITR of Mos1 transposon was prepared as described [30]. DNA were Bigot Y, Carnus E, Demattei MV, Casteret S, Carpentier G, et al.

In each well of a 6-well-plate, 4x105 HeLa cells were plated one day prior to transfection, and were cultured in DMEM medium (PAA France, Les Mureaux, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine se - rum at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2. Two microgrammes of pCS2-R2DBD were using JetPEITM according to standard protocols (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France). One day post-transfection, the cells were scraped off and washed with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) 1X solution. Cells were resuspended in buffer A, and disrupted with four 5-minute freeze ( 80\u00b0C) and thaw (37\u00b0C) cycles, and sonicated (twice,for 10 sec at 50W). After centrifuging for 10 min at 15,000g and 4\u00b0C, thesupernatant was used as a crude extract known to contain the proteinof interest. Integration assays in HeLa The features of the plasmids used in integration assays, transfec - tion, and microscopy analysis in HeLa cells are summarized in Table 1. About 1 x 10 5 HeLa cells were co-transfected with 500 ng of a 4 DNA plasmid mix. One fifth (100 ng) of the mix corresponded to the pGL3 plasmid (Promega, Madison WI, USA) that was used to check that transfection had occurred. The remaining 400 ng consisted of a mix composed of one of the 3 different Tpase sources (pCS2, pCS2-SB10 or pCS2-SB10-R2DBD), one of the 5 sources of a cassette encoding a resistance to G418 (pBS-NeoR, pBS-NeoR-LexA/BS, pBS-NeoR-ZBS, pT2-pSV40-NeoR, 1/3 of cells were used to check the effective- ness of transfection by evaluating the luciferase activity with the Lucif - erase Assay System Kit (Promega, Madison WI, USA). The remaining 2/3 of the cells were transferred to 100-mm plates followed by G418 sulfate selection (800 \u00b5g/mL, PAA France, Les Mureaux, France) for 14 days. Finally, the cells were fixed and stained with 70% EtOH - 0.5% methylene blue for 3h. Only colonies with a diameter > 0.5 mm were counted. Microscopic analysis in HeLa cells About 5 x 104 HeLa cells were co-transfected with 500 ng of a 2 DNA plasmid mix as described above. 50% of the mix corresponded to the plasmid expressing the R2DBD fused to the GFP [Table 1]; the remaining 50% consisted of a plasmid expressing a nucleolus marker fused to the DsRed (pDsRed-C1Hsnucleoline [33]). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS 1X, and nu - clear DNA was stained with 2 \u00b5g /mL DAPI for 2h. Three more PBS 1X washes were performed before microscopic observation. Cells were observed under an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51). Electrophoretic mobility gel assay (EMSA) Binding reactions were carried out in binding buffer (BB) contain - ing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 Triton X-100. In each 20 of reaction mixture, 0.03 pmol of the 32P-labeled duplexes were mixed with appropriate amounts of purified pro - teins, and 1 \u00b5g of sheared DNA from herring sperm. Mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Reaction products were then separated using discontinuous 4 to 6 or 9% native polyacrylamide gels (depend - ing on the protein size). Electrophoresis was carried out in 0.25X TBE at 200 V , dried and autoradiographed . UV cross-linking of DNA-protein complexes Complexes were assembled in 20 \u00b5l reaction mixtures containing 0.2 pmol of 32P labeled R2 site probe (150-bp), and 5 pmol of protein His-BmR2DBD or 0.6 pmol of MBP-BmR2DBD in BB. After incu - bating for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, samples were exposed to UV irradiation (312 nm) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C.

Kd determination Concentrated proteins or HeLa cell extracts were serially diluted and used in EMSA. Bound and unbound R2site probe was quantified by Instant Imager (Packard Instrument SA France, rungis, France). The apparent Kd for each binding reaction was estimated from the plot of bound/unbound probe versus binding protein concentration using PRISM 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA USA). Data from 4 or 5 replicates were pooled to calculate each apparent Kd. Analysis of the expressed proteins by immunoblotting Cells recovered from the cultures were washed three times with 1X PBS. Total protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis, adding 20 \u00b5g of each sample to a sodium dodecyl sulfate 8% miniPAGE, and then electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad Laboratories). After blocking with 5% skim milk in 1X PBS for 1 h, the filters were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-6-His (1: 20,000; Bethyl USA) or anti-LexA (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrish, St Louis, MO USA). filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) before being developed using enhanced chemilumi - nescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sunnyvale, CA). Nucleotide sequence analyzes To make an inventory of the nucleotide motifs in the human ge - nome, we used syntactic models to mine the database using W APAM at the website http://genoweb.univ-rennes1.fr/Serveur-GPO/outils_acces.php3?id_syndic=185&lang=en. The syntactic models used were TA - AGGTAGCCAAATGCCTCG to locate 100% conserved of R2 endonu-clease binding sites, and CGGGTAAAC-x(0,12)-GGAGTAACT, for the different variants of the ZBS potentially bound by the pZFD used in this paper, and which has a variable spacer of 0 to 12 nucleotides between the 9-bp motifs bound by ZFD1 and ZFD2 respectively [Figure 1c]. The parameters were set to detect only exact matches (significance score of 100%). We confirmed results obtained with W APAM by mining data-bases with BLASTn, using the NCBI facilities and non-default were the \"Somewhat similar sequences (blastn)\" , a word size = 7, and an expected threshold of 100. Results Genomic distributions of pZFD (ZBS) and R2DBD (R2BS) binding sites Before designing pZFD proteins able to bind specifically within the 100-bp region that is 99 to 100% conserved in the gene encoding 28S rRNA from yeasts to human beings [Figure 1], we used an in silico two-step procedure to locate an accurate binding site in this DNA seg-ment. The first step consisted in finding out whether the 100-bp region contained a candidate nucleotide motif with sequence properties that matched with an accurate ZBS. The aim of the second step was to check whether the candidate ZBS occurred only within 100-bp region in the gene encoding 28S rRNA, or whether it was also present at other chro - mosomal locations in the genome of models frequently used for the purposes of gene therapy (mouse, rat, and human) or bioproduction (baker's yeast and chickens). To target a unique sequence in the human genome, searches were performed to locate an appropriate 18-bp site within both strands of the 100-bp DNA segment. This was performed taking into account the factthat the pZFD had to contain two modules with three ZFs. In conse - quence, the aim of our search was to locate two 9-bp binding sites thatwere juxtaposed or separated by 1 to 12-bp, using the facilities of theZinc Finger Tools website. Calculations revealed only one solution thatincluded all the features required to design a bipartite pZFD within the 100-bp region. It consists of two 9-bp motifs separated by 4 bp [Figure 1b and c]. The distribution of this ZBS among the chromosomes of fivemodels was determined on the one hand using W APAM software with the CGGGTAAAC-x(4)-GGAGTAACT as a model to mine the data - base and, on the other hand, with BLASTn using the NCBI facilities, with a word size = 7, and an expected threshold of 100 as parameters.We obtained similar results with both types of software. The number ofZBSs located outside the chromosomal loci that contain the rRNA geneclusters in each model is summarized in Table 2a. The results revealed that there were a few ZBSs present outside the rDNA loci in the mam - malian species, and none was detected in the chicken, drosophila or yeast genomes. The number of R2BS located outside the rDNA loci was also evalu - ated using an in silico approach similar to that described above [Table 2b]. R2 non-LTR retrotransposons are able to integrate specifically and only in the \"TAAGGTAGCCAAATGCCTCG\" motif that is usu - ally present in the genes encoding 28S rRNA.

Gene Technol Page 6 of 14 Gene Technol ISSN: GNT, an open access journal Volume 1 Issue 1 1000101sites are present in a genome, as in Bombyx mori, in which R2BS occurs outside the rDNA loci, R2 non-LTR retrotransposons can also locate to and use these other sites for integration [34]. Here, although R2BSs were less abundant than ZBS, they were also found outside the rDNA loci. Overall, these non-specific sites represented from 1% to 10% of the binding sites for both proteins. Such occurrence levels indicate that R2BS has, on average, only half as many binding targets as pZFD in the mammal genome. Since both domains have a population of specific and non-specific binding sites with equivalent quality in the different mod - els, and given that previous studies [28,34] have shown that R2DBD was able to bind to R2BS, we limited our investments in designing and optimizing pZFD to in silico approaches to evaluate their potential so that functional pZFDS could be obtained quickly. With such an ap - proach, the results obtained were less satisfactory as the binding effi - ciency of the three synthetic pZFDs was weak, whatever the in silico design strategy used [S1]. We therefore focused our work on the prop - erties of the two R2DBDs. Analysis of the R2DBD of the non-LTR retrotransposon en - donucleases The sequence encoding the DBD of the endonucleases encoded by the R2 non-LTR retrotransposons contained in the genome of the fruit melanogaster [30] and the silkworm Bombyx mori [35] were located as described [25]. The codon usage was optimized in silico to avoid some restriction sites, and to allow their expression in mam - malian cells. These DBDs were designated DmR2DBD and BmR2DBD, respectively. Genes were cloned to fuse them with an amino-terminal MBP or Histidine tag. The 4 fusion proteins, MBP-BmR2DBD, His-BmR2DBD, MBP-DmR2DBD and His-DmR2DBD, were produced in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography. Preliminary EMSA showed that the four proteins were similarly able to bind specifically to the R2site probe [Figure 2a,d and Figure 3a]. Since the same results were obtained with BmR2DBD and DmR2DBD, only those obtained with BmR2DBD are illustrated in the figures. Data about DmR2DBD are supplied in [36]. Influence of tagging on the EMSA complexes assembled with MBP-R2DBD EMSA analyses revealed that MBP-BmR2DBD and MBP- DmR2DBD assembled several different complexes with the R2site probe under our EMSA conditions [Figure 2a, lane 2]. Protein-DNA complexes were therefore assembled under similar conditions, cross-linked with UV , denatured by boiling, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine how many proteins were involved in each of these complex - es [Figure 2b]. The results revealed that there were three cross-linked complexes, with molecular weights indicating that they should corre - spond to one molecule of the R2site probe (MW = 99 kDa) linked to one protein molecule (MW = 99 + (1 x 59) = 158 kDa), two protein molecules (MW = 99 + (2 x 59) = 217 kDa), and three protein mol - ecules (MW = 99 + (3 x 59) = 276 kDa), respectively.

Gene Technol Page 7 of 14 Gene Technol ISSN: GNT, an open access journal Volume 1 Issue 1 1000101that the number of complexes increased with the protein concentration, indicating that they resulted from protein oligomers, each being bound to a single R2site probe (data not shown). The fact that only one R2site probe was present in each complex was confirmed by performing short-long probe experiments, using two probes of 150-bp and 240-bp in length, one of which was radio-labeled, as previously described [36,37]. This made it impossible to determine the apparent Kd of the MBP- R2DBDs. Since fusion with the MBP allowed oligomerization to occur, the MBP tag of the MBP-BmR2DBD and MBP-DmR2DBD proteins was removed by specific site enzymatic cleavage with factor Xa at the hinge peptide between MBP and R2DBD. We first used PAGE to check that this enzymatic treatment did not degrade the peptides by proteoly - sis [Figure 2c]. EMSA analysis revealed that the binding activity of the BmR2DBD released was reduced 1000-fold as a result of the cleavage treatment [Figure 2d, lane 2 versus 3 to 6]. The apparent Kd of the cleaved protein was determined by EMSA. The saturation graph was plotted, and used to calculate a fixed con-centration of 102 nM for the BmR2DBD protein, and of 116 nM for the DmR2DBD protein (data not shown). EMSA assays were then per - formed using the appropriate fixed concentration of the protein with variable concentrations of the R2 site probe. Under these assay con - ditions, the BmR2DBD and DmR2DBD were found to be low affinity proteins with an apparent Kd of more than 1 \u00b5M. Taking into account the data presented below, our results indicated that the release of the MBP tag did not seem to change the specific activity of either R2DBD to any great extent, but did modify their affinity, probably by destabilizing them or modifying their folding. Properties of R2DBD Under our laboratory conditions, and for all protein concentra - tions, His-BmR2DBD and His-DmR2DBD each assembled only in one complex with the R2site probe [Figure 3a]. To find out how many pro - teins were bound to each R2site molecule, UV cross-linking assays were carried out with both R2DBDs [Figure 3b]. The molecular weight of the only cross-linked formed complex indicated that only one protein was bound to each R2site probe. Both purified proteins were also used to determine the apparent Kd. Saturation graphs were plotted and used to calculate a fixed concentration of 6.6 nM for the His-BmR2DBD pro - tein and 3c and d]. EMSA assays were then performed using a fixed concentration of protein and variable concentrations of the R2site. The apparent Kd of His-BmR2DBD for the R2site probe was estimated to be 30 nM, and that of His-DmR2DBD to be 18 nM [Figure 3e and f]. These two apparent Kd values were similar, and higher t han those obtained using Factor Xa cleaved proteins. Over - all, they showed that the tag used had a major impact on the binding of both R2DBDs to the R2site probe, and on their ability to oligomer - ize. Indeed, the 89 amino acid residues located upstream to R2DBD [28] were removed to suppress homo-dimerization. Our interpretation of the data herein and those of the literature is that the dimerizationactivity is contained within the amino acid residues located at the N- terminal end of R2DBD. These residues would be accurately folded and stabilized only when they are fused with certain peptides at their N-terminal end. Under this interpretation, the fusion of R2DBD to the MBP would allow the release of t he dimerization activity.

Gene Technol Page 9 of 14 Gene Technol ISSN: GNT, an open access journal Volume 1 Issue 1 1000101only one main complex was assembled with the His-DmR2DBD and R2site probe, whatever the biological system in which it had been pro - duced [Figure 4a, lane 2 versus 3]. HeLa cell extracts were then used to determine the apparent Kd of His-BmR2DBD. Saturation graphs were plotted to fix the concentration in HeLa cell extract [Figure 4b], and the apparent Kd was estimated to be 31 nM [Figure 4c]. This value was identical to that obtained with the protein produced in bacteria, indi - cating that expression in eukaryotic cells did not alter its activity. Since we had pre viously observed that fusion of both R2DBDs with the MBP tag modified their ability to oligomerize, we investigat - ed the properties of a fusion protein model that had previously been investigated as a potential way to target a nucleic acid vector close to its chromosomal integration target [14]. This consisted of fusing the BmR2DBD at its C-terminal end with a LexA DBD, and including a SV40 Nuclear Localization the DBDs [Figure 4d]. The LexA DBD was an interesting model, because its functionality had previously been shown to depend on the properties of the domain to which it is fused [38], making it possible to find out whether His-BmR2DBD can modify the properties of a fused DBD. The profile of the R2DBD-LexA expressed in HeLa cells was verified. Western blot analy- sis revealed that the fusion was expressed as a single protein of about 46 kDa [Figure 4e; theoretical molecular weight = 45.6 kDa]. EMSA analyses done with the R2site probe revealed that the BmR2DBD in the fusion protein was active, but that three complexes were observed [Figure 4f, lane 3]. Similarly, EMSA indicated that the LexA part was also active, and once again, three complexes were also observed [Figure 4g, lane 3]. The presence of three complexes was very probably not due to BmR2DBD oligomerization, but to the fact that the LexA DBD can occur as a monomer, a dimer, or a tetramer in solution [38]. In contrast to MBP fusions, saturation graphs could be calculated for these pro - teins, although these fusions were able to assemble in several different complexes as a result of LexA DBD oligomerization. Similar UV cross-linking investigations and short-long probe EMSA indicated that they all contained a single DNA probe to which the fusion was oligomerized (data not shown). These controls made it possible to perform affinity analyses, which revealed that the values of the apparent Kd of both do- mains in the fusion proteins were similar to those of each isolated do - main (about 20 nM; [38]). Impact of R2DBD fusions on DNA integration in HeLa cells The effects of several Bm R2DBD fusions were assayed on the abil - ity of SB vectors to integrate into chromosomes by transposition and that of a plasmid to integrate by random recombination. Integrations by transposition and random recombination occur at different rates during an assay monitored with a transposon vector system, depend-ing on the cell lineage used and plasmid amounts transfected [39,40]. As a consequence, a NeoR cassette can integrate by transposing with the SB vector into chromosomes in presence of Tpase. A fraction of the plasmids carrying the SB vector will also integrate into chro - mosomes as a result of random recombination, but in general this happens less often than transposition. In the control assays carried out in absence of SB Tpase, only plasmid integrations by random recombination occur. A first set of assays was monitored with an R2DBD fused to the N- terminal end of the SB Tpase (R2DBD-SB10; S2). One objective of these assays was to find out whether R2DBD-SB10 was able to mediate inte - gration into rRNA genes. Two SB vectors were used (Table 1). The first vector, pT2-pSV40-NeoR, carried a NeoR cassette with expression that depended on an RNA polymerase II promoter, pSV40, and the second vector, pT2-pPol1h-NeoR, had NeoR cassette expression that depends on the human RNA polymerase I promoter, pPol1h [41]. The interest of this second construct is that pPol1h contains cryptic RNA polymerase II promoters that allow expression of NeoR cassettes integrated into nu- cleolar rRNA genes or elsewhere in the genome [42]. Our results indi - cated that R2DBD-SB10 was unable to achieve transposition, whatever the SB vector used (Figure 5a and b; white bars versus dark gray bars). These data agreed with those obtained with most of the SB Tpases so far fused to a DBD [14-16]. Interestingly, we found that the numbers of NeoR clones obtained in assays monitored with R2DBD-SB10 (Figure 5a and b, dark gray bars) were systematically lower than those in the controls done in the absence of Tpase (Figure. 5a and b, black bars). Statistical analyses indicated that this difference was only significant (p>95%) when pT2-pPol1hNeoR was used as the SB vector source. In a second set of assays, we checked the impact of several peptides theoretically designed to target a DNA plasmid in the proximity of the rRNA genes [9,14]. First, we analyzed the effect of R2DBD-NLS-LexA peptide on the integration ability of SB vectors. Two plasmid sources of SB vectors were used: pT2-pSV40-NeoR and pT2-pSV40-NeoR-LexA/BS, in which a LexA binding site was cloned within the SB vector (Ta - ble 1). Our results indicated that the R2DBD-NLS-LexA expression in HeLa cells inhibited the transposition of both SB vectors (Figure. 5c and d, white bars versus light gray bars). Here too, we found that the numbers of NeoR clones obtained in the absence of SB10 Tpase, and in the presence of R2DBD-NLS-LexA (Figure. 5c and d, dark gray bars), were statistically lower than those of the control assays monitored in the absence of both proteins (Figure. 5c and d, black gray bars). We con - clude that R2DBD-NLS-LexA was able to inhibit the SB vector transpo- sition and the plasmid integration by random recombination. Because a similar effect of R2DBD-NLS-LexA was observed with both SB vector sources, we concluded that LexA interfered non-specifically with both plasmids independently of the presence of LexA/BS (Figure. 5c and d, top bars). Since some studies in the literature [43] have confirmed that LexA DBD has lower DNA binding specificity, we assayed a second peptide R2DBD-NLS-pZFD bcr-abl [44] in which pZFDbcr-abl is composed of a concatemer of four ZFs that recognizes a 12-bp motif (GACG - CAGAAGCC; ZBS). ZBS is not found in the human genome, except in the genomes of most patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and in some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), in which the BRC and ABL genes are fused. Two pBS-NeoRs were used for the integration assays: pBS-NeoR and one pBS-NeoR derivative in which was cloned a ZBS to produce pBS-NeoR-ZBS. Whichever plasmid was used, our results indicated that R2DBD-NLS-pZFDbcr-abl also lacked binding specificity under our experimental conditions (S3). These results were confirmed for both peptides in experiments in which the pSV40-NeoR cassette was replaced by a pPol1h-NeoR cassette (data not shown). The properties of a third peptide that theoretically works in a dif - ferent way were therefore investigated. This peptide was composed of an R2DBD fused to a domain corresponding to the first 57 N-terminal residues of SB10 Tpase (N57SB; S4). N57SB has previously been pro - posed to be a Tpase-interacting domain that is able to interact with full-length SB Tpase complex bound to the SB vector ITRs [9,14]. The N57SB10-NLS-TetR peptide has also been demonstrated to be able to modify the integration preferences of SB vectors in the proximity of a TetR binding site [14]. For the integration assays, two ratios of the plas - mids pCS2-SB10 and pCS2-R2DBD-NLS-N57SB were used. The results revealed that R2DBD-NLS-N57SB inhibited SB vector transposition, the intensity of inhibition depended on the amount of R2DBD-NLS-N57SB expressed in the cells (Figure. 5e and f, white bars versus light gray bars). Unexpectedly, controls done in the absence of SB10 Tpase Citation: Bigot Y, Carnus E, Demattei MV, Carpentier G, et al. (2012) Characterization of Monomeric Protein Domains that Bind Specifically to a Highly-Conserved 100-Bp DNA Target within rRNA Genes. Gene Technol Page 10 of 14 Gene Technol ISSN: GNT, an open access journal Volume 1 Issue 1 1000101indicated that R2DBD-NLS-N57SB also inhibited plasmid integration by random recombination, at least under conditions in which R2DBD-NLS-N57SB was abundant (Figure 5f, black bars versus dark gray bars). Complementary experiments indicated that this effect was statistically significant from a plasmid ratio of 1:4 (data not shown). In agreement with structural data [45,46], our results therefore support the sugges - tion that N57SB is above all a DBD that binds to the SB vector ends (ITRs) contained in pT2-pSV40-NeoR. In conclusion, R2DBD-NLS-LexA, R2DBD-NLS-pZFD bcr-abl and R2DBD-NLS-N57SB all have the ability to inhibit SB vector transpo - sition and plasmid integration by random recombination. Prelimi - nary results obtained with piggyBac vectors, R2DBD-NLS-LexA and R2DBD-NLS-pZFDbcr-abl led to similar conclusions, indicating that the effect was independent of the transposon used (data not shown; only one replicate of each of the transposition assays shown in Figure. 5 was done). In agreement with these conclusions, we also found that R2DBD-NLS-LexA, R2DBD-NLS-pZFD bcr-abl and R2DBD-NLS-N57SB have the ability to decrease the expression of a gene beard by a co-trans - fected plasmid (data not shown). These results were obtained using an internal control of our transposition assays (see Material and Methods). We checked 24 hours post transfection that plasmids were transfected by following the transient luciferase expression of the co-transfected pGL3 plasmid. We observed that luciferase activities were all 2 to 5-fold lower in HeLa cells transfected with plasmids expressing R2DBD-NLS-LexA or R2DBD-NLS-pZFD bcr-abl, 5 to 20-fold lower in those expressing with R2DBD-NLS-N57SB, and similar to the controls in those express - ing R2DBD-NLS, NLS-LexA or NLS-N57SB. Overall, these inhibitory effects did not depend on the domain fused to R2DBD or on the promoter of the marker gene since we ob - tained similar results with all three peptides using a pBS-NeoR plasmid. Howev er, their effects did depend on their cellular level of expression, which was to be expected since they do not have the same affinities for DNA binding sites. None of the domains fused here to R2DBD, i.e. LexA, pZFDbcr abl and N57SB, has previously been found to inhibit transposition and recombination [14-16] when associated with another DBD or enzyme. We therefore concluded that the inhibitory effect was allocated by R2DBD to the fusion peptides. Two hypotheses can be pro - posed to explain our results. The first supposes that the expression of R2DBD peptides has a toxic effect on HeLa cells, and so killed the trans-fected cell population. The second proposes that the nuclear trafficking of the plasmid to the target was affected, and that this impaired plasmid access to the transposition and r ecombination machineries. Impact of R2DBD peptides on HeLa cells To find out whether R2DBD peptides were toxic for HeLa cells, the effect of R2DBD-NLS was assayed on the transposition and plasmid integration of SB vectors. The results showed that R2DBD-NLS did not have any effect on transposition (Figure. 5g, white bars versus light gray bars) or recombination (Figure. 5g, black bars versus dark gray bars). The effects of the NLS-LexA and NLS-N57SB were also assayed. Our findings also showed that t hey had no effects (Figure. 5h), even though we did detect a weak effect with NLS-LexA when a plasmid contain - ing a LexA/BS was used (Figure. 5h, black bars versus white bars). The toxicities of R2DBD and the peptides in which it was fused to LexA and N57SB were then verified using a viability assay evaluating cell survival during the 48 hours following the plasmid transfection (S5). We found that the viability of the HeLa cells was not altered, whatever R2DBD peptide was expressed. We therefore concluded that R2DBD peptides had no toxic effect on HeLa cells under our experimental conditions, and that their effects on transposition and recombination were attribut - able to some other cause. The localization of R2DBD in nuclei was verified by transfecting HeLa cells with plasmids expressing an R2DBD-NLS-GFP fusion or a variant expressing an R2DBD-GFP fusion in which the SV40NLS had been removed by mutagenesis (PKKKRK to PKAIRK [47]). The expression profiles of both peptides were compared to those of HeLa cells transfected with control plasmids expressing GFP , a protein that passively diffuses into all cell compartments, or a MOS1-GFP , a protein fusion that is actively concentrated in the nucleus (personal data). Our findings indicated that fusions of both GFPs with R2DBD were actively accumulated in the nucleus (Figure. 6a). This indicated that the R2DBD sequence contained NLS information that was efficient enough to mon - itor a nuclear import as strong as that mediated by SV40 NLS. PSORT II facilities at http://psort.hgc.jp/form2.html allowed us to identify two NLS candidates (HKRR and PMMVKRR). The findings also revealed that the nuclear distribution of the green fluorescent signal was unex - pected, since it was not homogenous with either of the GFP fusions, both of which assembled fluorescent \"mottling\" around and between the nucleoli. This feature was in striking contrast with the results ob - tained in the controls in which the GFP or the MOS1-GFP fluorescence were found to diffuse homogenously within the fusions expressed in HeLa cells. (a) Analysis of DAPI and GFP-fluorescence distribution proteins. GFP and MOS1-GFP were used as negative and positive controls of active nuclear import, respectively. The nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI. Merge pictures were used to confirm the co-localization between the nucleus and GFP proteins. Since the results were similar, only those obtained with R2DBD-NLS-GFP are shown. (b). Analysis of GFP and DsRed-fluorescence distribution in HeLa cells co-transfected with plasmids expressed the R2DBD-NLS-GFP and pDsRed- C1Hsnucleoline fusions. pDsRed-C1Hsnucleoline was used to label nucleoli. Merge pictures were used to verify the co-localization between nucleoli and GFP signal in nuclei. Since results were similar with both fusions, only those obtained with R2DBD-NLS-GFP are shown in a and b.Citation: Bigot Y, Carnus E, Demattei MV, Casteret S, Carpentier G, et al.

Gene Technol Page 11 of 14 Gene Technol ISSN: GNT, an open access journal Volume 1 Issue 1 1000101was therefore further investigated by co-expressing both R2DBD-GFP fusions with a nucleolar marker, human nucleoline [34]. The compos - ite image created by merging the GFP and DsRED signals confirmed that R2DBD-GFP was indeed assembled as mottling organized around and between nucleoli, and that R2DBD-GFP did not co-localize with nucleolin within the nucleoli (Figure 6b). These observations led us to propose that R2DBD was located around and between the nucleoli, and probably around other small nucleolar accessory bodies [48]. Such a location could explain why the R2DBD-GFP signal formed mottled patterns, and suggests that R2DBD has an affinity for a nuclear protein that is abundant in nuclear organelles and molecular networks ensur - ing connections between them. Fibrillarin is a potential candidate [49]. Discussion The positive and negative results reported here supply important information that needs to be analyzed from three aspects concerning i) the R2DBD properties, ii) the unexploited advantages of the R2DBDs, and iii) the limitations of fusion peptides for targeting integrations of non-viral vector and their alternatives. Properties and current limitations of R2DBDs Our objective was to characterize at least one DBD that has the properties required to specifically target rRNA genes, whatever the eu - karyotic genome in which it could be used. The interests of the strategy that consist in targeting insertions of transgenic cassettes into rRNA genes in eukaryotic genomes are summarized in S6. Here, our data show that R2BDBs have at least five of the prop - erties that are required in such a peptide. Firstly, R2DBDs are able to bind specifically to a 20-bp motif located within the 100-bp region that is conserved among all eukaryotes. Moreover, the affinity of R2DBDs for the 20 bp target is rather high in vitro, their apparent Kds being around 20 nM. Secondly, R2DBDs bind to their DNA target in a mo-nomeric form. This property is very important if R2DBDs are used to target other molecules, because it should prevent the assembly of ho - mo-aggregates. Thirdly, the R2DBD sequences contain strong NLS in - formation, which should avoid the addition of an NLS in the synthetic peptide. Fourthly, R2DBDs retain their DNA binding properties when there are fused to another protein or domain. Fifthly, the functionality of a protein fused to R2DBD is preserved, as illustrated here with LexA, pZFD bcr-abl, N57SB and GFP . We found that the functionality of SB10 is in fact altered by its N-terminal fusion to R2DBD. However, this is very probably due to the fact that SB10 cannot tolerate N-terminal fusion, which is clearly illustrated in the literature with domains of various ori - gins [14-16]. Our results also show that a few properties of the R2DBDs still need to be optimized before they become fully usable. Indeed, we observed that R2DBD-GFP fusions did not penetrate into all nuclear compart - ments, but were concentrated around nuclear organelles, nucleoli and other small nucl eolar accessory bodies, that are connected to each other by proteins such as fibrillarin [48,49]. This property, that is probably due to the absence of a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS), means that in their present form R2DBDs are unable to reach the rRNA genes in the nucleoli in vivo. There are ways to circumvent both problems inde - pendently. Firstly, the localization of R2DBD in nucleoli can be deter - mined by adding an NoLS at its N- or C-terminal ends, as described in [50]. Secondly, the potential affinity for the surface of nuclear organ - elles could be eliminated by screening a library of punctually mutated R2DBDs, using a single or a two yeast-hybrid system to locate mutants that have lost the ability to interfere, for example, with fibrillarin. This second point still needs t o be engineered after adding a NoLS at one end of R2DBD. Even if it is relatively simple to think up ways of doing this, the implementation of such mutant screening will require considerable investment, since the properties of several mutants that do not assemble around nuclear organelles, will all need to be verified in order to iden - tify one or more optimal DBD candidates. Unexploited properties of R2DBD Previous studies [28,34] have together demonstrated that R2DBD is able to bind specifically to a 20-bp rRNA target. The findings reported here indicate that R2DBD has no dual DNA binding activities, i.e. one DNA binding activity with high affinity for its 20-bp target, and a sec - ond activity characterized by the absence of specificity and low binding affinity. Indeed, we observed that R2DBD expressed alone in vivo does not inhibit the DNA plasmid integrations by transposition and recombi- nation (Figure. 5g), and does not hamper the luciferase expression from a plasmid. The absence of dual DNA binding activities is not common in either natural or synthetic DBDs. Hence, the three DBDs used here to be fused to R2DBD, LexA, pZFD bcr-abl and N57SB, were also found to be able to interact non-specifically in vivo with plasmids that do not contain their specific binding target (Figure. 5h and S3). For LexA and N57SB DBDs, our observations confirm observations already reported in the literature, even though there are few such examples [43,51]. In the case of pZFD bcr-abl, this was a priori not expected for a tetra-ZF do - main, although dual DNA binding activities had already been identified for pZFDs bigger than tri-ZF. The objective of most molecular methods so far developed to obtain pZFDs is to produce tailored tri-ZFs. Fused to a nuclease or a recombinase catalytic domain, such tri-ZFs are suf - ficient to bind to a 18-bp binding target by dimerizing two ZF-nuclease or ZF-recombinase monomers [52]. Few molecular methods have been developed to manufacture hexa- and nona-ZF monomers to bind to 18- and 30-bp motifs, [53-56]. If tailored hexa- and nona-ZF monomers have nM affinity for their binding target, their or - ganization into several blocks of di- or tri-ZF means that they are also able to bind with a lower affinity to smaller motifs similar to submotifs contained in their specific 18- and 30-bp DNA target. In an eukary - otic genome, the ability of a hexa-ZF monomer to recognize a unique, 18-bp chromosomal motif is therefore going to be a balance between its specificity for its target and its ability to bind with lower affinity to hexa- and nona-bp motifs that are much more abundant in eukaryoticgenomes. These features of the pZFDs greater than tri-ZF explain why we found here that pZFD bcr-abl is able to interact non-specifically in vivo with plasmids that do not contain its binding site (S3). Overall, these observations suggest that R2DBDs may have two very interesting properties for certain biotechnological purposes re - quiring highly specific DNA binding of a 20-bp target. First, R2DBDs seem to be unable to bind non-specifically to DNA. Second, R2DBDs seem unable to bind to DNA submotifs contained in the sequence of its 20-bp rDNA target. The 3D structure of R2DBDs is probably respon- sible for their binding as a single block to the 20-bp rDNA target. To target one specific chromosomal locus requires that only one 18-bp DNA motif in eukaryote genomes is recognized. This means thatpZFD monomers designed to target DNA motifs of at least 12-bp can-not ensure the uniqueness of their binding to their target as reliably asR2DBDs do to their 20-bp rDNA target. The core structure of R2DBDsconsists of one associated with a Myb-like sub-domain [28,29] (Figure . 1d). Starting from the R2DBD backbone, it might therefore be of interest to develop the molecular engineering of a new type of monomeric DBDs that would be tailored to the 20-bp target sequenceto which they have to bind. The design of molecular methods to selectCitation: Bigot Y, Carnus E, Demattei MV, Casteret S, Carpentier G, et al.

Gene Technol Page 12 of 14 Gene Technol ISSN: GNT, an open access journal Volume 1 Issue 1 1000101such tailored R2DBD derivatives might be faci litated by the fact that the ZF structure in R2DBD (modeled using I-TASSER [57]) is very similar to that used to design tailored ZF. Using data from the ZiFit database, it should therefore be possible to fit this ZF moiety to the nucleotide trip - let to which it binds [21], and so \"only\" have to design a selection pro - cedure on the Myb-like sub-domain. Myb-like sub-domains are com - posed of 3 main helices in which only the third is involved in DNA binding [29]. Obtaining a crystal structure of an R2DBD bound to its 20-bp DNA target should help to confirm the viability of this ap proach. Alternatives to fusion peptides to target vectors Data recovered here about the functioning of the LexA, pZFDbcr- abl and N57SB confirm the need to have rigorous control procedures in place before attempting to use a protein domain in a synthetic pep- tide system. Nevertheless, our experience with such peptides suggests that these controls will very probably be far from sufficient to control the targeting. Indeed, whatever integration process is used (i.e. HR or transposition) and whatever locus is targeted (rRNA genes or other loci), the localization of the plasmid in the vicinity of the locus into which it must be targeted is going to depend to a large extent on the balance between two parameters: the peptide expression rate in the cell and the amount of plasmid able to reach the nuclei. A third parameter is that this balance is going to be complicated by the fact that the plasmid transfection efficiency is going to vary over about 4 orders of magnitude in a single cell population (this is strongly suggested by data obtained from the FACS analysis of a cell population transfected with a plasmid expressing the GFP). To date, although the third parameter seems to be difficult to control, the transfection of a pre-assembled complex (plasmid-targeting peptide) is a technical solution that should be kept in mind, since it could make it possible to circumvent the problems related to the two first parameters. One way to assemble such a complex could be to use a DNA oligonucleotide that is able, on the one hand, to be specifically annealed to the plasmid [10], and on the other hand, to be bound or cross-linked to a DBD. In such a procedure, the oligo - nucleotide might first be annealed to the plasmid. Depending on the presence of a biotin or SH group grafted at one end of the -oligonucle - otide, a streptavidin-DBD peptide or a polyNQ-DBD peptide might be then bound or chemically cross-linked to the oligonucleotide/plasmid complex. The efficiency to anneal the oligonucleotide onto a plasmid, and of the binding of a monovalent streptavidin to a biotin [58], or of the cross-linking with the Sulfo-EMCS cross-linker between a SH group and a polyNQ tail mean that this might be a viable solution. As previously pointed out, even if it is relatively simple to think up such solutions, their implementation will require considerable investment. Conclusion R2DBDs are promising candidates to target DNA molecules in the immediate vicinity of the rRNA genes since they i) specifically recog - nize, with high affinity, a 20-bp binding site located within the expected genomic rDNA target, ii) act as monomers, iii) contain a nuclear lo - calization signal, iv) remain functional when fused to another domain and, v) do not alter the functionality of the protein to which they are fused. However, R2DBDs have two properties remain to be engineered before these DBDs can be integrated into a molecular targeting system directed into rRNA genes. The first concerns the ability of R2DBD to locate within the nucleolus, the organelle in which the rRNA genes re - side. The second is the tendency of R2DBD to accumulate in certain parts of the nuclei, which limits its diffusion within nuclei. Technologi - cal solutions are available to engineer these DBDs. The results reported here also supply important information concerning the R2DBD prop - erties and the plasmid DNA targeting within nuc lei that will need to be further analyzed from three aspects; the unexploited advantages of the R2DBDs, the possibilities and limitations of fusion peptides for tar - geting integrations of non-viral vector, and the alternatives to fusion peptides for targeting vectors.
