It's a time when many people clean and declutter their physical spaces, but it can also be a great time to clean out our mental space by eliminating the clutter that bogs down our minds. While physical clutter may look like papers or laundry tossed around the room, mental clutter refers to the barrage of silent self-talk or thoughts that can pull us away from staying calm, clear, and grounded. This self-talk may include ruminating about to-do lists, rehashing old conversations, or wondering what your friends might be doing without you. We all have inner chatter. It's a quality that, as far as we know, is unique to us as humans. However, if we don't know how to manage it, that chatter can negatively clutter our internal world and impact our daily life. In fact, according to Dr. Ethan Kross, psychologist and author of the book Chatter, lingering mental clutter can cause trouble at work and friction in relationships, and even disrupt our sleep. According to Dr. Kross, a variety of tools can help us clean up an overloaded mental inbox. For example, research supports coaching yourself through a problem like you would coach a friend, using your own name as you speak to yourself, or considering a distanced \"fly on the wall\" perspective of your experience. While these techniques help, they require an underlying ability to first notice the self-talk and not get tangled up in it. Meditation is a powerful way to strengthen your ability to notice when mental clutter is building\u2014and encourages us to harness our mental broom to clear a path for a fresh perspective. Try this \"spring cleaning for the mind\" meditation and see how separating our thoughts from ourselves and anchoring to a nurturing breath can create a calmer inner space.
