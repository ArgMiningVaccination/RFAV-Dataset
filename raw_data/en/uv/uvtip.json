It is known as yauvanpidika or mukh dushika in Ayurveda. It is common on the face, cheeks, nose, chest, upper back and neck. Acne occurs when there is a blocking of the skin pores due to oils, dust, and dead skin cells that are deposited on the skin's surface. Factors responsible for acne can be many including poor diet, hormonal changes, oil deposition, and bacterial infections. According to Ayurveda it is caused by the vitiation of vata and kapha dosha. While acne is not physically painful, it can be mentally difficult, especially for your growing teen who already faces so much peer pressure. And because it's often present on the face, there's not much a teen can do about it. Acne can lead to low self esteem and inhibition in kids, a feeling that they are inadequate, and not as cool as the other kids. Teens may not always express how they feel about themselves when they suffer from acne - often they withhold their emotions, and just retreat to their bedrooms every chance they get. Sometimes parents have to resort to strong drugs to try and clear up their child's skin, leaving the teen to feel like they are diseased and, once again, not like the others. Acne medications come with possible side effects and they don't really treat the root cause, only suppress the symptoms. Once you get off the medication, the acne is likely to return, and sometimes worse than before. Fortunately, there are natural treatments that have been shown to be highly effective when used properly and over time. Ayurveda has a list of effective natural remedies, many of which you can prepare with ingredients you already have in your pantry. I'd like to share these with you in the hope that you give natural treatments a try before resorting to drugs to treat acne. Ayurvedic Diet for Treatment of Acne * Drink 8--10 glasses of pure water every day. * Avoid dairy products, as dairy is often a major contributor to acne-type skin inflammation. * Carrot, oranges, pumpkins and other vitamin A-rich vegetables and carotene-rich food are good for acne treatment and prevention. * Eat only unprocessed food. Avoid white flour foods. * Avoid fatty, deep fried, and high sugar content foods. * Eat vegetables and fruits rich in zinc as they are very effective in acne treatments. Home Remedies for Acne Turmeric and sandalwood paste are useful in treating acne. Fenugreek leaf (methi leaves) paste is an effective and safe acne treatment. Apply it every night and wash the affected area with the lukewarm water when dried. Lavender essential oil, orange peel paste, cucumber paste, and aloe vera juice prevent acne growth. Grated potato can be applied on affected areas for reduction in inflammation. A mixture of turmeric powder and mint juice is very effective for acne infected skin areas. Strawberry leaves made into a poultice are also very helpful in treatment of acne. Tomato paste when applied on acne gives relief from inflammation. Lemon juice can be applied on acne affected areas with good results. Garlic paste applied on acne affected areas, as it dries acne leaving no scars. Neem soap should be used for washing the infected area. Feel free to email me for more information on natural acne treatments, or how to prepare any of the above remedies.
