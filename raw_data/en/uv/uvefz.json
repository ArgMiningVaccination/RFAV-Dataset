In the US, the amount of people practicing meditation more than tripled from 2012 to 2017. While meditation has a rich cultural history in countries like India, China, and Japan, it's becoming increasingly popular in the Western world \u2014 and with good reason. Meditation can have extensive mental and physical health benefits, and you need less than 10 minutes alone each day to do it. It might seem difficult to get started and keep up a routine, but the following guide breaks it down for beginners. What is meditation? Meditation isn't about learning how to empty your mind or stop your thoughts. Instead, meditation is the practice of training your attention and focus from a place of non-judgement. Mindfulness meditation is the most common type of meditation in the West \u2014 and perhaps the easiest one to start. [Mindfulness](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/mindfulness) has to do with paying attention to what you're feeling and observing in the present moment. If the main idea of meditation is to be present and aware of your thoughts and feelings, mindfulness is the ongoing practice of honing that awareness and reconnecting to what we do and why we do it. For example, if you're totally immersed in a single task, and not thinking about the past or imagining the future, you're being mindful. Or, if you go for a walk and feel lost in nature, becoming attuned to the chirping birds or falling leaves, you're also being mindful. In other words: meditation isn't the only way to be mindful. On the other hand, meditation is the intentional practice of mindfulness. Instead of focusing on nature or a specific task, you're focusing on each inhale and exhale of your breathing. This type of [mindful breathing is an important](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/why-is-mindful-breathing-important) and useful way to anchor your focus in the present moment. How to meditate To learn how to meditate effectively, it's helpful to have some guidance. Click to play our audio meditation guides in the background as you start your practice. Try the two-minute meditation first, and once you feel comfortable, try the five-minute and 10-minute meditations. 2-minute guided meditation 5-minute guided meditation 10-minute guided meditation [Mindfulness meditation](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/mindfulness-meditation) can be done anywhere that you can focus. Here are a few steps to help you meditate: - Find a quiet space. Make sure there is nothing to disturb you before you start meditation. Turn your phone on silent and go into a room away from others. - Sit in a comfortable position. You can sit on top of a cushion or blanket, on the floor or in a chair. Sit upright, but don't tense up \u2014 your body should feel relaxed. - Breathe gently. Focus your attention on each inhale and exhale. Alternatively, you can begin with a body scan: focus on each part of the body, down from your toes and up to your head, pausing to notice the sensations. - Let distractions come and go. If your mind wanders, acknowledge the thought that has distracted you, but do not dwell on it. Then, gently bring your attention back to your breathing. Getting distracted when meditating is inevitable and one of the biggest worries for beginners \u2014 but learning how to manage distraction is a vital part of the process. Meditating for just five to 10 minutes each day is an achievement to be proud of. Some people like to meditate for as long as 30 minutes to 45 minutes once they become more experienced, but there are benefits even with short amounts of practice. Building a meditation habit Building a meditation habit is important if you want to gain all the benefits that the practice has to offer. Meditate at the same time daily If possible, try to meditate at the same time every day, as this will help you build a habit so you build meditation into your daily schedule. And if you have to skip a day for whatever reason, don't be too hard on yourself \u2014 just try to get back to your routine the next day. Some people choose to meditate every morning, right after they wake up. [Morning meditation](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/morning-meditation) is a staple of some successful entrepreneurs' schedules, and it can help improve your focus and clarity for the day ahead. Others choose to meditate right before they go to sleep, as it can promote relaxation and help your drift off easier. [ Meditation for sleep](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/sleep-meditation) is a bit different than in the day, as you normally wouldn't want to fall asleep as a result of your practice. In a [2021 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8603170/) of meditation app users, researchers found that people who used the app at the same time every day were more likely to continue using the meditation app. The research also suggested that establishing the habit of using the app at the same time every day may have made the act of meditation easier and more beneficial for people, since they could focus all their cognitive resources on the meditation, rather than making the time or space meditate. Create an ideal space for meditation As James Clear writes in his book Atomic Habits, making the [desired habit visible](https://jamesclear.com/power-of-environment) while [removing any obstacles](https://jamesclear.com/environment-design-organ-donation) in your environment is an important tool for forming the habit. So if you want to form a meditation practice, create an environment associated with meditation. Maybe you have a meditation room or nook that's free from distractions such as your phone or television, with a comfortable seat or cushion for meditating. Each time you meditate, do it here. Make meditating easy Another way to help yourself build a desired habit is to [make the habit easy](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/changing-habits/). Meditating for more than 10 minutes might seem like a challenge at first, but meditating for two minutes while you wait for your coffee to brew is much more doable. Keep doing this every day, and you might find that you've formed a habit. Now you can try increasing the amount of time you spend meditating. Meditation types and techniques On top of your basic mindfulness practice, there are many other different [types of meditation](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/types-of-meditation) you can try.

Here's how: Body scan meditation During a [body scan meditation](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/body-scan-meditation), you'll be focusing on bodily sensations, as opposed to just your breath. For example, you can start at your toes, and take a few moments to focus on how they feel when they're grounded on the floor. Then, move through your legs, chest, arms, shoulders, neck, and head, slowly noticing the sensations of each body part. Body scan meditation can be especially useful for reducing chronic pain or dealing with tension, stress, or trauma. Loving kindness meditation With loving kindness meditation, the aim is to direct feelings of compassion towards yourself and others. It's easy to add this on to any basic mindfulness meditation. For example, instead of just focusing on your breath, try thinking about someone else in your head. Then, say this phrase aloud: \"May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe.\" You can direct these positive thoughts toward yourself, someone you love, or someone you don't particularly like at the moment.
