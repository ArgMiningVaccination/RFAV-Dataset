We use traditional chiropractic to help heal the body and to help you feel your best. Our approach is very much a hands-on approach to chiropractic. This gives our doctors the best opportunity to pinpoint exactly where you need treatment. What Is Chiropractic? Chiropractic is a type of medical profession that helps to diagnose and treat mechanical disorders related to the muscular and skeletal systems, with a particular focus on the spine and its relevance to associated anatomical structures. The spinal cord functions primarily in the transmission of neural signals between the brain and the rest of the body. This mosaic of circuitry acts as a conduit for motor information and response, as well as sensory input and output. What Does Chiropractic Do? The goals of traditional chiropractic include alleviating irregular muscle contraction, temporary mitigation of pain and an overall improvement in our range of motion. The human body is a sophisticated machine. An intimate understanding of how that machine operates provides us with the capacity to apply manual therapy, especially manipulation of the spine, other joints, and soft tissues, but may also include exercises, health, and lifestyle discussion. In no way does this diminish the marvels of modern medicine - it simply augments them. Have you ever known an automotive mechanic so articulate in his craft, that he could simply listen to your engine and tell you what is wrong? Well, we listen to your body, we understand the relationships between muscular, skeletal and nervous systems, and how they collaborate to affect general health. Adjusting the specific joints of the spine which cause nerve interference and pain, traditional chiropractic uses only time-tested, proven techniques. Overall animation of any complex organism is directly related to the aggregate dexterity of its every constituent, and as such, dysfunction in one element can translate into the reduced performance of another. A lower back injury from your youth can disrupt your mobility in adulthood, bad posture at your office job may affect your lower back, and a seemingly insignificant, occasional backache might become quite visceral if not addressed. Our Philosophy I feel that using a hands-on approach to traditional chiropractic is what best allows me to best ascertain a patient's true condition, and to provide optimal care to alleviate that condition. This is what I provide for my patients. We offer massage therapy by appointment, physical therapy for work and auto injuries, and nutritional guidance designed to enhance wellness and help you live a more comfortable, pain-free life. "}
