Students are strongly encouraged to get COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots, but they are not required. There is one exception: Maine community college students in some programs may require vaccination against COVID-19 due to requirements at third-party locations, such as student placement sites. On February 8, 2023, the MCCS Board of Trustees voted unanimously to rescind the previous student vaccine protocol requiring on-campus students be vaccinated. The resolution reads: Effective immediately, students at MCCS owned or controlled indoor spaces no longer require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 as a condition of enrollment and attendance in on-campus activities. While lifting this requirement, the Board and MCCS leadership strongly encourage all students to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters and remind all members of our community that if they are ill that they should stay home. Participation in some academic programs may require vaccination against COVID-19 due to the requirements at third-party locations, such as student placement sites. This resolution supersedes the resolution adopted by the MCCS Board of Trustees "}
