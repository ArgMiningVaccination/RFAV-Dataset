Webster's dictionary defines it in part as \"a code of ceremonial forms and courtesies of precedence accepted as proper and correct in official dealings, as between heads of state and diplomatic officials.\" This is the definition upon which we will concentrate. Why is this area important? We need to know the limits God has set. Those who do not learn the protocol concerning spiritual matters will always be moving beyond their measure, stepping beyond the boundaries that God has ordained and moving beyond the areas that the Holy Spirit has given them to move in. As we learn the protocol of the spiritual realm, we will begin to know how to operate without transgressing or moving beyond the area or the measure of the rule that God has given us. If we are to function properly in the Spirit, we must be aware of the ways in which God desires that we move. --- Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/dr-vincent-g-valentyn/message Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/dr-vincent-g-valentyn/support", "sitename": "Poddtoppen", "date": "2023-06-20", "cleaned_text": "What is protocol?
