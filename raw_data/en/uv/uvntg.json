HEARTS Technical Package More people die each year from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) than from any other cause. Over three-quarters of heart disease and stroke-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. The HEARTS technical package provides a strategic approach to improving cardiovascular health. It comprises six modules and an implementation guide. This package supports Ministries of Health to strengthen CVD management in primary care and aligns with WHO's Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN). HEARTS modules are intended for use by policymakers and programme managers at different levels within Ministries of Health who can influence CVD primary care delivery. Different sections of each module are aimed at different levels of the health system and different cadres of workers. All modules will require adaptation at country level. The people who will find the modules most useful are: National level - Ministry of Health NCD policymakers responsible for : oodeveloping strategies, policies and plans related to service delivery of CVD oosetting national targets on CVD, monitoring progress and reporting. Subnational level - Health/NCD programme managers responsible for : ooplanning, training, implementing and monitoring service delivery Primary care level - Facility managers and primary health care trainers responsible for : ooassigning tasks, organising training and ensuring the facility is running smoothly oocollecting facility-level data on indicators of progress towards CVD targets. Target users may vary, based on context, existing health systems and national priorities. 6 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocolsMODULES OF THE HEARTS TECHNICAL PACKAGE Module What does it include?Who are the target users?

Treatment of major CVD risk factors remains suboptimal, and only a minority of patients who are treated reach their target levels for blood pressure, blood sugar and blood cholesterol. In other areas, overtreatment can occur with the use of non-evidence-based protocols. The aim of using standard treatment protocols is to improve the quality of clinical care, reduce clinical variability and simplify the treatment options, particularly in primary health care. Standard treatment protocols can be developed by preparing new national treatment guidelines or by adapting or adopting international guidelines. The Evidence-based protocols module uses hypertension and diabetes screening and treatment as an entry point to control cardiovascular risk factors, prevent target organ damage, and reduce premature morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive risk- based approach for integrated management of hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol is included in the Risk-based CVD management module. This module includes clinical practice points and sample protocols for: 1. hypertension detection and treatment 2. type 2 diabetes detection and treatment 3. identifying basic emergencies - care and referral. HEARTS emphasizes adaptation, dissemination, and use of a standardized set of simple clinical-management protocols, which should be drug- and dose-specific, and include a core set of medications. The simpler the protocols and management tools, the more likely they are to be used correctly, and the higher the likelihood that a programme will achieve its goals. The use of a standardized algorithm is critical to success because it: enables task-sharing, with the entire health care team able to support patients increases ease of logistics in terms of drug inventory, drug forecasting, and quality monitoring enables large reductions in cost of medication enables evaluation of impact simplifies implementation of changes to protocols, if needed. Use of module This module is intended for national policymakers, subnational programme managers and primary health care facility managers who are in the position to adapt these protocols and align to the local context. This ensures that just one protocol is used at the national or in some instances subnational level. 9 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocols1 Hypertension detection and treatment All adults should have their blood pressure checked. The treatment protocols provided can be used if the patient is known to have hypertension or is newly diagnosed with hypertension when presenting at the health care facility. When to measure blood pressure Measuring blood pressure is the only way to diagnose hypertension, as most people with raised blood pressure have no symptoms. Blood pressure measurements should be conducted on adults during routine visits to primary health care facilities, including all adults at first presentation to the facility, and, if normal, periodically thereafter (e.g., every 1 to 5 years). Every patient with elevated blood pressure readings requires immediate follow-up, according to the protocol. Blood pressure measurement and control is particularly important in adults who: have had a prior heart attack or stroke have diabetes have chronic kidney disease (CKD) are obese use tobacco have a family history of heart attack or stroke. How to measure blood pressure Effective treatment algorithms for hypertension are dependent on accurate blood pressure measurement. The following advice should be followed for measuring blood pressure (1): Use the appropriate cuff size, noting the lines on the cuff to ensure that it is positioned correctly on the arm. (If the arm circumference is >32 cm, use large cuff.) Although at the initial evaluation it is preferable to measure blood pressure in both arms and use the arm with the higher reading thereafter, this may not be practical in a busy primary care environment. The patient should be sitting with back supported, legs uncrossed, empty bladder, relaxed for 5 minutes and not talking. For persons who are getting their blood pressure measured for the first time, it is preferable to take at least two readings and to use the second reading. Blood pressure can be measured either by a conventional sphygmomanometer, using a stethoscope, or by an automated electronic device. The electronic device, if available, is preferred because it provides more reproducible results and is not influenced by variations in technique or by the bias of the observers. 10 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocolsIf the primary health care facility has electricity or regular access to batteries, then consider an automated validated blood pressure device with a digital reading. If the primary health care facility has no electricity or batteries, then a manual BP cuff will have to be used with a stethoscope. Diagnosing hypertension The diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed at an additional patient visit, usually 1 to 4 weeks after the first measurement. In general, hypertension is diagnosed if, on two visits on different days: systolic blood pressure on both days is 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure on both days is 90 mmHg. Hypertension treatment Who should receive hypertension treatment? Hypertension treatment is indicated for adults diagnosed with hypertension, as defined above (SBP 140 mmHg and/or DBP 90 mmHg). Patients with SBP 160 mmHg or DBP 100 mmHg may be indicated for immediate treatment based on one assessment. Lifestyle counselling (healthy diet, physical activity, tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol) is a critical component of good hypertension management and is often recommended as a first step for patients with blood pressure of SBP 130-139 mmHg and/or DBP 80-89 mmHg (2) who do not have other CVD risk factors. However, in settings where people do not regularly visit the doctor, people who are recommended only lifestyle modification may not return for re-evaluation and needed treatment, resulting in uncontrolled hypertension and associated complications. (See Healthy-lifestyle counselling module for more information on lifestyle counselling.) What medications should be used to treat hypertension? There are four main classes of antihypertensive medications: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, blockers (CCB), and thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. Any of these four classes of antihypertensive medication may be used unless there are specific contraindications. Proper treatment of hypertension usually requires a combination of hypertension medications. Notes on specific hypertension medications Pregnant women and women of childbearing age not on effective contraception should not be given ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics; CCBs should be used. If not controlled with intensification dose of medication, refer to specialist. Beta blockers are not recommended as first-line therapy. If a heart attack has been diagnosed within the previous three years, or there is atrial fibrillation or heart failure, then a beta blocker should be added to the starting dose of antihypertensive medication. Patients with angina may also benefit from treatment with a beta blocker. 11 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocolsTreatment targets For most patients, blood pressure is considered controlled when SBP <140 mmHg and DBP <90 mmHg. However, for patients with diabetes or a high risk of CVD, certain guidelines recommend lower targets: SBP <130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg. Other treatment considerations If there is a prior heart attack or stroke, or the person is otherwise at high risk of CVD, start a statin at the same time as starting antihypertensive medication. (Statins should not be used in women who are or who may become pregnant.) If there is a prior heart attack or ischemic stroke, start low-dose aspirin. The hypertension protocols included in this module serve well for initiation and maintenance of successful treatment. If there are serious adverse events, lack of control of blood pressure, or if a major medical event intervenes, then referral to a specialist will be needed. If the patient is already on another medication regimen, blood pressure is controlled to the target level, and the medications the patient is taking are accessible and affordable, there is no reason to change the regimen. If the patient feels faint on standing, check blood pressure while standing. If the systolic blood pressure is consistently less than 110 mm Hg in a patient on medical treatment, consider reducing the dosage or number of medications used. Treatment adherence Adherence to treatment is critical for blood pressure control. If antihypertensive medication is being prescribed, the following are critical to ensuring adherence: Teach the patient how to take the medications at home. Explain the difference between medicines for long-term control (for example, of blood pressure) and medicines for quick relief (such as for headaches). Explain the reason for prescribing the medicine(s). ooExplain the diagnosis of hypertension. ooDiscuss the asymptomatic nature of hypertension and explain that medications must be taken even if there are no symptoms. ooInform patient of the complications of untreated hypertension, including stroke, heart attack, kidney failure. ooExplain the disability and economic and family burden these preventable complications cause. Show the patient the appropriate dose. Explain how many times a day the patient should take the medication and at what time, and adopt the following simple steps to help them to adhere to the guidelines: ooLabel and package the tablets. ooCheck the patient's understanding before the patient leaves the health centre. ooWherever possible, use once-daily dosages of all medications, to be given at the same time each day. 12 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocols Explain how important it is for the patient to: ooKeep an adequate supply of medications safely at home. ooTake the medicines regularly as advised, even if there are no symptoms. Explain potential adverse effects of the medications and what to do if the patient experiences them. Sample hypertension treatment protocols The following pages outline sample protocols for managing hypertension, each with a different starting medication. Each programme/country should select and then adapt the option that best suits their circumstances. This series of sample protocols represents a range of possible approaches to managing hypertension. Depending on the local preferences, influenced by usual practice, resources and demography, countries may select one or more protocols from this sample to adapt. To assist in the selection of the most suitable option, a non-comprehensive list of advantages and disadvantages is presented in a box relating to each protocol. Selection of a single option greatly facilitates logistics, training, supervision, evaluation, and overall programme implementation. The simpler the protocol, the more likely it is to be followed and to achieve the programme objective. The following sample hypertension protocols have been endorsed by the: World Hypertension League and the International Society of Hypertension 1. Diuretic as first-line treatment (3-11) 2. CCB as first-line treatment (5, 6, 9, 12-17) 3. ACE-I or ARB as first-line treatment (5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18-21) 4. ACE-I or ARB + CCB as first-line treatment (5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 22) 5.

If 140-159 or 90-99, check on a dierent day, and if still elevated, start. ** Smaller, fragile patients should be started on 2.5 mg per day. Alternatively, amlodipine can be replaced with a thiazide diuretic (e.g., chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, indapamide 1.25 mg, or indapamide SR 1.5 mg; if neither chlorthalidone nor indapamide is available, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) or a once-daily angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (e.g., telmisartan 40 mg or losartan 50 mg) or once daily angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) (e.g., lisinopril 20 mg, ramipril 5 mg, perindopril 4 mg). ACE-I and ARB should NOT be given to women who are or who may become pregnant. Before initiating and several weeks after starting a thiazide diuretic, ACE-I, or ARB, check serum creatinine and potassium if possible. If systolic BP repeatedly 110, consider going to prior, less intensive regimen. Indapamide can be used if chlorthalidone is not available (1.25 mg starting dose, 2.5 mg intensi/f_ication; for indapamide SR 1.5 mg, do not increase dose at Step 7). Hydrochlorothiazide can be used if neither of the other diuretic agents is available (25 mg starting dose, 50 mg intensi/f_ication). \u00a4 Hypokalemia is more common using full-dose diuretic - consider regular lab monitoring. If a diuretic is used instead of amlodipine in the initial treatment, this consideration would apply earlier in the protocol. 16 February 2018HYPERTENSION PROTOCOL Adapted example: CCB as /f_irst-line 40 mg single-pill combination regimen as first-line treatment Advantages: Single-pill combination medication increases ease of logistics and reduces patient barriers; Reduces the number of steps in the protocol, increasing the likelihood of control of blood pressure; Reduces number of pills and increases adherence as most patients will require multiple anti-hypertensive medications; Benefits some patients with kidney disease, prior myocardial infarction, and low ejection fraction; Reduced incidence of ankle edema compared to amlodipine use without telmisartan (or other ARBs and ACE-inhibitors).

ACE-I and ARB should NOT be given to women who are or who may become pregnant. Before initiating and several weeks after starting ACE-Is or ARBs check serum creatinine and potassium if possible. \u00a7 Amlodipine can be replaced with another once-daily dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Alternatively, amlodipine can be replaced with chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, indapamide 1.25 mg, or indapamide SR 1.5 mg. If neither chlorthalidone nor indapamide is available, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg can be used. If a diuretic is used instead of amlodipine, check serum potassium if possible and see below. \u00a5 Medications can be used as individual agents if single-pill combinations are not available. ** If BP 160 or 100, start same day. If 140-159 or 90-99, check on a dierent day, and if still elevated, start. If systolic BP repeatedly <110, consider going to prior, less intensive regimen. If a diuretic is used initially instead of amlodipine, then amlodipine or another once-daily dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker would be used at this step. Consider increase to full-dose diuretic (chlorthalidone 25 mg or indapamide 2.5 mg; indapamide SR 1.5 mg is both the start and the full dose). Hypokalemia is more common using full-dose diuretic - consider regular lab monitoring. If a diuretic is used instead of amlodipine in the initial treatment, this consideration would apply earlier in the protocol. 16 February 2018HYPERTENSION PROTOCOL Adapted combination\u00a5 regimen9 312 Diabetes detection and treatment Treatment protocols are for patients in the primary care setting with established or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and are derived from the WHO Package of Essential NCD interventions (27). Diabetes risk factors and symptoms Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include: overweight/obesity physical inactivity having a first-degree relative with diabetes history of gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia history of CVD, HTN, dyslipidaemia, or polycystic ovary syndrome. On average, people have type 2 diabetes (with or without symptoms) for between five and seven years before it is diagnosed. Symptoms of diabetes include: polyuria (excessive passing of urine) polydipsia (excessive thirst) unexplained weight loss polyphagia (excessive hunger) vision changes fatigue. Diagnostic testing for diabetes Test adults who are 40+ years old and who are overweight (BMI >25) or obese (BMI >30)* (28), or follow national guidelines. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is the most practical test for low-resource settings, given its low cost**. HbA1c can also be used, but it is considerably more costly. Plasma glucose two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load (OGTT) can also be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes, but is less practical and more costly. If patient is not fasting and has symptoms, a random plasma glucose (RPG) test can also be performed. It is the least accurate of the diagnostic tests. It is useful to con - firm the diagnosis in person with symptoms; however, a negative test does not rule out the diagnosis of diabetes. * Calculate body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) in all adults. For some populations (e.g., South Asian), weight-associated risks similar to those at a BMI of 25 in Caucasian populations are found at a BMI of approximately 23, and intensify at a BMI of approximately 28. ** Point of care devices can be used in diagnosing diabetes if laboratory services are not available. 32 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocolsDiagnostic values: Test mmol/l mg/dl Fasting blood sugar (FBS)* 7 126 Random plasma glucose (RPG) 11.1 200 Plasma glucose two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load-OGTT11.1 200 mmol/mol % Haemoglobin A1c 48 6.5% Drug therapy Control of blood glucose Metformin is recommended as the first-line drug in the treatment of diabetes. Sulfonylurea is recommended as the second-line treatment, and human insulin as the third-line treatment. Patients may require two or three drugs. Although there are other drug classes usually used as second- and third-line treatment, including thiazolidinediones (TZDs), DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists, these medicines tend to be more costly than metformin, sulfonylurea and insulin, with currently limited evidence of superior effectiveness. They may, however, be considered in the rare cases when treatment with metformin, sulfonylurea, and insulin is not possible. Insulin treatment should be introduced and monitored according to national practices. Control of blood pressure and blood lipids Hypertension treatment is indicated when SBP 130 and/or DBP 80). Statins are recommended for all people with type 2 diabetes older than 40 years, but only if this does not negatively impact access to glucose-lowering and blood pressure- lowering medication. Monitoring glycaemic control If diabetes is diagnosed, monitor glycaemic control every three months until diabetes is controlled, then every six months after that. HbA1c is the most accurate measurement of long-term glycaemic control and represents the average blood glucose over the previous two to three months. HbA1c < 7% is generally considered to be adequate glycaemic control. In people with frequent severe hypoglycaemia, severe complications and low life-expectancy, the goal for HbA1c could be relaxed, e.g. to <8%. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) can also be used to monitor control. Goal for glycaemic control Plasma glucose Fasting 7.0 mmol/l (126mg/dl) * Fasting: no food and only water for 8-14 hours or more before the test. 33 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocolsClinical practice recommendations Provide counselling around lifestyle change, including diet, physical activity and smoking cessation (see Healthy-lifestyle counselling ). Initiate diabetes self-management education to reinforce treatment goals. Prescribe aspirin for patients with CVD. Measure blood pressure at every visit. Treat as per hypertension protocol if 130/80 mmHg. Note : if 130/80 mmHg is chosen as target, then treatment should start if over 130/80 mmHg. Measure weight and calculate BMI at every visit. Take A1c measurements every three to six months; every six months if stable on unchanging treatment. Arrange fasting lipid panel annually if available. Conduct foot exam for amputation risk annually, or every visit if high-risk. Conduct annual urine protein dipstick (microalbuminuria dipstick if available to calculate albumin to serum creatinine measurement (GFR CKD screening. CKD is defined by GFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 OR the presence of moderate or severe albuminuria (albumin-creatinine ratio 30 mg/mmol). Conduct dilated pupils retinal exam every two years if treatment available. Treatment adherence Explain the diagnosis of diabetes. Inform patient of the complications of untreated diabetes. Discuss the possible symptoms of diabetes. Show the patient the appropriate dose. Prescribe once-daily medications, less expensive generics, and longer-lasting supplies of medicine whenever possible. Explain potential adverse effects of the medications and what to do if the patient experiences them. Explain how many times a day the patient should take the medication and at what time, and adopt the following simple steps to help them adhere to the guidelines: ooLabel and package the tablets. ooCheck the patient's understanding before the patient leaves the health centre. Explain to patient how import it is to: ooKeep an adequate supply of medications safely at home. ooTake the medicines regularly as advised, even if there are no symptoms. Provide tools such as pill boxes and medication logs to help patients remember to take their medications. Assess adherence and discuss barriers at every visit. Reconcile clinician's medication list with patient's list, adjust dose, and eliminate unneeded medications. 34 HEARTS: Evidence-based treatment protocolsDIABETES PROTOCOL Type 2 diabetes management protocol derived from WHO-PEN (27, 29) FPG/RPG >18 2-3 monthsNo improvement ImprovementBEGIN gliclazide 80 mg bid & counsel on diet modi/f_ication, physical activity and adherence to medicinesREVIEW IN 3 MONTHS If goal not achieved BEGIN METFORMIN 500 mg once daily.

Morbidity from acute exacerbations of cardiovascular disease (including but not limited to hypertensive crisis, heart attack, stroke, and diabetic ketoacidosis) can be very time-dependent. Early recognition, resuscitation and referral of patients with acute cardiovascular emergencies is essential. All providers delivering primary care for cardiovascular conditions should: 1. Know the nearest appropriate higher-level facilities for referral of acute cardiovascular emergencies. 2. Understand how to approach the person with acute difficulty in breathing, shock, or altered mental status (such as that taught in the WHO Basic Emergency Care course). 3. Screen each patient for danger signs that would suggest the need for immediate referral. (This screening may take 2-3 minutes in patients without acute symptoms.
