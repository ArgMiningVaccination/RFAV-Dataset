The couple's interest in supporting integrative medicine at University Hospitals grew from Sara's background in alternative and complementary healing. An occupational therapist by training, Sara is also a Reiki master and advocate of ancient healing therapies such as acupuncture and acupressure. Over the years, she and several family members benefited from complementary therapies; as a result, Sara and Chris wanted to help others access optimal health and relaxation treatments. They knew that people would be more open to holistic therapies if they were offered through University Hospitals, a respected medical center. Their generous gift sparked the creation of University Hospitals Connor Whole Health in 2011 and has since made a profound impact on the health and wellbeing of UH patients, employees and community members. Chris, former CEO of The Sherwin-Williams Company, credits his wife with the initial idea of supporting integrative medicine at UH; but he quickly came on board and is an enthusiastic supporter. \"Once I learned of the potential of Sara's idea and saw the interest and support of so many UH leaders, I began to share her vision,\" says Chris, who has held numerous volunteer leadership positions with UH, including chair of the UH Board where he continues to serve as a director. \"People are searching for more than just purely medical solutions to their health problems,\" adds Sara. \"They want therapies that focus on their psychological and spiritual well-being, too. We are proud to share our passion for integrative medicine through UH Connor Whole Health.\" To support "}
