Research shows global demand for Ayurvedic beauty products is booming, as more consumers seek natural ingredients and restorative rituals. I started enjoying Ayurvedic products after a foray into Forest Essentials, a hugely popular luxury line in India, founded by Mira Kulkarni, who created the brand from scratch by hand-making soaps. Now she has a new store in Covent Garden, with more UK openings scheduled. Being completely candid, it was the colourful boxes, adorned with the goddess Lakshmi perched on a lotus, that caught my eye. I also loved the authentic scents that reminded me of my trips to the spice markets in Delhi and the magical, misty countryside of Darjeeling. But it was the [Ayurvedic Eternal Youth Formula Date & Litchi](https://forestessentials.co.uk) (\u00a374) that helped me start to appreciate Ayurvedic efficacy. It's made with sweet almond oil, and features date extract, which has antioxidant and smoothing properties, and litchi (lychee) extract to rev glow, as well as fenugreek seed for its anti-inflammatory action. Used at night, it leaves skin satiny smooth. 'Skin is alive and we believe beauty products should be made from \"living\" substances,' says Kulkarni. 'Ideally, you would prepare your own fresh concoctions using seasonal ingredients and following ancient recipes. In today's fast-paced world, we offer a \"next-to-best\" option, for example herbs that are sun-dried and flowers picked at peak potency and hand-pounded, with blends based on an ancient Sanskrit treatise.' Left to right: The Soothing Hydrating Toner Eternal Youth Formula Date (\u00a374, [forestessentials.co.uk](https://www.forestessentials.co.uk/ayurvedic-eternal-youth-formula-date-litchi.html)); Nourishing Night Face Oil (\u00a387, [almorabotanica.com](https://almorabotanica.com/products/restorative-night-face-oil)) In a nutshell, the theory of Ayurveda spans five elements: air, water, space, earth and fire. These interact to form three 'doshas' or life forces of the body - vata (air and space), pitta (fire and water) and kapha (water and earth). Ayurveda practice rests on the idea that each person leans towards a dominant dosha, shaping your character and constitution, thereby indicating the best approaches for your well-being. As far as skincare is concerned, a vata skin type tends to be dry, rough and shows signs of ageing easily, so benefits from regular deep nourishment and hydration. Pitta skin is prone to warmth and redness, so responds to cooling, anti-inflammatory ingredients, while kapha skin is often oily and dull, so purifying products are go-to remedies. For help identifying your own dosha, [urbanveda.com](https://www.urbanveda.com/gb/) has a useful diagnostic quiz. I came out mostly pitta (intelligent and charismatic... how accurate), but also had a lot of vata in the mix. The [Soothing Hydrating Toner](https://urbanveda.com) (\u00a312.99) helped calm my complexion, while the Soothing Clarifying Night Cream (\u00a319.99) was comforting. In Ayurvedic beauty, rituals are also important. For instance, 'abhyanga' (self-massage with oils) not only keeps skin supple but promotes inner balance. For facial massage, new brand Almora Botanica has sublime oils such as [Nourishing Night Face Oil](https://almorabotanica.com) (\u00a387). While understanding doshas can help inform your choice of products, according to Kulkarni, it's not a prerequisite for beginning your self-care routine - simply tuning into how your skin looks and feels will guide you: 'Ayurveda is a wonderful journey of discovery, not a passing trend. A philosophy that crosses generations and cultures.' Try these... Fable & Mane HoliRoots Hair Oil To strengthen hair from the top down, apply to dry hair and scalp as a pre-wash once a week. Result?
