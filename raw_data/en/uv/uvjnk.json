This one day called Menopause is the cessation of menstruation for one year, and the average age of onset is 52. Just as we have education for our girls about the onset of puberty, we as women can fearlessly educate ourselves about the onset of menopause and the years leading up to it (peri-menopause), rather than resisting this natural biological occurrence. Better yet, we can balance and heal leading up to it. This webinar will discuss what you can do and how to balance your body during peri-menopause (5-15 years before the onset of menopause). This is a time when women's bodies go through a series of complex changes that affects everyone differently on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels. These changes during peri-menopause can create more imbalance in the woman's body and life than the actual event menopause. We must collectively and individually reframe what these years are about for us and not buy into societal renderings and depictions of a woman's worth regarding her age. We can be empowered about it by understanding that this is a phase where we can consciously move into our wholeness more than ever before. It is a natural shift that happens from our outward focus towards our family, career, and caretaking when we are younger that turns inward towards our growth and healing, and purpose as we age. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, menopause is called a \"Second Spring\" and it represents this renewal of opportunities and energy. It's the trading-in of the reproductive energy for wisdom and a greater connection to one's spiritual purpose in life. In Chinese Medicine, when our bodies cease menstruation, the qi and blood can then be redirected to our Heart, where our \"Shen\" or Spirit resides. This next half of a woman's life can be conscious, intentional, courageous and creative. Let's take our heads out of the sand, let go of the past, and create forward movement and intentionally in our lives.
