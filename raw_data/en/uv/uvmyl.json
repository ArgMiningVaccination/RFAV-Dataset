If the county auditor concludes that the information on the application (( matches the information maintained by the department of licensing )) describes the person on the depart - ment of licensing record , the county auditor (( may)) must override the (( automated )) computerized failure to verify and must note the reason it is considered a match. The county auditor must place the applicant on the official list of regis - tered voters in active status. (5) (( If the applicant's driver's license or state identifica - tion number cannot be considered a match, the county auditor must attempt to contact the applicant to resolve the discrep - ancy, as required by RCW 29A.08.107.

Consistent with RCW 29A.08.110, the applicant is considered registered as of the original date of mailing or date of delivery, whichever is applicable. )) If the applicant's iden - tity is not verified in the computerized verification process, the applicant must be placed on th e official list of registered voters in active status, but the registration record must be flagged as still requiring verification of the applicant's iden - tity before the applicant's ballot may be counted.

(1) At the time of licensing, a trainer must pay industrial insur - ance premiums established by labor and industries, unless exempted under WAC 260-36-240. (2) A trainer must pay an industrial insurance premium for exercise riders based upon the number of stalls the trainer has on the grounds of a racing association, or upon the regis - tration papers in the race office, whichever is greater. In the event the number of stalls a trainer has on the grounds or the registration papers in the race office are unavailable, the number of industrial insurance premiums for exercise riders will be based upon the number of stalls or papers in the race office from the previous year. The calculation of exercise rider industrial insurance premiums for trainers at Class C racetracks is the total horses unde r that trainer at all the Class C racetracks. The number of exercise riders for which a trainer is required to pay industrial insurance premiums will be determined as follows: (a) For zero to twelve stalls on the grounds or papers in the race office, a trainer must pa y an industrial insurance pre - mium for one exercise rider; (b) For thirteen to twenty-four stalls on the grounds or papers in the race office, a tr ainer must pay an industrial insurance premium for two exercise riders; (c) For twenty-five to thirty-six stalls on the grounds or papers in the race office, a tr ainer must pay an industrial insurance premium for thr ee exercise riders; and (d) For thirty-seven or more stalls on the grounds or papers in the race office, a tr ainer must pay an industrial insurance premium for fo ur exercise riders. (3) If the trainer increases th e number of horses or stalls during the license year, the traine r must pay the exercise rider industrial insurance premiums as provided in subsection (2)(a) through (d) of this section.

The trainer must pay twenty percent of the trainer base premium, and twenty per - cent for each groom slot obtained, assistant trainer hired, and each exercise rider as requir ed in WAC 260-36-220 (all rounded to the next whole dolla r). The base premium used for this calculation will be the industrial insurance premiums for Class A or B race meets. A trainer may only purchase Class A or B race meet shor t duration coverage for three seven-day periods per calendar year. (b) Trainers who ship in to Class C race meets may pur - chase short duration industrial insurance coverage for seven consecutive calendar days. The trainer must pay twenty per - cent of the trainer base premiu m, and twenty percent of each groom slot obtain ed, assistant trainer hi red, and each exercise rider as required in WAC 260-36-220 (all rounded to the next whole dollar).

Central Washington University will admit qualified students who meet the published admissions criteria for any quarter. Admission to the university is based on the student's ability to successfully complete programs offered by the university. Eligibility for admission as a first- time freshman is based on eviden ce of potential success in university study. Eligibility for (( regular )) initial admission as a freshman will be guided by the following situations: Situation 1: (( Regular )) Initial admission of (( freshman under twenty-one years of age. Eligibility for regular admis - sion as a freshman for those twenty-one years of age or younger )) freshmen will be determined using both the stu - dent's high school grade point average and a nationally normed standardized test, either the (( American College Test ())ACT(( ))), or the (( Scholastic Aptitude Test ( ))SAT(( ))). The high school grade point average and test score will be combined to produce, for each freshman applicant, an admis - sion index number. An offer of acceptance to the university as a freshman will be based on the resulting index number. The minimum index number established by the higher educa - tion coordinating board for the three regional universities and The Evergreen State College for regular admission is 13. A 13 index indicates that applicants have at least a sixty-five percent probability of achieving a \"C\" or better grade point average at the completion of th eir freshman year at Central Washington University. Freshman applicants must have pre - scribed set of high school courses totaling fifteen units. The required high school courses include: Four years of English, three years of math, two years of science, three years of social studies, two years of single foreign language, and one year of fine, visual or performing arts, or an additional year of any of the above college-prep courses. ((Situation 2: Regular admi ssion of freshmen twenty- one years of age or older. A st udent twenty-one years of age or older who is seeking initial entry at the freshman level may be offered regular admission if the student obtained a score of at least eighteen on the Enhanced ACT Exam or seven hun - dred minimum on the SAT Exam, or he or she has scored at least an eighty-three or higher on WPCT if they took that exam prior to June 1, 1989. )) Situation (( 3)) 2: Alternate standards for freshman admissions. Students (( seeking freshman admission )) who are not admissible through the initial admissions process may be admitted through the (( use of alternative criteria. Students applying under the alternative standard must satisfy each of the following requirements: (1) Submit a score on the ACT or SAT; (2) Submit a transcript showing achievement of a 2.0 or higher high school grade point average and/or a passing score on the General Education Development Test; (3) Complete high school course pattern requirements as prescribed with no more than th ree subject year deficiencies waived; and (4) Present evidence of success outside the classroom and strong motivation to succeed in college )) comprehensive review process.

Applicants who have earned mo re than forty transferable quarter credits will be admitted based on the quality of col - lege work only. If transcript s do not provide evidence of aca - demic ability, regardless of the grade point average, addi - tional information may be required. Central Washington Un iversity accepts academic credits earned at other accredit ed collegiate institutions which are essentially equivalent in acade mic level and nature of work offered at CWU. The university endorses the policy in the Intercollegiate Transfer and Articulation Agreement among Washington public colleges and universities. ((Transfer students who have not earned a Washington community college academic asso ciate of arts degree will be admitted on sliding scale.

(4) What information does the annual survey require? The annual survey reques ts information about the following: (a) Amount of tax deferred, the amount of B&O tax exempted, the amount of B&O tax credit taken, or the amount of B&O tax reduced under the preferential rate; (b) The number of new products or research projects by general classification; (c) The number of trademarks, patents, and copyrights associated with activities at the investment project. (d) The following information for employment positions in Washington: (i) The total number of employment positions; (ii) Full-time, part-time, and temporary employment positions as a percent of total employment. Refer to subsec - tion (7) of this section for in formation about full-time, part- time, and temporary employment positions; (iii) The number of employm ent positions according to the wage bands of less than $ 30,000; $30,000 or greater, but less than $60,000; and $60,000 or greater. A wage band con - taining fewer than three individuals may be combined with the next lowest wage band; and (iv) The number of employment positions that have employer-provided medical, dental, and retirement benefits, by each of the wage bands; and (e) Additional information the department requests that is necessary to measure the re sults of the tax adjustments. (i) The department is required to report to the state legis - lature summary descriptive statistics by category and the effectiveness of the tax adjus tments, such as job creation, company growth, and such other factors as the department selects or as the statutes id entify. The department has included questions related to measuring these effects. (ii) In addition, the department has included questions related to: (A) The person's use of the sales and use tax exemption for machinery and equipment used in manufacturing pro - vided in RCW 82.08.02565 and 82.12.02565; and (B) The Unified Business Iden tifier used with the Wash - ington state employme nt security department and all employ - ment security department re ference numbers used on quar - terly tax reports that cover the employment positions reported in the annual survey. (5) What is total employment in the annual survey? (a) The annual survey requi res information on all full- time, part-time, and temporary employment positions located in Washington state on December 31st of the calendar year covered by the report. Total employment includes persons who are on leaves of absence su ch as sick leave, vacation, disability leave, jury duty, mil itary leave, and workers com - pensation leave, re gardless of whethe r those persons are receiving wages. Total empl oyment does not include separa - tion from employment such as layoffs or reductions in force. Vacant positions are not incl uded in total employment. (b) Examples. Assume these facts for the following examples. National Construction Equipment (NCE) manu - factures bulldozers, cranes, and other earth-moving equip -ment in Ridgefield, WA and Kennewick, WA. NCE received a deferral of taxes under chapter 82.60 RCW for sales and use taxes on its new manufacturing site in Kennewick, WA. (i) NCE employs two hundred workers in Ridgefield manufacturing construction cranes. NCE employs two hun - dred fifty workers in Kennewick manufacturing bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment. Although NCE's facility in Ridgefield does not qualify for any tax adjustments, NCE's annual survey must report a total of four hundred fifty employment positions. The an nual survey includes all Wash - ington state employment positions, which includes employ - ment positions engaged in activities that do not qualify for tax adjustments. (ii) On November 20th, NCE lays off seventy-five work - ers. NCE notifies ten of th e laid off workers on December 20th that they will be rehired and begin work on January 2nd. The seventy-five employment positions are excluded from NCE's annual survey, because a separation of employment has occurred. Although NCE intends to rehire ten employ - ees, those employment positions are vacant on December 31st. (iii) On December 31st, NC E has one hundred employ - ees on vacation leave, five em ployees on sick leave, two employees on military leave, one employee who is scheduled to retire as of January 1st, and three vacant employment posi - tions. The employmen t positions of employees on vacation, sick leave, and military leave must be included in NCE's annual survey. The one employ ee scheduled to retire must be included in the annual survey because the employment posi - tion is filled on December 31st. The three vacant positions are not included in the annual survey. (iv) In June, NCE hires two employees from a local col - lege to intern in its engineering department. When the aca - demic year begins in September, one employee ends the internship. The other employee's internship continues until the following June. NCE must report one employment posi - tion on the annual survey, representing the one intern employed on December 31st. (6) When is an employment position located in Wash - ington state? The annual survey s eeks information about Washington employment positions only. An employment position is located in Washington state if: (a) The service of the employee is performed entirely within the state; (b) The service of the employ ee is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the empl oyee's service within the state; (c) The service of the employee is performed both within and without the state, and the employee's base of operations is within the state; (d) The service of the employ ee is performed both within and without the state, but the serv ice is directed or controlled in this state; or (e) The service of the employee is performed both within and without the state and the service is not directed or con - trolled in this state, but the employee's individual residence is in this state. (f) Examples. Assume these facts for the following examples. Acme Computer, In c. develops computer soft - ware and claims the B&O tax credit provided by RCW Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-064 [ 37 ] Proposed82.04.4452 for its research and development spending. Acme Computer, headquartered in California, has employees working at four locations in Washington state. Acme Com - puter also has offices in Oregon and Texas. (i) Ed is a software engineer in Acme Computer's Van - couver office. Ed occasionall y works at Acme Computer's Portland, Oregon office when othe r software engineers are on leave. Ed's position must be included in the number of total employment in Washington state that Acme Computer reports on the annual survey. Ed performs services both within and without the state, but the services performed with - out the state are incidental to the employee services within Washington state. (ii) John is an Acme Computer salesperson. John travels throughout Washington, Oregon, and Idaho promoting sales of new Acme Computer products. John's activities are directed by his manager in Acme Computer's Spokane office. John's position must be included in the number of total employment in Washington state that Acme Computer reports on the annual survey. John performs services both within and without the state, bu t the services are directed or controlled in Washington state. (iii) Jane, vice-president for product development, works in Acme Computer's Portland, Oregon office. Jane regularly travels to Seattle to review the progress of research and development projects conducted in Washington state. Jane's position must not be included in the number of total employ - ment in Washington state that Acme Computer reports on the annual survey. Although Jane regularly performs services within Washington state, her activities are directed or con - trolled in Oregon. (iv) Roberta, a service techni cian, travels th roughout the United States servicing Acme Computer products. Her activ - ities are directed from Acme Co mputer's corporate offices in California, but she works from her home office in Tacoma. Roberta's position must be included in the number of total employment in Washington state that Acme Computer reports on the annual survey. Roberta performs services both within and without the state and the service is not directed or controlled in this state, but her residence is in Washington state. (7) What are full-time, pa rt-time and temporary employment positions? The survey must separately identify the number of full-time, part-time, and temporary employ - ment positions as a percent of total employment. (a) Full-time and part-tim e employment positions. A position is considered full-time or part-time if the employer intends for the position to be filled for at least fifty-two con - secutive weeks or twelve cons ecutive months, excluding any leaves of absence. (i) A full-time position is a position that requires the employee to work, excluding overtime hours, thirty-five hours per week for fifty-two consecutive weeks, four hundred fifty-five hours a quarter, or one thousand eight hundred twenty hours during a period of twelve consecutive months. (ii) A part-time position is a position in which the employee may work less than the hours required for a full- time position. (iii) In some instances, an employee may not be required to work the hours required for full-time employment because of paid rest and meal breaks, h ealth and safety laws, disability laws, shift differenti als, or collective bargaining agreements. If, in the absence of these factors, the employee would be required to work the number of hours for a full-time position to receive their current wage, th e position must be reported as a full-time employment position. (b) Temporary positions. There are two types of tem - porary positions. (i) Employees of the person required to complete the survey. In the case of a temporary employee directly employed by the person required to complete the survey, a temporary position is a position intended to be filled for a period of less than fifty-two consecutive weeks or twelve consecutive months. For example, seasonal employment positions are temporary positions . These temporary positions must be included in the information required in subsections (5), (8), and (9) of this section. (ii) Workers furnished by staffing companies. A tem - porary position also includes a position filled by a worker fur - nished by a staffing company, regardless of the duration of the placement. These temporar y positions must be included in the information required in subsections (5), (8), and (9) of this section. In addition, the person filling out the annual sur - vey must provide the following additional information: (A) Total number of staffing company employees fur - nished by staffing companies; (B) Top three occupational codes of all staffing company employees; and (C) Average duration of all staffing company employees. (c) Examples. Assume these facts for the following examples. Worldwide Materials, Inc. is a developer of mate - rials used in manufacturing elec tronic devices at a facility located in Everett, WA. Wo rldwide Materials claims the B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.4452 for its research and development spending. Worldwide Materials has one hundred employees. (i) On December 31st, Worldwide Materials has five employees on workers' compensa tion leave. At the time of the work-related injuries, the employees worked forty hours a week and were expected to wo rk for fifty-two consecutive weeks. Worldwide Materials mu st report these employees as being employed in a full-time position. Although the five employees are not currently work ing, they are on workers' compensation leave and Worldwide Materials had intended for the full-time positions to be filled for at least fifty-two consecutive weeks. (ii) In September, Worl dwide Materials hires two employees on a full -time basis for a two-year project to design composite materials to be used in a new airplane model. Because the position is intended to be filled for a period exceeding twelve consecutive months, Worldwide Materials must report these positions as two full-time posi - tions. (iii) Worldwide Materials ha s two employees who clean laboratories during the evenings. The employees regularly work 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, fifty-two weeks a year. Because the employees work less than thirty-five hours a week, the employment positions are reported as part-time positions.WSR 06-22-064 Washington St ate Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 38 ](iv) On November 1st, a Wo rldwide Materials engineer begins twelve weeks of family and medical leave. The engi - neer was expected to work forty hours a week for fifty-two consecutive weeks. While the engineer is on leave, World - wide Materials hires a staffing company to furnish a worker to complete the engineer's projects. Worldwide Materials must report the engineer as a full-time position on the annual report. Worldwide Materials must also report the worker fur - nished by the staf fing company as a temporary employment position and include the information as required in (b) of this subsection. (v) Worldwide Materials allo ws three of its research employees to work on specific projects with a flexible sched - ule. These employees are not required to work a set amount of hours each week, but are exp ected to work twelve consec - utive months. The three resear ch employees are paid a com - parable wage as other resear ch employees who are required to work a set schedule of forty hours a week. Although the three research employees may work fewer hours, they are receiving comparable wages as other research employees working forty hours a week. Worldwide Materials must report these positions as full-time employment positions, because each position is equi valent to a full-time employ - ment position. (vi) Worldwide Materials has a large order to fulfill and hires ten employees for the months of June and July. Five of the employees leave at the end of July. Worldwide Materials decides to have the remaining five employees work on an on- call basis for the remainder of th e year. As of December 31st, three of the employees are wo rking for Worldwide Materials on an on-call basis. Worldwid e Materials must report three temporary employment positions on the annual survey and include these positions in the information required in subsec - tions (5), (8), and (9) of this section. (8) What are wages? For the purposes of the annual survey, \"wages\" means compensati on paid to an individual for personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, or otherwise as reported on the W-2 forms of employees. Stock options granted as compensation to employees are wages to the exte nt they are re ported on the W-2 forms of the employees and are taken as a deduction for federal income tax purposes by the employer. The compen - sation of a proprietor or a partner is determined in one of two ways: (a) If there is net income for federal income tax purposes, the amount reported subject to self-employment tax is the compensation. (b) If there is no net income for federal income tax pur - poses, reasonable cash withdraw als or cash advances is the compensation. (9) What are employer-provided benefits? The annual survey requires persons to report the number of employees that have employer-provided medical, dental, and retirement benefits, by each of the wage bands. An employee has employer-provided medical, dental, and retirement bene - fits if the employee is currently eligible to participate or receive the benefit. A benefit is \"employer-provided\" if the medical, dental, and retirement benefit is dependent on the employer's establishment or admi nistration of the benefit. A benefit that is equally available to employees and the general public is not an \"emp loyer-provided\" benefit. (a) What are medical benefits? \"Medical benefits\" means compensation, not paid as wages, in the form of a health plan offered by an employer to its employees. A \"health plan\" means any plan, f und, or program established, maintained, or funded by an employer for the purpose of pro - viding for its employees or their beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, medical and/or dental care services. (i) Health plans include any: (A) \"Employee welfare benefi t plan\" as defined by the Employee Retirement Inco me Security Act (ERISA); (B) \"Health plan\" or plan\" as defined in RCW 48.43.005; (C) Self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in RCW 48.125.010; (D) \"Qualified health insurance\" as defined in Section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code; (E) \"Archer MSA\" as defined in Section 220 of the Inter - nal Revenue Code; (F) \"Health savings plan\" as defined in Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code; (G) \"Health plan\" qualifying under Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code; (H) Governmental plans; and (I) Church plans. (ii) \"Health care services\" m eans services offered or pro - vided by health care facilities and health care providers relat - ing to the prevention, cure, or treatment of illness, injury, or disease. (b) What are dental benefits? \"Dental benefits\" means a dental health plan offered by an employer as a benefit to its employees. \"Dental health plan\" has the same meaning as \"health plan\" in (a) of this subsection, but is for the purpose of providing for employees or their beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or othe rwise, dental care services. \"Dental care services\" means services offered or provided by health care facilities and health care providers relating to the prevention, cure, or treatment of illness, injury, or disease of human teeth, alveolar process, gums, or jaw. (c) What are retirement benefits? \"Retirement bene - fits\" means compensation , not paid as wages, in the form of a retirement plan offered by an employer to its employees. An employer contribution to the retirement plan is not required for a retirement plan to be employer-provided. A \"retirement plan\" means any plan, account, deposit, annuity, or benefit, other than a life insurance policy, that provides for retirement income or deferred income to employees for periods after employment is terminated. The term includes pensions, annuities, stock bonus plans, employee stock ownership plans, profit sharing plans, se lf-employed retirement plans, individual retirement accoun ts, individual retirement annu - ities, and retirement bonds, as well as any other plan or pro - gram, without regard to its source of funding, and without regard to whether the retirement plan is a qualified plan meet - ing the guidelines established in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Rev - enue Code.Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-064 [ 39 ] Proposed(d) Examples. Assume these facts for the following examples. Medical Resource, Inc. is a pharmaceutical manu - facturer located in Spokane, WA. Medical Resource, Inc. claims the B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.4452 for its research and development spending. It employs two hun - dred full-time employees an d fifty part-time employees. Medical Resource, Inc. also hi res a staffing company to fur - nish seventy-five workers. (i) Medical Resource, Inc. offers its employees two dif - ferent health plans as a medical benefit. Plan A is available at no cost to full-time employees . Employees are not eligible to participate in Plan A until completing thirty days of employment. Plan B costs employees $200 each month. Full-time and part-time employees are eligible for Plan B after six months of employment. One hundred full-time employees are enrolled in Plan A. One hundred full-time and part-time employees ar e enrolled in Plan B. Forty full-time and part-time employees chose not to enroll in either plan. Ten part-time employees are not ye t eligible for either Plan A or Plan B. Medical Resource, Inc. must report two hundred employees as having employer-provided medical benefits, because this is the number of employees enrolled in the health plans it offers. (ii) Medical Resource, Inc. does not offer medical bene - fits to the employees of the staffing company. However, twenty-five of these workers have enrolled in a health plan through the staffing company. Medical Resource, Inc. must report these twenty-five empl oyment positions as having employer-provided medical benefits. (iii) Medical Resource, Inc. does not offer its employees dental insurance, but has arranged with a group of dental pro - viders to provide all employees with a 30% discount on any dental care service. No action, other than Medical Resource, Inc. employment, is required by employees to receive this benefit. Unlike the medical benefit, employees are eligible for the dental benefit as of the first day of employment. This benefit is not provided to the workers furnished by the staff - ing company. Medical Resour ce, Inc. must report two hun - dred and fifty employment positions as having dental bene - fits, because this is the number of employees enrolled in this dental plan. (iv) Medical Resource, Inc. offers a 401(k) Plan to its full-time and part-time empl oyees after six months of employment. Medical Resource , Inc. makes matching con - tributions to an employee's 401(k) Plan after two years of employment. On December 31st, two hundred and twenty- five workers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. Two hundred workers are enrolled in the 401(k) Plan. One hundred of these workers recei ve matching contributions. Medical Resource, Inc. must report two hundred employment positions as having employer-provided retirement benefits, because this is the number of employees enrolled in the 401(k) Plan. (v) Medical Resource, Inc. co ordinates with a bank to insert information in employee paycheck envelopes on the bank's Individual Retirement Account (IRA) options offered to bank customers. Employees who open an IRA with the bank can arrange to have their contributions directly depos - ited from their paychecks into their accounts. Fifty employ - ees open IRAs with the bank. Medical Resource, Inc. cannot report that these fifty employees have employer-provided retirement benefits. IRAs are not an employer-provided ben - efit because the ability to esta blish the IRA is not dependent on Medical Resource, Inc.'s participation or sponsorship of the benefit. (10) Is the annual surv ey confidential? The annual survey is subject to the confidentiality provisions of RCW 82.32.330. However, information on the amount of tax adjustment taken is not subject to the confidentiality provi - sions of RCW 82.32.330 and may be disclosed to the public upon request. More confidentiality provisions in regards to the annual surveys are as follows: (a) Failure to timely file a complete annual survey subject to disclosure. If the following taxpayers fail to timely file a complete annual survey for claiming the tax adjustment, then the fact that such taxpayers fail to timely file a complete annual survey is not confidential: (i) Persons receiving deferr al of taxes under chapter 82.75 RCW on an eligible investment project in biotechnol - ogy products (RCW 82.32.645(6)); (ii) Persons claiming the B&O tax exemption provided by RCW 82.04.4266 for fruits and vegetables, RCW 82.04.-4268 for dairy products, and RCW 82.04.4269 for seafood products (RCW 82.32.610(5)); and (iii) Persons claiming the B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.449 for customized employment training (RCW 82.32.650(5)). (b) Amount reported in annu al survey is different from the amount claimed or allowed. If the following tax - payers report the amount of th e tax adjustment on the annual survey which is different than the amount actually claimed on the taxpayers' tax returns or otherwise allowed by the depart - ment, then the amount actually claimed or allowed may be disclosed: (i) Persons claiming the high technology B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.4452 (RCW 82.04.4452 (6)(d)(i)); (ii) Persons claiming the B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.4487 for engaging in qualified preproduction development in the field of aeronautics (RCW 82.32.635 (2)(c)); (iii) Persons claiming the B&O tax rate provided by RCW 82.04.250(3) as FAR part 145 certificated repair sta - tions (RCW 82.32.640 (2)(c)); and (iv) Persons claiming the B&O tax rate provided by RCW 82.04.260(12) for timber products (RCW 82.32.630 (2)(d)). (c) Tax adjustment is less th an ten thousand dollars. If the tax adjustment of the following taxpayers is less than ten thousand dollars during the period covered by the annual survey, then such taxpayers ma y request the department to treat the tax adjustment as confidential under RCW 82.32.- 330. The request must be made for each survey in writing, dated and signed by the owner, corporate officer, partner, guardian, executor, receiver, admi nistrator, or trustee of the business, and filed with the department's special programs division at the address provided above in subsection (3) of this section. (i) Persons claiming the high technology B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.4452 (RCW 82.04.4452 (6)(d)(ii));WSR 06-22-064 Washington St ate Register, 06-22 Proposed [ 40 ](ii) Persons claiming the B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.4487 for engaging in qualified preproduction development in the field of aeronautics (RCW 82.32.635 (2)(d)); (iii) Persons claiming the B&O tax rate provided by RCW 82.04.250(3) as FAR part 145 certificated repair sta - tions (RCW 82.32.640 (2)(d)); and (iv) Persons claiming the B&O tax rate provided by RCW 82.04.260(12) for timber products (RCW 82.32.630 (2)(e)). (11) What are the consequences for failing to timely file a complete annual survey? (a) What is a \"complete annual survey\"? An annual survey is complete if: (i) The annual survey is filed on the form required by this section or in an electronic form at as required by law; and (ii) The person makes a good faith effort to substantially respond to all survey questions required by this section. Responses such as \"varied,\" \"v arious,\" or \"please contact for information\" are not good faith responses to a question. (b) High technology business and occupation (B&O) tax credit. If a person claiming the B&O tax credit provided by RCW 82.04.4452 for persons engaged in qualified research and development fails to timely file a complete annual survey by the date due, th e person is not eligible to take or assign the credit in the year the person failed to timely complete the annual survey. See RCW 82.04.4452. For example, if a person claims the credit in 2006 but fails to file a complete annual survey by March 31, 2007, then the person is not eligible to take or assign the credit in 2007. If a person claims the B&O tax credit during this period of ineligibility, the department will declare th e amount of taxes for which the credit was claimed during the period of ineligibility to be immediately due and payable with interest and penalties, as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW. If a person fails to file the survey by the due date as the result of circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer, the person may request a thirty-day extension of the due date. See WAC 458-20-228 for more information on circum - stances beyond the control of the taxpayer. The request must be made in writing before the due date to the address pro - vided in subsection (3)(c) of this section. (c) Tax deferrals for investment projects in rural counties.

No penalties or inter - est will be assessed on the deferr ed sales/use tax; however, all other penalties and interest a pplicable to excise tax assess - ment may be assessed and imposed. For example, if a person fails to file a complete annual survey by March 31, 2007, then 12.5% of the total deferred tax is immediately due, with applicable penalties and interest beginning to accrue on the due date. (d) Tax deferrals for invest ment projects for high technology businesses.

Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: This proposed amendment: 1. Clarifies, defines, and specifies the confidentiality requirements for emergency do mestic violence shelter pro - grams, and incorporates recen tly enacted federal and state legislative requirements. The anticipated effect will be strengthened confidentiality protections for recipients of ser - vices from emergency domestic violence shelter programs. 2. Clarifies the fire safety requirements for emergency domestic violence shelter homes. The anticipated effect will be that contractors obtain annual life and safety inspections from local fire departments or the fire marshal, and DSHS will be relieved from measuri ng the contractor's compliance with requirements of the state building code. 3. Repeals appeal rights on advice of the assistant attor - ney general because dispute re medies for contractors are incorporated in the co ntract for services. Reasons Supporting Proposal: This amendment incor - porates recently enacted federal and state legislative require - ments; simplifies the fire safe ty requirements for emergency domestic violence shelter homes; and repeals unnecessary appeal rights language.

Bianchi Assistant Director Interpretations and Technical Advice Division AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 90-17-068, filed 8/16/90, effective (1) Introduction. RCW 82.12.022 and 82.14.230 impose state and local use taxes on the use of natural gas or manufac - tured gas by a consumer, if the person who sold the gas to the consumer has not paid public utility tax on that sale. This use tax is imposed only for natural gas delivered to a consumer through a pipeline. The use tax is applied at the same rate as the state and city public utility ta xes. This section explains how this use tax applies and how it is reported to the depart - ment. (2) Definitions. For the purpose of this section: (a) \"Brokered natural gas\" (( as used in this section is )) means natural gas purchased by a consumer from a source out of the state and delivered to the consumer in this state. (b) \"Value of gas consumed or used\" (( as used in this section shall be )) means the purchasing price of the gas to the consumer and generally (( shall )) must include all or part of the transportation charges as explained later. (((2))) (3) Applicability of use tax. The distribution and sale of natural gas in this state is generally taxed under the state and city public utility taxes. With changing conditions and federal regulations, it is now possible to have natural gas brokered from out of the state and sold directly to the con - sumer. If this occurs and the public utility taxes have not been paid, RCW 82.12.022 (state) and RCW 82.14.230 (city) Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-084 [ 55 ] Proposedimpose a use tax on the brokered natural gas at the same rate as the state and city public utility taxes. (((3))) (4) State tax. When the use tax applies, the rate of tax imposed is equal to the public utility tax on gas distribu - tion business under RCW 82.16.020 (1)(c). The rate of tax applies to the value of the gas consumed or used and is imposed upon the consumer. (((4))) (5) City tax. Cities are given the authority to impose a use tax on brokered natural gas. When imposed and applicable, the rate of tax is equal to the tax on natural gas business under RCW 35.21.870 on the value of gas con - sumed or used and is imposed on the consumer. (((5))) (6) Transportation charges. (a) If all or part of the transportation charges for the delivery of the brokered natural gas are separately subject to the state's and cities' public utility taxes (RCW 82.16.020 (1)(c) and RCW 35.21.870), those transportation charges are excluded from measure of the use tax. The transportation charges not subject to the public utility taxes are included in the value of the gas consumed or used. (b) Examples. The following exampl es identify a num - ber of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should be used only as a general guide. In actual practice, the tax status of a situation must be determined after a review of all of the facts and circumstances. (i) Public university purchases natural gas from an out of the state source through a broker. The natural gas is delivered by interstate pipeline to the local gas distribution system who delivers it to the university. The university pays the supplier for the gas, the pipeline for the interstate transportation charge, and the gas distribution system for its local transpor - tation charge. The transportation charge by the pipeline is not subject to public utility tax because it is an interstate transpor - tation charge. The transportation charge paid to the local gas distribution system is subject to the public utility taxes as an intrastate delivery. The value of the gas consumed or used is the purchase price paid to the supplier plus the transportation charge paid to pipeline company. (ii) The above factual situat ion applies except that the natural gas is delivered directly by the interstate pipeline to the university. The university pays the supplier for the gas and the pipeline for the transportation charge. As the trans - portation charge is not subject to the public utility tax, it will be included in the measure of the tax. The value of the gas consumed or used is the purch ase price plus the transporta - tion charge paid to the pipeline. (((6))) (7) Credits against the taxes. (a) A credit is allowed against the use taxes described in this section for any use tax paid by the consumer to another state which is similar to this use tax and is applicable to the gas subject to this tax. Any other state's use tax allowed as a credit (( shall )) will be prorated to the state's and cities' por - tion of the tax based on the relative rates of the two taxes. (b) A credit is also allowe d against the use tax imposed by the state for any gross receip ts tax similar that imposed pursuant to RCW 82.16.020 (1)(c) by another state on the seller of the gas with respect to the gas consumed or used. (c) A credit is allowed agai nst the use tax imposed by the cities for any gross receipts tax similar to that imposed pursu - ant to RCW 35.21.870 by another state or political subdivi -sion of the state on the seller of the gas with respect to the gas consumed or used. (((7))) (8) Reporting requirements. The person who delivers the gas to the consumer (( shall )) must make a report to the miscellaneous tax division of the department by the fif - teenth day of the month following a calendar quarter. The report (( shall )) must contain the following information: (a) The name and address of the consumer to whom gas was delivered, (b) The volume of gas delivered to each consumer during the calendar quarter, and, (c) Service address of consum er if different from mailing address. (((8))) (9) Collection and administration. ((A separate quarterly return for )) Use tax on brokered natural gas (( shall )) must be filed with the department by the consumer on (( or before the last day of the month following a calendar quar - ter)) forms and records prescribed by the department. Such forms and records must be filed according to the reporting frequency assigned by the department and must be accompa - nied by the remittance of the tax. (( The collection and admin - istration for the cities of the use tax described in this section shall be done by the department under RCW 82.14.050. )) The department's authority to collect this tax is found in RCW 82.12.020 and 82.14.050. It may be of interest to note that the use tax on brokered na tural gas has historically been reported and paid on a specific \"natural gas use tax return,\" filed on a quarterly basis. However, starting no sooner than the first period of 2007, the department intends to be able to have taxpayers report and pay their natural gas use tax with their regular excise tax return, to be filed at whatever fre - quency has been assigned by the department to that particular tax reporting account.

Bianchi Assistant Director Interpretations and Technical Advice Division AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 99-08-090, filed (( chance. )) Gambling activities. (1) Introduction. This (( rule)) section explains the business and occupation (B&O), retail sales, and use tax reporting requirements of persons operating contests of chance such as pull-tab and punch board games(( . It also explains the application of tax to persons conducting amuse - ment games )), card games, bingo games, (( and)) raffles , and persons operating amusement game s such as dart-toss games, ball-throw or ball-roll games, and crane games. It also explains the B&O tax reporti ng requirements of persons engaged in the business of conducting parimutuel wagering, which became effective July 1, 2005 . Nonprofit organiza - tions conducting (( these games as a part of their )) activities for fund-raising (( activities )) purposes nonprofit service organiza - tions, and sheltered workshops) to determine if a B&O, retail sales, or use tax exemption is available for their activities.Persons (( operating or selling these types of games )) conducting the types of activities described above should also be aware that the Washington state gambling commission regulates these activities. These persons should refer to chap - ter 9.46 RCW (Gambling\u20141973 Act), Title 230 WAC (Gambling commission), and/or contact the Washington state gambling commission with any questions regarding their licensing and reporting responsibilities with the commission. Persons engaging in the business of parimutuel wagering should refer to ch apter 67.16 RCW (Hor se racing) and/or contact the Washington horse racing commission for addi - tional reporting responsibilities. (2) (( Measure of tax. The business and occupation (B&O) and retail sales taxes apply to income as described below. These guidelines apply equally whether the game is mechanically or electronically operated. (a) Pull-tab, punch board, and bingo games. )) Parimu - tuel wagering. Effective July 1, 2005, persons engaging within this state in the busin ess of conducting race meets for which a license must be obtain ed from the Washington horse racing commission are taxable under the parimutuel wager - ing B&O tax classification. Chapter 369, Laws of 2005. This tax is in addition to any tax imposed under chapter 67.16 RCW. Unlike the parimutuel tax, the B&O tax applies to both in-state and out-of-state parimutuel wagering. The mea - sure of tax is the gross income of the business derived from parimutuel wagering. For purpos es of this classification, \"gross income\" does not include amounts paid to players for winning wagers, or taxes imposed or other distributions required under chapter 67. 16 RCW (i.e., RCW 67.16.102 owners bonus, RCW 67.16.105 fair fund, RCW 67.16.175 breeders award). (3) Contests of chance. Contests of chance means any contests, games, gaming scheme s, or gaming devices, other than the state lottery as defined in RCW 67.70.010, in which the outcome depends in a materi al degree upon an element of chance, notwithstanding that skill of the contestants may also be a factor in the outcome. The term includes social card games, bingo, raffle, and punch board games, and pull-tabs as those terms are defined in chapter 9.46 RCW. Contests of chance does not include race m eets for the conduct of which a license must be secured from the Washington horse racing commission, or \"amusement game\" as defined in RCW 9.46.0201. (a) Taxability of contests of ch ance on or after July 1, 2005. Effective July 1, 2005, persons operating contests of chance are taxable under one of two new B&O tax classifica - tions on their total gross income for all contests of chance. Chapter 369, Laws of 2005. Persons whose gross income from contests of chance is less than fifty thousand dollars in a calendar year will report all su ch income under the \"gambling contests of chance (less than $50,000 a year)\" tax classifica - tion. Persons whose gross income from contests of chance is fifty thousand dollars or more in a calendar year will report all such income under the \"g ambling contests of chance ($50,000 a year or great er)\" tax classification. (b) Taxability of contests of chance before July 1, 2005. Before July 1, 2005, pe rsons operating contests of chance were taxable on their gross income under the service and other activities B&O tax classification.Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-084 [ 57 ] Proposed(c) Measure of tax. Persons operating contests of chance are subject to B&O tax on the gross income of the business derived from contests of chance. With respect to income from contests of chan ce, \"gross income\" of the busi - ness does not include the monetary value or actual cost of any prizes that are awarded, amounts paid to players for winning wagers, accrual of prizes for pr ogressive jackpot contests, or repayment of amounts used to seed guaranteed progressive jackpot prizes. In the case of donated merchandise, the oper - ator may deduct the fair-market value of the merchandise. Costs of operating the game, including the amount paid for the purchase of the actual game (e.g., a punch board), may not be deducted. Examples. The following exampl es identify a number of facts and then state a conc lusion. These examples should be used only as a general guide. The tax results of other situ - ations must be determined after a review of all facts and cir - cumstances. (i) Example 1. Persons operating (( pull-tab, punch board, or )) for-profit weekly bingo games at the Town & Country Social Club are taxable (( under the service and other activities B&O tax classification )) upon (( all \"increases\" )) gross income arising from the (( conduct )) operation of ((such)) their games. (( The term \"increases\" as used in this subsection, means gross gambling receipts less the monetary value or, in the case of merchandise, the actual cost, of any prizes that are awarded. The actual cost of the merchandise is the amount actually paid by the operator without any markup. In the case of dona ted merchandise, the operator may deduct the fair-market value of the merchandise. While the cost of merchandise prizes may be deducted, other costs of operating the game, including the amount paid for the pur - chase of the actual game (e.g., a punch board), may not be deducted. Prior to April 1, 1999, oper ators of pull-tab and punch board games awarding merchandi se as prizes were consid - ered to be selling the prizes for the gross income derived from the games. As a result, this income was subject to the retail - ing B&O and retail sales taxes. (b) Card games. The fees ch arged to card players as a condition for their participati on in card games, whether the fees are based on time, on a per-hand basis, or on a percent - age of the wagered amount (commonly referred to as a \"rake\"), are subject to the se rvice and other activities B&O tax. In those cases where the operator of the card room par - ticipates in the card game as a house or central bank, the mea - sure of tax is the amount of winnings less the amount of losses. (c) Raffles. Effective Apr il 1, 1999, persons conducting raffles are subject to the serv ice and other activities B&O tax upon all \"increases\" (as defined in subsection (2)(a) above) arising from the conduct of the raffles. Prior to this date, the measure of tax was the gross income from the sale of raffle tickets or chances without any deduction for the value or cost of any prizes awarded. (d))) As their annual gross income from the bingo games is $30,000, they will report under the gambling contests of chance (less than $50,000 a year) tax classification. (ii) Example 2. The Lucky Card Room (LCR) charges a fee to all card players as a condi tion for participating in their card games. Depending on th e game, the LCR may charge a fee based on time, on a per-hand basis, or on a percentage of the wagered amount (commonly referred to as a \"rake\"). Their annual gross income from card game fees and percent - ages of wagers is $120,000, a nd thus they will report under the gambling contests of chance ($50,000 a year or greater) tax classification. (iii) Example 3. Take A Chance (TAC) is a business offering customers several types of gambling activities, such as pull-tabs, bingo, and punch board games. Based on last year's income and this year's anticipated income, TAC started the year out reporting their gross income under the gambling contests of chance (less than $50,000 a year) tax classifica - tion. As their income from gambling activities was better than anticipated, they passed the $50,000 threshold. TAC must now start reporting their gross income under the gam - bling contests of chance ($50, 000 a year or greater) tax clas - sification. They must also reclassify, by filing amended excise tax returns, all income reported for the year under the tax classification for less than $50,000 a year to $50,000 a year or greater. (4) Amusement games. Chapter 369, Laws of 2005, made no change to the taxability of income derived from amusement games as defined in RCW 9.46.0201. The gross receipts derived from the operation of (( amusement games as defined in RCW 9.46.0201 )) these games are subject to the service and other activities B&O ta x. The cost of any prizes awarded may not be deducted from the measure of tax. (( (i))) Businesses computing their gro ss income from contests of chance, for reporting under th e gambling contests of chance tax classification, should not include income derived from their amusement games. For example. The Lucky Card Room in Example 2 of subsection (3)(c)(ii) of this se ction also provides games for customers to play that do not involve wagering. Prizes, such as free or discounted meal vouchers or home appliances, are awarded to the winners. The cost of these prizes is not allowed as an adjustment to computing the LCR's gross income. (a) What is an amusement game? The term \"amuse - ment game\" is defined in RCW 9.46.0201 (( defines amuse - ment games to be )) as a game played for entertainment in which: (((A))) (i) The contestant act ively participates; (((B))) (ii) The outcome depends in a material degree upon the skill of the contestant; (((C))) (iii) Only merchandise prizes are awarded; (( and (D))) (iv) The outcome is not in the control of the opera - tor; (v) The wagers are placed, the winners are determined, and a distribution of prizes or property is made in the pres - ence of all persons placing wa gers at such game; and (vi) The game is conducted or operated by any agricul - tural fair, person, association, or organization in such manner and at such locations as may be authorized by rules adopted by the gambling commission under chapter 9.46 RCW . (((ii))) (b) Examples of amusement games. Crane machines, coin-toss and dart-toss games at fairs and carni - vals, and skill-stop games are examples of games qualifying as amusement games under RCW 9.46.0201. For additional WSR 06-22-085 Washington St ate Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 58 ]examples of amusement games, refer to WAC 230-20-508 (Authorized amusement games\u2014 Types, standards and clas - sifications) issued by the gambling commission. (c) Coin-operated games are not amusement games. Persons operating coin-operated games that do not qualify under the definition of amusement games in RCW 9.46.0201 (e.g., pinball, video, and pool games) should refer to WAC 458-20-187 (Coin-operated vending machines, amusement devices and service machines) fo r an explanation of their tax reporting responsibilities. (((e))) (5) Sales of foods and beverages. Sales of foods, beverages, and other tangible personal property by persons operating or conducting any of the activities described above are retail sales and subject to the retailing B&O and retail sales taxes, unless a specific exemption applies (e.g., see WAC 458-20-124 regarding sales of food and beverages by restaurants, taverns, and s imilar businesses and WAC 458- 20-244 for exemptions available for certain food products). Persons conducting dice games to determine the amount that the customer will pay for food or beverages are subject to tax upon the amount the customer actually pays for the food or drink. (((3))) (6) Merchandise prizes. Persons operating or conducting any of the activities described (( in subsection (2)(a) through (d) of this rule )) above are the consumers of any merchandise delivered to the players in the form of prizes or awards. Purchases of this merchandise are purchases at retail and subject to the retail sales tax, unless a specific exemption applies (e.g., see WAC 458-20-244 for exemp - tions available for certain food products). Purchases of sup - plies, devices, and other equipment used in the conduct of these (( games )) activities are also subject to the retail sales tax. (((a))) If retail sales tax is not collected by the seller, the person conducting these (( games )) activities must remit the retail sales tax (often referred to as deferred retail sales tax) or use tax directly to the department of revenue . See also WAC 458-20-178 (Use tax). (((b) Prior to April 1, 1999, operators of punch board and pull-tab games awarding merchandise as prizes were consid - ered to be selling the prizes for the gross income derived from the games. The purchase of the merchandise prizes by the operators of these games were purchases at wholesale and not subject to either the retail sales or use tax. For the purposes of determining the taxability of mer - chandise prizes awarded by operators of punch board and pull-tab games that were in operation both before and after April 1, 1999, the operator should remit retail sales or use tax on the value of the prizes awarded on or after April 1, 1999. )) WSR 06-22-085 PROPOSED RULES DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE [Filed October 31, 2006, 3:36 p.m.] Original Notice.

The stumpage values in subsection (2) of this ru le for the designated stumpage value areas are adjusted for va rious logging and harvest con - ditions, subject to the following: (a) No harvest adjustment is allowed for special forest products, chipwood, or small logs. (b) Conifer and hardwood stumpage value rates cannot be adjusted below one dollar per MBF. (c) Except for the timber yarded by helicopter, a single logging condition adjustment applies to the entire harvest unit. The taxpayer must use the logging condition adjustment class that applies to a major ity (more than 50%) of the acre - age in that harvest unit. If the harvest unit is reported over more than one quarter, all quar terly returns for that harvest unit must report the same logging condition adjustment. The helicopter adjustment applies only to the timber volume from the harvest unit that is yarded from stump to landing by heli - copter. (d) The volume per acre adjustment is a single adjust - ment class for all quarterly returns reporting a harvest unit. A harvest unit is established by th e harvester prior to harvest - ing. The volume per acre is determined by taking the volume logged from the unit excluding the volume reported as chip - wood or small logs and dividing by the total acres logged. Total acres logged does not include leave tree areas (RMZ, UMZ, forested wetlands, etc.,) over 2 acres in size. (e) A domestic market adjustment applies to timber which meet the following criteria: (i) Public timber\u2014 Harvest of timber not sold by a com - petitive bidding process that is prohibited under the authority of state or federal law from foreign export may be eligible for the domestic market adjustment. The adjustment may be applied only to those species of timber that must be processed domestically. According to type of sale, the adjustment may be applied to the following species: Federal Timber Sales: All species except Alaska-cedar. (Stat. Ref. - 36 C.F.R. 223.10) State, and Other Nonfederal , Public Timber Sales: Redcedar only. (Stat.

(4) Damaged timber. Timber harvesters planning to remove timber from areas having damaged timber may apply to the department of revenue for an adjustment in stumpage values. The application must contain a map with the legal descriptions of the area, an accura te estimate of the volume of damaged timber to be removed, a description of the damage sustained by the timber with an evaluation of the extent to which the stumpage values have been materially reduced from the values shown in the ap plicable tables, and a list of estimated additional costs to be incurred resulting from the removal of the damaged timber. The application must be received and approved by the department of revenue before the harvest commences. Upon receipt of an application, the department of revenue will determine the amount of adjust - ment to be applied against the stumpage values. Timber that has been damaged due to sudden and unforeseen causes may qualify. (a) Sudden and unforeseen causes of damage that qualify for consideration of an adjustment include: (i) Causes listed in RCW 84.33.091; fire, blow down, ice storm, flood. (ii) Others not listed; vo lcanic activity, earthquake. (b) Causes that do not qualify for adjustment include: (i) Animal damage, root rot, mistletoe, prior logging, insect damage, normal deca y from fungi, and pathogen caused diseases; and (ii) Any damage that can be accounted for in the accepted normal scaling rules through volume or grade reductions. (c) The department of revenue will not grant adjustments for applications involving timber that has already been har - vested but will consider any remaining undisturbed damaged timber scheduled for removal if it is properly identified. (d) The department of revenue will notify the harvester in writing of approval or denial. Instructions will be included for taking any adjustment amounts approved.

Purpose of the Proposal a nd Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The proposed rule amendment incorporates changes to the definitions of food and food ingredients, and in particular, the defined term \"pre - pared foods\" promulgated by chapter 153, Laws of 2004. The rule includes the methodology for determining whether a seller of prepared foods must co llect and remit sales tax on all sales of food and food ingredients, or only items qualifying as prepared foods under particular definitions. Reasons Supporting Proposal: RCW 82.08.0293 and 82.12.0293 provide, respectively, a retail sales tax and use tax exemption for food and food ingredients. In 2003 and 2004, the legislature amended th ese statutes to alter the defi - nitions used to determine whet her a particular food or food ingredient qualifies for the exemptions. The amendments were made in compliance with the national streamlined sales and use tax agreement (SSUTA). Amendments to Rule 244 incorporate these statut ory changes, as well as the final inter - pretations adopted by th e SSUTA advisory council. Statutory Authority for Adoption: RCW Statute Being Implemented: RCW 82.08.0293 and 82.12.0293. Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision.

A small business eco -nomic impact statement is not required because the rule and the amendments do not impose new performance require - ments for administrative burde ns on any small business not required by statute as interpreted under the SSUTA. A cost-benefit analysis is not required under RCW 34.05.328. The proposed rule is not a significant legislative rule as defined by RCW 34.05.328. October 31, 2006 Janis P. Bianchi Assistant Director Interpretations and Technical Advice Division AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 03-24-031, filed 11/25/03, effective 1/1/04) ingredients. (1) Introduction. ((RCW 82.08.0293 and 82.12.0293 provide retail sales tax and use tax exemptions for certain foods sold for human consumption. In 2003, the legislature adopted the food definitions set forth in the national Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The 200 3 amendments to these stat - utes significantly change how sales of food and food ingredi - ents are taxed on and after January 1, 2004. This rule pro - vides guidelines for determining if the sale of a food or food ingredient is subject to retail sales tax. There is no general business and occupation (B&O) tax exemption for sales of food and food ingredients. Therefore, even if a sale of food is exempt from retail sales tax, the income from that sale is incl uded in gross proceeds when cal - culating the business's retailing B&O tax. (2) Related rules. The department has adopted other rules that provide important tax reporting information to per - sons who sell food and prepared meals: (a) WAC 458-20-119 (Sales of meals); (b) WAC - erns and similar businesses); (c) WAC 458-20-12401 (Special stadium sales and use tax); (d) WAC 458-20-166 (Hotels, motels, boarding houses, rooming houses, resorts, summe r camps, trailer camps, etc.); (e) WAC 458-20-167 (Education institutions, school dis - tricts, student organizations, and private schools); (f) WAC 458-20-168 (Hospitals, medical care facilities, and adult family homes); and (g) WAC 458-20-169 (Nonprofit organizations). (3) \"Food and ingredients\" defined. \"Food and food ingredients\" means substa nces, whether in liquid, con - centrated, solid, frozen, dried, or dehydrated form, that are sold for ingestion or chewing by humans and are consumed for their taste or nutritional value. \"Food and food ingredients\" does not include: (a) \"Alcoholic beverages,\" which means beverages that are suitable for human consumption and contain one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume; and (b) \"Tobacco,\" which means ci garettes, cigars, chewing or pipe tobacco, or any other items that contain tobacco. (4) Taxability of prepared food. The exemption for \"food and food ingredients\" provided in RCW 82.08.0293 does not apply to prep ared food. The sale of prepared food is Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-092 [ 71 ] Proposedsubject to retail sales tax, unl ess otherwise exempt by law. See subsection (5) of this section for information about the taxability of soft drinks and s ubsection (6) of this section for information about the taxabili ty of dietary supplements. (a) Prepared food. \"Prepared food\" means: (i) Food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, nap - kins, or straws. A plate does not include a container or pack - aging used to transport the food; (ii) Food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller; or (iii) Two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, except: (A) Food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller; (B) Raw eggs, fish, meat, poultry, and foods containing these raw animal foods requirin g cooking by the consumer as recommended by the federal Food and Drug Administration in chapter 3, part 401.11 of The Food Code, published by the Food and Drug Administration, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003, so as to prevent foodborne illness; or (C) Bakery items, including bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, croissants, pastries, donuts, Danish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, muffins, bars, cookies, and tortillas. (b) Food sold with eating utensils. Food sold with eat - ing utensils provided by the seller is prepared food and thus subject to tax, even if the se ller does not otherwise prepare the food. (i) Eating establishments that sell food with eating utensils. Generally food sold by an eating establishment is subject to sales tax. An eating establishment may be mobile or in a fixed location and may or may not provide seating accommodations for its customers. Eating establishments include restaurants, caterers, pizzerias, bars, taverns, night clubs, yogurt or ice cream stores/stands, coffee or donut shops, diners, refreshment stands, drive-ins, fast restau - rants, bagel shops, lunch coun ters, cafeterias, private and social clubs, sandwich shops, snack bars, hot dog carts, espresso stands, concession stands at a fair or a mall, side - walk vendors or like places of business where food is served to individuals and is customarily sold for consumption shortly after it is sold. (A) All food served at eating establishments is subject to tax unless the seller maintains adequate records for sale of food items that are generally not sold with eating utensils and do not otherwise qualify as prepar ed food, such as gallons of milk, loaves of bread, whole pies, a dozen donuts, wedding or birthday cakes, and packages of rolls or muffins. The infor - mation shown on invoices, cash register receipts, or sales tickets must provide an adequate description of the food items sold to show that the sale was not of food items that are generally served with eating utensils or do not otherwise qualify as prepared food. (B) Food sold by grocery st ores, convenience stores, and department stores is generally not considered to be sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, even though eating utensils may be available to customers (e.g., napkins on the counter). For example, the sale of yogurt is not subject to retail sales tax even if napkins are available for the customer's use at the checkout stand. The food may be taxable if it is generally served with eating uten sils (see part (ii) below). A grocery store is a business primarily engaged in the retail sale of a wide variety of food products. They generally contain the following departments: Dairy, baked goods, canned and dry goods, frozen foods, meats, fr esh fruits and vegetables and household supplies. Grocery stores, department stores, and convenience stores that have a separately identifiable eating establish - ment, such as a salad bar, sush i bar, or deli, are required to collect the tax on food items sold at that establishment unless the store maintains adequate re cords for sale of food items that are generally not sold with eating utensils or do not oth - erwise qualify as prepared food. (ii) Food that is generally sold with eating utensils. Food that is generally sold with eating utensils, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws, is subject to tax, even if the seller does not in all cases actually provide the utensils. For example, sales from salad bars or \"make your own sandwich \" bars at a grocery store are taxable since salads and sandwi ches are generally eaten with eating utensils (a fork for the salad and a napkin for the sand - wich). \"Make your own ice cr eam sundae\" bars are taxable for the same reason. These item s are taxable regardless of where they are sold. Cold cut platters, cheese platters, vege - table and fruit platters are taxabl e since the platter is an eating utensil. (A) Box lunches are taxable since they are generally sold with eating utensils pr ovided by the seller. (B) If the eating utensil is provided by the manufacturer rather than by the seller, the sale of the food is not subject to retail sales tax. For example, a box of crackers and cheese that includes a spreader, is not subject to tax since the seller does not provide the spreader. (c) \"Prepared food\" examples. The examples in this subsection identify a number of facts and then state a conclu - sion. These examples should only be used as a general guide. Similar determinations for other situations can be made only after a review of all facts and circumstances. (i) If a carton of milk is pur chased from a grocery store, the sale is exempt from retail sales tax because the milk, in this case, is an exempt food it em. If an individual purchases a glass of milk from a restaurant, however, it is subject to retail sales tax because the seller provi ded an eating utensil, a glass. (ii) A grocery store deli sells pasta salad that it prepares itself and potato salad that it purchases in bulk. The deli packages the pasta salad for sale, and repackages the potato salad the deli purchased in bulk into smaller containers. Sales of the potato salad are exempt from retail sales tax because \"prepared food\" does not include food that is merely repack - aged. Sales of the pasta salad ar e subject to retail sales tax because the deli mixed or comb ined two or more food ingre - dients, doing something more than cutting or repackaging the food ingredients. (iii) A grocery store meat de partment prepares ready-to- bake stuffed pork chops. The stuffed pork chops are not \"pre - pared foods\" and are not subject to tax even though the seller combined two or more ingred ients because \"prepared foods\" does not include raw meat, or foods containing raw animal foods that require cooking by the consumer, to prevent food - borne illness.WSR 06-22-092 Washington St ate Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 72 ](iv) Pizza. The taxability of pizza depends on who pre - pares it and in what form it is sold. The following examples explain the taxability of pizza in its various forms: (A) Pizza prepared by the seller and sold in a heated state. Pizza sold by the slic e and whole hot pizzas ready to eat, including delivered pizzas, are taxable because they are sold in a heated state. Additio nally, the sale of the pizza is a taxable sale of a \"prepared food\" because the seller mixed or combined two or more food ingredients. (B) Ready-to-bake pizzas prepar ed by the seller. Fresh or frozen ready-to-bake pizza prepared by the seller is taxable as a \"prepared food\" because the se ller mixed or combined two or more food ingredients. (C) Ready-to-bake pizzas prepared by a third party. Fresh or frozen read y-to-bake pizza procured by the seller from a third party or wholesaler is exempt from sales tax because it does not fall under the definition of \"prepared food\" as the seller did not mix or combine two or more food ingredients. (d) Exemption from taxation for certain meals (pre - pared food). Notwithstanding subsection (4)(a) and (b), above, meals sold under a state-administered nutrition pro - gram for the aged as provided for in the Older Americans Act (Public Law 95-478 Title III) and RCW 74.38.040, and meals sold to or for senior citizens, disabled persons, or low-income persons by a not-for-profit or ganization organized under chapter 24.03 or 24.12 RCW are exempt from retail sales and use tax. There is a sales tax exemption for meal sales for cer - tain fund-raising by nonprofit organizations. See WAC 458- 20-169. (5) Taxability of soft drinks. The exemption for \"food and food ingredients\" provided in RCW 82.08.0293 does holic beverages that contain natu ral or artificial sweeteners. Soft drinks do not include: (i) Beverages that contain milk or milk products, soy, rice, or similar milk substitutes; or (ii) Beverages that contain gr eater than fifty percent veg - etable or fruit juice by volume. (b) \"Soft drink\" examples. The examples in this sub - section identify a number of fact s and then state a conclusion. These examples should only be used as a general guide. Sim - ilar determinations for other situations can be made only after a review of all facts and circumstances. (i) The sale of bottled water, carbonated water, and fla - vored water, without natural or artificial sweeteners, is exempt from tax because they are defined as food in RCW 82.08.0293 and do not fall within the definition of \"soft drinks.\" If these products are so ld in a cup or glass, however, the sale is a sale of a \"prepared food\" and is subject to sales tax. See subsection (4)(a)(i) ab ove. Bottled water, carbon - ated water, and flavored water that contain natural or artifi - cial sweeteners are subject to sa les tax because they are \"soft drinks.\" (ii) Sports drinks that cont ain natural or artificial sweet - eners are subject to sales tax b ecause they fall within the def - inition of \"soft drinks.\" (iii) Fruit or vegetable juice that contains natural or arti - ficial sweeteners and contains fifty percent or less by volume of fruit or vegetable juice is subject to sales tax because it falls within the definition of \"soft drinks.\" (iv) Bottled coffee or tea drinks with natural or artificial sweeteners, but without milk or milk products, are \"soft drinks\" and are subject to retail sales tax. Bottled coffee or tea drinks, with or without sweeteners that contain milk or milk products are not subject to sale s tax because they do not fall within the definition of \"soft drinks.\" (6) Taxability of dietary supplements. The exemption for \"food and food ingredient s\" provided in RCW 82.08.0293 does apply to (a) \"Dietary supplements\" defined. \"Dietary supple - ment\" means any product, other than tobacco, intended to supplement the diet and that: (i) Contains one or more of the following dietary ingre - dients: (A) A vitamin; (B) A mineral; (C) An herb or other botanical; (D) An amino acid; (E) A dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (F) A concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in this subsection; (ii) Is intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, powder, soft gel, gelcap, or liquid form, or if not intended for inges - tion in such a form, is not represented as conventional food and is not represented for use as a sole item of a meal or of the diet; and (iii) Is required to be labeled as a dietary supplement, identifiable by the \"Supplement Facts\" box found on the label and as required under 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a7 101.36, as amended or renumbe red as of January 1, 2003. (b) \"Dietary supplements\" examples. The examples in this subsection identify a number of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should only be used as a general guide. Similar determinations for other situations can be made only after a review of all facts and circumstances. (i) Nutrition products in bar or liquid form formulated to provide balanced nutrition as a sole source of nourishment are considered a food and not a dietary supplement and are therefore exempt from taxation. (ii) A product sold for human consumption may have one or more of the following federal Food and Drug Admin - istration labels, a \"Nutrition Facts,\" a \"Dietary Supplements Facts,\" or a \"Drug Facts\" label. If a product label contains a \"Supplement Facts\" and \"Nutrition Facts\" box, the product is a food and not subject to tax if it does not otherwise qualify as prepared food. (7) Is ice sold for human consumption taxed? Ice sold for human consumption is considered a food or food ingredi - ent and is therefore exempt from retail sales tax. \"Ice sold for human consumption\" means ice sold in cube, shaved, or crushed form and in quantities of ten pounds or less in weight per bag or container. Blocks of ice of any weight are not con - sidered a food or food ingredient and are therefore taxable. See WAC 458-20-120 (Sales of ice) for additional guidance on the sale of ice. (8) Combination businesses. The sale of \"food and food ingredients\" or \"prepared food\" sold in the same manner Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-092 [ 73 ] Proposedshould receive the same tax treat ment regardless of the estab - lishment in which the item is sold. Persons operating a com - bination of two kinds of food sa les businesses at one location must keep their accounting reco rds and sales receipts segre - gated between taxable and tax exempt sales. Examples of combination businesses are a grocery store with a lunch counter or salad-deli bar, a bakery that sells tax-exempt baked goods and also sells baked goods with eating utensils or as part of a meal, and a gas station/convenience store. (a) Tax collecting responsibility. Combination busi - nesses must collect and re port retail sales tax upon their charges for prepared foods. It is sufficient segregation for accounting purposes if cash regi sters or electronic checking machines are programm ed to identify and separately tax food that is not tax exempt. If the combined food business' sales are commingled in their accounting records, all sales of food and food ingredients are subject to retail sales tax. (b) Combination business examples. The examples in this subsection identify a number of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should only be used as a general guide. Similar determinations for other situations can be made only after a review of all facts and circumstances. (i) A consumer purchases his wedding cake, a donut, and a cup of coffee from Bakery. The sale of the wedding cake is not taxable if Bakery maintains adequate records for sale of food items that are generally not sold with eating utensils and do not otherwise qualify as pr epared food. The sale of the donut is taxable because it is a f ood that is generally sold with eating utensils, a napkin. The sale of the coffee is taxable because it is served with an eating utensil, the cup, and because it is sold in a heated state by the seller. (ii) Grocery Store has a deli section that prepares and sells deli foods and provides a salad bar where the customer can make a salad. A customer purchases a salad that he made from the salad bar and a bottle of apple juice that is one hun - dred percent fruit juice. The sale of a salad from the salad bar is taxable because it is generally sold with eating utensils (e.g., a plate, fork, knife, spoon, or napkin). The sale of the apple juice is exempt because it is food and not a \"soft drink\" because it is more than fifty percen t fruit juice. (iii) Gas Station has a conven ience store that sells \"food and food ingredients,\" \"prepared food,\" and nonfood prod - ucts. The sale of \"food and food ingredients\" is not taxable if Gas Station maintains adequate r ecords for sale of food items that are generally not sold with eating utensils and do not oth - erwise qualify as prepared food. (9) How are packages of food items that contain tax - able and nontaxable items taxed? When a package consists of both food and nonfood products, such as a holiday or pic - nic basket containing beer and pretzels, cups or glasses con - taining food items, or soft drinks along with cheese and crackers, the food portion may be tax exempt if its price is stated separately. If the pri ce is a lump sum, the sales tax applies to the entire price. Nonfood items given to buyers to promote food or food ingredient sales such as coffee sold in a decorative apothe - cary container or cheese sold in a serving dish are not taxable and are not deemed combination packages where it is clear that the nonfood item is simply a gift furnished as a sales inducement for the food. In the same way, promotional give-aways of food items as an inducement for sales of nonfood items are not exempt (e.g., the sa le of crystal ware containing candy or nuts is fully subject to sales tax). (10) Purchases made under th e Food Stamp Act of 1977. RCW 82.08.0297 provides a retail sales tax exemption for the sale of eligible foods that are purchased with coupons issued only under the federal Food Stamp Act of 1977. The term \"food coupon\" does not include manufacturers' cou - pons, grocers' coupons, or other coupons issued by private parties. \"Eligible foods\" has the same meaning as established under federal law for the purposes of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. The term includes any food or food ingredient intended for human consumption except alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and hot foods or hot food ingredients prepared for immediate consumption. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012(g), as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003. The term \"coupon,\" as used in this subsection, mean s any coupon, stamp, type of certificate, authorization card, cas h or check issued in lieu of a coupon, or access device, including an electronic benefit transfer card or personal iden tification number issued pursu - ant to the provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. 7 CFR \u00a7 271.2, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003. (a) Purchasing nonfood products with food coupons. Some nonfood products may be exempt if purchased with food coupons. For example, seeds and growing plants are considered \"nonfood products,\" even though they may be sold at grocery stores and can be ingested by humans. How - ever, seeds and plants to grow foods for the personal con - sumption of eligible households are \"eligible foods\" under the Food Stamp Act of 1977. 7 CFR \u00a7 271.2, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003 . Therefore, in this limited circumstance, the sale of seed s and plants is tax exempt. When both coupons and cash (or check) are used to make purchases, the coupons must be applied first to \"eligible foods\" which are not otherwise tax exempt \"food or food ingredients.\" For example, soft drinks and garden seeds are \"eligible foods\" under the food stamp program but are not tax exempt under RCW 82.08.0293. The intent is always to apply the coupons and cash in such a way as to provide the greatest possible amount of retail sales tax exemption under the law. (b) Food coupon examples. The examples in this sub - section identify a numb er of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should only be used as a general guide. Sim - ilar determinations for other situations can be made only after a review of all facts and ci rcumstances. The following exam - ples demonstrate how the tax exemption applies in cases where a purchase of ten dollars each is made for meat (a food ingredient), soda pop (an eligible food), and soap (a nonfood item) using both coupons and cash. (i) The customer pays with fifteen dollars in coupons and fifteen dollars in cash. The coupons are applied first to the soda pop (ten dollars worth) and then to the meat (five dollars worth). The cash applies to the re st of the meat and the soap. Retail sales tax is due on the ten-dollar purchase of soap because soap is not an \"eligi ble food\" under the food stamp program. (ii) A customer pays the thirty-dollar selling price with ten dollars worth of coupons and twenty dollars cash. The coupons are applied to the soda pop, making the soda pop exempt. The cash is applied towa rds the purchase of the meat WSR 06-22-092 Washington St ate Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 74 ]and soap. The result is that retail sales tax is due only on the ten-dollar purchase of soap. (iii) The customer pays with five dollars worth of cou - pons and twenty-five dollars in cash. Again, the coupons are first applied towards the soda pop, leaving five dollars of the value to be purchased with cash. Retail sales tax is due on fif - teen dollars, the ten-dollar purchase of soap and five dollars worth of soda pop. (11) How are food vending van sales taxed? Food and food ingredient sales from vehicular vending vans are taxable or exempt of retail sales tax in the same manner as food sales at grocery stores. Thus, sales of candy bars, gum, or any pre - wrapped food and food ingredients which are prepackaged by a manufacturer or preparer ot her than the person operating the van are exempt from retail sa les tax. Sales of any prepared food items or soft drinks, including, but not limited to, hot - dogs, sandwiches, soups, and hot or cold beverages are sub - ject to retail sales tax. See de finition of \"prepared food\" in subsection (4)(a), above. )) (a) What is the purpose of this section? This section, WAC 458-20-244, provides guidelines for determining if food or food ingredients qualify for the retail sales tax and use tax exemptions under RCW 82.08.0293 and 82.12.0293 (collectively referred to in this section as the \"exemptions\"). There is no corresponding business and occupation (B&O) tax exemption. Even if a sale of food or food ingredi - ents is exempt from retail sales tax or use tax under the exemptions, gross proceeds from sales of food or food ingre - dients remain subject to the retailing B&O tax. (b) How has the law changed since the prior version of this section was published? In 2003 and 2004, the legis - lature amended RCW 82.08.0293 and 82.12.0293 to comply with the national Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. These amendments alter the definitions used to determine whether a particular food or food ingredient qualifies for the exemptions. (c) What other sections might apply? The following sections may contain additional relevant information: WAC 458-20-119 (Sales of meals); and similar (Special stadium sales and use tax); WAC 458-20-166 (Hotels, motels, boarding houses, rooming houses, resorts, summ er camps, trailer camps, etc.); WAC 458-20-167 (Education institutions, school dis - tricts, student organizatio ns, and private schools); WAC 458-20-168 (Hospitals, medical care facilities, and adult family homes); and WAC 458-20-169 (Nonprofit organizations). (2) What qualifies for the exemptions? (a) In general. The exemptions apply to food and food ingredients. \"Food and food ingredients\" means substances, whether in liquid, concentrated, solid, frozen, dried, or dehy - drated form, that are sold for ingestion or chewing by humans and are consumed for their taste or nutritional value. (b) Items not used for ingestion or chewing. Items that are commonly ingested or chew ed by humans for their taste or nutritional value but which may also be used for other pur - poses are treated as food or food ingredients. For example, pumpkins are presumed to be a food or food ingredient unless the pumpkin is sold painted or is otherwise clearly for deco - rative purposes rather than consumption. This is true even though the purchaser may use an undecorated pumpkin for carving and display rather than for eating. (3) What does not qualify for the exemptions? The exemptions do not apply to the following items, which are not considered \"food or food ingredients\" or which are other - wise specifically exclud ed from the exemptions: (a) Items sold for medical or hygiene purposes. Items commonly used for medical or hygiene purposes, such as cough drops, breath sprays, toothpaste, etc., are not ingested for taste or nutrition and are not considered a food or food ingredient. In contrast, breath mints are commonly ingested for taste and are considered a food or food ingredient. (b) Bulk sales of ice. Ice sold in bags, containers, or units of greater than ten pounds and blocks of ice of any weight are not considered a food or food ingredient. Ice sold in cubed, shaved, or crushed form in packages or quantities of ten pounds or less is considered a food or food ingredient. Refer to WAC 458-20-120 (Sales of ice) for additional guid - ance on the sale of ice. (c) Alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages are excluded from the definition of food and food ingredients. \"Alcoholic beverages\" means be verages that are suitable for human consumption and contain one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume. (d) Tobacco. Tobacco is excluded from the definition of food and food ingredients. \"Tobacco\" includes cigarettes, cigars, chewing or pipe tobacco , or any other items that con - tain tobacco. (e) Soft drinks. Soft drinks are excluded from the exemptions. \"Soft drinks\" means any nonalcoholic beverage that contains natural or artif icial sweeteners, except bever - ages that contain: Milk or milk products; Soy, rice, or similar milk substitutes; or More than fifty percent by volume of vegetable or fruit juice. For example, sweetened sports beverages are considered \"soft drinks,\" but a sweetened soy beverage is a food or food ingredient. Beverage mixes that are not sold in liquid form are not soft drinks even though they are intended to be made into a beverage by the customer. Examples include powdered fruit drinks, powdered tea or coffee drinks, and frozen concen - trates. These items are a food or food ingredient and are not subject to retail sales tax. (f) Dietary supplements. Dietary supplements are excluded from the exemptions. \"Dietary supplement\" means any product intended to supplement the diet, other than tobacco, which meets all of the following requirements: Contains a vitamin; mineral; herb or other botanical; amino acid; a substance for use by humans to increase total dietary intake; or a concentrat e, metabolite, constituent, extract; or combination of any of them; Is intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, powder, soft gel, gelcap, or liquid form, or if not intended for ingestion in such a form, is not represented as conventional food and is Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-092 [ 75 ] Proposednot represented for use as a sole item of a meal or of the diet; and Is required to be labeled with a Food and Drug Admin - istration \"supplement facts\" box. If a product is otherwise considered a food or food ingredient and labeled with both a \"supplement facts\" box and \"nutrition facts\" box, the product is treated as a food or food ingredient. Nutrition products formulated to provide balanced nutri - tion as a sole source of a meal or of the diet are considered a food or food ingredient and not a dietary supplement. Refer to RCW 82.08.925 for information on the sales tax exemp - tion applicable to dietary supplements dispensed under a pre - scription. (g) Prepared food. Prepared food is excluded from the exemptions. Prepared food ge nerally means heated foods, combined foods, or foods sold with utensils provided by the seller, as described in more detail in subsection (4) of this section. \"Prepared food\" does not include food sold by a seller whose proper primary No rth American industry classi - fication system (NAICS) classification is manufacturing in sector 311, except subsector 3 118 (bakeries), unless the food is sold with utensils provided by the seller (see subsection (4)(c) of this section). (4) What is \"prepared food\"? Food or food ingredi - ents are \"prepared foods\" if any one of the following are true: (a) Heated foods. Food or food ingredients are \"pre - pared foods\" if sold in a heat ed state or are heated by the seller, except bakery items. \"Bakery items\" include bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, cr oissants, pastries, donuts, Dan - ish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, mu ffins, bars, cookies, and torti - llas. Food is sold in a heated st ate or is heated by the seller when the seller provides the food to the customer at a temper - ature that is higher than the ai r temperature of the seller's establishment. Food is not sold in a heated state or heated by the seller if the customer, rather than the seller, heats the food in a microwave provided by the seller. (b) Combined foods. Food or food ingredients are \"pre - pared foods\" if the item sold consists of two or more foods or food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, unless the food or food ingredients are any of the following: Bakery items (defined in (a) of this subsection); Items that the seller only cuts, repackages, or pasteur - izes; Items that contain eggs, fish, meat, or poultry, in a raw or undercooked state requiring cooking to prevent food-borne illness; or Items sold in an unheated state as a single item at a price that varies based on weight or volume. (c) Food sold with utensils provided by the seller. Food or food ingredients are \"prepared foods\" if sold with utensils provided by the selle r. Utensils include plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, and straws. A plate does not include a containe r or packaging used to trans - port the food. (i) Utensils are customarily provided by the seller. Food or food ingredients are \"sold with utensils provided by the seller\" if the seller's customary practice is to physically deliver or hand a utensil to the customer with the food or food ingredient as part of the sales tr ansaction. If the food or food ingredients are prepack aged with a utensil, the seller is con - sidered to have physically delivered a utensil to the customer unless the food and utensil are prepackaged together by a food manufacturer classified under sector 311 of the NAICS. Examples of utensils provided by such manufacturers include juice boxes that are packaged with drinking straws, and yogurt or ice cream cups that are packaged with wooden or plastic spoons. (ii) Utensils are necessary to receive the food. Individ - ual food or food ingredient item s are \"sold with utensils pro - vided by the seller\" if a plate, gl ass, cup, or bowl is necessary to receive the food or food ingredient and the seller makes those utensils available to its customers. For example, items obtained from a self-serve salad bar are sold with utensils provided by the seller, because th e customer must use a bowl or plate provided by the seller in order to receive the items. (iii) Seller of predominantly prepared food makes utensils available. All food and food ingredients sold at an establishment are \"sold with utensils provided by the seller\" if the seller makes utensils ava ilable to its customers and the seller is in the business of selling predominantly prepared food. A seller is in the business of selling predominantly pre - pared food if the seller's gros s sales of prepared food under (a), (b), and (c)(ii) of this subsection equal more than sev - enty-five percent of the seller's gross sales of food, food ingredients, soft drinks and dietary supplements. (A) Exception for four or more servings. Even if a seller is in the business of selling predominantly prepared food, four servings or more of food or food ingredients pack - aged for sale as a single item and sold for a single price are not \"sold with utensils provided by the seller\" unless the seller's customary practice is to physically hand or otherwise deliver a utensil to the customer as part of the sales transac - tion. Whenever available, the number of servings included in a package of food or food ingr edients is to be determined based on the manufacturer's product label. If no label is available, the seller must reas onably determine the number of servings. (B) Determining total sales of prepared foods. T h e seller must determine a single pr epared food sales percentage annually for all the seller's es tablishments in the state based on the prior year of sales. Th e seller may elect to determine its prepared food sales percenta ge based either on the prior tax year or on the prior fiscal year. A seller may not change its elected method for determin ing its prepared food percent - age without the written consent of the department of revenue. The seller must determine its annual prepared food sales per - centage as soon as possible after accounting records are avail - able, but in no event later than ninety days after the beginning of the seller's tax or fiscal year. A seller may make a good faith estimate of its first annual prepared food sales percent - age if the seller's records for th e prior year are not sufficient to allow the seller to calculat e the prepared food sales per - centage. The seller must adjust its good faith estimate pro - spectively if its relative sales of prepared foods in the first ninety days of operation materially depart from the seller's estimate. (d) Examples. The following exam ples identify a num - ber of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should be used only as a general guide. The tax results of WSR 06-22-092 Washington St ate Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 76 ]other situations must be determined after a review of all of the facts and circumstances. (i) Example 1. Fast Cafe sells hot and cold coffee and mixed coffee and milk beverages, cold soft drinks, bottled water, milk and juice in single-serving containers, sand - wiches, whole fruits, cold pasta salad, cookies and other past - ries. Fast Cafe prepares the past a salad on-site. It orders the pastries from a local bakery, including specialty cakes which it sells both as whole cakes and by the slice. It purchases its sandwiches from a local caterer . The sandwiches are deliv - ered by the caterer prewrapped in plastic with condiments and a plastic knife. Fast Cafe makes straws, napkins and cup lids available for all customers by placing them on a self-ser - vice stand. In its first full year of operation, Fast Cafe gross sales of food and food ingredient s, soft drinks, and dietary supplements is $100,000. Of this gross sales total, $80,000 is from the sale of hot coffee an d hot and cold mixed coffee and milk beverages, all sold in disposable paper or plastic cups with the Fast Cafe logo. Because more than 75% of Fast Cafe's total sales of food, food ingredients, soft drinks and dietary supplements are sales of food or food ingredient s that are heated or combined by the seller or sold with a ut ensil (cups) necessary to receive the food, Fast Cafe is in the business of selling predominantly prepared food. Because Fast Cafe makes utensils available for its customers, all food and food ingredients sold by Fast Cafe are considered \"prepared food,\" including the cold milk beverages, cookies and pastries, pasta salad, sandwiches and whole fruits. The only exception is the sale of whole spe - cialty cakes. Because a whole cake contains four or more servings, it is not subject to retail sales tax unless Fast Cafe customarily hands a utensil to the customer as part of the sale transaction. (ii) Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, but that only $60,000 of Fast Cafe's Year 1 gross sales were sales of hot coffee and hot and cold mixed coffee and milk beverages. The remainder of its sales were sales of sand - wiches, whole fruits, cookies an d other pastries. Under these facts, Fast Cafe is not consider ed to be in the business of sell - ing predominantly prepared food. The items sold by Fast Cafe are taxed as follows: Hot coffee and milk beverage s are heated by the seller and are also sold by Fast Cafe with a utensil (a paper cup) necessary to receive the food. The hot coffee and milk bev - erages are \"prepared food\" for e ither reason and are subject to retail sales tax. Cold milk beverages or a combination of two or more foods or food ingredients are al so sold by Fast Cafe with a utensil (a paper or plastic cup) necessary to receive the food. The cold milk beverages are \"pre pared food\" for either reason and are subject to retail sales tax. Cold soft drinks are not exem pt and are subject to retail sales tax. Sandwiches prepared by the caterer are subject to retail sales tax. Even though the caterer, rather than the seller, combines the ingredient s and includes a utensil, Fast Cafe is considered to have provided the utensil because the caterer is not a food manufacturer classi fied under sector 311 of the NAICS. Pasta salad is combined by the seller and is subject to retail sales tax. Note that if the pasta salad was sold by the pound, rather than by servings, it would not be subject to retail sales tax. Bottled water, milk and juice in single serving contain - ers, whole fruit, cookies, pastries, slices of cake, and whole cakes are not subject to retail sales tax unless the seller's cus - tomary practice is to hand a utensi l to the customer as part of the sales transaction. None of these items are heated by the seller, combined by the seller, or require a plate, glass, cup, or bowl in order to receive the item. Even if Fast Cafe heats the pastries for its customers, the pa stries are not subject to retail sales tax. (5) How are combined sales of taxable and exempt items taxed? (a) Combined sales. Where two or more distinct and identifiable items, at least one of which is a food or food ingredient, are sold fo r one nonitemized price: The entire transaction is taxable if the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable items is greater than fifty percent of the combin ed purchase price or sales price; and The entire transaction is exempt from retail sales tax if the seller's purchase price or sales price is fifty percent or less of the combined purchase price or sales price. The seller may make the determination based on either purchase price or sales price, but may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price. (b) Examples. (i) A combination wine and cheese picnic basket con - tains four items packaged togeth er: A bottle of wine, a wine opener, single-serving cheeses, and the picnic basket holding these items. The seller's purcha se price for the wine, wine- opener, and picnic basket totals ten dollars. The seller's pur - chase price for the cheeses is two dollars. The seller must collect retail sales taxes on th e entire package, because the seller's purchase price for the taxable items (ten dollars) is greater than fifty percent of the combined purchase price (twelve dollars). (ii) A retailer sells a deco rative jar containing individu - ally wrapped candies for the selling price of fifteen dollars. The retailer sells the decorative jar by itself for the price of five dollars. The retailer's selling price for the candy alone is seven dollars. The retailer is not required to collect retail sales taxes on the decorative ja r filled with candies, because the retailer's selling price for the tax exempt candies is greater than its selling price for the taxable jar. (c) Incidental packaging. \"Distinct and identifiable items\" does not include packaging which is immaterial or incidental to the sale of another item or items. For example, a decorative bag sold filled wi th candy is not the sale of \"dis - tinct and identifiable\" items where the bag is merely orna - mental packaging immaterial in the sale of the candy. (d) Free items. \"Distinct and identifiable items\" does not include items provided free of charge. An item is only provided free of charge if the seller's sales price does not vary depending on whether the item is included in the sale. (6) What are the seller's a ccounting requirements? All sales of food and food ingredients at an establishment will be treated as taxable unless the seller separately accounts for sales of exempt and nonexempt food and food ingredients. It Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-092 [ 77 ] Proposedis sufficient separation for acco unting purposes if cash regis - ters or the like are programmed to identify items that are not tax exempt and to calculate and assess the proper sales tax accordingly. (7) Are there any other retail sales tax exemptions that apply? (a) Meals served by not-fo r-profit organizations. The exemptions apply to meals sold under a state-administered nutrition program for the aged as provided for in the Older Americans Act (Public Law 95-478 Title III) and RCW 74.38.040, and meals sold to or for senior citizens, disabled persons, or low-income pers ons by a not-for-profit organiza - tion organized under chapter 24.03 or 24.12 RCW. The exemptions apply even if the meals would otherwise be con - sidered prepared food. (b) Foods exempt under the Federal Food Stamp Act. Under RCW 82.08.0297, eligib le foods under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 purchased with food coupons are exempt from the retail sales tax. This is a separate and broader exemption than the retail sales exemption for food and food ingredients under RCW 82.08.0293. For example, soft drinks and garden seeds are \"e ligible foods\" but are not a \"food or food ingredients.\" If such items are purchased with food coupons, they are exempt from the retail sales tax under RCW 82.08.0297, even though the items do not qualify for the exemption under RCW 82.08.0293. (i) Definition of food coupons. The term \"food cou - pons,\" as used in this subsection means any coupon, stamp, type of certificate, authorizatio n card, cash or ch eck issued in lieu of a coupon, or access de vice, including an electronic benefit transfer card or persona l identification number issued pursuant to the provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. See 7 CFR \u00a7 271.2, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003. (ii) Use of food coupons comb ined with other means of payment. When both food coupons and other means of payment are used in the same sales transaction, for purposes of collecting retail sales taxes, the other means of payment shall be applied first to items which are food and food ingre - dients exempt under RCW 82.08.0293. The intent is to apply the coupons and other means of payment in such a way as to provide the greatest possible exemption from retail sales tax. (iii) Example. A customer purchases the following at a grocery store: Meat for three dollars, cereal for three dollars, canned soft drinks for five dol lars, and soap for two dollars for a total of thirteen dollars. The customer pays with seven dollars in coupons and six dollars in cash. The cash is applied first to the soap because the soap is neither exempt under RCW 82.08.0293 nor an eligible food under the Food Stamp Act. The remaining cash (four dollars) is applied first to the meat and the cereal. The food st amps are applied to the bal - ance of the meat and cereal (two dollars) and to the soft drinks (five dollars). Retail sales tax is due only on the soap. (8) Vending machine sales. The exemptions do not apply to sales of food and food ingredients dispensed from vending machines. There are sp ecial requiremen ts for report - ing sales tax collected on vendin g machine sales, discussed in (a) of this subsection. \"Honor box\" sales (sales of snacks or other items from open display trays) are not considered vend - ing machine sales.(a) Calculating and reporting retail sales tax collected on vending machine sales. Vending machine owners do not need to state the retail sales tax amount separately from the selling price. See RCW 82.08.050(5) and 82.08.0293. Instead, vending machine owners must determine the amount of retail sales tax collected on the sale of food or food ingre - dients by using one of the following methods: (i) Food or food ingredient s dispensed in a heated state. For food or food ingredients dispensed from vending machines in a heated state (e.g ., hot coffee, soups, tea, and hot chocolate), a vending mach ine owner must calculate the amount of retail sales tax that has been collected (\"tax in gross\") based on the gross ve nding machine proceeds. The \"tax in gross\" is a deduction against the gross amount of both retailing B&O and retail sales. The formula is: gross machine proceeds - [(gr oss machine proceeds) / (1 +sales tax rate)] = tax in gross (ii) All other food or food ingredients. For all other food and food ingredients dispensed from vending machines, a vending machine owner must calculate the amount of retail sales tax that has been collected (\"tax in gross\") based on fifty-seven percent of the gr oss vending machine proceeds. The \"tax in gross\" is a deduction against the gross amount of both retailing B&O and retail sales. The formula is: (gross machine proceeds x .57) x sales tax rate = tax in gross The remaining 43% of the gross vending machine pro - ceeds, less the \"tax in gross\" am ount, is reported as an exempt food sales deduction against re tail sales proceeds only calcu - lated as follows: (gross machine proceeds x .43) - tax in gross = exempt food deduction (b) Example. Jane owns a vending machine business with machines in Spokane and Seattle. In each location, she has a vending machine selling candy, soft drinks, and water and a second vending machine selling hot cocoa and coffee drinks. Her annual sales for the vending machines and the combined retail sales tax rates for Seattle and Spokane are as follows: Coffee Machine (cocoa & cof - fee)Candy Machine (candy, soft drinks, & water)Combined Retail Sales Tax Rate Seattle $2,500 $10,000 .088 Spokane $3,000 $6,000 .086 To determine the amount of retail sales tax she collected on the sale of cocoa and coffee (food dispensed in a heated state), Jane calculates the \"tax in gross\" amount as follows: gross machine proceeds - [(gr oss machine proceeds) / (1 + sales tax rate)] = tax in gross $2,500 - ($2,500/1.088) = $202.21 (Seattle coffee machine) machine)WSR 06-22-096A State Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 78 ]$439.78 Thus, for both retailing B&O and retail sales, Jane must report her total gross coffee m achine proceeds of $5,500 with a \"tax in gross\" deduction of $439.78. To determine the amount of re tail sales tax she collected on the sale of candy, soft drinks and water, Jane calculates the \"tax in gross\" amount as follows: (gross machine proceeds x .57) x sales tax rate = tax in gross $10,000 x .57 x .088 = $294.12 (Seattle candy machine) $6,000 x .57 x .086 = $501.60 (Spokane candy machine) $795.72 Thus, for both retailing B&O and retail sales, Jane must report her total gross candy machine proceeds of $16,000 with a \"tax in gross\" deduction of $795.72. Jane must also report an exempt food sales deduction representing the remaining 43% of the gross candy machine proceeds. (43% x gross machine proceeds) - tax in gross = exempt food deduction (.43 x $16,000) - $795.72 = $6,084.28 Jane reports the exempt food sales deduction only against the gross amount of her retail sales. The deduction does not apply to retailing B&O.

Assistance for Persons with Di sabilities: Contact Arlene Robertson by January 19, 2007, TTY (800) 833-6388 or 711. Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: WAC 246-854- 020, the proposal specifies the level of education and training needed for osteopathic physician assistants (PA) by identify - ing approved programs. Accredited programs will provide consistent training standards for licensure eligibility. Pro - posed language also provides for training and approval of new skills.WSR 06-22-100 Washington St ate Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 84 ]WAC 246-854-080, the proposal identifies the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants exami - nation as being approved by the board of osteopathic medi - cine and surgery (board) to meet the minimal qualifications for licensure. The examinat ion implements legislative changes made by SB 5702 in 1999. New section WAC 246-854-085, the proposal provides for an interim permit for one-y ear until the licensee can pass the examination. Since the interim permit is a new license category, a new section has been established which defines permitted practice. The interim permit implements legisla - tive changes made by SB 5702. WAC 246-854-090, the proposed modifications will per - mit an osteopathic physician to supervise multiple PAs with - out special board approval; addr ess required chart reviews for licensed PAs; clarify that PA s may sign birth and death cer - tificates; require notification of termination of the osteopathic physician/osteopathic physician as sistant relationship to the board from both parties. These proposed changes are needed so that practice standards will be similar to allopathic physi - cian assistants. The proposal s will reduce the supervisory burden on osteopathic physicia ns while maintaining over - sight of the PAs' practice. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The proposed rules will allow more flexibility in most practices, especially rural areas and remote practices, by allowi ng 10% of the charts to be reviewed after the first thirty da ys of practice. These and the other proposed changes provide more consistency with the practice and supervision standards established for allopathic physician assistants.

Current ly without rules in place the access to pain management care fo r podiatric patients is lim - ited. As a result of establishing rules, under-treatment of chronic pain may be reduced and access to care enhanced.

A small business economic impact statement has been prepared under ch apter 19.85 RCW. Small Business Economic Impact Statement 1. Briefly describe the proposed rule: The Washing - ton podiatric medical board (board) adopted podiatric physi - cian guidelines for prescribi ng, dispensing, and administer - ing opioids, also known as pain management guidelines. These guidelines became effect ive on September 13, 1996. The guidelines describe approved opioid therapy for acute, chronic, and intractable pain patients. However, the guide - lines do not protect the podiatric physician who manages pain through opioid therapy to practice without fear of injudicious discipline from the board regarding such things as drug addi - tion and diversion. As a result, under-treatment of chronic pain affects the public health, safety, and welfare of the resi -dents of Washington state. In order to improve patient care and access to care, new sections in the Washington Adminis - trative Code (WAC) are needed to reassure podiatric physi - cians they can use opioids to effectively manage pain. The proposed rule will: Reassure podiatric physicians who are treating pain consistent with currently acceptable medical practice that they need not fear disciplinary action by the board for prescribing, dispensing, or administering controlled substances, including opioids. Advise podiatric physicians to follow the preestab - lished pain management guid elines that specifically address the patient evaluation and treatment plan, informed consent, periodic reviews, use of consulta - tions and the necessity for maintaining accurate and complete medical records. Describe the need for a podia tric physician to possess knowledge about the complexity of pain terminology and treatment modalities. Assure that patient care is clinically sound. The pro - posal will provide a basis for the board to assess care provided against established standards. 2. Is a small business eco nomic impact statement (SBEIS) required for this rule? Yes. The proposed rules have more than a minor impact on small businesses. 3. Which industries are affected by this rule? In pre - paring this SBEIS, the departme nt of health (DOH) used the following codes: SIC Industry Code and Title # of Businesses# of EmployeesAverage # of Employees for Smallest Businesses <=50Average # of Employees for Largest Businesses >50 8043 Offices and Clinics of Podiatrists136 480 3.6 0 8049 Offices and Clinics of Health Practitioners, Not Else - where Classified913 5450 4.5 102.9 8062 General Medical and Sur - gical Hospitals146 78593 11.1 758.4 4. What are the costs of co mplying with this rule for small businesses (those with fifty or fewer employees) and for the largest 10% of businesses affected? The costs asso - ciated with the prop osed rules include: Time with Patient and Record keeping: It will be necessary for pr oviders to spend additional time with each patient. Periodic reviews of pain patients will be required to ensure effective interven - tions and compliance with treatment modalities, including opioid therapy. Since podiatrists' scope of practice does not include treatment of systemic condi - tions, very few podiatric ph ysicians provide long-term pain management. They would only provide this type of care if there is no one else that the patient can be referred to. The number of treating podiatrists is lim - ited to five or six podiatrists within the state. Each of these podiatrists will have only one or two patients they would manage with controlled substances. Since con - trolled substances cannot be re filled, patients will need to be seen at least once a month to have new prescrip - tions written for them and their progress monitored. Based on a DOH survey it is estimated that an addi - tional fifteen minutes per visit will be required and will cost the provider an additional $19.34. An average pain management patient wi ll require approximately twelve visits per year. Th e annual additional cost per pain patient will be [(12 patient visits x $19.34)] $232.08. Since these types of patients are considered more com - plex and take more time to manage, the practitioner can charge more for their services. It is likely that the addi - tional time spent will be reimbursed by insurance carri - ers. More frequent patient screenings will therefore require additional record keeping and maintenance. Since the standard of care requires r ecord keeping, the costs asso - ciated with this are assumed to be minimal. The proposed rules will requir e additional time for each pain patient visit to ensure ad herence to the podiatric pain WSR 06-22-102 Washington St ate Register, Issue 06-22 Proposed [ 90 ]guidelines. The costs are estimated to cost an additional $232.08 annually for each pain patient. Since most pain patients will be referred to fa mily practice or pain specialist physicians, management of pain patients will be limited in podiatric practices. Since reimbursement rates are determined by the com - plexity of a patient's condition, systems evaluated, diagnostic tests performed, etc., it is likely that the estimated costs to the practitioner would be fully or partially reimbursed. Podiatric Physician Education: Knowledge of pain management treatment is required for podiatric physicians to treat chronic pain patients. It is estimated that a basic training course will consist of a minimum of eight hours. The cost of a course is estimated to be $800. In addition, personal expenses and costs associated with the course is estimated at $200. The total cost for obtaining a basic course is esti - mated to be $1,000. If they choose to take a compre - hensive course in pain management, it would only be taken one time. Periodically it may be nece ssary for podiatric physi - cians to obtain additional e ducation to continue to treat chronic pain patients by keeping informed about new therapies and medications. Since continuing education is required to maintain their license, any additional courses pertaining to the practice of pain management could be obtained to fulfill that requirement. The addi - tional education would be related to their general prac - tice and not attributed directly to the cost of the pro - posed rule. Most podiatric physicians obtain educational courses during nonbusiness hours and therefore the additional training would not interfere with their ability to see patients. Each podiatric physician who chooses to treat chronic pain patients may decide to take a comprehensive training course to gain knowledge regarding pain management. An initial comprehensive training course is estimated to cost a practitioner $1,000. It is assumed that initially all podiatric physicians practicing pain management will take a compre - hensive training course. Subs equent continuing education courses may also be obtained periodically to learn new treat - ment modalities and become familiar with new medications. However, if a practitioner chose to take additional courses in pain management, these would be taken to benefit their gen - eral practice and those costs woul d not be attributed directly to the proposed rules. These co urses could be used to fulfill the continuing education requi rements needed to maintain their license. Most podiatric physicians obtain educational courses during nonbusiness hours and therefore the additional train - ing would not interfere with their ability to see patients. The cost is the same for all practitioners. However, for those businesses that pay for practitioners' education, the costs will vary depending on the number of practitioners in each busi - ness that treats pain patients. The education costs of comp liance with the proposed rules are $1,000 and are the same for pr actitioners in small businesses as those in large busi nesses if practitioners pay for the costs of their education. 5. Does the rule impose a disproportionate impact on small businesses? If practitioners pay for the costs of their education, then the $1,000 education costs will be the same for all. However, if education costs were paid by institutions that hire these practitioners, then small businesses would dis - proportionately be impacted as the following table indicates. Education: Podiatric Physicians SIC Industry Code and TitleAverage # of Employees for Smallest BusinessesAverage # of Employees for 10% of Largest BusinessesCosts of Rule Change Small BusinessesCosts of Rule Change Large BusinessesAverage Cost Per Employee Small BusinessesAverage Cost Per Employee Large Businesses 8043 Offices & Clinics of Podi - atrists 3.6 7.8 $1000 $1000 $277.77 and Clinics of Health Elsewhere Classified 4.5 27.4 $1000 $1000 $1000 $90.09 $.49 Both small and large businesses may incur a benefit from the additional time spent to properly manage pain with, among other remedies, opioids. Additional time taken to appropriately treat a patient's pain with medications could alleviate the cost incurred fo r unnecessary return visits because of ineffective pain interventions and improper self- medicating.Washington State Register, Issue 06-22 WSR 06-22-103 [ 91 ] Proposed6. If the rule imposes a di sproportionate impact on small businesses, what efforts were taken to reduce that impact (or why is it not \"legal and feasible\" to do so) by: It is not legal or feasible to mitigate the impact to small busi - nesses because the standard of care must be fo llowed by all podiatric physicians. 7. How are small businesses involved in the develop - ment of this rule? Small businesses have been involved through individuals on the DOH interested parties list and also through professional associations.

A small business economic impact statement has been prepared under ch apter 19.85 RCW. Small Business Economic Impact Statement 1. Briefly describe the proposed rule: The Washing - ton board of osteopathic medicine and surgery (board) adopted pain management guidelines for osteopathic physi - cians and osteopathic physician assistants for prescribing, dispensing, and administering opioids. These guidelines became effective on November 1, 1996. The guidelines describe approved opioid th erapy for acute , chronic and intractable pain patients. However, the guidelines do not pro - tect the osteopathic physician or osteopathic physician assis - tant who manages pain thr ough opioid therapy to practice without fear of injudicious discipline from the board regard - ing such things as drug addition [addiction] and diversion. As a result, under-treatment of chronic pain is affecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Wash -ington state. In order to improve patient care and access to care, new sections in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) are needed to outline appropriate standards for pain management and to reassure osteopathic physicians and osteopathic physician assistants that they can use opioids to effectively manage pain. The proposed rule will: Reassure osteopathic physicians and osteopathic physi - cian assistants who are treat ing pain consistent with currently acceptable medical pr actice that they need not fear disciplinary action by the board for prescribing, dispensing, or administering controlled substances, including opioids. Advise osteopathic physici ans and osteopathic physi - cian assistants to follow the preestablished pain man - agement guidelines that speci fically address the patient evaluation and treatment plan , informed consent, peri - odic reviews, use of consul tations and the necessity for maintaining accurate and complete medical records.

What are the costs of co mplying with this rule for small businesses (those with fifty or fewer employees) and for the largest 10% of businesses affected? The costs asso - ciated with the prop osed rules include: Time with Patient and Record Keeping: If an osteopathic physician were to treat a patient for pain management, it will be necessary for them to spend additional time with each patient. Periodic reviews of pain patients will be required to ensure effective interventions and compliance with treatment modalities, including opioid therapy. Based on a DOH survey it is estimated that an additional fifteen minutes per visit will be required and will cost an osteopathic physician an additional $19.34. Since controlled sub - stances (i.e. opioids) cannot be refilled, patients will need to be seen at least once a month to have new pre - scriptions written for them and to monitor their progress. If an osteopathic physician spends fifteen minutes per patient in a seven hour day, it is estimated an average of twen ty-eight patients would be seen per day. If an osteopathic physician sees one pain patient per year, the annual cost to treat the one patient would be $232.08 [(twelve patient visits) x $19.34]. If one- fourth of an osteopathic physician's patient visits are pain patients (seven patient visits per day/four days a week), the costs would be $135.38 per day, $2166.08 per month or $25,992.96 per year. It is assumed that the additional costs to the osteopathic physician would range from $232.08 to $25,992.96, depending on the number of pain patient s that are treated. If an osteopathic physician assistant were to treat a patient for pain management, it will also be necessary for them to spend additional time with each patient. Periodic reviews of pain patients will be required to ensure effective interventions and compliance with treatment modalities, including opioid therapy. Based on a DOH survey it is estimated that an additional fif - teen minutes per visit will be required and will cost an osteopathic physician assistant an additional $9.44. Since controlled substances (i.e. opioids) cannot be refilled, patients will need to be seen at least once a month to have new prescriptions written for them and to monitor their progress. If an osteopathic physician assistant spends fifteen minut es per patient in a seven hour day, it is estimated an average of twenty-eight patients would be seen per day. If an osteopathic phy - sician assistant sees one pain patient per year, the annual cost to treat the one patient would be $113.28 [(twelve patient visits) x $9.44]. If one-fourth of an osteopathic physician assistan t's patient visits are pain patients (seven patient visits per day/four days a week), the additional cost would be $66.08 per day, $1057.28 per month or $12,687.36 per year. It is assumed that the costs to the osteopathi c physician assistant would range from $113.28 to $12,687.36, depending on the number of pain patient s that are treated. Since these types of patients are considered more com - plex and take more time to manage, the practitioner can charge more for their services . It is likely that the addi -tional time spent will be reimbursed by insurance carri - ers. More frequent patient screenings will therefore require additional record keeping and maintenance. Since the standard of care requires r ecord keeping, the costs asso - ciated with this are assumed to be minimal. The proposed rules require additional time for each pain patient visit to ensure proper adherence to the osteopathic pain guidelines. The costs could potentially range from $232.08 for one pain patient and $25,992.96 annually for approximately 1456 patient visits, estimated to be one-fourth of the practice time for an oste opathic physician. The costs estimated for osteopathic physi cian assistants would range from $113.28 for one pain patient and $12,687.36 annually for approximately 1456 patient visits, estimated to be one- fourth of the practice time for an osteopathic physician assis - tant. Since reimbursement rates are determined by the com - plexity of a patient's condition, systems evaluated, diagnostic tests performed, etc., it is likely that the estimated costs to the practitioner would be fully or partially reimbursed. Osteopathic Physician Education: Knowledge of pain management treatment is required for osteopathic physicians to treat chronic pain patients. It is estimated that a basic training course will consist of a minimum of eight hours. The cost of a course is estimated to be $8 00.

Assistance for Persons with Di sabilities: Contact Office of Information and Assist ance, TTY (360) 602-5797. Purpose of the Proposal a nd Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: This proposal will reduce the medical aid premium ba se rates for the six months beginning July 1, 2007, which will ultimately reduce the medical aid contingency reserve. During this time period, medical aid premiums will not be assessed for employers and workers and therefore it is antici pated that this will reduce the balance of the medical aid fund by $315 million. As a result of lower medical aid (account 6 08) premiums collected the accident fund (acco unt 609) premium base rates would be reduced because of th e impact on anticipated retro - spective rating refunds. These refunds are a percentage of the accident plus medical aid premiums, and are expected to decrease by $30 million. As a result, the upfront premium income for the accident fund is expected to decrease by $30 million. Associated changes in the retros pective rating size tables are also included in this rule making. Because of the potential impact on the total of retrospective rating refunds we are specifically interested in receiving comments and input from retrospective rating participants. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The medical aid fund, which is paid half by workers and half by employers, as of June 30, 2006, has a contingency reserve of close to $1.1 bil - lion. This equates to approximately 38% of total medical aid liabilities and is more money than is felt necessary to main - tain solvency in the medical aid fund.
