Integrative medicine is often used alongside other treatments to complement your care plan. For example, we could use acupuncture to help with pain management while you're also being treated with physical therapy and medications. We might recommend integrative medicine treatments if you're dealing with chronic pain, muscle spasms, arthritis, fibromyalgia and many other orthopedic conditions. Integrative medicine treatments Integrative medicine is typically used alongside other therapies. Depending on your condition and specific needs, we'll recommend the best type of holistic treatment for you. Our services include: Acupuncture is an Ancient Chinese medical practice that has been used for over 3,000 years. During acupuncture, thread-like needles are inserted into various trigger points in your body. This stimulates the central nervous system, enhancing your body's natural healing abilities. At an acupuncture appointment, you'll lie on a table while we place several needles in and around the painful parts of your body. The needles are so thin that this procedure feels painless to most patients. Once all the needles are placed, you'll relax for 10-20 minutes before we remove them. We may recommend acupuncture for a wide variety of orthopedic conditions, including carpal tunnel syndrome, [osteoarthritis](/care/tria-orthopedics/what-we-treat/osteoarthritis/), tennis elbow and low back pain. Yoga is a type of mild physical exercise that combines breath control and meditation with specific physical poses. It's useful in increasing strength and mobility, improving bone health and managing stress. Yoga therapy helps empower a sense of direction, balance and well-being. This is beneficial for all people, but especially those who have neck or back pain, osteoporosis or chronic pain. We offer four different types of yoga classes: - Chair yoga - practiced while sitting in a chair or using the chair for support while standing. - Hatha yoga - focuses on physical movements, strength and flexibility. Hatha yoga is the most common type of yoga performed in the U.S. - Therapeutic yoga - focuses on breath, relaxation and stress relief. This class is great for beginners, people recovering from injury or who have persistent pain, and those who want to learn the fundamentals. - Viniyoga - adapts the movements to your unique needs. Each class offers a welcoming space to discover the building blocks of self-transformation. We offer private and group classes. Group classes are $15 each, $60 for a package of five and $120 for a package of ten. Private classes are $175 for the initial three sessions and $150 for packages of three follow-up sessions.
