Essential oils are the chemicals that give flowers, trees, and herbs their smell. They come straight from the plant with no added parts. Essential oils have been used for healing for thousands of years and in many cultures. Essential oils do not treat or cure diseases, but they can help with the symptoms of many conditions. Aromatherapy is often combined with conventional medical treatments. It is also used with other CAM treatments such as massage and acupuncture. Essential oils are usually breathed in or placed on the skin. What are the risks and/or side effects? Medical aromatherapy has few side effects, but you should work with your child's doctor to avoid any practices that can hurt your child or their treatment. For instance, an oil might interfere with another medicine your child is taking, or it might cause an allergic reaction. Essential oils are very strong and should only be used by trained individuals. Some essential oils are poisonous if swallowed. Some may cause skin reactions such as a rash, and others might make your child feel worse instead of better. Essential oils are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so the strength of each oil can vary greatly. Here are some general safety tips: - Store essential oil bottles away from children and pets. - Do not swallow or eat essential oils, as many are toxic or dangerous when swallowed. - Use caution in young children, especially if they are younger than 2 years old. - Before using any essential oil, talk to your child's healthcare provider. Some essential oils can interact with your child's other medicines. - Never apply straight essential oils to the skin. Always dilute them with carrier oil or lotion. - Limit time in the sun. Essential oils might make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, causing burns and irritation. - Be considerate of how the oil's smell affects other people. What are the benefits? Through smell, aromatherapy can also be used to help with many problems. Here are three examples of how three common essential oils can work: - Lavender. Lavender is taken from the flowers of the lavender plant. It is often used to calm, comfort, or lift a person's mood. - Mandarin oil. Mandarin oil is taken from the peel of an mandarin fruit but may not smell just like a fresh mandarin. Mandarin oil is used to provide a calming effect and to relieve stomach discomfort. - Peppermint. Peppermint comes from peppermint leaves. Peppermint is used to calm and comfort, and to relieve stomach upset. How do I prepare? Before using aromatherapy, check with your child's doctor, especially if your child has asthma or allergies. If the essential oil is used on the skin, be sure there are no cuts or irritated skin. Explain to your child that essential oils are another way to help our bodies heal and feel better. If possible, show what you will do first on yourself or a doll, so your child can see what will happen. How is aromatherapy done? Many essential oils are used in aromatherapy. Each oil has a different chemical structure that defines what it can be used for and how the body uses it. Essential oils can help your child to relax, improve their mood, and increase their sense of well-being. Aromatherapy is different for each person and their needs. Not everyone responds the same to each oil. Essential oils are usually breathed in or placed on the skin. Diffusers, which mix the oils with water and turn them into a mist, are available at many stores. The essential oil's smell enters the body through nerve cells in the nose. The nose sends signals to the brain. The brain takes these signals and changes how the person faces feelings such as discomfort, restlessness, and irritability. Before applying essential oils to the skin, the oil should be mixed with a bland oil (called carrier oil) or lotion. The exact mixture depends on the reason for using the oil. When will I know the results? While you and your child might see fast results with medical aromatherapy, reaching your goal might take time. You should ask your child to tell you if the essential oils are helping or not. What are follow-up requirements and options? No follow-up may be needed for medical aromatherapy. If your child likes to use the essential oils, it can become part of your routine. Many people like to diffuse the oils in their home for the nice scent. "}
