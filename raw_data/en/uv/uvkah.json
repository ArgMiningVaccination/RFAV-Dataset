What is complementary or alternative treatment or CAM? CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) is care provided in addition (integrative medicine) to or instead of traditional or standard medical practices. This group of therapies is wide-ranging and includes: [acupuncture](https://www.medicinenet.com/slideshow_pictures_acupuncture/article.htm), - herbal [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm), - dietary modifications, - magnets, - reflexology, and - much more. Some people who seek out alternative medicine feel that conventional therapy has not successfully controlled their symptoms, or that the potential side effects associated with traditional therapy aren't acceptable. Others find that adding complementary medicine to their program allows improved control of symptoms. When complementary medicine is added to traditional routes, it is referred to as integrative medicine. Recent studies through the US Centers for Disease Control and [Prevention](https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm) (CDC), specifically the National Health Interview Survey, suggest that as many as 38% of residents within the United States seek out CAM. Many therapies that are considered within the group of complementary and alternative medicines haven't been studied extensively or investigated in comparison to conventional treatment options. What is of multiple sclerosis (MS)? [Multiple sclerosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm) ( [MS](https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)) is a disease that causes [demyelination](https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) of the brain and spinal cord or a loss of the covering around axons. When this occurs, the axons (the parts of the nerve cells that transmit impulses to other cells) don't work well. As more areas of the central nervous system are affected by the loss of myelin, different symptoms develop. [](https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) SLIDESHOWSee Slideshow What are the symptoms of MS? The specific symptom seen in [MS](https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms_quiz/quiz.htm) is related to the area of injury in the brain or spinal cord. Examples of symptoms of MS include: - a numbness, burning or tingling feeling, or [weakness](https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm)in certain areas of the body; the weakness might be mild or severe enough to cause [paralysis](https://www.medicinenet.com/paralysis/symptoms.htm)of one side of the body; - bladder and bowel symptoms such as [incontinence](https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence_in_women_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), difficulty in starting to urinate, a strong and/or frequent urge to urinate, and even loss of control of the bladder or an inability to empty the bladder; [eye problems](https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)such as eye neuritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/optic_neuritis/article.htm), and [vision loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm); - difficulty moving the arms or legs, difficulty walking, or problems with coordination and fine motor skills; - sexual problems in men and [vaginal dryness](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_dryness_and_vaginal_atrophy/article.htm)(decrease in vaginal lubrication in women); - Nerve and brain problems such as [dizziness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm), [depression](https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm), [memory loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm), balance problems, poor judgment, and [memory loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/memory_loss/symptoms.htm); and - as MS progresses, some patients are left with muscle spasticity, which is an involuntary painful contraction of some muscles. What alternative treatments can be used for MS symptoms? Fatigue and spasticity [Fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm) and spasticity seem to respond best to CAM. Therapies that have been shown to be of some benefit for fatigue have included: [exercise](https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm), for example, yoga, swimming, walking, and other types of regular exercise; - magnet therapy; and - gingko biloba supplements. Spasticity has reportedly been reduced with the use of acupuncture and massage therapy. A sense of tingling (paresthesias) has been reportedly improved with reflexology. Alternative treatments for other MS symptoms Symptoms including [depression](https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), memory loss, urinary incontinence, and progression of MS itself (including relapses, disease extent as measured on [MRI](https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm)), and disability have had limited improvement when treated with CAM. Therapies tested in an effort to improve these symptoms have included: - a low-fat [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm), - bee venom, - hypnosis, - multiple different amino acids, - alpha lipoic acid, and - hyperbaric oxygen therapy. None of these treatments led to any significant benefit in the studied symptoms. What about medical marijuana (cannabis) for MS symptoms? There have been a number of studies looking at the potential benefits of medical marijuana (cannabis) on [MS symptoms](https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm), including spasticity and [chronic pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/symptoms.htm). some that FDA-approved forms of medical cannabis (Marinol or Sativex) may be beneficial in improving spasticity or bladder frequency. However, there are no reports that ingested or inhaled medical marijuana is beneficial for conditions associated with MS. The [National Multiple Sclerosis Society](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines/Marijuana) has more information about medical marijuana for MS symptoms (http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines/Marijuana) Who is eligible to pursue treatment with CAM? Anyone can participate in CAM therapy. However, it is important to recognize that most of these therapies are not covered by insurance, and may be an \"out of pocket\" cost for patients with MS. Patients who decide to pursue CAM need to share this information with their physicians, as some supplements may interact with conventional medication and lead to side effects. How much does CAM cost? The costs of CAM can vary widely; regular exercise and yoga can be low or no-cost options, while massage therapy, acupuncture, and some supplements can be quite expensive. Every patient must have a good relationship with treating healthcare professionals of traditional and non-traditional therapies to best understand potential costs.

What are the potential risks and side effects of CAM? Side effects of CAM vary depending on the treatment. - Patients who have selected various supplements or dietary measures may experience: [hot flashes](https://www.medicinenet.com/hot_flashes/article.htm)(flushing), or - gastric disturbances, such as [nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm)or [constipation](https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm). - - Some supplements can increase the risk of bleeding ( [ginkgo](https://www.medicinenet.com/ginkgo_ginkgo_biloba-oral/article.htm)Biloba) or interact with traditional medications. - Infections may occur when the skin is punctured, such as with acupuncture. - Some patients expect CAM to be able to outperform conventional treatments, despite a lack of scientific evidence. If this doesn't occur, patients may feel discouraged. It is important to discuss any potential or ongoing use of CAM with your healthcare professional, who may need to adjust your current therapies to prevent any adverse effects caused by interactions between the two types of therapies. What different types of CAM were studied in the National Health Interview Survey? Different types of complementary and alternative medicines that were studied in the National Health Interview Survey from 2002 through 2012 include: - Acupuncture - Ayurveda - Biofeedback - Chelation therapy - Chiropractic care - Energy healing therapy/Reiki [Special diets](https://www.medicinenet.com/special_diets_and_recipes/article.htm): [Vegetarian](https://www.medicinenet.com/vegetarian_diet_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), Vegan, Macrobiotic, and others - Folk medicine - Guided imagery - Homeopathic treatment - Hypnosis - Massage - Meditation - Movement therapies: Alexander technique, Feldenkrais, [Pilates](https://www.medicinenet.com/pilates/article.htm) - Naturopathy - Nonvitamin and nonmineral [dietary supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm) - Osteopathic manipulation - Progressive chi](https://www.medicinenet.com/tai_chi/article.htm) Traditional healers: Botanica, Curandero, Espiritista, Yerbera, Medicine man, Shaman, and others - Yoga From Healthy Resources Featured Centers Health Solutions From Our Sponsors REFERENCES: Clarke TC, Black LI, Stussman BJ, Barnes PM, Nahin, RL.

More broadly, acupuncture is a family of procedures involving the stimulation of anatomical locations on or in the skin by a variety of techniques. MS (Multiple Sclerosis) vs. ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease) and MS (multiple sclerosis) are both diseases of the nervous system (neurodegenerative). ALS is a disease in which the nerve cells in the body are attacked by the immune system, although it's not considered an autoimmune disease by some scientists. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the insulated covering of the nerves (myelin sheath) in the CNS (central nervous system) degenerate, or deteriorate. Scientists don't know the exact cause of either problem. However, they have discovered that mutations in the gene that produces the SOD1 enzyme were associated with some cases of familial ALS. Scientists also theorize that multiple sclerosis may be caused by infection or vitamin D deficiency. ALS occurs between 50-70 years of age (the average age of occurrence ALS is 55), and mostly affects men. While MS occurs between 20-60 years of age, and mostly affects women. About 30,000 people in the US have ALS, and an average of 5,000 new diagnoses per year (that's about 15 new cases per week). Worldwide, MS affects more than 2.3 million people, with about 10,000 new cases diagnosed each year (that's about 200 new diagnoses per week). Some of the signs and symptoms of both diseases include muscle weakness, muscle spasms, problems walking, fatigue, slurred speech, and problems swallowing. ALS signs and symptoms that are different from MS include problems holding the head upright, clumsiness, muscle cramps and twitches, problems holding objects, and uncontrollable periods of laughing or crying. MS signs and symptoms that are different from ALS include vision problems, vertigo and balance problems, sexual problems, memory problems, depression, mood swings, and digestive problems. There is no cure for either disease, however the prognosis and life expectancy are different. Multiple sclerosis is not a fatal condition, while ALS progresses rapidly and leads to death. Botox to Treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS)Botulinum toxin is a muscle-relaxing medication used to decrease spasticity related to multiple sclerosis and other neurological conditions. Botulinum toxin is derived from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. There are three types of botulinum toxin available for therapeutic use. Chronic Fatigue QuizExhausted all the time? Maybe it's not all in the mind. Take the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Quiz to learn more about tricky condition. How Painful is a Lumbar Puncture?A lumbar puncture (LP) procedure, also called a spinal tap, spinal puncture, thecal puncture, or rachiocentesis, collects cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lumbar region of the spine by inserting a needle between two lumbar vertebrae. The CSF is analyzed for diagnosing life-threating conditions such as cancers and tumors of the brain or spinal cord; bleeding around the brain; inflammatory diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis and syphilis; autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis; and increased fluid pressure from hydrocephalus. Low FODMAP Diet for IBS FODMAPs are foods that contain sugar alcohols and short chain carbohydrates. The gut can't digest them very well. There are \"low\" FODMAP foods and \"high\" FODMAP foods. Foods high in FODMAPs lay in the gut and ferment, which causes symptoms of: - Excessive gas - Bloating - Abdominal pain - Diarrhea Some people with digestive diseases and disorders, for example, IBS, microscopic colitis, IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and other functional bowel disorders often are placed on a low FODMAP diet to decrease the amount of high FODMAPs foods in the diet, which create uncomfortable symptoms. Multiple Sclerosis (MS)Multiple sclerosis or MS is an autoimmune disorder in which brain and spinal cord nerve cells become demyelinated. This damage results in symptoms that may include numbness, weakness, vertigo, paralysis, and involuntary muscle contractions. Different forms of MS can follow variable courses from relatively benign to life-threatening. MS is treated with disease-modifying therapies. Some MS symptoms can be treated with medications. Making an MS Friendly HomeAdults with multiple sclerosis may be at risk for injuries, hazards, and falling at home. Some simple home modifications can protect your health and safety and facilitate fall prevention. Reduce your risk of accidents and prevent hazards with these tips.

Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms PictureSymptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple and may range from mild to severe in intensity and short to long in duration. See a picture of Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms and learn more about the health topic. Muscle SpasmsMuscle spasms are involuntary muscle contractions that come on suddenly and are usually quite painful. Dehydration, doing strenuous exercise in a hot environment, prolonged muscle use, and certain diseases of the nervous system may cause muscle spasms. Symptoms and signs of a muscle spasm include an acute onset of pain and a possible bulge seen or felt beneath the skin where the muscle is located. Gently stretching the muscle usually resolves a muscle spasm. Multiple Sclerosis: Signs of Multiple Sclerosis RelapseSigns of an MS relapse can vary in type and intensity.

What Does an MS Attack Feel Like?Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which your own antibodies (autoantibodies) start attacking and destroying the nerve cells of your body. This disease affects the central nervous system, which is responsible for various functions including, balance, and coordination. An MS attack can include tingling and numbness, cramps and tightness in the muscles, fatigue, dizziness, a triad of abnormal speech, abnormal eye movement, and hand tremor; problems with balance and coordination, visual disturbances, bladder problems, bowel incontinence, face pain, pain, and intolerance to heat. What Is the Cause of Cotard's Syndrome?Cotard's syndrome, also known as walking corpse syndrome, is a neuropsychiatric condition in which people develop false beliefs that their body parts are missing, or they are dying or they don't exist. The exact cause of Cotard's syndrome is unknown, but certain conditions are likely cause this syndrome, including dementia, encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, "}
