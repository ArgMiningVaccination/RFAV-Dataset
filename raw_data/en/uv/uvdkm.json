It is not the flu vaccine. The voluntary recall is a precautionary measure. The company cannot assure sterility for these specific vaccine lots. The potential for contamination of any individual vaccine is low, and, if present, the level of contamination would be low. Physicians are advised not to administer any vaccine from the lots described. Children that were vaccinated with one of the vaccines with the described lot numbers will not need to be re-vaccinated as the efficacy of the vaccine was not affected. These children should complete their series with a H influenzae type b conjugate (Hib) containing vaccine that is not affected by the recall. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the recall is not a health-threatening situation for children. PedvaxHIB(r) is nonformulary; therefore it is unlikely that any patient at MUSC received this vaccine. Although COMVAX(r) is on the formulary, with the availability of Pediarix(r), COMVAX(r) is not used frequently. Parents should be informed about the recall and educated about the signs and symptoms of infection (eg, redness and swelling at the injection site) and contact their providers if such reactions occur. It should be emphasized that sterility tests of samples from the recalled lots have not found any contamination and the potential of contamination of any individual dose of Hib vaccine is very low.
