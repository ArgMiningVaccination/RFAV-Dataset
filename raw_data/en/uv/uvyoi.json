With brand new state of the art facilities and placements across Croydon, we aim to help tackle the NHS shortage of nurses across the area. To study at LSBU Croydon please put a C on your UCAS application. All pre-registration students need to be DBS cleared before going on placement. You'll need to have an enhanced DBS check even if you have had one before and will not be able to go on placement until this is complete. The DBS process is not difficult but can take some time so it's best to get started as soon as you receive your email. You will receive the email during Summer 2023. If you're part of the [DBS update service](https://www.gov.uk/dbs-update-service), your subscription is up to date and you already have a DBS certificate, please bring in your original green DBS certificate for the document check. To take advantage of the update service, your certificate needs to be classified as 'Enhanced' and workforce must be listed as 'Adult and Child'. If you have any queries, please email us at [hscdbsoh@lsbu.ac.uk](mailto:hscdbsoh@lsbu.ac.uk). Our DBS supplier, Verifile, will send you an email with all the details you need to complete your DBS. Verifile will give you instructions to log into their system and complete your personal details and information. To complete the process, you'll need your passport or driving licence and 5-year address history including dates when you moved in/out. You can use your application number to track the progress of your DBS.

Please include any and all major and minor, spent and unspent convictions, cautions, warning and reprimands, even if they relate to juvenile offences or seem trivial or unimportant. Some minor offences will not prevent you from going on placement or being offered a place on your course, but still need to be reviewed so it's best to be honest and include everything.

Government legislation requires all Higher Education Institutions who offer courses where students may come into unsupervised contact with children or vulnerable adults to have this check. These checks also help us to ensure duty of care to our students, and create a safer environment for patients seen by our students. As part of the University's admissions process, declarations of any offence may be referred to a virtual panel made up of senior managers from partner NHS Trusts and/or other sectors within Health and Social Care. Any DBS that is considered by the panel will be anonymised. The panel members then deliberate and make a recommendation whether the application be rejected, accepted or request further information or documents. If you have declared an offence, we might ask for more information from you in writing which will help the panel make a decision. Once your declaration has been referred to the panel it can take up to 28 working days to be processed. You need to put your current address on your DBS application because this is where your Statement will be mailed. If you've moved house between submitting and receiving your DBS, make sure you have mail forwarding set up so that you'll receive your statement. If you've moved recently, make sure you have proof of your new address (such as a new bank statement) to bring for your document checks. If you've lost your statement you will need to pay \u00a346 to purchase a new one. Yes.

There will be instructions in the letter about how you can appeal and which supporting information you need to provide.
