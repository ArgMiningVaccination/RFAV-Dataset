It essentially creates an intolerance to either substances that come from the \"outside\" environment or literally intolerance to the tissues of one's own \"inside\" body. By giving specifically made, diluted and ultrahigh diluted antigens (hence the word \"low-dose antigens\" (LDA) or \"low-dose immunotherapy\" (LDI)) we teach the immune system to develop a new tolerance and behave in a more normal physiological fashion. (ideally the food/chemical sensitivities disappear; allergies and autoimmune diseases like arthritis, thyroiditis, etc are controlled.) In this brief introduction there is no place for a comprehensive history of the development of this therapy, nevertheless a word of gratitude needs to go to doctors Leonard McEwen MD, William Schrader MD and Ty Vincent MD, for their groundbreaking and pioneering work in the field.) Building on their experience, we have developed additional steps ourselves at the Paulina Medical Clinic which make this method even more effective. From a conventional scientific point of view, the explanation for the effectiveness of these extremely diluted antigen doses seems to be that they stimulate the so-called T regulatory lymphocytes, which are known to suppress unwanted \"hyperactive\" immune reactions. We believe however that this materialistic, reductionist point of view does not cover the entire picture and more than likely, these, essentially homeopathic remedies, are therapeutic by \"calming\" and strengthening vital soul - spiritual processes as well beyond the material effects. Based on the collective experience of doctors across the nation - gained from the treatment of many thousands of patients - the statement can be made that patients experience improvement in both specific physical and behavioral complaints as well as gaining a new sense of vitality. (Caveat: no \"cure\" in medicine has a 100% success rate! No guarantees can ever be given in medicine that an individual person will have a success with a particular therapy. Nevertheless for some of the more common conditions that have been treated by the LDA-LDI physicians (food and inhalant allergies, eczema and other skin conditions, autoimmune diseases like arthritis, colitis, PANDAS, etc.) the success rate is reported to be upwards of 80%. Safety Issues Considering that the LDA and LDI doses are given in the form of high and ultra-high dilutions, it is understandable that the safety record has been exceptional. In the original study that looked at over 11,000 patients given this therapy no significant adverse reactions were noted. However, as will be explained below, that does not mean that following a prescribed dose a temporary worsening of symptoms cannot occur. This however in itself, is a sign that the therapy is working although the dose strength may need to be adjusted. This occurrence can be called a \"Flaring\" where old symptoms that had disappeared in the past may briefly resurface or present symptoms may be temporarily aggravated. This so-called \"flaring\" should not be confused with unpleasant symptoms that had been there all along and may persist through the initial treatment period. What antigens are used - in high and ultra-high dilutions (potencies): - food mixtures - inhalants - chemicals - bacteria - viruses - autologous antigens from blood, urine, stool, saliva and others - hormones Conditions treated with the LDA/LDI method: The conditions listed below have been successfully treated at one time or another by various doctors throughout the country. Some conditions have been reported to helped only a single individual but we felt it was important to demonstrate the width of possibilities. Acne Allergies Alopecia Areata Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Ankylosing Spondylitis Anxiety and irritability that seems immune-mediated Autism (especially those with a lot of agitation or violence) Bell's palsy Boils, Bullous autoimmune skin disorders - diff infection, Recurrent Collagen Vascular Diseases Constipation, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea (even if yeast doesn't show up on stool testing) Cough, chronic Crohn's Disease Cutaneous Mycobacterial infection Dandruff Dementia Dental Allergy Diarrhea, chronic Diarrhea, chronic with Hx/O prior C. diff infection) Disease processes that began right after MMR vaccination Dyspepsia Eczema -various Endometriosis Epilepsy Fatigue Syndromes Fatigue, chronic Fibromyalgia Flu like symptoms, persistent Folliculitis GI symptoms unexplained Guillian-Barre Syndrome Guttate Psoriasis Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (this is the only thing I've seen it work for so far) Herpetic lesions - Recurrent cold sores or genital herpes, herpetic lesions; and post-herpetic suppurativa IBD IBS, Impetigo Inflammatory arthritis, NOS Inflammatory conditions involving symptoms such as headache, fever, rash, Interstitial Cystitis Lyme, chronic Multiple sclerosis (MS) Myasthenia Gravis Myositis Narcolepsy Nausea, and other upper GI symptoms Neurological problems that began following DTaP vaccine Neurological sx's: numbness, tingling, tremor, pain, seizure-like Osteoarthritis Otitis Externa, chronic Pain syndromes - particularly if their widespread pain sounds like nerve pain; and if it seems to get worse after eating (no matter what food is eaten). PANDAS, some Autism cases Parkinsonism Pelvic pain, dyspareunia, of breath Sinusitis, chroni Symptoms similar to Lyme disease (tremendous overlap) Tetany-type neurological symptoms (uncontrollable muscle contractions) Thrush, burning mouth alba, try Varicella) Ulcerative Colitis Unexplained bone fragility/osteoporosis Unexplained dermatitis (especially with pus, crusting, or other evidence of intense inflammation) Unexplained Peripheral Neuropathy Unexplained rashes, especially if itchy or flaky Unexplained Tremors Universal reactors - people Urethritis UTI, Chronic urinary tract inflammation Vaginitis, chronic (even if yeast doesn't show up on wet mount) Vitiligo Yeast-rashes What to expect- Timeline: (Please keep in mind that details, specific antigens and substances given, etc. will different from patient to patient as each unique person warrants it. The doctor will determine f. ex. what the appropriate \"DOSE \"will be.) At the first visit you will have been given a general understanding of the intended therapy, discussed protocols etc. and either at that visit or at the next one you will be given the first dose of antigens - as discussed in the encounter with the doctor. What happens after that? A visit from the patient will be requested every two weeks at which time the amount, the kind, the route of administration, and the timing of the next dose will be discussed. In general we will choose the route of administration in the form of drops given under the tongue but on occasion the antigens will be given as an injection under the skin. Essentially, we determine what to do next based on the symptoms that the patient reports and in general there are three situations that may occur: - Within the next few days, there is a clear and substantial improvement in the symptoms. Ideally, this improvement should last 7 to 8 weeks after which another antigen dose needs to be given. This 7 to 8 weeks cycle will be repeated several times, however, each new dose will be given only if at least some of the symptoms returned. After a while - a time that is varying quite individually - the spacing between doses will be increasingly lengthy such that some patients may require a repeat dose only once a year or less. While this is the most desirable of all situations it may not occur in the majority of patients. For most patients, the improvement will last, at first, only several days or weeks after which a reduced to dose, a \"booster dose\", needs to be given. Overall, the 7 to 8 weeks cycle is nevertheless maintained. During the first or even sometimes second cycle a visit every two weeks to the Dr.'s office (or, less ideally, a consultation on the phone) is required. - After the dose given the symptoms for which the patient came in may worsen - this is not pleasant, but not unexpected, and not a bad sign since the discomfort will relatively quickly disappear. That discomfort is in itself a clear sign that the therapy is on the right path- but the dose may need to be adjusted. Based on this reaction the next doses will likely be weaker and will eventually (and hopefully) lead to the desired improvements). Depending on the severity of the discomfort the next dose will be administered seven, eight or even only nine weeks later. - After the given dose, no reaction is observed (the symptoms for which the patient came in get neither better nor worse). In that case, the next dose should be given already after 10 to 14 days. Patience is important! Sometimes a benefit will be noted only after several sessions. Improvements have been known to occur within days (or Hours!) but also only after repeated doses over 6 months. Staying with \"the program\" is a key to eventual success. Feedback during this whole process is essential! It is important that you fill out the questionnaire, and particularly note whether the symptoms have improved, worsened or stayed the same. This will play a major role in determining the next dose/steps. Always let the doctor know if questions arise. Basic Instructions When working with these subtle dosing remedies, it is important to follow some preparation steps. Most people can follow only the basics and do very well. Sometimes some more strict rules are needed- this will be discussed with the doctor. If possible, the day before, day of and day after your dose you should: - On the day of the dose given, stop all supplements (that you may have taken previously on your own) that are not essential- exception of Vitamin D. - Stop all non-essential medications (on the day of) but you MUST discuss this with the doctor to be sure it is safe to do so. - On the day of, have a bland diet of foods that you are used to. No spices. (Gluten has a controversial role in the relationship to the crucial Treg Some studies go in the direction that gluten free helps other studies find that gluten may reduce the regulatory cells. ) Appropriate anthroposophic/homeopathic remedies and/or other necessary supplements may be added by the doctor. These will make the therapy even more effective. These ARE NOT fixed rules, and for each patient some rules may not apply and others might be important. We will discuss as needed and please ask questions. ************** Questionnaire: The doctor will suggest that before you start the treatment, you take a piece of paper and divide it in 4 columns as in the many symptoms as you feel belong to the condition that is being treated. Obviously the first time you just list them! Then before the next visit go over that list again and fill in the check marks as appropriate. We would prefer that this arrangement be put into a Word Doc and sent to the clinic the day before in an email ( [paulinamedical3525@gmail.com](mailto:paulinamedical3525@gmail.com)) ; that way the results can be included into your electronic medical record and the progress can be monitored. General Protocol: These are the most important elements of the treatment: - Visits -frequency to be determined by the situation - Tests: - HRV - testing the autonomic nervous system - Micronutrient test- to help determine the nutritional components most essential to the stimulation of the immune system - Vitamin D level - Others as needed - LDA/LDI dose - will be determined as needed - Diet - to be discussed; see basics above - Supplements-most important is the Vitamin D; others as appropriate - Potentized remedies (anthroposophic/homeopathic) - designed to strengthen the effect of the overall treatment (ex.s: 5M; Reservoir; others ) - note: The LDA/LDI therapeutic modality while very successful and beneficial to patients, is still not FDA approved and as such not covered by any insurance. Proceeding with this therapy, after having read this Guide means that you have given an informed consent and desire to continue with the therapy. You agree that all reasonable explanations regarding risks and benefits have been given to you.) We are trying to keep the costs of this therapy manageable. The \"doses\", antigens, charges listed below cover only essentially the costs of the antigens and only a small portion of the time involved creating the mix and managing the follow up communications. The costs noted are for the therapy prep and administration. There will also be a separate visit charge. As mentioned above, in the beginning, the visits will be needed more often. Later a phone call, email or shorter visit will suffice. For a repeat booster no visit will be required. Visits: please ask the office staff for the current charges applying to New patient visit Return patient: the doctor will determine if a brief, regular , or extended visit is necessary LDA/LDI Dose: $125 All emails requiring a min 10 minutes for preparation and answer $25. $25 for additional 15 minutes min. Separate charges not listed here may also occur for tests, remedies, other diagnostic procedures, etc Wishing all the best of Health, Razvan \"Ross\" Rentea MD (Dr. Rentea has been practicing with potentized (highly diluted and ultra-highly diluted anthroposophical and homeopathic remedies) for over 40 years.
