The validity and reproducibility of these trials was the result of a combination of excellent trial design, patient population selection, as well as fast and high rates of recanalization of the occluded artery. As we celebrate this monumental advancement in the treatment of ischemic stroke, we must look forward to find ways to obtain even better outcomes.
