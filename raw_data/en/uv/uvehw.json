The development of vaccines has proven to be an effective method to combat severe forms of infection. Adverse effects reported after COVID-19 vaccination consisted of local injection site reaction, fatigue, myalgia, or fever as well as sporadic cases of vaccine-induced thrombotic immune thrombocytopenia, especially viral vector vaccines. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the repeated dose toxicity of a candidate vaccine against SARS- CoV-2, a test in which several parameters were analyzed, including coagulation factors. Materials and methods: The test included 120 rats, of both sexes, divided into six groups (main group, recovery group and control group) at which the human dose, 10X human dose and 1 control adjuvant were tested. The vaccine was administered intranasally, 4 times every two weeks. The final day was after the last administration to the main group and another 30 days from the last administration to the recovery group. On day 0 and the final day, blood was collected for hematological, biochemical, immunological examinations Fibrinogen, in the case of all groups, increased on the final day, except for females from the recovery groups where this parameter decreased by 25%. PT, aPTT and TT, regardless of group or sex, had low values compared to the initial time of the study. On day 0, the values of the coagulation factors were homogeneous, the fibrinogen being between 155- 347mg / dL, PT 25.5-57.8 sec, aPTT 61.9-120 sec and TT values of 53-60 sec. On the final day, the group analysis also showed unit values. Fibrinogen increased between 90-116%, PT decreased by 48-71%, aPTT decreased by 59-80%, and TT had values lower by 10-14% compared to the initial day. Conclusions: Increased fibrinogen associated with decreased PT and aPTT is common in human clinical pathology. Fibrinogen, PT, aPTT and TT are the standard parameters of blood clotting assessed in toxicity tests. The results obtained in the study represent a preliminary phase which, corroborated with the results of the other tests, supports the conclusion that the candidate vaccine does not have toxicological potential, the coagulation factors not being influenced after its repeated administration.

INTRODUCTION Guidelines for repeated dose toxicity state that the primary purpose of repeated- dose toxicity studies is to contribute to the development of drug safety by characterizing the toxicological profile after repeated administration [1]. This test is performed on animal models and the general principles should consider the choice of species, group size, dosing regimen, duration and route of the test substance administration [2]. Regarding the preclinical safety assessment in the development of a vaccine, the repeated dose toxicity test is a critical step that must be completed before proceeding with clinical trials. The results show the safety of clinical application by detecting the potential toxicity of new vaccines in animals, reducing the risks assumed by subjects of clinical trials and providing a basis for the formulation of clinical trial protocols. The choice of animal species in toxicity tests is important, the animal model must be as close as possible to humans, and their use must be scientifically and ethically justified, animal welfare, during studies, is capital to obtain high-quality data [3]. Usually, in such tests, it is recommended to use rodent and non-rodent, as such rats, mice, minipigs and dogs, are preferred animal models due to the wealth of background data available in the literature. The dose of the test substance, its repeatability, and the route of administration in animal toxicity tests should be similar to that for humans, but to assess the toxicological potential, animals will be given both the proposed dose for humans and the highest permissible human dose. If the dose is still limited to the total volume to be administered, by animal welfare guidelines, then a dose exceeding the human dose may be calculated based on mg/kg, capable of inducing the immune response in the animal model. The routes of administration are also similar to clinical conditions and may be intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal or intranasal [4]. Repeated dose toxicity studies address the potential for systemic toxicity, including systemic effects on the immune system. A wide range of information that is obtained usually includes close monitoring of body weight and food consumption, body temperature, histopathology, clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation parameters and C-reactive protein [1]. The aim of our study was to evaluate the repeated dose toxicity of a candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal administration on rats, a test that complied with the provisions of the actual OECD guidelines. During the test, several parameters were evaluated, including coagulation factors. They are commonly included in vaccine toxicity studies and may provide information on a systemic inflammatory response with consequences for coagulation activation, which may result in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [5]. DIC is characterized by a large-scale activation of coagulation, which leads to the deposition of microvascular fibrin from the liver, kidneys and brain in the lungs, then developing multi-organ failure [6]. The hemorrhage that follows contributes to the consumption of coagulation factors and platelet dysfunction [7]. General DIC-related indices are count, prothrombin fibrinogen and fibrin-related markers [8]. In general toxicological studies, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are commonly measured to assess blood clotting. Special blood coagulation tests are important to detect abnormalities and investigate the toxicity mechanism in detail. The cascade of reactions that lead to blood clotting consists of 2 main pathways: the extrinsic pathway initiated by thromboplastin and followed by factors III, VII and X and the intrinsic pathway initiated by the activation of factor XII, preceded by factors IX, XI and VIII. Many of these factors are synthesized in the liver and any agent that affects liver function causes a decrease in the production of clotting factors. The importance of performing tests on coagulation factors is reflected in the possibility of detecting the toxicity of a substance based on its effect on the activity of coagulation factors [9]. Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein synthesized in the liver, which is found in plasma and 9 Testing for a candidate vaccine against SARS-COV-2 platelets. Fibrinogen plays an essential role in homeostasis by forming the fibrin cross- linked network. Fibrinogen values associated with prothrombin time and partially activated thromboplastin time allow a rough assessment of the effect of a substance on the blood clotting cascade in blood tests. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Ethical Approval The animal experiments were performed at the Bneasa Animal Facility (BAF), Preclinical Testing Unit of the Cantacuzino\" National Military Medical Institute for Research and Development (CI). The study was approved by the CI Ethics Committee 47/2020 and the competent authorities (DSVSA authorization number 566/2020), in accordance with EU Directive 63/2010 on the rules for the care, use and protection of animals used for scientific purposes. BAF is also an authorized unit under current legislation as a user of animals used for scientific purposes. 2.2. The animals One hundred and twenty Sprague Dawley rats, both male and female, were included in the study, in equal numbers. The average weight of the animals at the beginning of the experiment was 300 grams and their age was 6-8 weeks. They were divided into three groups: main, recovery and control. The main and recovery groups received the human dose and 10-fold higher human dose. The animals were housed in the BAF Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) animal testing space, which complies with the conditions set out in the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" . Groups of 5 same-sex animals that received the same test dose were housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC) and received standard diet food and microbiologically controlled water. 2.3. Test substances The candidate vaccine against SARS- CoV-2, proposed by the ONCOGEN Center, Timioara, consisted of a combination of peptides specifically recognized by the 2 components of the adaptive immune system. Specifically, 9 long synthetic peptides (SLPs) were selected from the Spike protein of SARS- CoV-2 and another 2 with increased affinity to bind to a wide variety of MHC molecules (Table 1). Peptide no. Amino acid DEMIAQY3229.71Table 1. Selection of peptides in the candidate vaccine against COVID-19 SLPs were designed using a cathepsin- sensitive linker (LLSVGG) to link MHC class class II-restricted epitopes, the MHC class II epitope being always located at the N-terminus, to stimulate both cytotoxic T lymphocytes. (CTL) as well as helper T lymphocytes. For the human dose, the peptides were solubilized in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10 mM and resuspended in vitamin A (Biofarm, 20 mg/ml, oral drops Retinol acetate solution) - 0.48 nmol / 12 X 40 of each peptide = 1.6 nmol of each peptide, and for the 10x dose compared to the dose for human administration, the peptides were solubilized in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM and resuspended in vitamin A (Biofarm, 20 mg/ml, oral drops solution Retinol acetate) - 0.48 nmol / 12 x 10 x 40 of each peptide = 16 nmol of each 10ANCU\u00deA et al. peptide. The control groups received a mixture of DMSO and vitamin A, in the same dose as the candidate vaccine. The dose of the vaccine was selected by the General Principles for Technical Review of the Preclinical Safety Assessment of Biologicals for Prevention (CDE, 2008), which also followed the WHO guidelines for the preclinical evaluation of the vaccine (WHO, 2014). The vaccine was administered intranasally with a micropipette, and the volume administered was 5 l / nostril/ animal. Referring to the above guidelines, the animals received at least one more vaccination than clinically prescribed. Exposure intervals should generally be determined by the immune response of the animals. Because animals generally reach stable antibody formation after 2-3 weeks of inoculation, long-term toxicity tests generally use 2-3 week exposure intervals. Thus, the vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 was administered once every day on days 0, 14, 28 and 42, resulting in a total of four administrations, and the interval between administrations being 2 weeks. 2.4. Monitoring period For the main group, the monitoring period was 46 days, and for the recovery group, 70 days. The study protocol required monitoring of local clinical signs (appearance of the nasal cavity after inoculation) and general (body temperature and weight, food consumption), ophthalmological monitoring and performing hematological, biochemical, immunological examinations and coagulation tests. At the end of each period, the animals were euthanized and 34 organs were taken for histological examination. 2.5. Examination of coagulation factors On day 0 and the final day of each monitoring period, retro-orbital blood was collected in tubes with 3.2% sodium citrate (blood: anticoagulant = 9:1). It was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the resulting plasma was analyzed for fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT).2.6. Statistical analysis The Gnumeric Spreadsheet was used for statistical analysis of the data, and the t-test was used to compare the results obtained between the groups of rats. p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. 3. RESULTS The results are presented in tables 2 and 3. There were no statistically significant changes (p > 0.05) in the coagulation indices of rats in each group on both day 0 and the final day. There was only one exception among females who have tested 10 times the human dose on the final day for fibrinogen ( p = 0.01) (Fig. 1) and aPTT (Fig. 2) ( p = 0.04). Fibrinogen, in the case of all groups, increased on the final day, except for females in the recovery groups in which this parameter decreased by 25%. PT, aPTT and TT, regardless of group or sex, had low values compared to the initial time of the study (Fig. 3 and 4). On day 0, the values of the coagulation factors were homogeneous, the fibrinogen being between 155-347mg / dL, PT 25.5-57.8 sec, aPTT 61.9-120 sec and TT values of 53-60 sec. On the final day, the group analysis also showed unit values. Fibrinogen increased by 90-116%, PT decreased by 48- 71%, aPTT decreased by 59-80%, and TT had values 10-14% lower than the initial day. Thus, no toxicological changes were observed in the coagulation indices of the main group and recovery during the experiment. 4. DISCUSSION Due to the sudden outbreak of the pandemic, researchers around the world have been looking for an effective solution to prevent and combat SARS-CoV-2; vaccination is the most effective and economical way to save the population. Because vaccines are intended to immunize healthy people, a certain rigor is required for the safety requirements of vaccines, so preclinical evaluation is one of the important phases and the evaluation is being explored continuously [11]. The objectives of preclinical safety studies are to define the pharmacological and toxicological effects of a product.

The average value of TT\u00b1SD12test is a preliminary stage of clinical trials, and the results obtained both in vitro and in vivo contribute to the understanding of the biological activity of a biopharmaceutical [12]. In vivo tests involve the use of two relevant animal models; however, in some justified cases the use of a single species is sufficient. Sprague Dawley rats are models traditionally used for toxicological studies, being able to have a human-like immune response when the test substance is a viral vaccine [13]. Repeated dose toxicity testing aims to analyze all data provided and their correlation guides future studies. One of the analyzes refers to coagulation factors. Regarding vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, special attention was paid to these factors, especially after cases of thrombosis or thromboembolism have been reported in patients receiving vaccines covid-19 vector adenovirus ChAdOx1nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2- S (Johnson & Johnson / Janssen) [14]. Currently, there are few reported data, but the vast majority refer to cases of moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications that have occurred since day 10 post-vaccination. The conditions are very similar to heparin-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, which in turn is a prothrombotic condition induced by antibodies against platelets, which recognize the molecular complex generated by the interaction between cationic platelet factor-4 (PF4) and anionic heparin. thrombosis, a high level of anti-PF4 antibodies was found in the absence of heparin, which led to the definition of the diagnosis of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) [15]. Laboratory tests performed on VITT indicated reduced [16] or normal [17] fibrinogen values and PT and aPTT were often abnormal [18]. Repeated dose toxicity testing involves the use of a human dose and a maximum human dose on animal models. In our study, we were able to observe an increase in fibrinogen levels on the final day associated with a decrease in other coagulation factors in all groups, regardless of the dose administered. Existing data in the literature show that fibrinogen increases with the administration of vaccines, which indicates a systemic inflammatory response to the test substances [19]. Fibrinogen levels are known to reflect non-specific inflammatory conditions in animals. The observed increase demonstrates the onset of an inflammatory reaction following vaccine administration. However, the reduction in PT and aPTT values in laboratory animals are frequently observed in toxicity studies, but the significance of these observations has not been fully explored and evaluated. In human clinical pathology, the increased fibrinogen correlation - low PT and aPTT may predict thrombosis [20], myocardial infarction [21] or diabetes [22]. In rats, PT and aPTT may be elevated if, at the time of blood sampling, the animals were kept on a prolonged diet and water diet without a direct link to the test substance [9]. Prothrombin time was used to evaluate the extrinsic pathway and the common coagulation pathway (coagulation factors II, V, VII, X and fibrinogen). Conceptually, prothrombin time increases in cases of fibrinogen deficiency or factors II, V, VII and X. Fibrinogen is a hexamer glycoprotein that is involved in the final stages of coagulation as a precursor of fibrin monomers required for platelet buffer formation [23]. Fibrinogen has a high molecular weight (number), is soluble in blood plasma and is the active enzyme that mediates the conversion of thrombin to fibrin. Part-time activated thromboplastin is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intrinsic coagulation pathway in measuring the formation of fibrin clots. Prolonged aPTT indicates that one of the factors is lower than normal or indicates the presence of inhibitors, such as factors VIII, IX, XI and XII (intrinsically) or factors II, V and X (common pathway) [24]. In our study, the ratio was inversely proportional, indicating only a possible inflammatory reaction, which means that a common substance in the composition of those tested determined the inflammatory response, most likely being DMSO. Control groups maintained the same trend of increasing fibrinogen and decreasing PT, aPTT and TT, without showing a significant difference from the main or recovery group. The same results ANCU\u00deA et al.13 have been reported in toxicological tests of Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which may be clinically relevant [25-26], but the toxicological potential of these findings in rats is low in humans. In a concordance analysis of the toxicity of pharmaceuticals to humans and animals, the results showed a positive human concordance rate of 71% for combined rodent and non-rodent species, 63% for single non-rodents and 43% for single rodents [27]. Therefore, a correct and complete assessment of all parameters evaluated in repeated dose toxicity tests determines the toxic potential of a substance. 5. CONCLUSIONS Fibrinogen, PT, aPTT and TT are the standard blood coagulation parameters evaluated in the toxicity tests and after analyzing the results obtained in the study no toxicological changes were observed in the coagulation indices of the main group and recovery. The results obtained in the study represent a preliminary phase which, corroborated with the results of the other tests, supports the conclusion that the candidate vaccine does not have toxicological potential.
