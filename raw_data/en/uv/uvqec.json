Unani Tibb Medicine is a holistic approach to health that originated in Greece over 2,000 years ago. The word \"Unani\" comes from the Arabic word for \"Greek,\" and \"Tibb\" means \"medicine.\" Unani Tibb Medicine is based on the belief that all humans have four essential elements: air, water, fire, and earth. These elements are in constant balance, and when one is out of balance, it can lead to illness. Unani Tibb practitioners use a variety of modalities to restore balance and promote health, including dietary modification, herbs, and massage. Unani Tibb Medicine has a long history of use in the Middle East and Asia. However, it is gaining popularity in the West as more people seek alternative approaches to health care. A growing body of scientific evidence supports the efficacy of Unani therapies. Many people find that these natural treatments offer a gentle and effective way to improve their health and well-being. Arlington Integrative Medical Center is pleased to offer Unani Tibb Medicine as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive care for the whole person.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) reportedly said, \"There is no disease that Allah has created, except that He also has created its cure.\" This principle forms the foundation of Islamic/prophetic medicine, which seeks to treat the whole person rather than just disease symptoms. Islamic/prophetic medicine stresses the importance of preventive measures, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding harmful substances. It also emphasizes the role of the mind-body connection in healing, where positive thinking and prayer help promote physical healing. In addition, Islamic/prophetic medicine recognizes the role of spiritual healing in overall health and well-being. This treatment is a unique medicine that may not be for everyone.

One of the key tenets of naturopathic medicine is using supplements to support the body's natural healing process. Supplements are an essential part of naturopathic care because they can help correct imbalances and deficiencies that may contribute to ill health. Naturopathic doctors often prescribe dietary supplements as part of their treatment plans. For example, supplements such as vitamin C and zinc assist in boosting the immune system, while omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce inflammation. While supplements are not a substitute for a healthy diet and lifestyle, they can be crucial to naturopathic care. When used correctly and with the guidance of a Naturopathic doctor, supplements can help optimize health and prevent disease. Common naturopathic treatments include specialty teas and coffee, thought to have many health benefits. For example, green tea is rich in antioxidants and helps improve heart health, while chamomile tea is a natural relaxant. Similarly, coffee is a popular naturopathic remedy due to its high levels of caffeine and antioxidants. In addition, specialty coffees such as Turkish and Vietnamese iced coffee are especially popular among naturopaths, as utilizing these beverages helps improve digestion, detoxify the body, and boost energy levels. If you are interested in trying specialty teas and coffee, book an appointment to speak with one of our naturopathic doctors about which ones might be right for you. "}
