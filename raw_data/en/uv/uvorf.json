Here is a brief explanation of some of the modalities. Integrative Medicine Integrative Medicine combines mainstream medical therapies with non-conventional complementary therapies. However, Integrative Medicine only uses complementary therapies for which there is some high-quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness. In short, Integrative Medicine utilizes all appropriate, evidence-based therapies to achieve health. Functional Medicine Functional medicine involves understanding the origins, prevention and treatment of complex, chronic disease. *Patient-centered care. The focus of functional medicine is on patient-centered care, promoting health as a positive vitality, beyond the absence of disease. *An integrative, science-based healthcare approach. Functional medicine practitioners look \"upstream\" to consider the complex web of interactions in the patient's history, physiology and lifestyle that can lead to illness. The unique genetic makeup of each patient is considered, along with both internal (mind, body and spirit) and external (physical and social environment) factors that affect total functioning. *Integrating best medical practices. Functional medicine integrates traditional Western medical practices with what are sometimes considered \"alternative\" or \"integrative\" medicine, creating a focus on prevention through nutrition, diet and exercise; use of the latest laboratory testing and other diagnostic techniques, and prescribed combinations of drugs and/or botanical medicines, supplements, therapeutic diets, detoxification programs and stress management techniques. Homeopathy Homeopathic medicine is a medical philosophy and practice based on the idea that the body has the ability to heal itself. Homeopathic medicine views symptoms of illness as normal responses of the body as it attempts to regain health. Homeopathy is based on the idea that \"like cures like.\" That is, if a substance causes a symptom in a healthy person, giving the person a very small amount of the same substance may cure the illness. In theory, a homeopathic dose enhances the body's normal healing and self-regulatory processes. Botanical Medicine or Herbal Medicine Botanical medicine or phytomedicine, refers to using a plant's seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, or flowers for medicinal purposes. Herbalism has a long tradition of use outside of conventional medicine. It is becoming more mainstream as improvements in analysis and quality control along with advances in clinical research show the value of herbal medicine in the treating and preventing disease. "}
