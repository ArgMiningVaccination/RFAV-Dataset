The Academy also serves as an advocate for improved patient care and informs the public about the science of orthopaedics. Founded in 1933, the Academy has grown from a small organization serving less than 500 members to the world's largest medical association of musculoskeletal specialists. The Academy now serves more than 39,000 members worldwide. Members of the Academy, called Fellows, are orthopaedists concerned with the diagnosis, care, and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. The orthopaedist's scope of practice includes disorders of the body's bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons.Circulation TOTAL: 27,010BREAKDOWN: 27,010 AAOS Members: 26,515 US / 495 Canada Sworn Statement Rates EARNED RATES: Rates are based on the total units run in a calendar year (i.e., 6 full pages and 6 half pages earn 12x rate).

The first three articles of the series focus on results from the 2018 AAOS Census Survey, and the final article includes data collected by the 2017 American Association of Ortho- paedic Executives Benchmarking Survey of Orthopaedic Practices. The second part will be featured in the September issue of AAOS Now. The AAOS research, quality, and sci- entific affairs department gathers demo- graphic and practice data on orthopaedic surgeons through the Orthopaedic Prac- tice in the United States (OPUS) Survey, also known as the Census Survey. The most recent data from the biennial report come from the 2018 Census Survey, the 17th in the series, which had a response rate of 23.3 percent based on the most recent orthopaedic physician census of 30,141 members. The information collected in the surveys helps ensure that AAOS mem- bers are accurately represented, that Academy programs and products evolve to reflect changes in membership, and that AAOS continues to address the professional needs and interests of its members. Surgeon density Surgeon density was computed with 2017 U.S. Census figures and 2018 or- thopaedic surgeon counts per state. The 2018 density of orthopaedic surgeons in the United States was 9.25 per 100,000 population, or a population of 10,810 per orthopaedic surgeon. Montana, Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska, and South Dakota had the highest surgeon density, with more than 13 orthopaedic sur- geons per 100,000 people (i.e., a popu- lation of 7,692 or fewer per orthopaedic surgeon). Mississippi, Texas, Nevada, Arkansas, and Oklahoma had the lowest surgeon density at eight or fewer or- thopaedic surgeons per 100,000 people (i.e., population of 12,500 or more per orthopaedic surgeon). The surgeon density map (Fig. 1) illustrates the density of orthopaedists by state. The online version of this article lists each state's density in de- creasing order.Age and sex The average age of an orthopaedic sur- geon is 56.5 years. Most (92.2 percent) of the orthopaedic workforce is male, and 5.8 percent is female (2.0 percent did not indicate their sex) (Fig. 2). For a list of average ages by state, view the online version of this article. Part two of this article will address trends in the data reported. Race/ethnicity Fig. 3 shows the racial/ethnic break- down among orthopaedic surgeons. The majority of the orthopaedic workforce is white. Asian Americans comprise the largest minority group, followed by Hispanic/Latino, then other, black, and Native American. Practice setting Members were asked to identify their practice settings (Fig. 4). The most common practice setting is private practice-group (36 percent), followed by hospital/medical center (17 percent), academic practice-salaried by aca- demic institution (14 percent), private NOLC Session Asks, 'How Do We Define Value in Health Care?' KERRI FITZGERALD U.S. health spending was 17.2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016, according to data from the Organisation for Econom- ic Co-operation and Development. But GDP is not the right measure of suc- cess in a healthcare system, according to Robert H. Quinn, MD, chair of the AAOS Council on Research and Qual- ity, who said success can be measured only by the value delivered per dollar spent.

Silhak\u2014meaning practical learning\u2014scholars challenged the traditional Confucianism that had dominated the Joseon dynasty. They advocated pragmatic sciences, including Western medicine versus traditional Oriental medicine. In the mid-18th century, Western medicine was partially imported from China. However, modern medicine was substantially in- troduced with the foundation of Jejungwon, the first Western hos- pital established in Seoul in 1885. Jejungwon was initially run by Protestant missionary doctors from the Presbyterian Missions in New York, such as Horace N. Allen, MD; W.B. Scranton, MD; John W. Heron, MD; and others from the United States. In 1886, 16 Korean medical stu- dents embarked on the first modern medical education at Jejungwon Medical School under the direc- tion of Dr. Allen. That first medical education system was developed by Charles DeCook, MDThursday.

Mulcahey, MD; Jo A. Hannafin, MD, PhD; Elizabeth A. Arendt, MD; and Karen M. Sutton, MD, discussed the influence of sex-related factors on treat- ment outcomes and return to play in sports medicine. This article covers Dr. Sutton's pre- sentation on bone health and stress frac - tures, with particular attention given to female athletes. An article on page 12 covers the presentation by Dr. Mulca- hey on sex differences with anterior cruciate ligament tears; the October issue of AAOS Now will cover the talks by Dr. Hannafin on shoulder injury and Dr. Arendt on patellofemoral injuries and issues. Dr. Sutton, of Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, N.Y., described the female athlete triad, which involves: low energy availability (LEA) menstrual dysfunction low bone mineral density (BMD) LEA may occur with or without an accompanying eating disorder, Dr. Sutton explained. \"They don't have to come in and make you think, 'This is someone with an extreme case of anorexia or bulimia.' It actually may be an athlete who's a midfielder in soccer and is running up and down the field, and they just happen to not be taking in the appropriate calories that they're supposed to be taking.\" Menstrual function ranges from eu- menorrhea to oligomenorrhea to amen- orrhea, Dr. Sutton said. BMD ranges from normal to osteoporosis. \"I think we're doing a little bit better of a job right now trying to figure out our athletes when they have low BMD, but it's still challenging because most of the data [are] on women who are closer to about 60 to 80 years old,\" Dr. Sutton said. \"Even female athletes with apparently strong bone may suffer stress injuries when loading exceeds the bearing capacity. We are still working on a clear definition of adequate bone quality for higher levels of activity and sports participation. Sending some of these patients for a bone density scan is not always appropriate based on the incomplete data we have on female athletes.\" Dr. Sutton explained the concept of \"relative energy deficiency in sports,\" or RED-S. The syndrome may occur in male or female athletes, and although it may be of particular concern in females in regard to altered reproductive hor - mones and lower BMD, it may affect systems in both sexes, such as the met- abolic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune systems. \"If you are working with schools, colleges, or professional teams, you can talk about this as not just a female athlete issue but one that can affect the Sex-related Differences in Sports Medicine: Bone Health and Stress Fractures TERRY STANTON Fig. 1 MRI scans without contrast with sagittal (A) and coronal (B) views of the left knee of a 44-year-old woman, reveal a tibial plateau stress fracture.
