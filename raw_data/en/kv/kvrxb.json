ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 58 of 124 2. CLASSIFICATION RULES FOR IN-VITRO DIAGNOSTIC PRO DUCTS RULE 1: IVD medical devices intended for the following purp oses are classified as Class D: devices intended to be used to detect the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent in blood, blood components, blo od derivatives, cells, tissues or organs in order to assess their suitabil ity for transfusion or transplantation, or devices intended to be used to detect the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent that causes a life-threatening, often incurable, disease with a high risk of propagation. Rationale: The application of this rule as defined above shou ld be in accordance with the rationale that follows: IVD me dical devices in this Class are intended to be used to ensure the safety of blo od and blood components for transfusion and/or cells, tissues and organs fo r transplantation. In most cases, the result of the test is the major determin ant as to whether the donation/product will be used. Serious diseases are those that result in death or long-term disability, which are often incurable or require major therapeutic interventions and where an accurate diagnosis is vi tal to mitigate the public health impact of the condition. Examples: Tests to detect infection by HIV, HCV, HBV, HTLV. Rule nd supplemental assays. RULE 2: IVD medical devices intended to be used for blood g rouping, or tissue typing to ensure the immunological compatibi lity of blood, blood components, cells, tissue or organs that are intend ed for transfusion or transplantation, are classified as Class C, except for ABO system [A (ABO1), B (ABO2), C), RH3 (E), RH4 (c), ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 59 of 124 RH5 (e)], which a re classified as Class D. Rationale: The application of this rule as defined above shou ld be in accordance with the following rationale: A high ind ividual risk, where an erroneous result would put the patient in an immine nt life-threatening situation places the device into Class D. The rule divides bl ood-grouping IVD medical devices into two subsets, Class C or D, depending o n the nature of the blood group antigen the IVD medical device is designed to detect, and its importance in a transfusion setting. Examples: HLA, Duffy system (other Duffy systems except thos e listed in the rule as Class D) are in Class C. RULE 3: IVD medical devices are classified as Class C if th ey are intended for use: in detecting the presence of, or exposure to, a se xually transmitted agent (e.g. Sexually transmitted diseases, such as Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae ). in detecting the presence in cerebrospinal fluid o r blood of an infectious agent with a risk of limited propagation (e.g. Neisseria meningitidis or Cryptococcus neoformans ). in detecting the presence of an infectious agent w here there is a significant risk that an erroneous result would cause death or severe disability to the individual or fetus being tested (e.g. diagnostic a ssay for CMV, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Methycillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ). in pre-natal screening of women in order to determ ine their immune status towards transmissible agents (e.g. Immune status te sts for Rubella or Toxoplasmosis). in determining infective disease status or immune status, and where there is a risk that an erroneous result will lead to a p atient management ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 60 of 124 decision resulting in an imminent life-threatening situation for the patient (e.g. Enteroviruses, CMV and HSV in transplant pat ients). in screening for selection of patients for selecti ve therapy and management, or for disease staging, or in the diag nosis of cancer (e.g. personalised medicine). NOTE: Those IVD medical devices where the therapy decision would usually be made only after further investigation and those use d for monitoring would fall into class B under rule 6. in human genetic testing (e.g. Huntington's Diseas e, Cystic Fibrosis). to monitor levels of medicines, substances or biol ogical components, when there is a risk that an erroneous result will lead to a patient management decision resulting in an immediate life-threatening situation for the patient (e.g. Cardiac markers, cyclosporin, prothrombin tim e testing). in the management of patients suffering from a lif e-threatening infectious disease (e.g. HCV viral load, HIV Viral Load and HI V and HCV geno- and subtyping). in screening for congenital disorders in the fetus (e.g. Spina Bifida or Down Syndrome). Rationale: The application of this rule as defined above shou ld be in accordance with the rationale for this rule which i s as follows: IVD medical devices in this Class present a moderate public hea lth risk, or a high individual risk, where an erroneous result would put the patie nt in an imminent life- threatening situation, or would have a major negati ve impact on outcome. The IVD medical devices provide the critical, or so le, determinant for the correct diagnosis. They may also present a high in dividual risk because of the stress and anxiety resulting from the information a nd the nature of the possible follow-up measures. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 61 of 124 RULE 4: IVD medical devices intended for self-testing are c lassified as Class C, except those devices from which the result is not determining a medically critical status, or is preliminary and re quires follow-up with the appropriate laboratory test in which case they are Class B. IVD medical devices intended for blood gases and bl ood glucose determinations for near-patient testing would be Cl ass C. Other IVD medical devices that are intended for near patient should b e classified in their own right using the classification rules. Rationale: The application of this rule as defined above shou ld be in accordance with the rationale for this rule which i s as follows: In general, these IVD medical devices are used by individuals w ith no technical expertise and thus the labelling and instructions for use are critical to the proper outcome of the test. Example for Self-testing Class C: Blood glucose monitoring, Example for Self-testing Class B: Pregnancy self test, Fertility testing, Urine test strip. RULE 5: The following IVD medical devices are classified as Class A: reagents or other articles that possess specific c haracteristics, intended by the product owner to make them suitable for in vitr o diagnostic procedures related to a specific examination. instruments intended by the product owner specific ally to be used for in vitro diagnostic procedures. specimen receptacles. NOTE: Any product for general laboratory use not manufactured, sold or represented for use in specified in vitro diagnosti c applications are not deemed to be IVD medical devices. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 62 of 124 Rationale: The application of this rule as defined above shou ld be in accordance with the rationale for this rule which i s as follows: These IVD medical devices present a low individual risk and n o or minimal public health risk. Examples : Selective/differential microbiological media (exc luding the dehydrated powders which are considered not to be a finished IVD medical device), identification kits for cultured microorga nisms, wash solutions, instruments and plain urine cup. NOTE: The performance of software or an instrumen t that is specifically required to perform a particular test will be assessed at the s ame time as the test kit. NOTE: The interdependence of the instrument and t he test methodology prevents the instrument from being assessed separately, even though the instrument itself is still classified as Class A. RULE 6: IVD medical devices not covered in Rules 1 through 5 are classified as Class B. Rationale: The application of this rule as defined above shou ld be in accordance with the rationale for this rule which i s as follows: These IVD medical devices present a moderate individual risk as they are not likely to lead to an erroneous result that would cause death or severe disability, have a major negative impact on patient outcome or put the individual in immediate danger. The IVD medical devices give results that a re usually one of several determinants. If the test result is the sole determ inant however other information is available, such as presenting signs and symptoms or other clinical information that may guide a physician, su ch that classification into Class B may be justified. Other appropriate control s may also be in place to validate the results. This Class also includes thos e IVD medical devices that ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 63 of 124 present a low public health risk because they detec t infectious agents that are not easily propagated in a population. Examples: Blood gases, H. pylori and physiological markers such as hormones, vitamins, enzymes, metabolic markers, spe cific IgE assays and celiac disease markers. RULE 7: IVD medical devices that are controls without a qu antitative or qualitative assigned value will be classified as Cl ass B. Rationale: For such controls, the user, not the product owne r, assigns the qualitative or quantitative value. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 64 of 124 ANNEX 4 ASEAN Common Submission Dossier Template 1. INTRODUCTION The Common Submission Dossier Template (CSDT) will harmonize the differences in documentation formats that presently exist in different ASEAN jurisdictions. The adoption of this guidance docume nt in ASEAN will eliminate the preparation of multiple dossiers, arranged in d ifferent formats but with essentially the same contents, for regulatory submi ssion to different regulatory authorities. 2. SCOPE The CSDT applies to all products that fall within t he definition of a medical device. The format of the CSDT recommended herein is based upon the goal of both regulators and product owners to strive for the lea st burdensome means to demonstrate conformity to the Essential Principles for all classes of medical devices. Requirements for post-market vigilance or adverse e vent reporting are outside the scope of this document. 3. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY An executive summary shall be provided with the com mon submission dossier template, which shall include the following informa tion: an overview, e.g., introductory descriptive inform ation on the medical device, the intended uses and indications for use o f the medical device, any novel features and a synopsis of the content of the CSDT; commercial marketing history; ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 65 of 124 intended uses and indications in labelling; list of regulatory approval or marketing clearance obtained; status of any pending request for market clearance ; and important safety/performance related information. 4. ELEMENTS OF THE COMMON SUBMISSION DOSSIER TEMPLA TE 4.1. Relevant Essential Principles and Method Used to Demonstrate Conformity The CSDT should identify the Essential Principles o f Safety and Performance of Medical Devices that are applicable to the devic e. The CSDT should identify the general method used to demonstrate con formity to each applicable Essential Principle. The methods that ma y be used include compliance with recognized or other standards, stat e of the art or internal industry methods, comparisons to other similar mark eted devices, etc. The CSDT should identify the specific documents related to the method used to demonstrate conformity to the Essential Principles. 4.1.1. Essential Principles and Evidence of Conform ity The evidence of conformity can be provided in tabul ar form with supporting documentation available for review as required. For example, a completed Essential Principles confo rmity checklist can be used to demonstrate that a recognized test standard was used as part of the method to demonstrate conformity to one Essential P rinciple. As such, CSDT would then include a declaration of conformity to t he standard, or other certification permitted by the Regulatory Authority , and a summary of the test data, if the standard does not include performance requirements. When the product owner uses international or other standards to demonstrat e conformity with the Essential Principles, the CSDT should identify the full title ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 66 of 124 of the standard, identifying numbers, date of the s tandard, and the organization that created the standard. When the product owner uses other means, such as internal standards, the CSDT should describe the means. Not all the essenti al principles will apply to all devices and it is for the product owner of the device to assess which are appropriate for his particular device product. In d etermining this, account must be taken of the intended purpose of the device. 4.2. Device Description 4.2.1.

Sufficient detail must be provided to enable a person generally familiar w ith quality systems to judge the appropriateness of the controls in place. A bri ef summary of the sterilization method and processing should be inclu ded, if any. If multiple facilities are involved in the manufact ure of device, the applicable information (e.g. quality assurance certificates is sued by an accredited third party inspection body) for each facility must be su bmitted. Firms that manufacture or process the device under contract to the product owner may elect to submit all or a portion of the manufacturi ng information applicable to their facility directly to the Regulatory Authority in the form of a master file. The product owner should inform these contractors of the need to supp ly detailed information on the device. However, it is not the intent of this section to capture information relating to the supply of su b-components (i.e. unfinished medical device) that contributes towards the manufacture of the finished device itself. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 75 of 124 ANNEX 5 Post Marketing Alert System (PMAS) Requirements 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Purpose This document aims to provide guidance on the post- market obligations of companies or persons who place medical devices on t he markets of ASEAN Member States. 1.2. Background This document is intended to provide guidelines on the following post-market alerting system requirements:- Distribution records Complaint records Adverse event (AE) reporting criteria and reportin g format Field Safety Corrective Action (FSCA) reporting fo rmat The Regulatory Authorities in the Member States may adopt the recommended post-market alerting system requirement s in this Annex or prescribe their own post-market alerting system req uirements. Distribution records Traceability is not only a requirement of an effect ive quality system but also the requirement of regulatory bodies around the wor ld. Keeping proper and appropriate distribution records is an important co mponent of ensuring traceability of products in the market. Complaint records An effective complaint handling system is an import ant part of any quality system. Any complaint received on a medical device should be evaluated and ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 76 of 124 if necessary, thoroughly investigated and analysed, and corrective actions should be taken. The results of the evaluation shou ld lead to a conclusion regarding whether the complaint was valid, the caus es of the complaint, and what actions were necessary to prevent further occu rrences. Physical Manufacturers, authorised representative a nd authorised distributors of medical devices are to:- maintain records of complaint reports and of actio ns taken in response to these reports, and produce such records for inspect ion by the Regulatory Authority in the Member State or an enforcement off icer as and when required; and establish and implement documented procedures to c onduct effective and timely investigations of reported problems. Adverse events A number of post-marketing risk assessment measures to ensure the continued safe use of medical devices. These measur es include reporting from healthcare professionals, mandatory reporting from medical device dealers, and exchange of regulatory information wit h other medical device regulatory agencies. The mandatory reporting of AEs by medical device de alers is an important part of the post-market surveillance system. The ob jective of AE reporting and subsequent evaluations is to improve protection of the health and safety of patients, users and others by disseminating informa tion that may reduce the likelihood of, or prevent repetition of AEs, or all eviate consequences of such repetition. Field Safety Corrective Action (FSCA) A FSCA is required when it becomes necessary for th e product owner of the medical device to take action (including recall of the device) to eliminate, or ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 77 of 124 reduce the risk of, the hazards identified. A FSCA may still be necessary even when the medical device is no longer on the market or has been withdrawn but could still po ssibly be in use (e.g. implants). A FSCA only applies to a medical device that has al ready been distributed by the product owner. It does not arise when a product owner is exchanging or upgrading medical devices in the absence of a safet y risk or when removals from the market are for purely commercial reasons. The physical manufacturer, authorised representativ e or authorised distributor in the Member State shall be responsible for physic ally performing and completing the FSCA in the Member State. 1.3.

Distribution records should be maintained for all m edical devices, including low risk medical devices that may be exempted from product registration. 2.2. Necessity of distribution records Keeping distribution records will facilitate the ac countability and traceability of a medical device. This ensures that the medical dev ice distribution channels in Member States. Distribution records of the medical devices are req uired to:- expedite any recalls of batches of the medical dev ices; identify the manufacturer of each batch of the med ical devices; identify where each batch of the medical devices i s supplied. 2.3. Information to be retained as distribution rec ords The distribution record should contain sufficient i nformation to permit complete and rapid withdrawal of the medical device from the market, where necessary. Information may include:- name and address of initial consignee; identification and quantity of medical devices shi pped; date shipped; ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 81 of 124 any control number(s) used, including lot / batch / serial number of the medical device. 2.4. Retention period for distribution records The distribution record maintained with respect of a medical device should be retained for the longer of one of the following:- the projected useful life of the medical device as determined by the product owner; two years after the medical device is shipped. NOTE: The projected useful life of a medical dev ice may be based on technical, legal, commercial or other considerations. Product owners may refer to ISO/TR 14969 Medical devices - Quality management systems - Guid ance on the application of ISO 13485:2003 for some of the considerations when defi ning the lifetime of their medical device. For medical devices that are imported for export on ly, it is two years after the date the medical device is shipped out of the Membe r State. 2.5. Records maintenance Distribution records should be maintained in a mann er that will allow their timely retrieval. 2.6. Records of implant The distribution record maintained should also cont ain a record of the information of the implant when supplied by a healt hcare facility. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 82 of 124 3. COMPLAINT RECORDS The records on complaints related to a medical devi ce may include the following information:- the device brand number, model/catal ogue number or bar code, control/serial/lot number and any other means of identification of the device; the name(s) and address(es) of the manufacturer, i mporter, wholesaler and/or registrant; records pertaining to the problem investigation. All actions taken by the physical manufacturer, aut horised representative, and authorised representative in response to the proble ms and complaints must be kept on record. These actions include any commun ications with the reporter/complainant, the evaluation of the problem /complaint, and any steps taken to correct the problem or prevent the recurre nce of the problem. Such steps might include increased post-market surveilla nce of the medical device, corrective and preventive action with respect to th e design and manufacture of the medical device, or product recall. Attention should also be given to identifying the d evelopment of patterns or trends in problems with medical devices. The report of an isolated incident would assume much greater significance if other sim ilar occurrences were reported. 3.1. Complaint handling procedure Physical manufacturers, authorised representative a nd authorised distributors should have in place a written procedure for compla int handling that outlines the steps to be taken once a complaint report is re ceived. The procedure should identify the personnel involved, and describ e their functions and responsibilities. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 83 of 124 In addition, the procedure should explain how to ma intain records of the complaint reports, and where appropriate, how to as sess these records and a reasonable time frame for completion of the investi gation. The procedure may contain the following:- determination of whether there is a health hazard associated with the medical device; determination of whether the medical device fails to conform to any claim made by the manufacturer, importer, wholesaler or r egistrant relating to its effectiveness, benefits, performance characteristic s or safety; determination of whether the medical device fails to meet any legislative requirements; determination of the most appropriate preventive/c orrective action; and justification when no action is taken, for example , in the case of receiving an unfounded or invalid complaint. 3.2. Retention of complaint records Complaint records maintained with respect to a medi cal device should be retained for a period of five years on top of the p rojected useful life of the medical device as determined by the product owner. For example, if the projected useful life of the medical device is one year, the complaint records should be kept for six years. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 84 of 124 4. ADVERSE EVENTS 4.1. Adverse event (AE) reportability criteria As a general principle, there should be a pre-dispo sition to report rather than not to report in case of doubt on the reportability of an AE. Any AE, which meets the three basic reporting criteria listed bel ow, is considered as a reportable AE. The criteria are that:- an AE has occurred; the medical device is associated with the AE; the AE led to one of the following outcomes; /square4 a serious threat to public health; /square4 death of a patient, user or other person; /square4 serious deterioration in state of health, user or other person; /square4 no death or serious injury occurred but the event might lead to death or serious injury of a patient, user or other person i f the event recurs. An event or other occurrence relating to a medical device represents a serious threat to public health if one or more of the follo wing occur:- the event or other occurrence is a hazard arising from a systematic failure of the medical device that becomes known to the man ufacturer, importer or wholesaler of the medical device; the event or other occurrence may lead to the deat h of, or a serious injury to, a patient, a user of the medical device or any other person; the probable rate of occurrence of or degree of se verity of harm caused by the hazard was not previously known or anticipated by the product owner of the medical device; it becomes necessary for the product owner of the medical device to take prompt action (including the recall of the medical device) to eliminate or reduce the risk of the hazard. A serious deterioration in state of health can incl ude:- ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 85 of 124 life-threatening illness or injury; permanent impairment of a body function or permane nt damage to a body structure; a condition necessitating medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent permanent impairment of a body function or permanen t damage to a body structure. Not all AEs that should be reported involve a death or serious deterioration in health that actually occurred. The non-occurrence o f an adverse effect might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or t o the timely intervention of health-care personnel. In such cases, it is suffici ent that either:- an AE associated with a medical device happened, a nd the AE was such that, if it occurred again, it might lead to death or serious deterioration in health; or testing, examination of the medical device, inform ation supplied with the medical device, or any scientific literature indica ted some factor (e.g. a deterioration in characteristics or performance, or a shortcoming in the information) which could lead to an AE involving de ath or serious deterioration in health. For In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) medical devices, it w ould be sufficient that:- an AE associated with an IVD medical device occurr ed, and the AE might lead to death or serious deterioratio n in health if it happens again; for the adverse event to become reportable. In assessing the type of AE, medical practitioner i nvolved or other health-care professional should be consulted wherever practicab le. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 86 of 124 All persons who place medical devices on the market s of Member States should be vigilant for any changes in trends or fre quency of occurrences of AEs with regards to medical devices they deal in. 4.2. Adverse events involving In vitro diagnostic d evices Most IVD medical devices do not come into contact w ith patients and so it is not easy to establish direct harm to patients, unle ss the IVD medical device itself causes deterioration in the state of health in a patient. However, an adverse event involving an IVD medical device could result in indirect harm as a result of an action taken or not taken on the bas is of an incorrect reading obtained with an IVD medical device. There should always be a predisposition to report e ven though it may not be easy to establish that a serious deterioration in t he state of a patient's health was the result of an erroneous test result obtained with an IVD medical device, or if the harm was the result of an error b y the user or third party. Information supplied by the product owner when inad equate, can lead users, patients or third parties to harm and should be rep orted. For self-testing IVD medical devices, where a medical decision may be ma de directly by the user who is the patient, insufficient information on the product presentation could lead to an incorrect use of the IVD medical device or a misdiagnosis. Hence, AEs involving IVD medical devices will most likely result from a consequence of a medical decision or action taken, or not taken , on the basis of result(s) provided by the IVD medical device. Examples of these types of AEs include (non-exhaust ive list):- misdiagnosis; delayed diagnosis; delayed treatment; ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 87 of 124 inappropriate treatment; transfusion of inappropriate materials. AEs for IVD medical devices may arise due to (non-e xhaustive list):- shortcomings in the design or manufacture of the I VD medical device itself; inadequate instructions for use; inadequate servicing and maintenance; locally initiated modifications or adjustments; inappropriate user practice; inappropriate management procedures; inappropriate environment in which an IVD medical device is used or stored; selection of the incorrect IVD medical device for the purpose. 4.3. Adverse Event Reporting Timeline All AEs should be reported immediately and not later than 48 hours for events that represents a serious threat to public health; not later than 10 days for events that has led to the death, or a serious deterioration in the state of health, of a patient, a user of the medical device or any other person; not later than 30 days for events where a recurren ce of which might lead to the death, or a serious deterioration in the state of health, of a patient, a user of the medical device or any other person The clock for reporting starts as soon as any perso nnel of the medical device dealers, including sales representatives, is made a ware of the AE. If there is uncertainty about whether the AE is reportable, dea lers should still submit a report within the timeframe stipulated. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 88 of 124 Dealers should not unduly delay the reporting of AE (s) if information is incomplete. The initial report of an AE should cont ain as much relevant detail as is immediately available, but should not be dela yed for the sake of gathering additional information. Dealers of medical devices are to follow up with a final report within 30 days of the initial reports, detailing the investigation in to the AE. If the final report is not available within 30 days, a follow-up report is to be submitted. Follow-up reports may be requested as and when necessary. 4.4. Reporting obligations All physical manufacturers, authorised representati ve and authorised distributors shall be required to report AEs involv ing medical devices, which they have placed on the market in the Member State. Reports should be submitted using the prescribed fo rmat of the regulatory authority of the Member State, which may follow the ASEAN AE Report Form (Reference No. ASEAN-MDAR). ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 89 of 124 5. FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION (FSCA) 5.1. Determining the need for a field safety correc tive action The product owner of the medical device in question is responsible for determining the need for a FSCA. In accessing the n eed for an FSCA, the product owner should perform a risk assessment in a ccordance to ISO 14971:2007. If the risk assessment performed by the product owner is deemed deficient by the regulatory authority of the Member State, the regulatory authority of the member state may instru ct the relevant companies and persons who placed the medical device in the ma rket of the Member State to take additional measures to safeguard publ ic health. FSCA may be triggered when information from the pro duct owner's post market surveillance (including product complaints, adverse incidents, etc) indicates an unacceptable increase in risk. On occasions, the regulatory authority may advise p roduct owners or their representative to implement a FSCA in relation to a medical device due to risk of serious injury or death to patients, users or ot hers. Such risks are usually identified through adverse events reports or other means. In certain cases it may be necessary to use precaut ionary measures in the interest of public health and restrict or prohibit products subject to particular requirements. In other cases, for safety reasons, i t may be necessary to remove a medical device from the market. 5.2. Notification of field safety corrective action When the product owner or its representative decide s to initiate a FSCA, he shall notify the regulatory authority. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 90 of 124 The time frame for notification of an FSCA shall be prescribed by the regulatory authority of the Member State. All notification and reports are to be submitted in the manner that the regulatory authority prescribes. 5.3. Information to be provided When the need for an FSCA has been established, the product owner or its representative should gather all relevant informati on on incident reports, the product and its distribution, and the action propos ed. Some information may not be available immediately (e.g. distribution cha ins, batch size etc). Notification to the regulatory authority in the Mem ber State should not be delayed pending collation of these data. Reports should be submitted using the prescribed fo rmat of the regulatory authority of the Member State, which may follow the ASEAN FSCA Report Form (Reference No. ASEAN-MDFR). 5.4. Closure of FSCA On completion of a FSCA, the product owner or its r epresentative should provide details to the regulatory authority of the Member State of the proposed corrective action to prevent recurrence of the prob lem that give rise to the FSCA. The FSCA will only be closed when all appropriate c orrective actions have been undertaken, subject to the concurrence of the regulatory authority of the Member State.

The product is not intended for any medical purpose or objective. 2. LABELLING REQUIREMENTS 2.1 General Requirements As far as it is practical and appropriate, the inf ormation needed to identify and use the device safely should be provided on the device itself, and /or on the packaging for each unit (primary level of pa ckaging), and / or on the packaging of multiple devices (secondary level of p ackaging). If individual packaging of each unit is not practicable, the info rmation should be set out in the leaflet, packaging insert or other media sup plied with, or applicable to, one or multiple devices. Where the product owner supplies multiple devices to a single user and/or location, it may be sufficient and appropriate to p rovide with them only a single copy of the instructions for use. In these c ircumstances the device user should have access to further copies upon requ est. The medium, format, content, readability and locat ion of labelling should be appropriate to the particular device, its intend ed purpose and the technical knowledge, experience, education or train ing of the intended user(s). In particular, instructions for use should be written in terms readily understood by the intended user and, where appropri ate, supplemented with drawings and diagrams. Some devices may requir e separate information for the healthcare professional and the lay user. Instructions for Use (IFU) may not be needed or ma y be abbreviated for devices of low or moderate risk if they can be used safely and as intended by the product owner without any such instructions. Paper versions of all labelling must accompany the product. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 104 of 124 Any residual risk identified in the risk analysis should be reflected as contraindications or warnings within the labelling. The use of internationally recognised symbols is e ncouraged provided that device safety is not compromised by a lack of under standing on the part of the patient or user. Where the meaning of the symbo l is not obvious to the device user, e.g. for a lay-user or for a newly int roduced symbol, an explanation should be provided. All characters on labelling must be of adequate si ze and legibly printed. 2.2 Content of Labelling 2.2.1 Primary and Secondary Levels of Packaging Contact Information It is mandatory to include the name and contact det ails (address and/or phone number and/or fax number and/or website address to obtain technical assistance) of the product owner on the labelling.

ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 110 of 124 ANNEX 10 Clinical Investigation - Pre-market Clinical Invest igation to Support Marketing Authorisation Application 1. INTRODUCTION A clinical investigation is a systematic investigat ion or study in or on one or more human subjects, undertaken to assess the safet y and/or performance of a medical device.\" The undertaking of a clinical investigation is a sc ientific process that represents one method of generating clinical data. The objective of a clinical investigation is to eva luate whether the device is suitable for the purpose(s) and the population(s) f or which it is intended. In general, clinical investigations must take into account scientific principles underlying the collection of clinical data along wi th accepted ethical standards surrounding the use of human subjects. The clinica l investigation objectives and design should be documented in a clinical inves tigation plan. While clinical evidence is an essential element of the pre-market conformity assessment process to demonstrate conformity to Ess ential Principles, it is important to recognise that there may be limitation s in the clinical data available in the pre-market phase. Such limitation s may be due to, for example, the duration of pre-market clinical invest igations, the number of subjects involved in an investigation, the relative homogeneity of subjects and investigators and the control of variables in the s etting of a clinical investigation versus use in the full range of condi tions encountered in general medical practice. ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 111 of 124 It is appropriate to place a product on the market once conformity to the relevant Essential Principles, including a favourab le risk/benefit ratio, has been demonstrated. Complete characterization of al l risks may not always be possible or practicable in the pre-market phase. T herefore, there may be questions regarding residual risks that should be a nswered in the post-market phase through the use of one or more systematic pos t-market clinical follow- up studies. Such studies are not intended to subs titute or duplicate but rather supplement the pre-market clinical evaluation. Post-market clinical follow-up studies are one of s everal options available in a post-market surveillance programme and contribute t o the risk management process. 2. SCOPE The primary purpose of this Annex is to provide gui delines in relation to: when a clinical investigation should be undertaken for a medical device to demonstrate compliance with the relevant Essential Principles (see Annex 1 \"Essential Principles of Safety and Performance of M edical Devices \"), and the general principles of clinical investigations involving medical devices. post-market clinical follow-up studies developed s pecifically for issues of residual risk (including those mandated by regulati on). the circumstances where a post-market clinical fol low-up study is indicated; the general principles of post-market clinical fol low-up studies involving medical devices; and the use of study information. This Annex is intended to apply to medical devices generally and the device component of combination products, to address the u se of Clinical ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 112 of 124 Investigations to support a marketing authorization application. It is not intended to cover In Vitro Diagnostic products. 3. DEFINITIONS CLINICAL DATA: Safety and/or performance information that are generated from the clinical use of a medical device .

Circumstances Where a Pre-market Clinical Inve stigation is Needed Clinical investigations are necessary to provide th e data not available through other sources (such as literature or preclinical te sting) required to demonstrate compliance with the relevant Essential Principles ( including safety, clinical performance and acceptability of risk/benefit ratio associated with its use). When a clinical investigation is conducted, the dat a obtained is used in the clinical evaluation process and is part of the clin ical evidence for the device. Crucial steps in clarifying the need for clinical i nvestigations (i) Identifying relevant clinical Essential Principles (for example, specifics of safety, clinical performance, acceptability of risk /benefit-ratio) for the device and its intended use/purpose(s) and use(s) ( see Annex 1 - Essential Principles of Safety and Performance of M edical Devices ); (ii) Perform risk management activities to help in identifying the clinical data necessary to control residual risks and aspects of clinical performance not completely resolved by available information e.g. d esign solutions, preclinical and material/technical evaluation, conf ormity with relevant standards, labelling, etc.; (iii) Conduct a proper clinical evaluation to demonstrate which clinical data are necessary and can be adequately contributed to by other methods, such as literature searching, prior clinical invest igations or clinical experience, and which clinical data remain to be de livered by clinical investigation(s). Available clinical data for compa rator devices should be ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 115 of 124 carefully examined for comparability and adequacy. The steps are applicable for the introduction of a new device as well as for planned changes of a device, its intended use and/o r claims. 4.2. Role of risk analysis A properly conducted risk analysis is essential in determining what clinical evidence may be needed for a particular device. A clinical investigation may be required when the currently available data from preclinical testing, and any prior clinical investigations or other forms of cli nical data are insufficient to demonstrate conformity with the Essential Principle s. This would be the case when the product owner's risk analysis and the clin ical evaluation of a medical device for a particular intended use, including new claims, shows that there are residual risks, including aspects of clinical p erformance, that have not been adequately addressed by the available data and cannot be addressed through other methods. \"Residual risk\" refers to the risk remaining after risk control measures have been taken. Risk control measures include inherent safety by design, protective measures in the medical device itself or in the manufacturing process, and information for safety. The decision to use a medical device in the context of a clinical procedure requires the re sidual risk to be balanced against the anticipated benefits of the procedure. A clinical investigation may be used to further elucidate the risk/benefit ratio in a defined patient population. For instance, risk can be measured thr ough safety endpoints, and benefits may be measured through assessments of cli nical performance. Residual risks that could require the use of a clin ical investigation might be an unknown rate of device failure. For long established technologies, clinical investi gation data that might be ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 116 of 124 required for novel technologies may not be necessar y. The available clinical data in the form of, for example, published literat ure, reports of clinical experience, post-market reports and adverse event d ata should, in principle, be adequate to establish the safety and performance of the device, provided that new risks have not been identified, and that t he indications for use have not changed. Where uncertainty exists as to whether current data are sufficient to demonstrate conformity with the Essential Principle s, discussion with regulatory authorities may be appropriate. 4.3. Justification for the Need for a Clinical Inve stigation In order to be justified and to avoid unnecessary e xperimentation on human subjects, the clinical investigation(s) must: be necessary (as assessed above); be designed properly (see Section on \" General Pri nciples of Clinical Investigation Design\"); be ethical (see Section on \"Ethical Considerations for Clinical Investigations\"); follow a proper risk management procedure to avoid undue risks; and be compliant with all applicable legal and regula tory requirements. 4.4. General Principles of Clinical Investigation D esign The design of the clinical investigation, including the study objectives and statistical considerations, should provide the clin ical data necessary to address the residual risks, including aspects of cl inical performance. Some factors that may influence the extent of data requi rements include, but are not limited to, the following:- type of device and/or regulatory classification; novel technology/relevant previous experience; ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 117 of 124 clinical application/indications; nature of exposure to the product, e.g.: surface c ontact, implantation, ingestion; risks inherent in the use of the product, e.g.: ri sk associated with the procedure; performance claims made in the device labeling (in cluding instructions for use) and/or promotional materials; component materials; disease process (including severity) and patient p opulation being treated; demographic, geographic and cultural consideration s (e.g.: age, race, gender, etc.); potential impact of device failure; period of exposure to the device; expected lifetime of the device; availability of alternative treatments and current standard of care; and ethical considerations. As a general rule, devices based on new or \"unprove n\" technology and those that extend the intended purpose of an existing tec hnology through a new clinical use are more likely to require supporting clinical investigation data. 4.5. Specific Considerations for Device Study Desig ns Device technologies have introduced a variety of co mplex challenges influencing the design of clinical investigations. Some of the factors that need to be considered include, for example: clear statement of objectives appropriate subject population(s) minimization of bias (e.g., randomization, blindin g) identification of confounding factors (e.g., concu rrent medications, co- morbidities) ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 118 of 124 choice of appropriate controls (e.g., cohort, sham , historical), where necessary design configuration (e.g., parallel, crossover, f actorial) type of comparison (e.g., superiority, non-inferio rity, equivalence) Investigations should be planned in such a way as to maximize the clinical relevance of the data while minimizing confounding factors. Possible study designs include: /square4 randomized controlled trials - clinical investigations where subjects are randomized to receive either a test or referenc e device or intervention and outcomes and event rates are compa red for the treatment groups /square4 cohort studies - data are obtained from groups who have and have not been exposed to the device (e.g. concurrent con trol) and outcomes compared /square4 case-control studies - patients with a defined outcome and controls without the outcome are selected and information is obtained about whether the subjects were exposed to the device /square4 case series - the device has been used in a series of patients and the results reported, with no control group for compari son In designing the study, statistical considerations should be prospectively specified and be based on sound scientific principl es and methodology. Care must be taken in developing a statistical plan that includes consideration of, for example, the following: /square4 clinically relevant endpoints /square4 statistical significance levels, power /square4 sample size justification /square4 analysis methodology (including sensitivity and po olability analysis) The design should ensure that the statistical eval uation derived from the investigation reflects a meaningful, clinically sig nificant outcome. Discussion with regulatory authorities may be appro priate when there is ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 119 of 124 uncertainty as to whether the proposed clinical inv estigational plan is sufficient. 4.6. Conduct of Clinical Investigations A properly conducted clinical investigation, includ ing compliance to the clinical investigation plan and applicable local laws and re gulations, ensures the protection of subjects, the integrity of the data a nd that the data obtained is acceptable for the purpose of demonstrating conform ity to the Essential Principles. 4.7. Final Study Report The outcome of a clinical investigation should be d ocumented in a final study report. The final study report then forms part of the clinical data that is included in the clinical evaluation process and ult imately becomes integrated into the clinical evaluation report for the purpose s of conformity assessment. 4.8. Ethical Considerations for Clinical Investigat ions As a general principle, \"the rights, safety and wel lbeing of clinical investigation subjects shall be protected consistent with the eth ical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki\" Specific considerations may include: clinical investigations should be used only when a ppropriate data cannot be obtained through any other method, as it is desi rable to minimize experimentation on human subjects; the design of the investigation and its endpoints should be adequate to address the residual risks including aspects of cli nical performance; care must be taken to ensure that the necessary da ta are obtained through a scientific and ethical investigational process th at does not expose ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 120 of 124 subjects to undue risks or discomfort; and ethics review and regulatory body oversight occurs in conformity to local laws or regulations.

Circumstances Where A Post-Market Clinical Fol low-Up Study Is Indicated The need for post-market clinical follow-up studies should be determined from the identification of residual risks that may impac t the risk/benefit ratio. Circumstances that may result in the need for post- market clinical follow-up studies include, for example: innovation, e.g. where the design of the device, t he materials, the principles of operation, the technology or the medi cal indications are novel; a new indication or claim has been approved; changes to device design or labelling; changes to medical practice; higher risk classification; high risk anatomical locations; severity of disease/treatment challenges; sensitivity of target population; identification of previously unstudied populations ; risks identified from the literature or similar ma rketed devices; discrepancy between the pre-market follow-up time scales and the expected life of the product; unanswered questions of long-term safety and perfo rmance; results of any previous clinical investigation inc luding adverse events identified or from post-market surveillance activit ies; questions of ability to generalise clinical invest igation results; or emergence of new information relating to safety or performance. Post-market clinical follow-up studies may not be r equired in cases where the ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 122 of 124 medium/long-term safety and clinical performance ar e already known from previous use of the device or where other appropria te post-market surveillance activities would provide sufficient da ta to address the risks. 5.2. Elements Of A Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up S tudy Post-market clinical follow-up studies are performe d on a device within its intended use/purpose(s) according to the instructio ns for use. It is important to note that post-market clinical follow-up studies mu st be conducted according to applicable laws and regulations, and should foll ow appropriate guidance and standards. The elements of a post-market clinical follow-up st udy include: (a) clearly stated objective(s) a scientifically sound design with an appropriate rationale and statistical analysis plan a study plan implementation of the study according to the plan, an analysis of the data and appropriate conclusion(s) 5.2.1. The objective(s) of post-market clinical fol low-up studies The objective(s) of the study should be stated clea rly and should address the residual risk(s) identified and be formulated to ad dress one or more specific questions relating to the clinical safety or perfor mance of the device. 5.2.2. The design of post-market clinical follow-up studies Post-market clinical follow-up studies should be de signed to address the objective(s) of the study. The design may vary bas ed on the objective(s) and should be scientifically sound to allow for valid c onclusions to be drawn. The study design can take several forms, for exampl e: ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 123 of 124 the extended follow-up of patients enrolled in pre -market investigations; a new clinical investigation; a review of data derived from a device registry; o r a review of relevant retrospective data from patie nts previously exposed to the device. 5.2.3. The post-market clinical follow-up study pla n All post-market clinical follow-up studies should h ave a plan appropriate for addressing the stated objectives. The study plan s hould justify, for example: the patient population; the selection of sites and investigators; the endpoints and statistical considerations; the number of subjects involved; the duration of the study; the data to be collected; the analysis plan including any interim reporting; and procedures for early study termination. 5.2.4. Implementation of the post-market clinical f ollow-up study, analysis of data and conclusion(s) The study should: be executed with adequate control measures to assu re compliance with the plan; include data analysis with conclusions drawn accor ding to the analysis plan by someone with appropriate expertise; and have a final report with conclusions relating back to original objective(s). 5.3. The Use of Study Information The data and conclusions derived from the post-mark et clinical follow-up ASEAN Medical Device Directive Version 11, Draft for National Consultation Dated 08 May 2012 Page 124 of 124 study are used to provide clinical evidence to supp ort the post-market surveillance program. This process may result in t he need to reassess whether the device continues to comply with the Ess ential Principles. Such assessment may result in corrective or preventive a ctions, for example, changes to the labelling/instructions for use, chan ges to manufacturing processes, or changes to the device design. "}
