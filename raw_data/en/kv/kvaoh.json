Which Vaccines are the Most Problematic? According to Dr. Smits, the most problematic vaccines are: DTaP-IPV vaccine: For diptheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), and polio. HiB vaccine: For Haemophilis influenzae type b. This vaccine is given at the same times as the DTaP-IPV vaccine MMR vaccine: For measles, mumps, and rubella. (HB) Hepatitis B Post-vaccination syndrome should always be considered whenever health complaints started at the time of, or the period following, vaccination. Complaints usually become clear after one, two or even a few weeks have passed. Also, in some cases it is often only after the second, third or fourth administration of the vaccine that problems suddenly occur. Homeopathic Treatment of PVS The offending vaccines are identified and the homeopathic version of the vaccine is then given to the child in varying potencies, to help neutralize the vaccine's harmful effects. The homeopathic form of the vaccine is completely safe and non-toxic, as it has been strongly diluted and potentised. In order to limit vaccine damage, there are homeopathic remedies that can be given to the child prior to and after vaccination to help the body cope better. Every parent wants the best for their child - being fully informed of what you are giving your child in terms of vaccinations and medications is very important. New vaccines are being added to the schedule all the time - do we know what the long-term effect of these multiple vaccinations will be on the child's immune system? Why do children have more chronic complaints, allergies, eczema, ADD, autism? There are many choices that can be made i.e. limiting the number of vaccines the child is given, being aware of adverse affects of vaccinations or using homeoprophylaxis instead of vaccinations.
