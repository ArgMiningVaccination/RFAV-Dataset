Whether you admit it or not, the enforced slow down and more time spent with yourself, your partner or your family has unearthed some home truths. Lack of routine has led, for many, to comfort eating, spor adic exercise, wine being cracked open most evenings and an increased dependency on digital technology. This will be the year to reset and redress the meaning of \"well -travelled\" in every sense when the world finally reopens to us. The options to reset, re flect and restore are endless and deeply personal. What floats one person's boat (fasting and detoxing to lighten the load?) creates a sinking feeling in others (who might prefer a retreat in Mexico to mend a broken heart). Some seek a retreat on their own , others - when rules allow - want to take the whole brood for a reboot. Though the children haven't left their sight for more than a few school hours during the past year, they have never felt more disconnected from them. Then there are fitness breaks, fr om Spain to the Caribbean, which may spark a new love of exercise; and retreats ensconced in nature that might just change your life altogether. Wellness travel and traditional travel are not separate; they are one and the same. Wellness will slowly return to the stature it held way before the coronavirus crisis - as an opportunity to learn about the world we live in, the people, the practices and the ways of being, returning improved with a renewed sense of purpose, consciousness, community and the realisa tion that we are all part of something bigger. If that isn't travelling well, I don't know what is. IMMUNITY Euphoria Retreat, Greece After a cancer diagnosis, Marina Efraimoglou, the former chairman of a Greek bank, embarked on a personal healing journey that resulted in her retraining in traditional Chinese medicine.
