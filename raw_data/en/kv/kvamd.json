Targeting immunometabolism for the treatment of autoimmune disease by repurposing clinically approved metab olic modulators, such as those used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), is therefore an attractive avenue. Canagliflozin - a member of the newest class of T2D drug, sodium glucose co -transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors - has known off - target effects i ncluding inhibition of mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and complex I. To date, the known effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on human T -cell function are extremely limited. Here, we show that canagliflozin -treated human CD4+ T -cells are compromised in their ability to activate, proliferate and initiate effector functions such as cytokine production. We demonstrate that canagliflozin inhibits the T -cell receptor signalling cascade, impacting on downstream ERK and mTORC1 activity, concomitantly associated with reduced c -Myc. Compromised c -Myc levels were encapsulated by a failure to engage translational machinery resulting in impaired metabolic protein and solute carrier production amongst others. Importantly, canagliflozin treatment of T -cells derived fro m patients with autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis) significantly impaired their effector function. Taken together, our work highlights a potential therapeutic benefit for repurposing canagliflozin as an interventio n for T -cell CD14 marks tissue CD8+T -cells instructed by myeloid cells and modulated by LPS Laura J.

Background and Aims: The liver is bathed in bacterial products, including lipopolysaccharide transported from the intestinal portal vasculature, but is able to maintain a state of tolerance that is then exploited by persistent pathogens and tumours. The cellular basis mediating this tolerance, yet allowing a switch to immunity or immunopathology, needs to be bette r understood for successful immunotherapy of liver diseases. Method: We analysed the phenotype and function of CD14 -expressing CD8 T cells directly ex vivo from resected/explanted human liver and explored their derivation, functionality, expansion and LP S-responsiveness in multiple in vitro and in vivo models. Results: Here we show that a variable proportion of CD8+ T cells compartmentalized in the human liver co -stain for CD14 and other prototypic myeloid membrane proteins and sit in close proximity to CD14high myeloid cells in the liver. CD14+CD8+ T cells exhibit increased turnover, activation and constitutive immunomodulatory features with high homeostatic IL -10 and IL -2 production ex vivo, and enhanced antiviral/anti -tumour effector function after TCR engagement. Whereas stimulation via CD14 by bacterial lipopolysaccharide not only increases the frequency of CD14+CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo but skews their function towards the production of chemotactic and regenerative cytokines. This CD14+CD8+ T cell profile seen ex vivo in tissues, can be recapitulated by the acquisition of membrane proteins \u2014including the lipopolysaccharide receptor complex \u2014from mononuclear phagocytes, resulting in augmented tumour killing by TCR -redirected T cells in vitro. Conclusion: A proportion of CD8 T cells compartmentalised in the liver express CD14/TLR4/MD2, recapitulated in vitro by membrane acquisition from mononuclear phagocytes. Thus, bacterial products in the gut -liver axis and tissue stromal factors can fine tune liver immunity by driving myeloid instruction of CD8+ T cells with immunomodulatory ability. The senescent secretome promotes expression of the fetal receptor PLVAP in human hepatic endothelium to promote Paul UK, 2University of Minia, Egypt, 3University of Cambridge, UK Chronic inflammatory liver disease (CLD) is a global challenge leading to organ failure or cancer development. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) which line the sinusoidal channels of the liver, regulate immune cell recruitment. LSEC undergo signifi cant phenotypic changes in CLD and yet the factors that drive this process and the impact on their function as a vascular barrier and gatekeeper for immune cell recruitment are poorly understood. Recent single cell studies have identified the fetal recept or, Plasmalemma vesicle -associated protein (PLVAP), as a marker of disease -associated LSEC. This led us to study the expression of PLVAP in CLD and its functional role in primary human LSEC. We found increased PLVAP in scar associated LSEC, correlating with markers of tissue senescence in CLD. Furthermore, exposure of human LSEC to the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in vitro led to a significant upregulation of PLVAP. Using flow based adhesion assays we studied the contribution of PLVAP in SASP -driven leukocyte recruitment across LSEC. We found that leukocyte subset recruitment in this setting was characterised by paracellular transmigration of monocytes whilst the majority of lymphocytes migrated transcellularly through LSEC. Knockdow n studies and antibody blockade confirmed that PLVAP selectively regulated monocyte transmigration. Bulk RNA sequencing and confocal imaging demonstrated LSEC Phosho -VE- cadherin expression and endoth elial gap formation. Our studies suggest that tissue senescence promotes re -emergence of the fetal receptor PLVAP in LSEC to promote monocyte recruitment. PLVAP may therefore be a potential endothelial target to treat CLD and its complications. IL-23 drives uveitis by acting on a novel population of resident ocular T cells David A Copland1,3,5, Robert Hedley2,5, Amy Ward1,5, Colin J Chu1,3,5, Jonathan Sherlock2,4,5, Andrew D Dick1,3,5 1Translational Health Sciences, Ophthalmology, University of Bristol, UK, 2Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford, UK, 3Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, UK, 4Janssen, USA, 5ORBIT Consortium ORBIT \u2014 The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Purpose: Acute anterior uveitis is a frequent ocular co -morbidity strongly associated with the Spondyloarthropathies (SpA), a group of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting the joints, skin, and gut of patients. Pathology at these different anatomical sites is driven by local resident popu lations of interleukin (IL) -23 responsive lymphoid cells. We therefore sought evidence for a resident population of IL -23 responsive cells within the reporter ce were used to determine tissue localization and phenotype of resident CD3+ populations in normal mouse anterior uvea. Perfused eyes were optically cleared for whole tissue Ce3D Lightsheet imaging. Flow cytometry (FACS) and ImageStream\u00aeX MK II analysis was performed to immunophenotype cells. To evaluate IL -23 responsiveness, C57BL/6J or (AAV) encoding an IL -23 hyperkine. Clinical assessment (Fundus & OCT) was performed to determine onset of clinical inflammation. Dissected anterior and posterior uvea were processed for FACS enumeration of CD45+ infiltrate. Results: Ex vivo tissue imaging of na\u00efve eyes reveals CD3+IL -23R+ cells are located across multiple tissues of t he anterior uvea, including the sclera, iris, and ciliary body. FACS identifies vivo, IL inflammation in anterior and posterior s egments of the eye by day 12. FACS confirms a significant increase in CD45+CD3+ cell number in anterior and posterior compared to eyes receiving control ShH10 vector. Ex vivo stimulation of anterior uvea shows increased IL -17A production by CD3+TCR+ fr following IL -23 overexpression. ShH10 -mediated IL -23 expression does not elicit clinical inflammation or infiltration of CD45+ cells in Rag2 deficient mice. Conclusions: A novel population of ocular T cells defined by CD3+CD4 -CD8-TCR+IL -23R+ expression resides within the anterior uvea of the mouse eye. Localised ocular cytokine expression demonstrates that resident IL -23R+ IL -17A producing cells are both necessary and sufficient to drive uveitis in response to IL -23. Further characterization of this population is warranted. TIM3 is a context -dependent co -regulator Morgan1, Christoph W\u00fclfing1. 1School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK, 2Department of Life Sciences, University of Bath, UK Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential effectors in the anti -viral and anti -tumour immune response and attractive targets in cancer immu notherapy. Although CTLs can directly recognise and kill tumour cells, tumour cells suppress CTLs by different mechanisms. This project investigated the upregulation of the inhibitory receptor T -cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM3). TIM3 is expres sed on T cells after chronic antigen exposure and marks the most exhausted tumour infiltrating CTLs in multiple solid tumours. However, it is unclear whether TIM3 directly regulates CTL function. Also, despite a predominantly inhibitory role in vivo, TIM3 promotes cellular activation in T cells, and roles of putative ligands in TIM3 function are controversial. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of TIM3 on direct CTL anti -tumour functions and how TIM3 Galectin9 empl (3D) tumour spheroids that effectively suppression similar to the in vivo tumour microenvironment in comparison to conventional two -dimensional (2D) tumour cell culture. In the 3D model, TIM3 significantly inhibited CTL cy totoxicity and cytoskeletal polarisation as a key mechanism of effective cytolysis in murine and human CTLs. Acute blockade of TIM3 by monoclonal antibodies reversed this inhibition. In contrast, in the 2D model, TIM3 stimulated CTL effector functions. Expression of Galectin9 on tumour cells further suppressed CTL killing ability in the 3D spheroid model. In the 2D, however, Galectin9 enhanced TIM3 costimulatory functions. In summary, our data suggest that TIM3 functions as a context -dependent coregulatory receptor as supported by the expression of its ligand Galectin9. Investigating the impact of radiation on the immunopeptidome of colorectal cancer cell lines University, UK, 2Monash University, Australia There is renewed focus in the potential of radiotherapy to stimulate T cell recognition of tumour cells, through mechanisms that include the upregulation of HLA -I on the tumour cells. The complex array of peptides displayed by HLA molecules are termed the immunopeptidome and its studying is a powerful tool for identifying actionable cancer antigens and their T cell epitopes. It is crucial to understand how radiotherapy modifies the immunopeptidome to develop targeted approaches to cancer. Thus, the aim of this research was to profile the immunopeptidome pre - and post -radiotherapy of colorectal tumours. Irradiation of a malignant colorectal cell line, SW480, provided a proof -of-principal that radiation increases HLA -I expression. Subsequently, we investigate d whether the immunopeptidome of these cells was altered by irradiation by investigating eluted peptides from purified HLA -I molecules from irradiated and non -irradiated cells and identifying them by tandem mass spectrometry. Irradiated cells demonstrated a significant increase in the total number of unique peptides presented at the tumour cell surface, with a unique radiation -induced peptide repertoire emerging, exhibiting peptides with C and/or N terminal extensions. Additionally, the peptides isolated f rom the irradiated cells were sourced from more diverse antigens with more distinct peptides representing each source protein. This was also evident for tumour -associated antigens (TAAs) with enhanced presentation of peptides from proteins associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. This research establishes that irradiation impacts the immunopeptidome and alters what is available for scrutiny by T cells. Increased presentation of TAAs may heighten tumour immunogenicity and facilitate tumour eradic ation. Poster abstracts P.01 CAR -TREG cell therapies and their future potential in treating ocular autoimmune conditions. Alan Abraham1, Panayiotis Maghsoudlou1,2, David Copland1, Lindsay Group, Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK, 2University of Bath, UK, 3UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, UK Ophthalmic autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions cause significant vis ual morbidity and require complex medical treatment complicated by significant side effects and lack of specificity. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have key roles in immune homeostasis and in the resolution of immune responses. Polyclonal Treg therapy has show n efficacy in treating autoimmune disease. Genetic engineering approaches to produce antigen -specific Treg therapy has the potential for enhanced treatment responses and fewer systemic side effects. Cell therapy using chimeric antigen receptor modified T c ell (CAR -T) therapy, has had significant success in treating haematological malignancies. By modifying Tregs specifically, a CAR -Treg approach has been efficacious in preclinical models of autoimmune conditions leading to current phase 1 -2 clinical trials. This educational poster summarises CAR structure and design, Treg cellular biology, developments in CAR -Treg therapies, and discusses future strategies to apply CAR -Treg therapy in the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. P.02 The longitudinal loss of isl et autoantibody responses from diagnosis of type 1 diabetes occurs progressively over follow -up and is determined by low autoantibody titres, early -onset, and genetic variants. G.L.M. R.J. Aitken, I.V. Wilson, G. George, K.M. Gillespie, A.J.K. Williams, The BOX Study Group, A. E. Long. Diabetes and Metabolism, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, UK The clinical usefulness of post -diagnosis islet autoantibody levels is unclear and factors that drive autoantibody persistence are poorly defined in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our aim was to characterise longitudinal loss of islet autoantibody responses after diagnosis in a large, prospectively sampled UK cohort. Participants with T1D [n=577] providing a diagnosis sample [range -1.0-2.0 years] and at least one post - diagnosis sample (<32.0 years) were tested for autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GADA), islet antigen -2 (IA -2A), and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A). Select HLA and non -HLA SNPs were considered. Non -geneti c and genetic factors were assessed by multivariable logistic regression models for autoantibody positivity at initial sampling and autoantibody loss at final sampling. For GADA, IA -2A, and ZnT8A, 70.8%, 76.8% and 40.1%, respectively, remained positive a t final sampling. Non -genetic predictors of autoantibody loss were low baseline autoantibody titres (p<0.0001), longer diabetes duration (p<0.0001), and age -at-onset years (p<0.01 -0.05). Adjusting for non -genetic covariates, GADA loss was associate d with low -risk HLA class II genotypes (p=0.005), and SNPs associated IFIH1/2q24 (p=0.018). IA -2A loss was not associated with genetic factors independent of other covariates, while ZnT8A loss was associated with the presence of HLA A*24 (p=0.019) and weakly negatively with RELA/11q13 (p=0.049). The largest longitudinal study of islet autoantibody responses from diagnosis of T1D shows that autoantibody loss is heterogeneous and influenced by low titres at onset, longer duration, earlier age - at-onset, and genetic variants. These data may inform clinical trials where post -diagnosis participants are recruited. P.03 Feeding and autoimmunity in children with Down Syndrome evaluation study (FADES): Evidence of early autoimmunity to insulin. Georgina Mortimer1, Georgina Williams2, Sam Leary2, Stu Toms2, Julian Hamilton -Shield2, Kathleen Gillespie1 1Diabetes, Bristol Medical School, Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK, 2Biomedical Research Centre, Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, UK Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased ris k of autoimmune conditions including diabetes, coeliac, and thyroid disease. FADES was developed to study the association between early feeding, infections, antibiotic use, gut microbiome, and autoimmunity in children with DS. In-depth feeding and medical questionnaires, stool, urine, and capillary blood samples were collected at birth, 6 months, and annually until the study end and/or 7 years of age. DNA was tested for T1D HLA class II susceptibility haplotypes. Serum was tested for autoantibodies associat ed thyroid autoimmunity using radioimmunoassay and luciferase immunoprecipitation systems. Since 2014, 116 infants (Male n=56) were recruited at mean age 16.8 weeks (S.D. 9.8 weeks). Initial questionnaires were completed by 89% of the participants with samples obtained from 72%. Thus far, autoantibodies associated with type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and thyroid disorders were identified in 10/71 (14.0%) in the last available sample including 6/71 (8.5%) positive for insulin autoa ntibodies (IAA), the youngest seroconverting at 0.5 years and the eldest at 5 years. Genetic samples were available from 5/7 with IAA, none had T1D HLA class II susceptibility haplotypes; two individuals were heterozygous for the protective DRB01*15 -DQB01* 0602. FADES has created a bank of samples and information to be analysed to explore the effects of early life influences on autoimmunity. Initial results support an increased frequency of islet autoimmunity in children with DS. This cohort should prove a valuable resource for future research into autoimmunity in DS. P.04 Impaired immune response to dengue viral infection in children and young adults with obesity Michaela Gregorova1, Nguyet Minh Nguyen2, 1University Bristol, UK, 2Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Vietnam, 3Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Vietnam, 4Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Oxford University, UK Background: Obesity, an increasing global health problem, has been associated with development of severe. But the exact role of immune cells and mechanism underlying obesity as a risk fa ctor is still not fully understood. Our study investigates the phenotype/functionality of T -cells and their association with body mass index and dengue outcomes. Methods: Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to evaluate the phenotypic/functional charact eristics of T -cells in a Vietnamese cohort of acute non -severe and severe dengue patients (day 3 and 8 illness onset). Magnitude, phenotype and multifunctionality of DENV intracellular cytokine staining. Results: Obesity associated with more dysfunctional and impaired phenotype of CD8+ T, mainly their cytotoxic ability, suggesting altered immune responses with potentially impaired capacity to clear dengue virus. Moreover, these altered cellular phenotypes were more marked in severe disease and strongly correlated with increasing BMI and serum leptin levels. In both patient groups (obesity and normal weight), DENV -specific CD8+ T -cells expressed high levels of MIP -1 and CD107a, with variable levels of IFN -, IL -2 cytokines. DENV -specific CD8+ T -cell responses were higher at day 3 in severe dengue patients and patients with obesity compared to non -severe and normal weight patients but were significantly lower at day 8. Conclusions: We identified alterations in immun e responses to dengue virus in patients with obesity compared to patients with normal weight, which were more marked in severe disease and secondary infection. Moreover, our data suggest potential impairment in the anti -viral capacity of T -cells in patient s with obesity, particularly during severe and secondary dengue infection. P.05 Modulation of pro -inflammatory and pro phenotype novel mitochondria Leonova 1, UK, Bath, UK Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and incurable disease requiring novel therapeutics. High baseline monocyte count assoc iates with increased risk of progression and mortality in IPF. Perturbations in monocyte phenotype and mitochondrial function, IL6 production, ACOD1 gene expression and metabolism have been observed in IPF patients. IPF patients also have reduced biosynthe tic capacity for the immunomodulatory gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) - an endogenous regulator of mitochondrial function and inflammation. However, the impact of H2S modulation in monocytes is unknown. Aims: Investigate the and anti -inflammatory effects of -targeted (mtH2SD) in human monocytes. Methods: Fresh monocytes were isolated IFN /TNF/IL-4 (20ng/ml) +/ - metabolic assays, ELISA, In vitro mtH2SD treatment of stimulated monocytes resulted in reduced pro -fibrotic marker levels (CD206 and CD163; p<0.05), more energetic and glycolytic metabolism, augmentation of anti - fibro tic ACOD1 expression, decreased IL -6 production and gene expression (p<0.01). Conclusions: Modulation of phenotype and metabolism, pro -fibrotic and pro -inflammatory gene expression by mtH2SD may have therapeutic potential for IPF. Future work will recapit ulate these data in IPF -derived monocytes. P.06 Suppression of the function of human anti -tumour T cells with a defined T cell receptor by human tumour Cytotoxic T cells commonly recognise tumour antigens and have the ability to kill tumour target cells. However, such killing is often suppressed within the tumour microenvironment. T cells eventually lose their ab ility to proliferate and release effector cytokines and cytotoxic granules that are essential for effective elimination of tumour cells. As one mechanism of such suppression, T cells increase expression of inhibitory receptors, including T -cell immunoglobu lin mucin -3 (TIM -3). Overcoming T cell suppression is a fundamental strategy in cancer immunotherapy. Robust in vitro cell -based assays are required to optimise therapeutic approaches to do so. Here we utilize 3D tumour cell spheroids and the lentiviral expression of the IG4 T cell receptor recognising a peptide derived from the NYESO melanoma tumour antigen in primary human T cells for the development an assay focussing on CTL function. As key features of our assay, killing of tumour target cells was pepti de-dependent, IG4 -expressing T cells acquired a suppressed phenotype through incubation with the spheroids and such suppression was further enhanced by TIM3 expression. P.07 Immature Neutrophils: Showing Borko Amulic, Ashley Toye , Christopher Rice, Kieran Roberts University of Bristol, UK Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the circulation, being the first responders to a site of infection. Their antimicrobial arsenal includes phagocytosis, degranulation of antimicrobial peptides, production of reactive oxygen species, ne utrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and cytokine release. Whilst this antimicrobial arsenal makes neutrophils essential for clearing pathogens, inappropriate or over activation may also cause damage to the host. Numerous inflammatory diseases inclu ding malaria and severe COVID -19 are associated with the appearance of immature neutrophils in circulation. These immature neutrophils are an indicator of poor clinical prognosis; however, little is known in terms of their function and mechanism in severe inflammatory disease. We hypothesise that immature neutrophils have altered functional properties that distinguish them from mature neutrophils. To address this we used two experimental systems: GCSF -treated healthy donors with circulating pools of primary immature neutrophils, and in vitro differentiation of human CD34+ stem cell derived cultured neutrophils. For both systems, we tested antimicrobial functions including NETosis, degranulation, cytokine production and mitochondrial content. It was clear tha t in both systems immature neutrophils differed from mature healthy neutrophils, but further investigation is needed to elucidate how this may be relevant for pathogenesis of inflammatory disease. P.08 Mesenchymal stem cells as a therapeutic agent for SAR S-CoV-2 infection Erly Savitri , Karen Still, Darryl Hill, Andrew Davidson, Wael Kafienah School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK Background and Purpose: The highly contagious SARS -CoV-2 gives a variety of symptoms, ranging fro m asymptomatic cases to severe and long -term debilitating symptoms. Dysregulated immune response is strongly associated with disease severity, lung tissue damage, and long -term functional disability. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, sel f-renewing cells that have an immunomodulatory, anti -inflammatory, and regenerative properties. We hypothesized that MSCs can dampen lung inflammation and repair lung tissue damage caused by the virus. The aim of study was to investigate the immunomodulato ry and regenerative properties of MSCs on SARS -CoV-2 infection of lung cells. Materials and Methods: The human adenocarcinoma lung epithelial cell line, Calu -3, was used to model lung tissue air -liquid interface (ALI) in vitro. The model was infected wit h SARS -CoV-2 and co -cultured with MSCs (n=4) for 1 and 4 days. The impact of MSCs on Calu -3 was evaluated by measuring gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and immunostaining of epithelial integrity markers. Results: MSCs significantly the inflammatory markers IL4, IL6, IL8, IL13, and TNF and increased the expression of epithelial integrity marker, CDH1, 1 and 4 days after infection. The disruption of lung epithelial tight junction was repaired by the MSCs at both time points, while human d ermal fibroblast (HDF), as MSC control cells, did not impact the infected cells. Conclusion: MSCs can reverse the damage to lung epithelial cells caused by SARS -CoV-2 infection by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines and improving the integrity of epitheli al cells. These findings support the potential for using MSCs or their by -products in cell therapy modalities for long COVID patients.

Previous studies have suggested a role for immune cell subtypes in colorectal cancer, with eosinophils having a protective effect and neutrophils having a detrimental effect. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of circula ting immune cell counts (ICCs) on CRC risk using Mendelian randomization (MR). Genome -wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics ICCs were accessed from a comprehensive meta -analysis (N=562,132 Europeans), and for CRC overall and by site (colon, proximal colon, distal colon and rectal) through a large meta -analysis (58,221 cases and 67,694 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry). We perf ormed univariable (UV) and multivariable (MV) MR analyses to assess the effect of ICCs on CRC risk. The inverse -variance weighted UVMR analysis showed evidence of an effect on CRC risk P=0.02). (MR -PRESSO, Cochran's Q test, MR -Egger). The MVMR method provided e vidence of an overall CRC risk. Our study provides evidence that circulating immune cells play a role in CRC aetiology, laying the path for targeted mechanistic studies. P.10 Assessing changes in the ocular micro -environment during inflammatory arthritis to understand co-existing arthritis and uveitis S. Eastham , A. L.B. Nicolson, G.W. Jones University Bristol, UK An association exists between sight -threatening uveitis and inflammatory arthritis. Approximately 11 - 30% of children with juvenile idiopathic arth ritis and up to 50% of patients with spondyloarthropathies develop uveitis. However these coexisting conditions are often studied separately, here we determined how the ocular microenvironment is impacted in arthritis using experimental arthritis models an d tracking ocular immune changes. Antigen -induced arthritis (AIA) and experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) were established in wild type and IL -27R-deficient (Il27ra -/-) mice. Clinical disease was assessed by histopathology, flow cytometry and optical coh erence tomography (OCT) imaging. Following induction of arthritis, ocular OCT analysis suggested sub -clinical changes in leukocyte infiltration. Consistent with this, at time points reflecting the peak of joint swelling and synovial CD4+ T - cell infiltrati on in AIA, a concurrent increase in ocular -infiltrating was observed. As flares of arthritis and uveitis often coincide in patients, we tested whether recurrent flares of AIA led to clinical uveitis. Here, the ocular infiltrate mirrored the pattern of flare -remission seen in the synovium, but multiple flares did not exacerbate the ocular immune response. AIA in Il27ra -/- mice resulted in exacerbated arthritis and an increase in ocular infiltr ating leukocytes, particularly CD11b+ and Ly6G+ populations. Parallel investigations of EAU in Il27ra -/- mice revealed an earlier disease onset and an increase in ocular infiltrating leukocytes. In summary induction of arthritis promotes an ocular leukocyte infiltrate reminiscent of sub -clinical changes preceding uveitis. IL -27 limits ocular leukocyte infiltration during arthritis and uveitis highlighting its regulatory action and therapeutic potential. P.11 Can the cross -reactivity of therapeutic TCRs be determined in silico? Annabelle Hartt1, Harper2, Marc W. van der Kamp1 1School of Biochemistry, University of Bristol, UK, 2Immunocore ltd., UK During cell -mediated adaptive immunity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins present short peptides made from degraded intracellular proteins on the cell surface. T -cell receptors (TCRs) can bind to non -self peptide -HLA (pHLA) molecules, leading to T -cell signalling events that induce the death of the antigen presenting cell. TCR affinity and speci ficity need optimising for therapeutic applications, as natural TCRs have low affinity and high cross -reactivity (i.e. bind to peptides that are not the intended target). A consequence of engineering high -affinity TCRs is often a reduction in specificity, which can cause off - target toxicity in patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that TCR cross -reactivity can be due to factors such as energetic hotspots, conformational flexibility, and rigid binding mechanisms. Here we show how biomolecular simulati ons can be used in combination with experimental work to investigate these factors in a series of affinity -enhanced TCRs to understand and predict cross -reactivity. We determine that the cross -reactive and specific TCRs show differences in energetic inter actions with the HLA as well as in CDR loop flexibility. Simulation of the TCR -pHLAs with known off -target peptides indicates that cross -reactivity may be predicted during high -affinity TCR design. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into the a pplications of biomolecular simulation in therapeutic TCR development and improves understanding of TCR specificity. P.12 Hemozoin, a by -product of of Bristol, UK Malaria is an inflammatory disease with a global incidence of around 220 million cases per year. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative organism of the most severe type of malaria, is a eukaryotic parasite endemic in sub -Saharan Afri ca. It invades and replicates in erythrocytes, often leading to life - threatening symptoms. Additionally, malaria patients have increased susceptibility to invasive bacterial infections such as Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus, although the reason is no t fully understood. Neutrophils suppress bacterial pathogens through produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, neutrophils from malaria patients are often observ ed to have phagocytosed hemozoin (HZ), an inert crystal by -product from hemoglobin digestion by Plasmodium. We assessed the impact of synthetic HZ (sHz) on the oxidative burst of human neutrophils in response to bacteria. We found that neutrophils treated with sHz had reduced ROS production in response to Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. This was confirmed by microarray data, which demonstrated that HZ downregulates p47phox, one of the NOX2 components. In conclusion, HZ has a suppressive effect on neutrophil antimicrobial function and might explain the increased rate of bacteraemia seen in malaria patients. P.13 Analysis of NK -cell function during dengue viral infection Yacoub2,4, Laura Rivino1 1School of Cellular and M olecular Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bristol, UK, 2Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Vietnam, 3Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Vietnam, 4Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Oxford University, UK Background/Aim: Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus causing the most prevalent mosquito -borne viral disease afflicting humans. During uncomplicated dengue, Natural Killer (NK) -cells are robustly activated and proliferating (Zimmer at al 2019, Nature commun ication). However, in severe dengue NK -cells display decreased expression of markers of activation and cytotoxicity (Vuong et al 2022 J Infect Dis). Here, we evaluate NK -cell expression of activating and inhibitory receptors and their anti -viral function in association with disease severity. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from patients with confirmed dengue and <72 hours of fever at the Hospital of Tropical Diseases, Vietnam. Ex vivo isolated PBMCs were thawed and stained with fluorescently -labelled antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess NK -cell phenotype. NK -cell function was analyzed after overnight resting or stimulation of PBMCs with IL -12/IL -18 and subsequent co -culture with target -cells. Cytokine/ch emokine degranulation (CD107a) were measured by flow -cytometry. Results/Conclusion: Our preliminary data from the analysis of N=19 samples show decreased expression of activation markers including NKG2D in NK -cells fro m severe compared to non -severe patients. However, decreased ex vivo NK -cell activation was not accompanied by impaired degranulation potential and decreased production of effector cytokines of NK -cells. Indeed severe patients have an increased percentages of functional IFN -g and CD107a producing NK -cells compared dengue. This data suggest that NK -cells may not be intrinsically impaired in severe dengue. P.14 Impact of cryopreservation on immune cell metabolism as measured by SCENITH Curtis L uscombe , Eben Jones, Laura Rivino University of Bristol, UK Immunometabolism is a rapidly expanding field, offering novel insights into the mechanisms through which cellular metabolic processes tightly regulate immune cell function and activity. Clinical samples are commonly cryopreserved to facilitate biobanking and high -throughput batch analysis, but this process is thought to influence cellular bioenergetics (e.g. as measured through Seahorse XFe96 bulk analysis). Recently described by Arg\u00fcello et al an d gaining significant attention in the field, SCENITH is a novel single -cell method for ex vivo functional metabolic profiling of immune cells. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of cryopreservation on immune cell metabolism as measured by SCENITH. We present a number of central findings. Firstly, T cells undergoing activation with a CD3/CD28 stimulus are less readily metabolically/translationally reprogrammed following cryopreservation. Secondly, we find that the process cryopreservation introdu phosphorylation, a degree of mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite this artefact, we demonstrate that SCENITH is still clearly able to differentiate between metaboli cally distinct cell populations following cryopreservation (e.g. by comparing the metabolic profiles of CD69 positive and negative T cells, or classical and non -classical monocytes). In summary, this poster will present several novel findings that will pr ove to be of interest to those studying immunometabolism in relation to a broad range of disease categories (including infection, auto -immunity and cancer), highlighting considerations and troubleshooting tips for those wishing to employ SCENITH in their r esearch. P.15 Autoimmune Disease and Cancer Crosstalk: A Shared Neo -Antigen inhibits the anti -tumour immune response Maryam Alismail , David Morgan, Christoph Wuelfing School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK The autoimmune disease is associated with an increased susceptibility to cancer. A continuous immune response against self -antigens, coupled with potential mechanisms of immune suppression, could hinder the immune system's ability to detect and combat earl y-stage tumors. Our objective was to elucidate mechanisms of crosstalk between autoimmune disease and cancer using a mouse model featuring a shared neo -antigen, the influenza haemagglutinin, between pancreatic tissue and a specific tumour cell line. A cruc ial aspect of persistent immune responses is the upregulation of inhibitory receptors. Further linking autoimmune and anti -cancer immune responses, blocking inhibitory receptors in cancer immunotherapy commonly results in significant adverse autoimmune eff ects. Therefore, in our investigation of the relationship between autoimmune disease and cancer, we also blocked the inhibitory receptor PD -1. In our mouse model, the presence of the shared antigen enhanced tumour growth and suppressed T -cell infiltration in tumors. Furthermore, it impaired the upregulation of co - stimulatory receptors on CD4 cells. Within the short 16 -day timeframe of tumor growth, we did not observe any discernible effect of anti -PD1 treatment. P.16 The impact of L -arginine deprivation on CMV and SARS -CoV-2-specific T Wooldridge1 1University of Bristol, UK, 2University of Cardiff, UK Background Critical illness is associated with striking abnormalities of innate and adaptive immunity. The increased incidence of secondary infections due to weakly virulent organisms, e.g. herpesvirus reactivation, strongly suggests T -cell suppression. Existing literature suggests that the amino acid L -arginine is essential for T -cell proliferation, and critical illness is a low arginine state, but these experiments have not examined antigen -specific responses. Here we examine whether altering arginine availability affects in vitro human CMV and SARS -CoV-2-specific memory T -cell respon ses. Methods Cellular proliferation was measured in a dye -dilution proliferation assay using CellTrace Violet (CTV) (Thermofisher). CTV -loaded peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors with previous CMV or SARS -CoV-2 infection were c ultured in media containing different L -arginine levels -CoV-2) was compared to non -specific stimulatio n (phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) anti -CD3/CD28 beads). Results CD4 and CD8 T -cells cultured in the absence of arginine are smaller and do not proliferate when activated non -specifically (PHA or anti -CD3/CD28 beads). When T -cells are stimulated via the T -cell receptor using NLV peptide or Spike peptides pools, proliferation was reduced in the absence of arginine, but not abolished. Discussion In contrast to non -specific stimulation, T -cells stimulated via the T -cell receptor can proliferate in the absence o f arginine, albeit at reduced capacity, suggesting they can withstand low arginine states. Further work is needed to determine whether this is a memory T -cell phenomenon or due to differing mechanisms of T -cell activation, and whether effector function is affected. "}
