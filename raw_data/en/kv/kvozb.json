The Five Year Consolidated Plan Fiscal Year 20 11 - 2015 includes specific objectives and priorities regarding how the District seeks to provide activities during the five -year period that promote equal opportunity to a suitable living environment, decent housing and economic development. These objectives and priorities, designed to assist persons of low - and moderate -income, are carried out on a yearly basis through five Annual Action Plans, and they inc lude: 1. Preserve and increase the supply of quality affordable housing; 2. Increase homeownership opportunities; and 3. Revitalizing neighborhoods, promoting community development, and providing economic opportunities. The Annual Action Plan is designed to guide housing, community development, homeless, and special population activities within the District of Columbia through fiscal year 2014 (October 1, 2013 - September 30, 2014) . The Action Plan is a collaborative process whereby the community establishes a un ified vision for housing and community development during FY2014. Citizens, public agencies, and other interested parties, including those most affected, are provided opportunities to participate in every aspect of the consolidated planning process, e.g. i dentifying needs, setting priorities, recommending programs, developing proposals, and reviewing program accomplishments. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is the District's agency responsible for preparing the Consolidated Annual Action Plan . The FY201 4 Action Plan is not only an application to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for federal fiscal year 2013 funding; it is also a statement of the strategic activities that DHCD, as the District's designated p rogram administrator, intends to undertake during FY2014 to implement the strategic goals set forth in the Five Year Consolidated Plan. The District will receive direct federal funding of over $32 million from HUD which is spread over the following four HU D program areas: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership s (HOME ), Housing Opportunities for Persons with A IDS (HOPWA), and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG ). Fiscal Year 2014 Federal Entitlement Grant Allocations Community Deve lopment Block Grant (CDBG) Allocation $13,252,300 HOME Investment Partnership s (HOME) Allocation $ 4,123,000 Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) Allocation $ 1,414,021 Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Allocation $13,623,582 Total: $32,412,903 The greatest single source of federal funding for DHCD in FY2014 is the Community Development Block Grant . In FY14 CDBG funding will account for $25,236,986, which includes the annual aw ard allocation, anticipated program income from existing projects funded with past CDBG dollars and FY13 fund balance carried over. Several projects will be funded through the use of HOME funds and anticipated program income, in the amount of $14,011,000 . District of Columbia Government Chapter One: General Information Page 6 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Certain homelessness prevention activities and shelter programs will be funded through the Emergency Solutions Grant ( ESG ) of $1,414,021 . This grant is administered through the D.C. Department of Human Services . Lastly, the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program has an allocation of $13,623,582, which is administered for the Washington DC Metropolitan Statistical Area by the DC Department of Health, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Administration (HAHST A). The Department's fun ding will be used to accomplish numerous housing and community development activities, including , but not limited to , providing housing counseling to approximately 16,000 residents, assisting 300 residents in becoming homeowners, providing 35 businesses wi th storefront fa\u00e7ade improvements, and preserving or creating more than 720 units of affordable housing for low -to-moderate income residents. Evaluation of Past Performance During the past five years, DHCD subsidized thousands of units of affordable hou sing, homebuyer education and outreach, expanded homeownership opportunities to the District's increasing ly diverse population while also contributing to economic and community revitalization in underserved areas of the District . Through the Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP) DHCD was able to provide first time home buyers with financial education along with down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of low interest deferred loans . DHCD also provided financial and technical assistance to ren ters looking to buy their multi - family apartment buildings under the District Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA). Additionally, the Department helped low - to moderate -income residents perform renovations to get homes up to District code, implement accessibility features, or remediate lead paint hazards through the Single Family Residential Rehabilitation Program (SFFRP). The Department increased the supply of affordable housing by providing funds for both single - and multi - family construction proj ects throughout the city. These funds came in the form of pre -development loans and financing for both new construction and renovations to existing structures. DHCD also provided funding for Community Based Organizations (CBOs) who provide housing counseli ng to tenants, home buyers and new homeowners to increase access to affordable housing. Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) funds provided emergency assistance to prevent households from becoming homeless and to provide shelter for families. DHCD's affordab le housing construction projects have spurred neighborhood revitalization and local economic development. As part of its neighborhood investments, DHCD funded technical assistance for small neighborhood businesses to assist in their retention and expansion. DHCD also provided funding for fa\u00e7ade improvement projects for small businesses. The Department has also enhanced the quality of its affordable housing construction projects by providing an annual training to all construction grantees -- developers, gen eral contractors and architects\u2014on local and federal accessibility compliance regulations applicable to new construction and substantially rehabilitated projects were in. This action ensures that a more diverse housing throughout the city is available to p ersons who wish to age in place and families and individuals using a wheelchair are part of the community. Geographic Priority Areas Through our city -wide citizen participation process, DHCD identified several areas for targeted investment. (Appendix D) These areas will remain a priority for DHCD through 201 4.1 The rationale for prioritizing 1 For the purposes of describing its inve stments and activities, DHCD cannot identify the exact location of activities to be undertaken, District of Columbia Government Chapter One: General Information FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 7 investment in these areas is that these areas meet the characteristics of the priority areas outlined in the District's FY 2011- 2015 Consolidated Plan. The targetin g of investment to these areas is anticipated to result in an increase in affordable housing opportunities for households that have experienced the pressure of rising housing costs. It also will leverage private investment to ensure that neighborhood- serving commercial opportunities and community facilities/services are created and maintained. DHCD will also support the local \"New Communities\" and \"Great Streets\" program s which aim to revitalize targeted parts of the city to create vibrant neighborhoods and commercial corridors. The Department will continue to leverage its funds with financial vehicles such as the New Markets Tax Credit Program and a range of financial instruments and/or arrangements that help to increase affordable housing, home -ownership opportunities, jobs and economic opportunity, retention and attraction of neighborhood businesses, neighborhood revitalization, community and commercial facilities and improvements to the living environments of our residents. Basis for Allocation of Fund ing As in the past, DHCD will continue to allocate its funding to address the demographic changes and needs identified in the Census, the Mayor's development priorities, The 2011Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice, and through DHCD's Needs Ass essment Hearings, which are used to allow the community input on both how DHCD is performing as well as what needs to be done going forward. A llocation of resources is prioritized among specific target areas based on a four -tier system: 1) Tier One focuses o n projects that are currently in the pipeline and that tie into a regional vision of sustainability. These resources are meant to supplement DHCD's mission of creating complete neighborhoods and a more sustainable city. These resources will be focused pr imarily in Wards 5, 7, and 8, where development momentum has been or is being established, but where further investment is needed. The resources will extend throughout Ward 5 where focus will be on finishing development and continuing preservation, specif ically in the Trinidad/Ivy City. In Wards 7 and 8, the resources will be distributed throughout specific corridors adjacent to Prince George's County, MD, where unemployment is high and resources are needed, specifically the Benning Road, Deanwood, Minnesota Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue and Historic Anacostia corridors. 2) Tier Two focuses on projects that are of high priority and develop coordination with other District agencies. These resources will be meant to provide finishing assistance to developing areas, continuing preservation and promoting economic viability through a more integrated approach. This tier will include working with DMPED to finish the development of the Georgia Avenue corridor and specific area locations where development has been es tablished, including Park Morton and the Bruce School. This tier will also prioritize resources in the Walter Reed development corridor and work with the Office of Planning (OP) in developing the St. Elizabeth's corridor. 3) Tier Three focuses on areas of the city that are in general poverty and in need of development and revitalization. These tier resources will provide assistance to areas of the city that are not consistent with specific developing corridors, but will improve the livability of areas with underserved need. 4) Tier Four focuses on the entire city, to achieve economic integration of subsidized housing by providing mixed -income housing, or by locating affordable housing in neighborhoods that are not poverty impacted, or that are undergoing r apid gentrification. Mixed income housing would focus investment but specifies the target area (in compliance with HUD guidelines); DHCD will not have made its development awards for FY2014 funding prior to the first quarter of the fiscal year. District of Columbia Government Chapter One: General Information Page 8 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan strategies and affordable housing programs to distribute mixed income housing more equitably across the entire city, taking steps to avoid further concentration of poverty within areas of the city that already have substantial affordable housing. These target areas include several neighborhoods where small area plans were conducted by the Office of Planning in cooperation with sister agencies to supplement the broad policy statement and public actions of the District's Comprehensive Plan. These plans are developed through a comprehensive process with the neighborhood residents and District agencies to provide detailed direction for the development of city blocks, corridors and neighborhoods with the goal of achieving complete neighborhoods. These small area plans help guide DHCD investment priorities through the four (4) tier system, with each tier having a greater priority. Sources of Funds The Department relies on both federal and loca l sources to finance service delivery . These sources include federal funding from HUD in the form of CDBG, HOME, ESG, and HOPWA grants, program income from past projects funded with CDBG and HOME dollars, and local resources comp rised of appropriated Dist rict funds and certain loan repayments. DHCD makes direct investments and uses funding to leverage private investments. a. Federal Resources FY2014 is the thirty -ninth year (CD -39) of the CDBG Program. HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development provided preliminary notice to DHCD that its FY2014 formula entitlement grant allocations were approximately $ 32 million. DHCD also anticipates an additional $ 9 million in program income from these entitlements to be available in FY201 4. The net available federal funds from these entitlement grants for FY201 4 are shown in Table 1. Table 1 : FY2014 Federal Funding CDBG HOME ESG HOPWA Other Federal Funding $13,252,300 $4,123,000 $1,414,021 Program Income 0 FY2012 Fund Balance $5,500,000 $7,000,000 0 0 Total federal funds $25,236,786 $14,011,000 $1,414,021 $13,623,582 0 DHCD will serve as the administrator for the CDBG and HOME federal grants. The regional HOPWA alloc ation is administered through and monitored by the D.C. Department of Health, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Administration (HAHSTA) . The Department of Human Services will administer the ESG grant allocation. District of Columbia Government Chapter One: General Informat ion FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 9 DHCD is required to have no more t han 1.5 times our annual CDBG allocation available in our HUD line of credit 60 days prior to the end of the program year, in order to meet the CDBG program's \"timeliness\" requirements. With an annual entitlement of appro ximately $13,252,300 and X , the Dis trict should have less than $X of unused C DBG funds available on July 31st. 2014. In order to meet this requirement, the District will expend approximately $X million in CDBG funds by July 31, 2014.2 The penalties for not meeting this test have become qu ite sever e and HUD views the failure to meet this test as a failure of the grantee's ability to carry out the CDBG program. HUD can require a payback of unspent funds if the timeliness test is not met. b. Program Income For FY 2014 DHCD projects that there will be a total of $ 6.5 million in program income from past projects funded with CDBG dollars and $2.8 million in program income from past projects funded with HOME Investment Partnership dollars. Program income is derived primarily from repayment of loa ns provided to citizens to assist in the purchase of homes within the District. Program income received in excess of the budgeted amount is reprogrammed for use with in the respective program. c. Section 8 The D. C. Housing Authority (DCHA) receives, admini sters, and monitors funds for the Section 8 Program, known as the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP). DCHA estimates that its budget for the HCVP program will be $ 150 million, a 2% increase over the FY2013 budget. The Section 8 funds are used to increas e affordable housing choices for very low -income households by allowing families to choose privately owned rental housing. The funds are not part of the DHCD budget, but may be used by low -income families to obtain affordable housing in projects funded by DHCD. d. Low -Income Housing Tax Credits The Low -Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program was enacted by Congress in 1986 to provide owners of qualifying properties a federal tax incentive with the Internal Revenue Service for providing rental housing at affordable rents for individuals and families of low or moderate income levels. The income limits and rent restrictions for LIHTC properties are released annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Residents of tax credit units are required to be within the income limits and owners of tax credit housing are required to meet the rent restrictions for tax credit units. The Internal Revenue Service charged the administration of the LIHTC program in the District of Columbia to the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD). Final regulations for \"Compliance Monitoring and Miscellaneous Issues Relating to the Low -Income Housing Credit\" were released by the Internal Revenue Service in the Federal Register, Volume 65 - Number 10 on Friday, January 14, 2000 and as further amended. Owners of rental housing receiving an allocation of tax credits from the District of Columbia DHCD after December 31,1989 are required to enter into a Restrictive Covenant with the agency. The Restrictive Covenant adds an additional 15 years to the 15- year tax credit compliance period. As mandated by the Internal Revenue Service, DHCD is charged with insuring the on- going compliance of Low Income Housing Tax Credit properties in the District of Columbia by conducting monitoring. DHCD meets this requirement by conducting physical inspections of the project's buildings and tax credit units, as well as review of the tenant files to determine their status with the rules and regulations of the L ow Income Housing Tax Credit 2 Because the total amount for the CDBG spending test will not be known until after the FY 2013 test has been complete, at the time of this draft, DHCD is unable to provide exact numbers. The exact CDBG spending test information will be in the final version of the Action Plan. District of Columbia Government Chapter One: General Information Page 10 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Program. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program estimated revenue from fees for FY2014 is expected to be approximately $700,000. e. Local Resources According to the Mayor's FY2014 proposed baseline budget, the funds project ed from local resources total $120,347,246. Appropriated and local funds are broken down in Table 2. Table 2 : FY2014 Proposed Local/Other Funds Allocations HPTF Local Appropriation Loan Repayments Intra - District/Other Unified Fund FY201 4 Revenue $106,207,309 Production Trust Fund (HPTF or \"Fund\") , authorized by the Housing Production Trust Fund Act of 1988 as amended by the Housing Act of 2002, is a local source of funding for affordable housing development. Funds for the Housing Production Trust F und are supplied by the legislated share of DC dee d recordation taxes and real estate transfer taxes, currently 15%. The Fund is designed to direct assistance toward the housing needs of the most vulnerable District residents\u2014very low - and extremely low -income renters. Pending the receipt of feasible p roject proposals, the statute requires that: A minimum of 40 percent of all Fund disbursements each year must benefit households earning up to 30 percent of the area median income (AMI); A second minimum of 40 percent of the Fund disbursements must benef it households earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI; The remainder must benefit households earning between 51 and 80 percent of the AMI; and At least 50 percent of the Fund disbursements each year must be used for the development of rental housing. The remainder of the Funds may be used for, but are not limited to, for -sale housing development, single family housing rehabilitation, and loans and title -clearing costs associated with the Homestead Program. In FY2005, DHCD launched a new HPTF Site A cquisition Funding Initiative (SAFI), which combines HPTF money with money from private lenders to provide loans to non- profit housing developers to facilitate acquisition of sites for affordable housing. The rapid pace of escalation in the District of Co lumbia's real estate market makes this initiative necessary to retain land parcels for the housing needs of low -moderate - income residents. DHCD also receives separate, local budget appropriations and repayments on loans originally funded with local dolla rs, for its Home Purchase Assistance Program, which it uses to make more homebuyer assistance loans. g. Private Funds and Leveraging District of Columbia Government Chapter One: General Information FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 11 The grant award criteria for the District's housing and community development programs require the maximum use of priva te financial resources. DHCD uses its funds to \"close the gap\" of needed financing for its selected projects therefore, the private financing sector generally provides a significant portion of each project's funds. Banks and savings and loan institutions serve as the primary financing sources of all housing production, rehabilitation, or capital improvements. Many banks have special community lending operations, partly in response to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages loca l lenders to invest in affordable housing and other community support projects. Several local banks have been active in supporting nonprofit affordable housing development. The District's public dollars leverage these private funds. DHCD also works in ta ndem with non- profit and semi -governmental development organizations to leverage funds for affordable housing and economic opportunity. In addition, the District government and nonprofit developers have actively reached out to capture foundation grants. Many nonprofit organizations seek foundation funding to provide social support services, especially to special needs populations. Among the organizations that are active in this area are the Fannie Mae Foundation, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (L ISC), and the Enterprise Foundation. h. Matching Funds Three (3) HUD programs require matching funds: HOME, ESG and Lead Hazard Control . Under 24 CFR 92.218 et. seq., the District must provide a matching contribution of local appropriated funds to HOME - funded or other affordable housing projects as a condition of using HOME monies. The District's FY201 4 contribution will not be less than 25 percent of non- administrative HOME draws. DHCD meets its HOME obligation through contributions from the Housi ng Production Trust Fund. Eighty percent of all HPTF funds must benefit households earning up to a true 50 percent of the area median income, which is below the HOME income eligibility maximum; moreover, HPTF -assisted rental projects must be affordable fo r 40 years, which exceeds the HOME affordability period requirement. In FY2014, the Department's HPTF funding is budgeted at over $45,000,000. As the Department incurs HOME match - eligible expenses, it will ensure that adequate funding is provided for the matching contribution. In addition to its federal ESG funds, the District of Columbia provides local match dollars to support outreach and prevention services; support shelter operations and fund renovation of shelter space. The District works to provide assistance for the homeless through community -based organizations, faith- based organizations and other non -profit service providers. DHCD matches its Lead Hazard Control monies with local funds. This funding is used to abate lead- based hazards in singl e- and multi -family properties. i. Capital Dollars The District Capital Improvement Program (\"Capital\") funds various modernization, acquisition and improvement efforts. Historically, the Department of Housing and Community Development has received an annual allocation of Capital funds for activities in the Property Acquisition and Disposition Division. The capital budget supports activities that consist of acquisition, assemblage, site preparations, and demolition and stabilization of property to promot e housing, affordable housing, and economic development opportunities. Projects for acquisition are identified in areas where the District can make an investment to enhance and complement development opportunities or projects being undertaken by the privat e or non - profit sectors, as well neighborhoods with substantial concentrations of vacant and abandoned property. Once the property is owned by the District, Capital funds pay for costs related to the rehabilitation and the stabilization of the real propert y. In FY2014, no new capital dollars were allocated to the DHCD capital budget. District of Columbia Government Chapter One: General Information Page 12 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Managing the Process Lead Agency The District of Columbia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is the lead agency developing and implementing the FY2014 Action Plan. DHCD will also administer the majority of program s covered by this plan. Other major public and private agencies responsible for administering programs covered by the plan include the District Department of Health's HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, a nd TB Administration ( HOPWA funded activities); the District of Columbia Housing Authority (public housing facilities and services); the Department of Human Services in partnership with the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness (ESG funded programs and other homeless facilities and services); the District Department of the Environment (lead -based paint assessments). DHCD will continue to work closely with Community -Based Organizations (Housing Counseling Services, Latino Economic Develo pment Corporation, Lydia's House, University Legal Services, and the Central American Resource Center); non -profit developers (such as Manna Community Development Organization, Mi Casa, and Community Preservation and Development Corporation); as well as other community partners including Anacostia Economic Development Corporation; Washington Area Community Investment Fund; Development Corporation of Columbia Heights, and Jubilee Enterprise of Greater Washington. Plan Development Process In preparing the FY2014 Action Plan, DHCD consulted with government agencies, non- profit developers, community stakeholders, and residents to discuss the needs of the community and how DHCD and partner organizations can best deliver those services. A variety of methods w ere used to collect input from the community, including a 'Housing and Community Development' survey, several stakeholder meetings, public hearings, and focused meetings with specific housing, health, and social service providers. DHCD held five Communit y Need Hearings in the spring of 2013 in which residents, stakeholders, and activist were invited to provide input on the FY201 4 Action Plan. Overall, there was broad participation by each sector of the community. Interagency Coordination In addition to specific outreach regarding the Consolidated Plan, DHCD is fortunate to have considerable access to District agencies with complementary missions. The Government of the District of Columbia is organized into clusters of agencies with allied missions. The City Administrator and the Deputy Mayors use periodic coordination meeting to align resources and activities to match mayoral administration priorities. Additionally, monthly Mayor's Cabinet Meetings are used to further coordinate among the clusters of agencies. This system provides for continuous consultation and coordination between agencies. As described earlier, DHCD is part of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Dev elopment (DMPED) cluster. The cluster consists of the Department of Housing and Community Development; Office of Planning; Department of Small and Loca l Business Development; Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs; Department of Employment Services; Department of Insurance, Securi ties and Banking; Office of Motion Picture Dev elopment ; and the Commission on the Arts & Humanities. In periodic cluster meetings, agency needs, upcoming plans, and recent accomplishments are discussed to coordinate efforts. DHCD used these cluster meetings to assist in creating its annual action plan . District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 13 DHCD also participates in regular Housing Agency cluster meetings. These meetings are led by the DMPED and attended by DHCD, the DC Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA), and the DC Housing Authority (DCHFA) . The agenda regularly includes coordination of pipel ine projects and resources, addressing shared issues and information sharing. Institutional Structure DHCD also works closely with the DC Housing Authority and the D C Housing Finance Agency to maximize dollars available for housing opportunities for extr emely low to moderate income residents of the District . A representative of DHCD attends the meetings of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) Committee of Housing Directors to participate in information sharing and initiatives of the Committee. The Director was also a member of the Comprehensive Housing Policy Task Force, which brought together diverse interest groups and experts to broadly analyze housing needs in the District of Columbia and recommend actions. The Task Force released i ts report \"Bridges to Opportunity: A New Housing Strategy for DC\" on March 12, 2013, DHCD will be one of the lead agencies in implementing the recommendations of the task force and Mayor Gray's vision for affordable housing in the District. 3 As part of i ts unified leveraging strategy, the District will continue to work with its non -profit, for -profit and quasi -governmental development partners, as well as coordinate DHCD's investments in the renewal of affordable housing and community facilities with gove rnment agencies that fund infrastructure improvements and services needed to create self -sustaining neighborhoods. 3 Mayor Gray and Comprehensive Housing Strategy Task Force Members Release Report .

Columbia Government Page 14 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Chapter Two: Housing Specific Housing Objectives In FY2014, DHCD will focus on three specific objectives: 1) Preserving and increasing t he supply of quality affordable housing; 2) Increasing homeownership opportunities; and 3) Revitalizing neighborhoods, promoting community development, and providing economic opportunities. Each division's initiatives work either towards one, two or all three objectives. Furthermore, each division has a set of measureable key performance indicators that include outcomes, outputs and efficiencies to allow the Department to work toward a more sustainable community and better serve District residents. The following tables represent the internal reporting, including past performance, for each division.

Services are delivered in two main fashions: 1. Through public housing properties; and 2. Through Section 8 housing vouchers whereby residents are allowed to find and select their own housing, either apartment -style or single- family residences, then pay a portion of the required rent based on their ability to p ay. The DC Housing Authority (DCHA or Housing Authority ) administers the Low -Rent Housing and Housing Choice Voucher Programs (formally Section 8), which are instrumental in preventing homelessness among extremely low -income families. At the present time, DCHA provides an estimated 8,000 public housing units through its Low -Rent Housing Program. An estimated 3,000 Housing Choice vouchers are also being utilized in scattered -site housing within the city limits. Housing specifically geared for special needs populations such as the elderly or people with disabilities are also included in these figures. Each of DCHA's public housing developments has a resident management council through which residents can become involved in the decision- making that affects th eir public housing units. DHCA's facilitates the selection of the councils and encourages residents to participate in council activities and in the general management of their development. DCHA will continue to promote involvement by the council in District of Columbia Government Chapter Two: Housing Page 16 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan managem ent of all facilities and will look at forming new partnerships with community agencies to provide services that encourage and assist residents with achieving self -sufficiency. There has been an increasingly proactive effort to enable residents of the Hou sing Authority to break the cycle of poverty and move towards greater self -sufficiency. The role of the Housing Authority continues to evolve into one that addresses the needs of public housing residents in a holistic manner, taking into account their educ ational, employment, health, and social service needs. The Housing Authority either develops its own programs or coordinates services with other providers to meet these needs. The Housing Authority has moved forward and is flourishing with several full-time Housing Counselor s. The Housing Counselor s are responsible for the development and implementation of Homeownership programs for their residents. The hiring of these Housing counselor s has been a smashing success. As of the date of hire, hundreds of famil ies have become homeowners. In many cases, these essential services are already available in the community, and the role of the Housing Authority is to serve as the facilitator and coordinate the delivery of these services to the public housing property to make them more accessible for residents. The Housing Choice Voucher Administrator provides homeowner opportunities to families who are currently utilizing the Housing Choice Voucher Program. In place of using the voucher as rent, the voucher is put towar d the house payment. Of the 3,000 Housing Choice vouchers received 120 are being utilized by homeowners to make their monthly house payments. DHCD continues to encourage the Housing Authority director to refer potential homebuyers presently residing in low rent housing to seek out the services of these different organizations. The main problem facing DCHA continues to be the ever increasing demand for housing services with little or no increase in federal aid to support this demand. This reality is clearly represented in the growing number of individuals and families on the waiting lists maintained by DCHA. Currently there are over 25,000 individuals on the DCHA waiting list. This number illustrates the current demand for housing assistance far exceeds the ability of DCHA to meet this growing demand. Recent projections indicate this gap will surely widen into the foreseeable future as the city's population growth outpaces the ability of government social service programs to respond to this growth. The Distr ict is pleased to report that the DC Housing Authority is not designated as \"troubled\" by HUD. In recent years, the DC Housing Authority continues to receive High Performer Awards for their endeavors. DHCD continues to examine opportunities for leveraging its housing and community development funds with DCHA to provide other public services and to expand homeownership opportunities. Barriers to Affordable Housing In the past decade, the District of Columbia housing market has experienced a sharp increase in housing prices making the District one of the least affordable in terms of housing. While home prices have declined since mid -2009, rents and home prices remain far higher than a decade ago. Affordable rental units continue to be converted into luxury c ondominiums, although not at the same rate as the peak of the housing market. The lack of affordable housing has been particularly burdensome for low - and moderate - income residents, and is so severe for the District's lowest -income residents that most in this category now spend half or more of their income on housing. The reasons for the high cost and limited stock of housing are complex, but government officials and policy experts have identified the following policies or lack of policies as major obsta cles to affordable housing in the District: A lack of tax incentives in the D.C. Official Code to promote the development of affordable housing and homeownership opportunities; District of Columbia Government Chapter Two: Housing FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 17 A rent control system which allows landlords to increase rents without many ru les and regulations. High rates of rental to condo conversion displacing low -income residents; The Uniform Height Act of 1910, which effectively limits building height in the District to 13 stories and requires a Act of Congress to repeal; In FY2014, the District will take several steps to remove any barriers to affordable housing and ameliorate the impact s of the current housing market. DHCD and District government realize that future resources will buy less in this competitive market, but both the Depar tment and the city will continue to fight in order to achieve the vision of economically stable and racially integrated neighborhoods . To foster this, DHCD has taken 1 1 steps to address the need for affordable housing in the District. 1. Housing Production T rust Fund A DHCD -administered source of public funds focused on producing and preserving units of affordable housing for low - and moderate -income residents The Fund is targeted to serve residents with the greatest housing needs. At least 40 percent of al l funds must be used to serve households with incomes below 30 percent of the area median income (AMI). At least 40 percent of funds must be used to serve households with incomes between 30 percent and 50 percent of AMI. The remaining 20 percent of funds may be used to serve families with incomes up to 80 percent of AMI. In addition, at least half of all Trust Fund funds must be used to produce or preserve rental housing. 2. Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act of 1980 This act regulates conversion o f use of rental housing and other property to condominium or cooperative ownership, provides housing assistance payments to eligible low income tenants displaced by a conversion of use, and gives tenants and tenant organizations the right to purchase their housing accommodations upon sale, discontinuance of use, or demolition by the owner. This program effectively aligns the purpose of the law with the agency charged with creating and preserving affordable housing opportunities. DHCD offers tenant purchase financing which assists in the preservation of affordable units across the city as a whole. 3. Distric t Opportunity to Purchase Amendment Act of 2008 This statue gives the Mayor the opportunity to purchase rental housing consisting of 5 or more rental unit s in which at least 25% or more of the rental units are deemed affordable (i.e., equal to or less than 30% of the monthly income of a household with an income of 50% of the area median income for the District metropolitan area). In the event tenants decli ne to exercise their opportunity to purchase rights, the Mayor may elect to purchase the property, with the objective of increasing affordable units in the dwelling. This program dovetails with the Department's objective of creating and preserving afforda ble housing opportunities. 4. The Housing Regulation Administration (HRA) HRA administers the District's rental housing regulations , implements the District's Inclusionary Zoning program as well as administers Affordable Dwelling Units (ADUs) . Inclusionar y Zoning in the District requires a percentage of units in a new development or a substantial rehabilitation that increase the size of an existing building set aside affordable units in exchange for a bonus density. The goals of the program are to generate mixed -income neighborhoods; construct affordable housing for a diverse labor force; seek equitable growth of new residents; and augment homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income levels. HRA can provide faster response to apartment building c onversion concerns which can affect low District of Columbia Government Chapter Two: Housing Page 18 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan income tenants because the notification process is flexible within the agency and displacement can be minimized . 5. Residential and Community Services Division (RCSD) The Residential and Community Services Division (RCSD) provides funding for programs focused on housing needs and neighborhood revitalization. RCSD works through Community Based Organizations (CBO) to provide comprehensive housing counseling services, small business technical assistance and fa\u00e7ade impr ovement opportunities. RCSD administers the homebuyer assistance programs, which provide financial assistance for low and moderate- income households and District Government employees for the purpose of first-time home purchase. The Division also provides r ehabilitation resources in the form of grants and loans that address health, safety and building code violations, to income eligible owner -occupant and rental units, in order to preserve homeownership. 6. Targeted Spending of Scarce Resources DHCD has partn ered with community- based, private sector and nonprofit partners such as Fannie Mae and the Urban Institute to ensure effective analysis and targeting of scare resources to maximize outreach and education to empower residents about their choices. 7. Tax A batement for L ower I ncome Homeownership Eligible homeowners, including non- profit organizations and shared equity investors, may receive a five- year tax abatement and be exempt from paying recordation and transfer taxes. To qualify, they must meet the following conditions: The property must be owner -occupied; The owner must meet the income level requirement; and The property must be less than $368,000 in value 8. Rental Housing Act of 2005 This act has placed a cap on how much rents can increase due to tenants complaining of unexplained rent increases and pricing them out of their apartment units . 9. Housing Waitlist Elimination Act of 2008 This act requires the Mayor to submit a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategy for eliminating the District of Columbia Housing Authority's current waiting list of individuals seeking housing choice vouchers and placement in public housing by January 1, 2013; and measures to prevent the waiting list from reaching such high levels in the future. 10. DCHousingSearch. org DCHousingSearch.org allows residents to quickly find housing that fits their needs and budget by providing up-to-date listings of available for rent and for sale properties. The site also connects people to housing resources through website links and provides helpful tools for renters such as an affordability calculator, rental checklist, and information about renter rights. 12. Analysis of Impediments District of Columbia Government Chapter Two: Housing FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 19 DHCD completed the 2011 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice which covers the period between 2005 through 2011. The City is mandated to complete this study on a five -year term as it is a recipient of federal funding and it certifies every year when receiving its Community Development Block Grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that its program and services will serve to affirmatively further fair housing. This document details barriers to fair housing choice faced by residents when seeking housing in the District. To this end the D.C. Office of Human Rights has been awarded funding to analyze the barriers found in the Analysis and develop a mechanism for addressing these barriers. HOME Investment Partnership Forms of Investment: DHCD may invest HOME funds in all proposed uses as prescribed in 24 CFR 92.205(b). The District's FY2014 HOME funds will be invested consistent with the purposes of this part and in accordance with HUD. Recapture and Resale: DHCD has selected to use the recapture and resale methods depen ding on the program. Recapture: When DHCD uses HOME funds for its homeownership programs, including both the Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP) and the Single Family Residential Rehabilitation Program, it will utilize the Recapture provision of the p rogram, pursuant to 24 CFR 92.254(a)(5)(i i)(A)(1). The full amount of assistance is recaptured upon transfer of the property or upon the homebuyer's relinquishment of the use of the property as a principal residence. This requirement is established as a covenant in the loan documents executed at settlement of the property. The resale provision would not be appropriate for the Department's single- family homeownership assistance program since it would impose an undue restriction on homes purchased in the pr ivate sector real estate market. Resale: DHCD, through its Development Finance Division, uses HOME funds to assist developers in new construction, renovation and rehabilitation activities that will result in the creation of affordable single - family and m ulti-family (condominium) ownership units and multi -family rental units in the District of Columbia. With regard to the ownership units, DHCD utilizes the Resale provisions of the HOME Program pursuant to 24 CFR 92.254 (a)(5)(i)(A) by incorporating restr ictive covenants running with the land and a silent second Deed of Trust that will require homebuyers to: 1) Maintain the HOME -assisted unit as his/her principal place of residency during the Affordability Period, and 2) Sell the HOME -assisted unit to a su bsequent HOME income -eligible buyer, if said sale occurs within the unit's Affordability Period. The resale requirement must also ensure the price at resale provides the original HOME -assisted owner a fair return on investment (including the homeowner's i nvestment and any capital improvement) and ensure the housing will remain affordable to a reasonable range of low -income homebuyers. The subsequent HOME income -eligible buyer will also have to maintain the unit as his/her principal place of residency throu ghout the remaining Affordability Period. If additional HOME funds are invested in the property at resale, the Affordability Period begins anew or has been effectively extended. Therefore, if the subsequent HOME income -eligible buyer also receives HOME f unding, then the Affordability Period on the unit will be the total of the balance of the previous homebuyer's Affordability Period plus the Affordability Period as determined by the second HOME investment amount. Refinancing: DHCD does not use HOME funds to refinance existing debt secured by multi -family housing that is being rehabilitated with HOME funds. District of Columbia Government Chapter Two: Housing Page 20 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Definition of Modest Housing: DHCD defines \"modest housing\" by following the method outlined in 24 CFR 92.254(a) (iii) for its homebuyer assistance and single family rehabilitation programs. Specifically, DHCD caps the allowable sales price or post -rehabilitation value at the Single Family Mortgage Limit under the 95% of area median established by HUD , as permitted by 24 CFR 92.254 (a)(2)(iii). The lim its for the District of Columbia as of January 1, 201 3 are as follows: House Size 1 family 2-family $465,000 limits apply to one -to-four family units. DHCD does not pr esently finance manufactured housing. In addition, DHCD applies the one -family limit to the sales price or post- rehabilitation value to define modest housing in the case of condominium or co- operative units. In doing so, DHCD cites the following: 94.254(a)(2)(iii): If a participating jurisdiction intends to use HOME funds for homebuyer assistance or for rehabilitation of owner -occupied single -family properties, the participating jurisdiction may use the Single Family Mortgage Limits under Section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b), which may be obtained from the HUD Field Office) or it may determine 95 percent of the median area purchase price for single family housing in the jurisdiction as follows... DHCD uses the 95 percent of the m edian area purchase price standard determined by HUD . Affirmative Marketing: DHCD has used and expanded the directives under HUD's Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan form (AFHMP) [HUD 935 -2] to ensure its production of HOME and federally assisted new construction and substantial rehabilitation housing complies not only with federal guidelines to affirmatively market, but that locally funded housing measures to the same standards. Thus ensuring the District's changing demographics have an equal opportu nity to benefit from the DHCD's housing production efforts when the project is unveiled to the public. Though HUD has instituted the m arketing process only to its housing construction; DHCD has seen the benefit to residents to institute this compliance mec hanism to DHCD funded services. The affirmative marketing certification process ensures that services provided directly or indirectly by the Agency and housing produced for the general public, abide by the affirmative marketing principle. Prior to full f unding, DHCD ensures that its project recipients complete and submit the appropriate certification with accompanying documentation. Through close monitoring of this process, the Department ensures that prospective buyers or tenants in the housing market area, regardless of their civil rights protected category, know about DHCD housing development(s) assisted, are attracted to the housing project, feel welcome to apply, and have an equal opportunity to buy or rent. Through the affirmative marketing proces s DHCD also affirmatively furthers fair housing by bringing greater diversity to areas that have been subjected to housing discrimination based on the residents' race or color, ethnic background and culture, perceived or actual disability, the presence of children, religion or religious practices, sex , or gender. By enforcing this process, DHCD is able to inform about the availability of housing to persons least likely to apply for the housing without special outreach efforts due to (a) self or forced segr egation, (b) linguistic isolation, (c) neighborhood racial or ethnic composition and patterns, (d) location, and (e) price of housing. The affirmative marketing plans expected of project and program funding recipients mitigates the segregationist patterns of the past. District of Columbia Government Chapte r Two: Housing FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 21 Outreach to Minority - and Women -Owned Businesses: The District Government as a whole has an active program of contracting with and promoting local, small, and disadvantaged business enterprises through the Certified Business Entity (CBEs) pr ogram. In 2005 the Office of Small and Local Business Development became a department with increased authority and program areas. The District's Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD) monitors the efficiency and compliance of all Distr ict government agencies, including DHCD, in accordance with the legislative mandate of the \"Equal Opportunity for Local, Small, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (LSDBE) Act of 1998.\" DSLBD reviews and approves Affirmative Action Plans submitted by D istrict agencies for public/private partnerships and for contractors with contracts in excess $25,000. It also provides technical assistance to CBEs that wish to contract, or currently contract, with the District government, and helps those entities with seeking business opportunities. DHCD's loan and grant agreements with developers require that the developers submit Affirmative Action Plans that set forth goals for the hiring of CBEs and for hiring minorities and women. Increasing Minority Ownership : DHCD's HOME funded direct homebuyer assistance is projected to assist an average of 30 -35 minority households each year of the Five -Year Plan, or 150 - 175 households over the period. DHCD estimates providing homebuyer assistance to at least 200 minority households per year or more than 1,000 households over the period of the Five -Year Plan . Under the DFD HOME -funded developer projects, DHCD funds the developers of affordable ownership housing, and not individual homebuyers. District of Columbia Government Chapter Three: Homeless FY2013 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 23 Chapter Three: Homeless Specific Homeless Prevention Elements 1. Sources of Funds In FY2014, Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) funds will pay for homeless prevention, shelter operations, rapid re-housing and administrative costs. The ESG funds are used in conjunction with other loca lly appropriated funds to provide a robust array of prevention services. The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness (TCP), the contractor managing the Continuum of Care for the District of Columbia, administers ESG funds under the directi on of and pursuant to a grant agreement from the Department of Human Services. The ESG Grant prevention funds will be used to cover eligible rental assistance for past due rent for individuals and families at -risk of homelessness, short -term subsidies to maintain housing for families at -risk of homelessness. The ESG shelter operation funds will be used to cover eligible costs to operate temporary shelter for homeless families as a bridge to transitional or permanent housing. The ESG rapid re- housing funds will be used to assist homeless individuals and families in need of identifying, acquiring and paying rent for housing. This rental subsidy assistance will be short -term and utilized as a bridge to other assistance programs or to an individual or family gaining self -sufficiency. Rental assistance will be paid directly to landlord on behalf of participant/household. Utility assistance will be paid directly to utility vender on behalf of participant/household. Table 4 describes the uses of ESG 2012 (FY201 4) funds. Table 4: FY2014 Proposed Emergency Shelter Grant Budget ESG Eligible Activity Homeless Prevention $400,000 Shelter Operations $276,901 Rapid Re -housing $666,419 Administrative Costs $70,701 TOTAL ESG Program $1,414 ,021 *Served includes person, households, and families In FY2014, Shelter Plus Care Grant (S PCG ) funds will also be used to support the homeless citizens of the District of Columbia. DHS will serve as the grantee for the SPCG program and the Co mmunity Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness (TCP) will serve as the sponsoring organization. DHS will work with TCP staff to administer this program and provide permanent housing to 350 households . DHS will continue to monitor TCP for complianc e in administering the SPCG Program. 2. Homelessness The District of Columbia is committed to being a national model in its approach to homelessness by preventing homelessness whenever possible and addressing the needs of our homeless neighbors by creatin g an individualized approach that improves well -being while moving people out of homelessness as rapidly as possible. The District will develop strategies that will allow it to be successful in federal funding competitions and incorporate HEARTH Act requir ements. It will be critical to align all possible resources, including local, federal, and private funds to be successful in achieving the goals. The plan outlines the following three policy objectives: Reduce the overall number of homeless individuals a nd families. District of Columbia Government Chapter Three: Homeless Page 24 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Redesign the Continuum of Care to develop an appropriate mix of services and interim and permanent housing options. Design an evaluation strategy and mechanism to track the District's progress in preventing and reducing homelessness. The Plan includes ten outcome measures the District will track to evaluate the extent to which we have been successful in preventing homelessness as well as helping people move out of homelessness more quickly through the implementation of this strategic plan. The plan includes an initial Work Plan which will be updated annually. Key elements of the plan can be found in the 5- year Consolidated Plan. 3. Chronic Homelessness The District 's 10 Year Plan addresses the issues of chronically homeless individuals. Outreac h services provided by several non -profit organizations under the supervision of DHS will continue to engage homeless individuals who are living on the streets and have a diagnosis of serious mental illness, chronic substance abuse, or dual diagnosis. Enga gement services include a bagged meal food program, a drop in center, and mobile mental and substance abuse services. The drop -in center provides additional services that assists with the engagement process that include but are not limited to shower services, access to toiletries, laundry services, access to medical services, and mail and phone services. The Mayor has made a commitment to provide comprehensive services to meet the needs of homeless individuals. These services include case management servi ces that are housing focused in nature, mobile mental health and substance abuse services, and weekly interdisciplinary meeting. This focus on the chronically homeless has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of chronically homeless living in shelters or on the streets. The District 's ultimate goal of serving the chronically homeless is to place them in permanent housing. The 10 Year Plan does focus on the development of permanent supportive housing programs which include \"housing first\" models . Most of the programs include a combination of a rental subsidy combined with supportive services. The 10 Year planning goals include the continued development of housing stock and the need to expand local rental subsidies and apply for other federal and state funding sources that support the development of permanent housing solutions. Specific steps to be taken during FY 2014 are described in the Consolidated Plan and the District's Permanent Supportive Housing Plan . 4. Homeless Prevention In partnership with the District, the Community Partnership provides an array of homeless prevention services, including: Case management (limited and short -term assessments and education, and home visits); Child abuse assistance (crisis intervention and immediate safety); Emergency assistance (overnight vouchers, utility assistance, security and utility deposits, food and clothing distribution, meals, use of shower and restroom facilities, health- related transportation, and referrals); Family violence assistance (crisi s intervention and immediate safety); Information and referral (Info Line); Life skills classes (counseling center); and Tenant counseling, fair housing, discrimination, and housing assistance. District of Columbia Government Chapter Three: Homeless FY2013 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 25 The Community Partnership's DC HMIS system also helps agencies better communicate and coordinate resources to provide homeless persons and persons at imminent risk of homelessness with better access to the region's network of homeless services and resources. 5. Discharge Coordination Policy As part of the 10 Year Pl an to End Homelessness, The District adopted a comprehensive Discharge Coordination Policy that comprised of policies and protocols for the discharge of persons from publicly funded institutions and systems of care, including foster care, health care, ment al health, and corrections. The purpose is to prevent these individuals from becoming homeless and requiring homeless assistance. Key elements of this policy can be found in the 5- year Consolidated Plan. In FY2014, the District will continue to review and update this policy as needed. Obstacles to Meeting Underserved Needs The major obstacle to meeting underserved needs, and all identified needs throughout the Action Plan, is the general lack of funding resources available, not only to DHCD, but to all public and private agencies who serve the needs of low -income and moderate -income residents. The District's federal resources have not kept up with inflation and, in many cases, have been reduced, and further limiting the funds available to address the ne eds in the community. The current revenue suggests the District was significantly affected by the national recession, with continued deterioration in local source revenues. However, unlike the rest of the nation, the economic forecasts through 2013 for th e District have become slightly more optimistic. District of Columbia G overnment Chapter Four: Community Development FY2013 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 27 Chapter Four: Community Development Community Development The District's core community development needs are those activities which help improve the quality of life of residents through neighborhood revitalization and employment, promote economic opportunities for residents and business owners, residential empowerment, and support the District's overarching objective in creating complete sustainable neighborhoods. With these conceptual goals in mind, the District anticipates using Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to support programs to: 1. Help ensure the District can include complete sustainable neighborhoods, especially for those who have limited resources available to them. CDBG an d other funds will be used to support acquisition, disposition, const ruction, and rehabilitation of housing and property. Additionally, funds will be used toward fair housing activities, rental housing subsidies, homeownership assistance, and energy effici ency improvements. Funds will also be used toward physical improvement to encourage sustainable neighborhoods within the District. 2. Bring federal, nonprofit and private partners together to expand the District's tax base, attract and retain businesses of all sizes, strengthen the business climate, and bring good -paying jobs to residents, particularly low to moderate incomes residents .Additionally, the District wants to continue to create jobs for residents by growing and supporting businesses currently in the District and attracting new businesses. Lastly, the District will emphasize resident job training for those of low to moderate incomes in order for them to successfully obtain the new higher level jobs being brought into the District. 3. Create vibrant and stable neighborhoods, rebuild retail corridors and ensure every District investment yields real benefits for residents and local businesses. The District hopes these funds help preserve, enhance, and strengthen the physical character and quality of Di strict neighborhoods. Priorities will be placed on projects that strengthen neighborhood identity, create more housing choices, guide growth, and improve environmental health. Finally, homeownership programs will be supported to help improve community stability by increasing homeownership rates in the District. 4. Continue to build the capacity of residents to empower themselves to help strengthen their community, address problems, and develop pride in their City and neighborhood. Public service activities th at strengthen neighborhood organizations, provide employment, skills, and homebuyer training, and offer leadership opportunities to youth will be emphasized. Community Development Objectives Table 5 shows the specific community development objectives of the CDBG program. These objectives are funded specifically with CDBG resources, in congruence with other allocated resources, in order to create complete neighborhoods and a more sustainable city. DHCD's community development primary objective is focused on implementing a community development plan that enhances the sustainability of the District within the regional context and holistically completes the fabric of the neighborhoods. District of Columbia Government Chapter Four: Community Development Page 28 District of Columbia FY2013 Action Plan Table 5: FY2014 Specific Community Developme nt Objectives Obj # Specific Objectives Sources of Funds Performance Indicators One-Year Goal Outcome/ Objective* 2 Development Finance Division 2.3 Revitalizing neighborhoods, promoting community development, and providing economic opportunities CDBG, HOME , Other % of affordable housing developments that are highly sustainable and meet the Green Communities Criteria 100 SL-3 3 Residential and Community Services 3.3 Revitalizing neighborhoods, promoting community development, and providing economic op portunities CDBG Total # of storefront facades improved Total # of technical assistance provided to small businesses 50 EO-3 1000 4 Property Acquisition and Disposition 4.3 Revitalizing neighborhoods, promoting community development, and providing economic opportunities Capital, Other Total # of properties acquired Total # of properties recaptured Total # of properties for which disposition agreements were executed Total # of properties investigated that result in rehab 30 SL-3 12 60 15 Priority Community Development Projects DHCD's community development primary objective is focused on implementing a community development plan that enhances the sustainability of the District within the regional context and holistically complete s the fabric of the neighborhoods. Priority community development projects throughout the FY201 4 Action Plan include: a. Housing Resource Center To build a more inclusive neighborhood and increase the number of District Residents who utilize DHCD services, DHCD opened a Housing Resource Center in 2009. The Housing Resource center serves the community as a one -stop shop for housing services and referrals, including providing access to DHCD's searchable affordable housing database, dchousingsearch.org. Comm unity access to the facility's services will continue throughout the five year plan. b. Interagency Coordination Through a recent partnership with the Department of Mental Health (DMH), DHCD is responsible for meeting a goal of financing the development of 320 affordable housing units for the exclusive use of DMH consumers. Through an additional partnership with the Department of Human Services (DHS), DHCD is District of Columbia G overnment Chapter Four: Community Development FY2013 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 29 responsible for meeting its goal of providing 36 units of permanent supportive housing to serve t he District's homeless population. c. Housing Cooperatives Access to homeownership opportunities has become more difficult due to the national economic downturn. DHCD will leverage investments already made into housing cooperatives, by coordinating with financial institutions in order to structure housing cooperative pools. These pools will enable tenant association members that have already purchased their buildings within a cooperative structure to reduce their cost of housing preservation, obtain new rehabilitated housing units and preserve their ability to reside within the District. d. Foreclosure Technical Assistance DHCD will provide technical assistance to borrowers who face financial difficulty or are nearing foreclosure due to current market co nditions and require DHCD loan restructuring in order to preserve the affordable housing units. e. Community Facilities Neighborhoods across the District rely on the development of community facilities for services such as childcare, healthcare, food prov isions, job training, etc. Such facilities can be difficult to develop in the current economic climate, since many private lenders will not make loans for such projects, since loan repayment can be uncertain. As a result, DHCD will coordinate with local financial institutions that have been awarded New Market Tax Credit allocations, so that a modest investment from DHCD can catalyze a larger investment from equity providers - all with the goal of financing the development of much needed community faciliti es in specific District neighborhoods. f. Housing Assistance DHCD will continue to develop housing assistance programs throughout the five year plan. Recently, in an effort to help stabilize the housing market and revitalize neighborhoods hardest hit by high rates of foreclosure and vacant properties the department added the Home Purchase Rehabilitation Pilot Program to its suit e of housing programs, HPAP , EAHP and NEAHP. It is a long- term goal of DHCD to partner with other District agencies to establish homeownership for employees to live near their place of work in the District. g. Commercial Improvements DHCD will continue its efforts to provide grants, through community- based non- profit partners, to retail and commercial property owners for the enhancement of retail and commercial facades in targeted commercial corridors of the District. Anti -Poverty Strategy DHCD, along with other agencies, has playe d a major role in the District's direct efforts to reduce poverty, and the HUD entitlement program funds administered by DHCD is one of many sources of funds for anti - poverty activity by the District. By funding housing for extremely low, very- low and low -income residents, DHCD contributes to the City's anti -poverty strategy by lifting families out of poverty and providing them with stable lodging and a means to build equity for the future. DHCD also supports other DC Government initiatives in reducing poverty and utilizes its federal and local funds to help residents improve their financial stability through housing and financial counseling programs conducted by a network of non- profits. DHCD District of Columbia Government Chapter Four: Community Development Page 30 District of Columbia FY2013 Action Plan also provides funds to Community Based Organizations (CBO) to assist small businesses with technical assistance and to improve their physical appearance. Other agencies play key roles in the reduction of poverty. The Department of Human Services administers income support, welfare to work and a range of programs to support families and individuals. The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness pr ovides emergency support from ESG funds to prevent eviction. The Office on Aging provides support services to seniors and partners with DHCD in the development of senior housing. The Department of Employment Services (DOES) provides extensive job traini ng opportunities through its city-wide \"One Stop Service Centers.\" The Workforce Investment Council (WIC) brings together private and public sector stakeholders to develop strategies to increase employment opportunities for DC residents and to support and to assist DOES in its employment mission. The DC Public School Administration has created career -oriented high schools in a number of specialized areas, including the Technology and Hospitality Industries to facilitate students progressing from school to r eal jobs in the DC market. In FY2014, DHCD will continue to play an important role in the District's new anti -poverty initiatives which directly target neighborhoods with high poverty and crime rates. The New Communities Initiative and the Great Streets Initiative have been planned to address both physical and socio- economic -educational needs of the targeted areas\u2014by combining government resources with those of private and non- profit developers or organizations to bring long- term and comprehensive revital ization to the designated area. \"New Communities\" is a comprehensive partnership to improve the quality of life for families and individuals living in distressed neighborhoods. The companion program, \"Great Streets\" is a strategy to revive the local comme rcial corridors bordering the new communities so that the balance of services that neighborhoods need are restored along with the housing and social fabric. These two initiatives are an aggressive approach to fighting poverty that includes current residen ts and businesses in the planning for an inclusive neighborhood that attracts a mixture of incomes and families, singles, and elders into the revitalized neighborhoods. District of Columbia Government Chapter Five: Non -Homeless Special Needs FY2013 Act ion Plan District of Columbia Page 31 Chapter Five: Non -Homeless Special Needs Non-Homeless Special Needs Priorities and Objectives As indicated in the FY2011 - 2015 Consolidated Plan, there are several populations who require more focused attention beyond their emergency shelter needs. These populations have \"special needs\" and they oftentimes fall into multiple special n eeds categories. These include the following: Elderly and frail elderly; People with severe mental illnesses; People with disabilities (mental, physical, and developmental); People with alcohol or other drug addictions; People with HIV/AIDS or other rel ated diseases; Youth and; Victims of domestic violence. The following special needs populations have been identified as the District's highest priorities for non - homeless special needs housing and supportive service assistance for the FY2014 Action Plan: Elderly and frail elderly; People with disabilities (mental, physical, and developmental); People with HIV/AIDS or other related diseases In FY2014, DHCD will fund the development of 207 units of housing for the special needs population. Additionally, DH CD will continue to administer the following programs that aid in the development of special needs housing: Single Family Residential Rehabilitation Program Multi -Family Housing Construction and Rehabilitation Program First Right Purchase Program Handicapped Accessibility Improvement Program. Source of Funds Various resources exist to address the identified housing and supportive service needs of non -homeless special needs populations. Two major sources of federal funding assist DHCD in its efforts to address their housing and supportive service needs for the non- homeless special needs population: CDBG and HOME funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The CDBG Program funds a variety of housing and community development activities, including housing rehabilitation, acquisition, and predevelopment costs; public facilities and improvements; clearance and demolition; public services; and planning and administration. The HOME Program funds a variety of eligible affordable housing activi ties, including new construction, rental rehab, and homeownership assistance, (both direct and indirect), as well as administration for its HOME programs. In FY2014 DHCD has coordinated with the Departmnet of Health, the Department of Human Services, and other agencies that provide social services in a consolidated request for proposals which will leverage Federal and District funds to provide both capital and operation funding for projects that target District residents with special needs. As with its oth er housing and community development needs, the District's special needs housing programs require, whenever possible, maximum use of private financial resources. Because DHCD uses its funds to \"close the gap\" of needed financing for its selected projects, the private financing sector provides the bulk of each project's funds. Banks and other financial institutions serve as the District of Columbia Government Chapter Five: Non -Homeless Special Needs Page 32 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan private financing sources of all housing production, rehabilitation, or capital improvements and ongoing operations. Many banks hav e special community lending operations, partly in response to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages local lenders to invest in affordable housing and other community support projects. Several local banks have been active in sup porting nonprofit affordable housing development. The District's public dollars leverage these private funds. HOPWA DHCD is the HOPWA Formula Grantee for the Washington, DC Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area (EMA). The District's, Department of Heal th, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and TB Administration (HAHSTA) is the sub -recipient of the HOPWA funds received by the District. The regional HOPWA allocation is administered and monitored by the D.C. Department of Health, HAHSTA. Funds are distributed thr ough HAHSTA's various program. For further information, please see HOPWA FY2014 Annual Action Plan in A ppendix I . District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 33 Chapter Six: Citizen Participation DHCD has a thorough and extensive community participation or citizen participation process that will be employed for all projects. DHCD consistently seeks to include the input of District residents in all phases and aspects of its Annual Action Plan, from the initial planning, to project and program implementation to the reporting and assessment of accompli shments. The effectiveness of this process is key in delivering the proper services and programs to the District's residents, while ensuring that the overall direction of DHCD's work is consistent with residents' expectations and is responsive to neighborhood concerns. A more detailed assessment of this processes elements is as follows: Participation Process DHCD encourages citizen participation in all stages of the planning process. From the drafting of the Consolidated Plan to the filing of the annual Performance Evaluation Report, DHCD hosts Public Meetings, provides draft copies of the Plan before submission, accepts and incorporates citizen input and feedback, and holds special hearings whenever any substantial amendments are made. DHCD also works in an on -going capacity with key non- profit organizations in encouraging the participation of the citizens they work with directly, including many of the low and moderate -income residents who are the primary targets of its HUD funded programs. Bi -lingual s ervices are available for those who request them. Additionally, DHCD works very closely with District's well- organized neighborhood groups in matters that have a particular interest and/or impact on a particular area or neighborhood. This relationship en sures maximum availability of DHCD staff to the residents and ensures transparency of DHCD policies and initiatives. Public Meetings The core of DHCD's Citizen Participation Plan is the Public Meeting. DHCD hosts a Public Meeting during each phase of t he funding cycle, one in preparation for the Consolidated Plan and its annual update through the One -Year Action Plan, and one in conjunction with DHCD's preparation of the Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report. These meetings give the resident s an opportunity to comment on all aspects of DHCD's administration of federal dollars, as well as all substantial activities undertaken by the District. A Public Meeting is also held when any substantial amendments are made to the Consolidated Plan. The meetings are well publicized , available through various mediums, and are held at centrally located facilities that are safe and fully accessible. The locations are also accessible by public transportation and are held on convenient days and times. Access to Information DHCD has all Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plan and Consolidated Annual Reports available on its website in a manner convenient for on -line viewing, downloading and printing. Draft versions of all Plans are made available before they are submitted for citizens, public agencies and other interested parties to view and comment upon. Copies of final and draft Reports are available free of charge at DHCD's office. Additionally, information that applies to these reports and the District's work in general is available. Requests for access to specific information must be made in advance and coordinated with DHCD personnel. DHCD's staff is also available to persons or interested parties who require technical assistance in understanding the P lan, in the preparation of comments, and in the preparation for requests of funding. This District of Columbia Government Chapter Six: Citizen Participation Page 34 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan availability and responsiveness is also employed in handling and responding to whatever reasonable complaints are made concerning the Plan and its undertakings. Substantial Amendments Should any substantial change to the stated Objectives of the Consolidated Plan become apparent, DHCD will involve the residents through its above described methods and practices. Such substantial changes would be understood as being new activities DHCD would undertake within a reporting cycle and does not include expected and actual changes to Goals as they relate to external factors and unexpected changes in available resources. Citizen Comments During the public comment period, c itizens were given an opportunity to provide comments or views on the FY2014 Action Plan. Citizen comments on the Action Plan will be compiled and added to the comments received on needs and priorities for housing and community development in the District. DHCD foresees accepting and responding to all citizen comments. A summary of comments can be found in Appendix G. Efforts to Broaden Public Participation DHCD facilitates broad -based participation in its planning process by providing: No less than two -week advance publication of a Notice of Public Hearings, No less than 30 days to review the draft documents, Two-week periods following hearings for the submission of additional comments, Direct mailings of Notices to a wide range of interested groups, Easy access to draft documents (hard copies and on -line) and hearing transcripts, Accommodation of special needs participation through sign -language interpreters and interpreters for Spanish- speaking constituents, and Holding hearings at convenient times and in barrier -free facilities that are easily accessible by public transportation. The Director and senior DHCD staff members are present at public hearings to take the direct testimony, answer questions on the District's housing and community development needs, and receive comments on DHCD's program performance for prior periods as well as for the current year. The submission of written testimony for the record is encouraged, and Public Hearing records are kept open for at least 2 weeks after the hearing for the receipt of post -hearing written testimony. A court reporter provides written transcripts within 2 weeks of the date of the Public Hearing, and a record of the Public Hearing, including the written transcript, is made available for public viewing at DHCD. When preparing the final Consolidated Plan, DHCD will include a summary of the comments and views received from citizens orally and in writing at the Public Hearing, as well as a response to any comments not accepted. Moreover, DHCD will provide citizens, public agencies and other interested parties with reasonable and timely access to information and records relating to the FY2014 Action Plan and its use of assistance under the programs covered under the Consolidated Plan during the preceding f ive years. Requests may be made to the DHCD Public Information Specialist at (202) 442- 7200. District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 35 Chapter Seven: Other Fair Housing DHCD created a Fair Housing Program in February 2001. To date it is still one a few Housing and Community Development agenc ies in the Washington Metropolitan Area that houses a Fair Housing Program within its agency rather than in an enforcement agency. The Fair Housing program provided education and outreach, policy direction and compliance services. Subsequently, the progr am was incorporated into the Office of Program Monitoring, due to its compliance duties. Since its inception, the Department 's fair housing program has served to promote fair housing and e qual opportunity with DHCD 's stakeholders, including the limited English proficient populations. Those targeted include agency staff within the program services and project development divisions; grantee funding recipients in the non- profit and for -profit sectors; the housing industry, and District residents in general . One key goal of the fair housing program is to ensure the agency is in compliance with local and federal fair housing and equal opportunity laws, rules, and regulations in all of its programs and services. Compliance is not measured only through agency direct services, but through its many community partners, such as community non -profit organizations, housing developers, and individual residents who receive program and project funding through DHCD. The Fair Housing program achieves these goals through: 1. Education and Outreach The Fair Housing program provides fair housing education through its translated fair housing materials in print, digital and web. It also provides training and workshops in various languages to District residents. It particular ly targets limited English proficient communities from our diverse immigrant communities, organizations which assist persons with physical or mental disabilities, and the elderly \u2014 about their fair housing rights in rental, sales, financing or home insurance transactions. Though the Department has completed this task by being awarded competitive grants for education and outreach by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the early years, it has in recent years completed this mandate thro ugh direct outreach to organizations and speaking engagements for target populations. The Department has partnered and continues to make alliances with District agencies, community based organizations, and the private sector to gain the widest and most di verse audience possible. 2. Partnerships The Fair Housing Program has partnered and continues to collaborate with practitioners, local and national non- profit advocacy organizations, sister government agencies, and the private sector since it was created in 2001. The partnership goal is to promote awareness of \"affirmatively furthering fair housing.\" The Department, in collaboration with a non- profit organization and various District agencies, has brought an Annual Fair Housing Symposium to bring experts i n various housing fields to inform participants on the relationships and impacts on fair housing. DHCD continues to partner with the DC Department of Mental Health (DMH) to ensure staff and recipients are trained on equal housing opportunity and affirmati ve marketing principles as they provide services to District residents. DHCD has also partnered with the DC Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs to assist in the Department's annual accessibility regulations and code enforcement training it provi des to funding grantees. DHCD is also partnering with the DC Housing Finance Agency to provide joint site accessibility inspections where both agencies are funding the construction or rehabilitation project. 3. Affirmative Marketing The Department ensures its programs and services are made available to District residents, in particular, those who are \" least likely to apply for the housing or program service without special outreach \" District of Columbia Government Chapter Seven: Other Page 36 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan through affirmative marketing techniques embodied in its certification proc ess. To affirmative market a program or a service, a grantee must take its efforts of outreach a step above general marketing activities. In considering the target groups to outreach, DHCD \u2014directly or through its grantees \u2014must analyze demographic changes, needs in the various target communities, language needs, and city services which impact the service or the housing being developed. DHCD has enforced these principles through an affirmative marketing certification process for its program and construction grants. The certification process takes into account federal and local laws and regulations and conveys the responsibility of affirmatively furthering fair housing which is a responsibility of the Department as a CDBG entitlement jurisdiction. The Departm ent's affirmative marketing certification process for program and service grantees is unique in the Washington Metropolitan Area. The certification process is not only a compliance tool but also an outreach and education opportunity to developers, manag ement companies and other housing industry partners to provide a greater understanding of fair housing principles and compliance. By enlarging the prospective market, funding grantees as well as buyers and tenants in the program or housing market area, reg ardless of their protected category \u2014racial or ethnic groups \u2014are given an equal opportunity to be informed about programs sponsored through the agency and of prospective housing development(s) across the city, and made welcome to apply. The Department will continue to enforce affirmative marketing principles through its certification process to ensure non- housing activities associated with new construction and rehabilitation projects, as well as programs providing services are available to all District resi dents on an equal basis. Another method in affirmative marketing which assists target communities such as persons with disabilities, the elderly or Limited English Proficient clients of Spanish speaking origin is the Department's bilingual housing locator tool, DCHousingSearch.org. This phone and internet tool is free of charge and allows DHCD to attract participation of a greater pool of applicants to its programs and services. In particular it can bring diversity to areas that have been subjected to ho using discrimination due to the residents' protected class. 4. Language Access Act Since 2001, DHCD has partnered with the Office on Latino Affairs, the Office on Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs, and the Office of African Affairs to ensure the Departm ent's services and programs of concern to these communities were available in the appropriate languages. The Language Access Act of 2004 (The Act) is designed to provide greater access and participation by Limited or No- English Proficiency LEP/NEP persons in the District to public services, programs, and activities. The implementation of the Act supports the Department 's responsibility to affirmatively furthering fair housing by ensuring equal opportunity and accessibility of program and services to all D istrict residents. The Department has been an active participant with the Office of Human Rights in enforcing the Act's mandate within the DHCD and its program. To date, the Department has executed five bi -annual Language Access Action Plans and adhered to the Act's regulations. DHCD continues to analyze and improve data collection mechanisms in its Residential and Community Services Division for programs such as Neighborhood Services Activities, Housing Counseling, Lead Safe Washington, and Small Busin ess Technical Support; DHCD also ensures training of its staff on language Access and cultural competency, and continues to translate vital documents as per its Biannual Language Access Plan. As funding is allocated, DHCD will update and develop new trans lated educational outreach material to minimize language barriers to the Department's programs and services. District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 37 Since joining DHCD in 2008, the Housing Regulation Administration has brought new opportunities to further engage and outreach the LEP community on DHCD programs and housing services, as many documents and forms pertinent to landlord and renters are translated into Spanish as the first target LEP language. These can be found on DHCD's website and are available for download. Various forms are manda ted by law to be translated into Spanish; however, DHCD is pursuing the possibility of translating target forms into additional languages in the Act. 5. Section 3 Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 requires that recipients of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds (and their contractors and subcontractors), to the greatest extent feasible, provide job and other economic opportunities to low - and very low-income persons (Section 3 residents) and Section 3 Busine ss Concerns. DHCD, as a recipient of HUD funding, must ensure that all its contractors and sub- contractors provide employment opportunities to low - and very low- income residents, with a focus on public housing residents and recipients of public assistance. DHCD's Section 3 program facilitates employment opportunities and contracting opportunities for businesses owned by or that employ Section 3 residents. Recipients of community development funds from DHCD are required to hire Section 3 residents and sub contract with Section 3 business concerns. DHCD has implemented a comprehensive compliance and monitoring program to ensure Section 3 regulations are followed in the agency and by those receiving DHCD funds. As part of this monitoring process, DHCD reviews all housing construction, housing rehabilitation, and public construction projects for Section 3 applicability. Recipients are required to submit a detailed plan stating their Section 3 goals and how they intend to comply with Section 3 rules and regula tions prior to receiving DHCD funds. Additionally, sub- contractors of these recipients are also required to complete a compliance plan. Recipients are monitored during the life of their project for compliance. M onitoring includes site visits, document revi ews, and quarterly reporting. DHCD will continue to provide technical assistance to its recipients and their contractors in order to facilitate further compliance. Furthermore, DHCD will continue to emphasize the Section 3 hiring priorities and notification of certified Section 3 Business Concerns of contracting opportunities. Education is the second component of the Department's compliance approach. DHCD has conducted an annual mandatory training for the last five years on Section 3 policy and procedure for recipients and their contractors. General contractors, local businesses, community groups, Youth Build organizations, and representatives from the housing authority are often in attendance. Partners in DHCD's Section 3 efforts from the DC Housing Authority including the Resident Services Manager and Section 3 Compliance Coordinator are introduced and given an opportunity to discuss their programs. This training is designed to provide a refresher on agency policy and procedure , but also to apprise non- recipients on the Section 3 program and opportunities that are available. DHCD will continue to provide this training in the future. For FY 2013, DHCD held compliance training on November 7, 2012 which included DHCD's annual Section 3 training but focused on projects recently selected from the annual RFP. This combined approached included other topics such as Davis -Bacon, Fair Housing and Relocation whi ch provided current recipients more comprehensive compliance training. The third focus of Section 3 co mpliance is the Section 3 Business Concern certification. The certification was implemented in 2009 and designed to facilitate compliance with Section 3 among DHCD recipients and their contractors. The certification is an application process that requires any business wishing to receive the preferences available to businesses under 24 CFR \u00a7135.36 to submit an application which will verify that they in fact meet the definition listed in the regulations. Recipients and their contractors are notified of certif ied Section 3 Business Concerns to make it easier for recipients to identify possible District of Columbia Government Chapter Seven: Other Page 38 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Section 3 partners and limit the opportunity for them to assert that there were no bona fide Section 3 businesses for them to contract with. In FY 2013 DHCD participate d in the second annual Section 3 Summit in collaboration with DCHA, the Charlotte Housing Authority, and HUD at the NAHRO Legislative Conference on March 19, 2013. This training provided attendees (not only PHAs but also community planning and development agencies) that receive Section 3 covered funds training on Section 3 compliance, negotiating the Section 3 commitment, Section 3 reporting and updates from HUD on their Section 3 monitoring and changes to the administration of its program. To further promote Section 3 Business Concern certification, DHCD has conducted an orientation/training event on the Section 3 Business Concern certification at the agency. The orientation targeted local businesses, small business assistance groups, minority contractor groups, and CBEs to apprise them of Section 3 related opportunities at the agency and DHCD policy. These orientations have facilitated the certification of Section 3 Business Concerns since its implementation. DHCD has also provided information about the c ertification the DCHA annual training. In FY 2014 DHCD will continue to host and expand these orientation s and training opportunities, as well as participate in other opportunities to publicize the Section 3 program. Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housin g Section 808(e) (5) of the Fair Housing Act provides for the Affirmatively Further Fair Housing (AFFH) requirement of all jurisdictions that receive federal funding. In addition, Section 104 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (24CFR Pa rt 570.496(a), requires that each participating jurisdiction certify that it will affirmatively further fair housing . To AFFH, the District will: (1) Conduct an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice (AI); (2) plan and take appropriate actions to overcome the impediments findings identified through the analysis; and (3) will maintain records reflecting the AI and actions taken in this regard. a. Analysis of Impediments Like all jurisdictions that receive Community Development Block Grant funds from HUD, the District of Columbia is obligated to identify, analyze, and devise solutions to both private and public sector barriers to fair housing choic. In particular, the p assage of the Housing and Community Development Act in 1974 established that recip ients of CDBG funds have a responsibility and obligation to affirmatively advance fair housing. The District completed its first Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) in 1995 and it has completed three additional AIs since in 2000, 2005, and 2011. The AI focuses on the essential goals of the CDBG program and the Fair Housing Act to achieve racial, ethnic, and economic diversity in housing, and on the legal obligation of each recipient of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD ) funds to affirmatively further fair housing in all of its housing activities and programs regardless of its funding source. The District follows the Fair Housing Planning Guide published by HUD which stated that each jurisdiction must co nduct an analysi s to identify impediments to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction; take appropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments identified through the analysis, and maintain records reflecting the analysis and actions in this regard. These ac tions are interpreted by HUD in the Planning Guide to mean: Analyzing and eliminating housing discrimination in the jurisdiction; promoting fair housing choice for all persons; providing opportunities for racially - and ethnically -inclusive patterns of hous ing occupancy; promoting District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 39 housing that is physically accessible to, and usable by, all persons, particularly persons with disabilities; and fostering compliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of the Fair Housing Act The 2011 AI used a color -blind analysis of the housing stock in the District based o n 2010 census data. This data was compared to the 2000 census information to complete a comparison of race demographics in the city. This information was also analyzed and compared to findings in the previous AI. The impediments and recommendations provided on the 2011AI are summarized as follows : Impediments: Washington D.C. has a dual housing market which has been primarily responsible for the racial and economic segregation in both the District and i ts surrounding jurisdictions. Racial steering contributes to much of the racial segregation in the District. Racial and national origin discrimination in issuing conventional and FHA loans to District residents. The high cost of housing continues to pose a barrier by fostering economic segregation and the racial segregation that accompanies it. The District has routinely granted extensions that have kept developments, where ground has not yet been broken, exempt from the city's inclusionary zoning requirements because they were in the pipeline when the inclusionary zoning act went into effect. The District's zoning ordinance imposes significant obstacles to accessory apartments, a cost - effective way to provide housing affordable to individuals and hous eholds of modest means and to enable households with declining incomes to remain in their homes. The District's Comprehensive Plan does not show goals, objectives, or policies that seek to achieve stable, racially -integrated neighborhoods, which in the Di strict would also require economically -diverse housing. The District's planning process does not directly addresses any fair housing issues that the city can help resolve and fair housing violations that the city can help prevent. The District's zoning treatment of what it calls \"community - based residential facilities\" is convoluted and sometimes contradictory. Accessing information on how and where to file a housing discrimination complaint if the complaint is not using the Internet is a substantial barrier to fair housing choice. Lack of accurate and current information on fair housing matters. District enforcement agency do not consistently track whether fair housing complaints involve rental or ownership housing, Difficulty in ob taining data from the District government a gencies limited the analysis. The DC Housing Authority lacks a cogent pro- integrative policy for siting public housing and the use of Housing Choice Vouchers. Nearly all public housing developments were located in predominantly bl ack areas. Recommendations The District must commit to the goal of transforming the dual housing market into a single, unitary housing market. The District should adopt an explicit goal and policy to promote the expansion of housing choice throughout th e city and metropolitan area. The District should work to expand the housing choices of existing and potential new residents beyond the neighborhoods dominated by their own race or ethnicity. Expand where people will look for housing. Commit to an ongoing long -term publicity campaign to make all races aware that they can move anywhere in the metropolitan area that they can afford. The District needs to increase the supply of housing affordable to households with modest incomes outside the predominantly African American neighborhoods. In addition, the District District of Columbia Government Chapter Seven: Other Page 40 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan needs to preserve housing affordable to existing African American residents so that gentrifying neighborhoods can achieve long -term stable integration. Working through existing metropolitan organizations or a new metropolitan coalition of local governments, the District should seek to get significant amounts of affordable housing built in the other cities and counties in the metropolitan area to avoid re -segregation of African Americans in surroun ding counties. District need to work with leader s of the real estate industry as well as the four counties that surround the District to buy into the concept of transforming the dual housing market into a unitary free market throughout the metropolitan a rea. Remove obstacles in the Zoning Code to accessory apartments. Change six of the eight requirements (b, c, d, e, g, h) of the zoning code to facilitate development of accessory dwellings with only a minimal impact on surrounding uses and neighborhoods . Amend the District 's comprehensive plan to establish explicit goals, objectives, policies, and implementation approaches to achieve stable, racially -integrated neighborhoods throughout the District and metropolitan area. Produce print and Internet advert ising targeted to the racial or ethnic groups that have sought housing in the areas the developer or real estate firm serves. Advertising in foreign language newspapers and magazines. Photographs and videos of models portraying residents or potential resid ents should reflect the full diversity of the District. Give every client who seeks housing a brochure that clearly identifies illegal discriminatory practices and provides clear contact information to file a fair housing complaint. Building permit should NOT be issued without full compliance with the accessibility standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Prevent the further expansion of existing clustering and de facto social service districts and prevent the creation of additional cluste ring and de facto social service districts. Amend the zoning code to more accurately call these uses something like \"community residences\" instead of \"community -based residential facilities.\" Adjust the zoning code definitions for the different types of \"community - based residential facilities\" to be consistent and compatible with the definition of \"family.\" Examine and revise the zoning code to make necessary reasonable accommodations for all types of \"community -based residential facilities\" for people with disabilities. The \"311\" database needs to be updated to identify the Office of Human Rights as the place to go when a caller thinks she may have encountered housing discrimination. Train the \"311\" information operators to refer all calls involving po ssible housing discrimination to the Office of Human Rights. Have a uniform reporting mechanism among government, private and non- profit fair housing enforcement agencies to report fair housing data by rental and ownership housing. The District of Columbia Housing Authority should maintain current records on the race and ethnicity of public housing residents in each development and of housing voucher holders. Determine the level of financial services available and whether redlining of mortgages and/or ho me owner and renter insurance is occurring. Greater transparency of information. A change in culture is needed to facilitate the sharing of information with researchers examining the District of Columbia. Adopt a strategic policy to locate public housi ng in a pro -integrative manner within the District and, if possible, outside the District in collaboration with the housing authorities of the surrounding counties. Existing buildings in disrepair located in the gentrifying neighborhoods, should receive high priority for restoration and continued use as public housing. Expand the geographic range of housing choices for Housing Choice Vouchers holders to consider. The Housing Authority should try to recruit more Housing Choice Vouchers holders for the Moving to Work program. District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 41 b. Efforts to Remove Barriers to Affordable Housing The District continues to support activities which are a catalyst for removing potential barriers to fair and affordable housing whether these are directly or indirectly housing rel ated. Throughout the Consolidated Planning period, DHCD will continue to work on remediating and identifying new goals to remove barriers to affordable housing internally and with its government and industry partners. Some of the measures to remove barriers are identified below. Fair Housing Task Force: The Office of Human Rights has created a fair housing task force to review the most recent findings and recommendations of the District's 2006 -2011 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI). A document authored by DHCD will be reviewed by a consultant who will meet with key District agencies to address these barriers and provide the most efficient and productive course of action to implement the recommendations in the AI. Rental Housing Con version and Sale Amendment Act of 2005: The Department continues to enforce the \"Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Amendment Act of 2005\" ( D.C. Bill 16 -050). This legislation eliminated the 95 percent/5 percent loophole in the Rental Housing Conversio n and Act of 1980 ( the Act) which allowed rental property owners to circumvent the tenant opportunity to purchase act (TOPA) and right of first refusal provisions. DHCD will continue to assist tenant associations to exercise their right to purchase rental housing . Inclusionary Zoning (IZ): Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) is a land use technique for developing diverse mixed- income communities by requiring each new residential development make a percentage of the new units affordable to targeted incomes. IZ in the District began with a set of public hearings held by the Zoning Commission starting in 2005. Around the same time, the City Council passed both the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital and the Inclusionary Zoning Implementation Amendment Act of 20 06, which gave policy guidance and empowered the Mayor to administer the program. In August of 2009, the District implemented the District's Inclusionary Zoning program, which affords private sector development companies the right to additional density for their projects in exchange for making at least 8 percent of the units in the project affordable. Through the implementation of this program, we hope to increase the racial and ethnic diversity in District neighborhoods. Office of the Tenant Advocate (OT A): OTA assists and represents tenants with respect to their rental housing concerns, including legal representation in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia administrative proceedings, mediation and adjudication services. OTA was initially housed within the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) , but became full independent in October 2007. The Chief Tenant Advocate advocates for, educates, and provides outreach for tenants in the District of Columbia. HRA and OTA coordinate efforts to work with landlords and tenants to ensure that the parties understand their respective obligations, responsibilities, and rights. Housing Regulation Administration: In 2008, the Housing Regulation Administration which houses the Rental Accommodations Division, the Rental Conversion and Sale Division and the Rental Housing Commission\u2014formerly located in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, transferred to DHCD. This was, in part, an effort by the District to reduce barriers to fair hous ing by providing quicker response to apartment building conversion concerns which can affect low income and disenfranchised tenants. After HRA transferred to DHCD, the Department established the Housing Resource Center to promote the public's access to inf ormation and education, and provide a public interface with property owners, tenants, developers, and other stakeholders. Further, in 2008, a housing provider ombudsman was established to provide property owners and landlords with assistance and guidance in complying with rental housing laws and regulations. District of Columbia Government Chapter Seven: Other Page 42 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Residential and Community Services: DHCD has improved processes in its Residential and Community Services programs to effectively address underserved needs. It also continues to provide an annual training program for staff and funding recipients on fair housing and accessibility compliance for construction projects. As well, DHCD continues to monitor all its sub- recipients to ensure compliance with fair housing and equal opportunity laws and regulati ons. Fair Housing staff is also available as a resource for constituents and service providers. Fair Housing Symposium April 18, 2013: DHCD celebrated its 12th Annual Fair Housing Symposium, themed \" Laying the Blueprint for Y our Advocacy\" during Fair Ho using Month in April 2013. This year marks the 45th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of hate Civil Rights Act of 1968). DHCD and its partners the Equal Rights Center (ERC) and the District of Columbia Office of Human Rights (OHR) brought the symposium with the aim of building awareness and inciting action on fair housing issues. The day -long symposium had a goal of attract ing persons who advocate on behalf of marginalized populations but have little knowledge of fair housing and thus do not incorporate those issues into their work, which was accomplished by providing symposium sessions where attendees were taught how to incorporate fair housing information and programs into their existing work. Request for Proposals (RFPs) : The bi -annual RFPs solicit proposals from community development corporations (CDCs) and private sector firms interested in creating affordable housing or community development projects. DHCD will continue to inform and educate residents and developers at community meetings about providing equal access opportunity to housing and furthermore on building housing that is accessible to person with mobility disabilities. Education and Outreach: The Department partners with non- profit and private sector hous ing advocates and practitioners to inform residents and stakeholders on the Department's programs and services. Education on DHCD programs involve in- house workshops on a plethora of topics including fair housing rights, lead safety, tenant and landlord r esponsibilities, and public meetings to notify and inform residents about DHCD's programs. The Department has a responsibility under the Community Development Act of 1974 to affirmatively further fair housing in all of its programs and to provide greate r education coverage of housing and fair housing issues to a diverse community. One method DHCD accomplishes this is by funding community based organizations to provide outreach and education for tenants on purchase programs, comprehensive homeownership a nd housing counseling, and assistance for relocation and location of apartments. Each year DHCD organizes the Annual Housing Expo, which brings together community based organizations and government agencies, industry leaders in the housing and construc tion arenas, lending and banking institutions and the real state private sector in one location. Accessibility Education and Enforcement: DHCD holds an annual housing accessibility training which incorporates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, American with Disabilities Act, Fair Housing Accessibility and the District of Columbia Code Enforcement. This training is mandatory for staff, principally architects, project managers and general contractors of for funded grantees. It is critical tr aining staff involved in designing, building or supervising the day- to-day progress of the project. The training covers practical and regulatory actions concerning accessible housing according to local building codes and its parallels to federal regulatio ns and laws, it is one more tool to educate grantees while simultaneously ensuring that housing funded through DHCD provides greater opportunities for persons using a wheelchair., Office of Human Rights: The DC Office of Human Rights is an agency of the District of Columbia government that seeks to eradicate discrimination, increase equal opportunity, and protect human rights in the city. The Office enforces the DC Human Rights Act of 1977 and other laws and policies on District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 43 nondiscrimination and fair housing . The Office is also the advocate for the practice of good human relations and mutual understanding among the various racial ethnic and religious groups in the District of Columbia. The District has the most comprehensive civil rights law of any metropoli tan jurisdiction which also includes in its amended form: Gender Identity or Expression and Status as a Victim of Intra -family Offense. Along with the new protected categories under the Act, the District also passed the 2006 Victims of Domestic Violence Eviction Protection law, which protects victims against evictions based on criminal acts perpetrated against them. It also permits DV victims to get out of a lease without liability where necessary to protect their own safety, and prohibits housing discrim ination on the basis of one's status as a victim of domestic violence. Department of Insurance Securities and Banking (DISB): Part of DISB's mission is to protect District residents from financial fraud and abuse by providing fair and efficient supervision of financial -service entities. Through education, training and outreach, DISB works to protect the interests of District consumers from unfair and abusive practices, including predatory lending practices. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs ( DCRA): The mission of DCRA is to protect the health, safety, economic interests and quality of life of residents, businesses and visitors in the District of Columbia by ensuring code compliance and regulating business. It regulates construction and business activity in the District by operating a consolidated permit intake center, and it reviews all construction documents to ensure compliance with building codes and zoning regulations. On the consumer side, DCRA issues business licenses, professional lic enses, and special events permits, registers corporations, and inspects weighing and measuring devices used for monetary profit. Construction activity, building systems, and rental housing establishments are inspected, and housing code violations are abated, if necessary. .In May 2009, DCRA launched its Proactive Inspections program to ensure all of the multi -unit rental properties stock in the District is inspected. Prior to the program, city wide inspections were complaint based; now, all multi- family rental properties in the District (estimated at 4,000) will be inspected regardless of a complaint. Notwithstanding, DCRA will continue to follow up on complaint based inspections. The agency has partnered with tenant advocate organizations to ensure buildings with a history of violations are prioritized. The program includes combing through DCRA's database for problem buildings, providing automatic referrals for inspections to the DC Department of Health (DOH), as well as to the District Department of the Environment (DDOE), for mold, lead, air quality, rodents and other health and environmental concerns. DCRA is on track to inspect an average of 60 buildings per month through 2013. Foreclosure Prevention: The District provides funding to the non- profit sector to provide outreach and education to residents victimized or at risk of a home foreclosure. CBOs funded through DHCD provide foreclosure prevention training so that residents can be salvaged from losing their home. The training, provided in E nglish and Spanish by some CBOs, seeks to provide individualized counseling, assess the delinquency status, and provide options and a work plan to alleviate the situation. Homeownership Assistance: The District has used both local and federal funds to continue to create and preserve affordable housing units for low -income and special populations which includes, but is not limited to, the elderly, at risk youth, victims of domestic violence, persons with developmental disabilities, recuperating drug and alcohol abuse populations, and homeless. All housing created or supported from these funding sources must adhere to the fair housing and equal opportunity compliance and monitoring processes, regardless of its funding source. Likewise, other housing age ncies and non- profit community development corporation also offer tools for assisting first time homebuyers and person in crisis. The D.C. Housing Finance Agency has a Home Resource Center dedicated to education and training to first time homebuyers on homeownership opportunities; Manna, Inc. a non- profit housing corporation which builds affordable housing also has its own first time home buyer training program and mortgage assistance program, through a sister organization, for low income residents citywide. District of Columbia Government Chapter Seven: Other Page 44 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Monitoring Program and financial management staff conduct formal on -site monitoring at least once every two years of CDBG and HOME funded projects implemented by sub- recipients (more frequently if the sub -recipient is new or is having difficulty meet ing program or contract requirements). Review of monthly or quarterly reports, program evaluation forms, program visits , and phone calls are also part of program monitoring procedures. Sub- recipients are surveyed periodically to determine satisfaction levels with services and areas in need of improvement. Program monitoring ensures that the sub- recipient's performance is adequate and in compliance with Federal and local regulations, as determined by the contract agreement and scope of service. Components of project monitoring include compliance with eligible activities and National Objectives, HUD program rules and administrative requirements; accessibility to all sites where federally -assisted programs are implemented; progress against production goals; n eeds for technical assistance; composition and activity of a sub- recipient's board; statements of non -conflict of interest by board members; compliance with equal employment opportunities and labor practices; reviewing client files where appropriate; revie wing program brochures and printed material to ensure compliance with language accessibility; and evidence of innovative or outstanding performance. Financial monitoring ensures that sub- recipients comply with all of the Fe deral regulations governing financial operations. This includes reviewing original supporting documenta tion for financial transactions; time sheets; independent audit reports and management letters ; tracking expenditures into the general ledgers ; check books and bank transactions; internal controls ; reviewing financial transactions to ensure that they are within the approved budget ; and that expenditures are eligible and reasonable. An overall monitoring schedule is established at the beginning of each program year, as well as an individ ual monitoring checklist for each activity. Monitoring of sub- recipients that result in significant findings will require a corrective action plan and repeated interim monitoring visits by DHCD staff. If corrective actions are not taken within a prescrib ed period or if the findings are egregious in nature, project reimbursement is immediately suspended until the deficiencies are corrected. Any financial malfeasance would be immediately rep orted to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development as well as the HUD Inspector General. Long term compliance with property management and disposition requirements is outlined in contracts with sub-recipients. DHCD interests in real property acquired with CDBG or HOME funds are required to be recorded as part of the deed. Federally -assisted housing projects that have HOME or CDBG funds are monitored periodically. Some projects have a full code inspection by the Code Enforcement staff and Fire Marshal. An on- site compliance monitoring review examines all aspects regarding the leasing of an affordable unit. It begins with a review of the components of the affordable housing agreement with leasing and management staff to ensure that all parties understand the requirements. Additionally, the lease, the rental amount s and the rent roll, the tenant selection policy and process, the waiting list procedures, property marketing plan and fair housing notices are reviewed. Tenant files of households occupying affordable units are reviewed to ensure required procedures are f ollowed, such as using HUD Handbook 4350.3 to identify and calculate income correctly, obtaining signatures of all adult household members on income certifications and renting at allowable amounts. Occupancy reports submitted by the owners are reviewed whi le on- site to verify that the information being reported is substantiated by the documentation in the file. When discrepancies are noted, the owner is required to make corrections. Corrective action ranges from the owners making corrections on their repo rt to providing a replacement affordable unit when the existing household is ineligible for the unit. Other changes might be preparing a more effective marketing plan or repayment of rent to tenants. District of Columbia Government FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 45 Lead -based Paint DHCD is committed to producing aff ordable housing that is free from lead- based paint hazards in all of its development programs. Since 2002, DHCD has revised protocols for all single family and multi -family housing development programs to ensure these programs comply with the Lead- Safe Ho using Rule (24 CFR 35). DHCD requires that lead- based paint (LBP) hazards be addressed in every project undertaken with DHCD funds or involving an existing residential building. Implementing DHCD's adaptation of the Lead -Safe Housing Rule involves appro ving and/or monitoring the full range of lead -hazard reduction activities, e.g., disclosure verification, risk assessment completion, lead scope -of-work development, finance for the lead- based paint reduction work, construction inspection, and verificatio n of clearance. Once clearance testing is complete, the District's Department of the Environment (DDOE) reviews the clearance report and issues Letter of Permit Completion to the property owner. In addition to what are now routine requirements for lead s afety in all DHCD housing rehabilitation activities, DHCD is administering a $2. 9 million Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Grant, awarded in 2012 on a competitive basis from HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control (OHHLHC) with a $1.9 mill ion District match ; the Department antic ipates completing another 200+ units with the funds . This new grant will reduce lead -based paint hazards in housing built before 1978 that is occupied by or available for occupancy by low -income (< 80% Area Median I ncome) households with children under the age of 6 years that live or frequently visiting the properties. DHCD is working in partnership with the District's Department of the Environment (DDOE), and Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA), Child and Family Services Administration (CFSA) as well as with the enforcement activities of the Office of the attorney General (OAG), to provide a seamless system of: (1) identification of lead hazards in residential property; (2) enforcement actions against property owners, where applicable; and (3) opportunities for property owners to finance lead hazard reduction activities. Economic Development In FY2014, DHCD along with the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development will continue to promote the revitalization of District neighborhoods in order to create job opportunities, affordable housing, commercial revitalization, public facilities (including parks, recreation centers, and multi- use facilities) and vibrant and safe places to live and work and to improve the general quality of life of District residents. In addition, DMPED will use a portion of FY201 4 CDBG funds to carry out activities that support the development and disposition of properties previously acquired with pu blic (largely through the former urban renewal program) and federal funds. DMPED will carry out these activities through individual development and facilities projects and through implementation of the Great Streets, New Communities, and Neighborhood Inv estment Fund programs.

The primary objective of this Act is the development of viable urban communities. The District of Columbia has been a participant in the federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program since its inception. A Citizen Participation Plan is part of the Consolidated Planning requirements co ntained in 24 CFR 91. In 1994, federal regulations were revised to require the consolidated submission of plans and applications for three other programs in addition to the CDBG plan and application. The following four entitlement grant programs of the U .S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) were consolidated into a single planning and application process: Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESG) Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) The Citizen Participation Plan Requirement The associated revised regulations stipulate that participating jurisdictions must develop and implement Citizen Participation Plans that specify how citizens can provide input to the planning and implementation process. This document constitutes the Citizen Participation Plan for the District of Columbia's Consolidated Plan. It was prepared by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the District's grantee agency for administration of the Consolidated Plan. DHCD's Citizen Participation Plan (CPP) describes how citizens will participate in three programmatic areas: 1. Development of the Consolidated Plan, 2. Substantial amendments made to t he Consolidated Plan, and 3. Development of the annual performance report. The plan is designed to especially encourage participation by low - and moderate -income persons, minority and non- English speaking persons, residents of public and assisted housing de velopments, and, in particular, persons living in areas where the federal grant funds are proposed to be used. In addition, the CPP requires DHCD to minimize displacement and inform citizens of available assistance with relocation for all federally - funded projects. DHCD includes relocation requirements compliant with the Uniform Relocation Act (URA) in its guidelines to prospective developers during the development funding process. These guidelines are also available to the public and other government age ncies. Participating jurisdictions are required to follow their Citizen Participation Plans after adoption. Plan Development Process : The District's Consolidated Plan process begins with DHCD's preparation of the Citizen Participation Plan (CPP) which de scribes the Plan Development Process. The CPP informs the public about processes and District of Columbia Government Appendix E: Citizen Participation Plan FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 93 procedures for public access and influence on the Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plans, and the proposed scheduling for development and submission of the plan. Cop ies of the CPP are made available at least 2 weeks prior to the first public hearing at public libraries, all Advisory Neighborhood Commission offices, selected community based organization offices, at DHCD's office and on DHCD's website: http://dhcd.dc.gov . The CPP is also made available during the review of the Consolidated Plan. The CPP includes a vigorous effort to notify the District of Columbia Housing Authority and other government agencies as well as the affect ed public about the Plan Development Process and to provide ample opportunity for citizen input at all stages. In the course of developing the Consolidated Plan, there are at least three public hearings held and there are two 30- day, open comment periods during the drafting stages before the document is finalized and submitted to HUD. The Consolidated Plan development process consists of the following steps: Preparing and issuing the Citizen Participation Plan with Notice of the \"Needs Assessment\" Public Hearings, Conducting a series of \"Needs Assessment\" Public Hearings early in the fiscal year to develop public priorities and receive feedback on prior year performance, Preparing and issuing a draft proposed Five -Year Plan (if a new 5 -Year Plan must be developed), or a draft proposed Action Plan for the current fiscal year, Conducting (at a different point in the program year) a \"Budget\" Public Hearing on the draft proposed Consolidated Plan and its proposed budget, Submitting the final proposed Consolid ated Plan to the Mayor for approval, Finalizing the Consolidated Annual Action Plan, and Submitting the Consolidated Annual Action Plan to HUD prior to the August 15th annual deadline.

District of Columbia Government Appendix E: Citizen Participation Pl an Page 94 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Public Access and Accommodation DHCD facilitates broad -based participation in its planning process by providing: No less than two -week advance publication of a Notice of Public Hearings, No less than 30 days to review the draft documents, Two-week periods following hearings for the submission of additional comments, Direct mailings of Notices to a wide range of interested groups, Easy access to draft documents (hard copies and on -line) and hearing transcripts, Accommodation of special needs participation through sign -language interpreters and interpreters for Spanish- speaking constitu ents, and Holding hearings at convenient times and in barrier -free facilities that are easily accessible by public transportation. The Director and senior DHCD staff members are present at public hearings to take the direct testimony, answer questions on the District's housing and community development needs, and receive comments on DHCD's program performance for prior periods as well as for the current year. The submission of written testimony for the record is encouraged, and Public Hearing records are kept open for at least 2 weeks after the hearing for the receipt of post -hearing written testimony. A court reporter provides written transcripts within 2 weeks of the date of the Public Hearing, and a record of the Public Hearing, including the written transcript, is made available for public viewing at DHCD. When preparing the final Consolidated Plan, DHCD will include a summary of the comments and views received from citizens orally and in writing at the Public Hearing, as well as a response to any co mments not accepted. Moreover, DHCD will provide citizens, public agencies and other interested parties with reasonable and timely access to information and records relating to the District's Consolidated Plan and its use of assistance under the program s covered under the Consolidated Plan during the preceding five years. Requests may be made to the DHCD Public Information Specialist at (202) 442- 7200. Hearing Notification DHCD promotes attendance at the hearings, particularly for low - and moderate -income citizens and citizen groups located in blighted areas of the city in which DHCD entitlement grant program funds are directed. The Public Hearings are announced through the publication of a Public Hearing Notice, containing the date, time, location, and subject matter of the Public Hearing. Advertisement of the Public Notice is placed at least 2 weeks prior to the hearings in the D.C. Register, and in various media outlets that reach different population and interest groups. These media outlets incl ude a daily newspaper in general circulation (such as The Washington Post or Washington Times ) and other publications that reach different language groups, neighborhoods , minority populations and other special interest populations. (Examples of such public ations would include: the Afro -American, El Tiempo and The Blade.) No fewer than 500 copies of the Public Hearing Notices are distributed by direct mail to various constituent groups and individuals, including all Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, public housing resident councils, civic associations, nonprofit developers, organizations supporting special needs populations , church groups, and community based organizations. Additionally, DHCD has contractual relationships with specific community based organ izations (CBOs) that have a responsibility to distribute information regarding DHCD's entitlement grant programs and to review the information with citizens. District of Columbia Government Appendix E: Citizen Participation Plan FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 95 \"Needs Assessment\" Public Hearing In the first quarter of each fiscal year, DHCD conducts a series of public hearings on \"Housing and Community Development Needs in the District of Columbia.\" Testimony is solicited from the public on a variety of issues, including community development, commercial revitalization, job creation through DHCD - funded projects, home ownership, housing rehabilitation, housing production, fair housing, lead paint hazards, and displacement issues resulting from DHCD development activities.

The draft Consolidated Plan includes estimated federal entitlement grant amounts, community development objectives, projec ted budgets and performance measures for implementing programs, a description of the processes DHCD utilizes to receive proposals for funding, certification of the District's plan to minimize displacement and assist in relocation in compliance with the fed eral and local regulations, and descriptions of other proposed District housing and/or community development activities. DHCD also includes estimates of appropriated, local funds, and the Housing Production Trust Fund (HPTF) in its draft document to provi de the public with a complete picture of its potential sources and uses of funds. In preparing the draft Consolidated Plan, DHCD considers all statements, testimony, and proposals regarding expenditure of federal entitlement grant funds that have been provided up to that point in the development process. A summary of the comments from the public at the Needs Hearings are included in the Draft Consolidated Plan along with a discussion of any comments not incorporated into the Plan. The public is given 30 da ys to provide written comments on the Plan to DHCD . \"Budget\" Public Hearing DHCD conducts a \"Budget\" Public Hearing on the proposed Consolidated Plan when the District's budget process has clarified local funding, usually in the months of March- April of a given fiscal year.

District of Columbia Government Appendix E: Citizen Participation Plan Page 96 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan Submitting the Consolidated Plan to HUD After approval of the proposed Consolidated Plan by the Mayor the Department submits the Plan to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Washington Field Off ice by the August 15th deadline. Copies of the approved plan are distributed to stakeholders. Technical Assistance The Department makes federal and local funds available for new and rehabilitated housing proposals and community- development projects and services through a public Notice of Funding (NOFA). DHCD's Development Finance Division (DFD) issues a Request for Proposals (RFP) for development proposals serving low -moderate -income residents, and the Residential and Community Services Division (RCS) i ssues a Request for Applications (RFA) for neighborhood- based services. Both Divisions can provide technical assistance to organizations that request it. Prior to releasing the RFP/RFA, DHCD conducts three educational seminars that lay the foundation for doing business with DHCD, instruct organizations on building capacity to ensure a more successful project, and how to create and submit a successful proposal. These seminars also give organizations the opportunity to ask questions and obtain assistance i n preparing RFP/RFA project submissions. In addition, DFD maintains an RFP telephone hotline and an RFP e -mail address to allow organizations to continue to ask questions and receive assistance on an ongoing basis throughout the RFP process. The RFP req uires that development proposals for existing and occupied buildings minimize displacement and provide a strategy and funding to meet temporary or permanent relocation needs in compliance with the types and levels of assistance in the URA (for federally -funded projects) or in Title 10 of the DC Code (for HPTF -funded projects). RCS keeps a record of all those who receive the RFA throughout the application cycle, in order than any amendments to the application process can be quickly communicated to all potent ial applicants. RCS keeps a record of all those who receive the RFA throughout the application cycle, in order tha t any amendments to the application process can be quickly communicated to all potential applicants. DHCD also supports direct technical assistance for low -and-moderate -income residents and groups through neighborhood- based housing counseling agencies and community development organizations. The purpose of the assistance is to make DHCD programs and funds accessible to low -moderate -income residents. These services include: Assisting renters to understand their o ptions under the \"first right to purchase\" program when a building is being sold so they can access seed loans and rehabilitation loans to exercise their rights to purchase their units; Providing program intake and technical assistance for applicants for first -time home owner loans, including assistance to organize financial and other required program documentation; Assisting tenants in expiring Section 8 properties to understand their rights and to offer relocation assistance as needed, Assisting new home owners to remain owners by assistance in home management, budgeting, credit, and mortgage payments, and Assisting small, neighborhood- serving businesses with technical assistance in areas such as: business start-up, maintaining an existing business, or improving the business and its environment. District of Columbia Government Appendix E: Citizen Participation Plan FY2014 Action Plan District of Columbia Page 97 Substantial Amendments to the Consolidated Plan The federal Consolidated Plan regulations require the inclusion of specific criteria in the Citizen Participation Plan for determining what constitutes a chang e in programmatic activity significant enough to be classified as a \"Substantial Amendment\" to the Consolidated Plan. A change in federal rules or regulations that mandates an alteration in current programmatic operations would not be considered a substant ive amendment, but rather a conforming regulatory requirement. Changes deemed \"Substantial Amendments\" must be subjected to citizen review and comment before implementation. The following criteria are used to determine whether a programmatic change con stitutes a Substantial Amendment to the Consolidated Plan: A change which results in a major alteration of the purpose, location, or beneficiaries of a DHCD operational program; or A change in the allocation of the distribution of program funds greater t han 25 percent of the federal entitlement grants included in DHCD's fiscal year budget (CDBG, HOME, and ESG). District law (D.C. Code \u00a7 5 -902) requires that DHCD \"provide citizens a full and meaningful opportunity to participate in the planning, developm ent and evaluation of the annual Community Development Program and any amendments or modifications thereto.\" (Emphasis added.) District law further requires that the public must be notified of a Substantial Amendment, and at least two public hearings must be held to obtain the views of citizens on the proposed change. The procedures cited for notice and access during the Consolidated Plan development process are applied in the case of any Substantial Amendment to the Plan. Notice of a Proposed Substant ial Amendment, including a description of the nature and the actual language of the amendment, is published in the D.C Register and in various citywide media sources, including, but not limited to, a daily newspaper in general circulation (such as The Wash ington Post) and other publications that reach different language groups, neighborhoods , minority populations and other special interest populations. (Examples such publications would include: the Afro- American, El Tiempo and The Blade.) A solicitation of public comment, including information on the two public hearings that will be held, is included in the notice. A period of not less than 30 days is allowed to receive responses from the public on a proposed Substantial Amendment. A period of at least 2 weeks notice is given for the two public hearings. The proposed final Consolidated Plan Substantial Amendment (incorporating any revisions or discussions resulting from the public comment process), are transmitted to the Mayor. Minor Amendments : Distr ict law (D.C. Code \u00a7 5 -902) allows DHCD to make \"minor\" amendments to the Consolidated Plan. A minor amendment is an amendment that is of less magnitude than a \"substantial\" amendment, but of greater significance than a \"technical\" amendment, which can be undertaken at the discretion of the agency. A minor amendment would NOT result in: A major alteration of the purpose, location, or beneficiaries of a DHCD operational program; or A change in the allocation of the distribution of program funds greater than 25 percent of the federal entitlement grants included in DHCD's fiscal year budget (CDBG, HOME, and ESG). District of Columbia Government Appendix E: Citizen Participation Plan Page 98 District of Columbia FY2014 Action Plan A minor amendment to the Consolidated Plan, consistent with the intent of the approved program, must be submitted to the Mayor. The minor ame ndment is deemed approved if the Mayor does not disapprove the amendment within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays). Annual Performance Report (CAPER ) Within 90 days after the close of DHCD's Fiscal Year (September 30th), HUD reg ulations require the Department to submit a performance report, the Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) . The CAPER provides HUD with necessary information to assess whether DHCD carried out its programs in compliance with applic able regulations and requirements, and as stated in that year's Consolidated Plan. The CAPER also provides a vehicle for DHCD to describe its program achievements to District citizens. At least 2 weeks prior to submission to HUD, the CAPER is made available to the public for review and comment, following the Notice and distribution procedures cited earlier. Notice of the availability of the CAPER for comment and review is published in the D.C. Register and in a daily newspaper in general circulation (such as The Washington Post) and other publications that reach different language groups, neighborhoods , minority populations and other special interest populations. (Examples in 2006 of such publications would include: the Afro -American, El Tiempo and The Blade.) No less than a 15 -day review period is provided for the draft CAPER. DHCD also accepts comments on the prior -year's performance at the annual Consolidated Action Plan \"Needs Assessments\" Hearings. The final CAPER is submitted to HUD by December 31st, with an addendum that summarizes any public comments received and the agency's response to the public comments in adopting its final CAPER report.
