Vaccination against coccidiosis with live oocysts is regarded as effective in the control of avian coccidiosis, but in some conditions, such as poor sanitary management or incorrect application of the vaccine, may lead to poorer performance, measured as reduced weight gain and feed efficiency, in comparison with prophylactically medicated birds. Such reports are the reason for widespread reluctance to use anticoccidial vaccine in broilers. This paper reviews broiler studies in which nutritional methods as performance and/or immune-supporting factor with regard to anticoccidial vaccination were investigated. The results of some of the studies presented in the article indicate that feed additives with immunostimulating properties, along with proper protein levels in the diet, may have a beneficial effect in cocci-vaccinated broilers. - Type - Review Article - Information [World's Journal](/core/journals/world-s-poultry-science-journal), [Volume 70](/core/journals/world-s-poultry-science-journal/volume/AA3F2CEC756E90DB0C7FEE74BA1617C5), [Issue 1](/core/journals/world-s-poultry-science-journal/issue/77D2252E403DC0450E79D70A2133EF94), March 2014 92 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 World's Poultry Science "}
