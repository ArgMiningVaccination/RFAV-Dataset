Biden, Jr., in his official capacity as President of the United States of America; Lloyd Austin, Secretary, U.S. Department of Defense, individually and in his official capacity as United States Secretary of Defense; United States Department of D efense; Carlos Del Toro, individually and in his official capacity as United States Secretary of the Navy, Defendants \u2014Appellants . Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas USDC No. 4: 21-CV-1236 Before Jones , Duncan , and Engelhardt , Circuit Judges . Per Curiam : The district court preliminarily enjoined the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") , United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin , and United United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit FILED February 28, 2022 Lyle W. Cayce States Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro from enforcing certain COVID -19 vaccination requirements against 35 Na vy special warfare personnel and prohibited any adverse action s based on their religious accommodation requests .1 It later declined to stay the injunction. Defendants now seek a partial stay pending appeal insofar as the injunction precludes them from considering Plaintiffs' vaccination statuses \"in making deployment, assignment and other operational decisions.\" The Navy ha s grant ed hundreds of medical exemptions from vacc ination requirements , allowing those service members to seek medical waiver s and become deployable. But it has not accommodated any religious objection to any vaccine in seven years, preventing those seeking such accommodations from even being considered for medical waivers. We DENY Defendants' motion . I. Background A. President Biden \"direct[ed] the [DoD] to look into how and when they [would] add COVID -19 vaccination to the list of required vaccinations for members of the military.\" Thereafter, the DoD and the Navy issued a serious of orders and directives implementing mandatory COVID -19 vaccine requirement s. Pertinent to this case, Secretary Del Toro issued \"ALNAV 062/21 ,\" which ordered all \"active duty Service Members . . . to be fully vaccinated within 90 days\" and \"all Reserve Component Service Members . . . to be fully vaccinated within 120 days.\" Secretary Del Toro's order \"exempted 1 At least two other district courts have recently enjoined the same, or similar, polices with respect to other service members. See Air Force Officer v. Austin , ___ F. Supp. 3d ____, No. 5:22 WL 468799 -cv-2429 520829 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 2022). Two other courts found similar challenges non -justiciable. See Church v. Biden, No. 21 -2815 (CKK), 2021 5179215 \"actively participating in COVID -19 clinical trials.\" His order warned that \"failure to comply is punishable as a violation of a lawful order\" and \"may result in punitive or adverse administrative action or both.\" It also authorized the Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the Marine Corps \"to exercise the full range of administrative and disciplinary actions to hold non -exempt Service Members appropriately accountable.\" Such actions \"include, but [are] not limited to, removal of qualification for advancement, promotions, reenlistment, or continuation, consistent with existing regulations, or otherwise considering vaccination status in personnel actions as appropriate.\" The next day, consistent with Secretar y Del Toro's order, the Navy issued \"NAVADMIN 190/21,\" which \"provides guidance\" on implementing the vaccine mandate within the Navy. NAVADMIN 190/21 states that \"COVID -19 vaccination is mandatory for all DoD service members who are not medically or administratively exempt.\" Religious accommodations fall under administrative exemptions. Again, \"service members who are actively participating in COVID -19 clin ical trials are exempt from mandatory vaccination against COVID -19.\" NAVADMIN 190/21 also specifies that the \"COVID Consolidated Disposition Authority (CCDA)\" will determine \"ultimate disposition\" of Navy service members who remain unvaccinated. The CCDA \"serve[s] as the central authority for adjudication and will have at his or her disposal the full range of administrative and disciplinary actions.\" The Navy, moreover, mandated FDA- approved COVID -19 vaccinations under its Manual of the Medical Department (\"MANMED\"). MANMED \u00a7 15-105, cover ing special operations service members, provides: \"[special operations] designated personnel refusing to receive recommended vaccines . . . based solely on personal or religious beliefs provision does not pertain to medical contraindications or allergies to vaccine administration.\" Service members who are \"disqualified\" under the MANMED have been rendered \"non -deployable.\" The Commander of Naval Special Warfare Command later issued \"Trident Order #12.\" The order set a deadline of October 17, 2021, for unvaccinated service members to receive their first jab or submit an exemption request. And it provides that \"exemptions for medical and/or administrative (including religious) reasons will be adjudicated via service policies.\" Further, \"special operations designated personnel (SEAL and SWCC) refusing to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs will still be medically disqualified.\" But, like MANMED \u00a7 15-105(3)(n)(9), Trident Order #12 \"does pertain contraindications or allergies to vaccine administration.\" Any \"waiver from medical requirements for special operations qualification requires a separate waiver that is in addition to waiver of the COVID -19 vaccine requirement for all service members.\" The Navy subsequently issued \"NAVADMIN 225/21,\" designating the Chief of Naval Personnel as the CCDA and providing procedural guidance for administrative disposition of unvaccinated Navy service members. NAVADMIN 225/21 mandates \"administrative separation\" of all \"Navy service members refusing the COVID -19 vaccination, absent a pending or approved exemption.\" It also authorizes commanding officers to \"to temporarily reassign Navy service members who refuse the COVID -19 vaccine, regardless of exemption status, based on operational readiness or mission requirements.\" In addition, \"Commands shall not allow those refusing the vaccine to promote/advance, reenlist, or execute orders, with the exception of separa tion orders, until the CCDA has completed disposition of their case.\" Commanders \"shall delay the promotion of any officer\" and \"withhold the advancement of any enlisted 5 refuses the vaccine. Service members separated for refusing the vaccine \"will not be eligible for involuntary separation pay and will be subject to recoupment of any unearned special or incentive pays.\" The CCDA may also \"seek recoupment of applicable bonuses, special and incentive pays, and the cost of training and education for service members refusing the vaccine.\" The Navy finally issued \"NAVADMIN 256/21\" t o specify that \"service members with approved or pending COVID -19 vaccination exemption requests shall not be processed for separation or be subject to . . . other administrative actions . . . due solely to their lack of COVID- 19 vaccination.\" Unvaccinated service memb ers, however, \"regardless of exemption status, may be temporarily reassigned . . . based on operational readiness and mission requirements.\" NAVADMIN 256/21 further requires service members whose COVID -19 vaccination exemption requests are denied to recei ve the vaccine within five days of the denial, or else they \"will be processed for separation and be subject to . . . other administrative actions.\" B. Plaintiffs are 35 Navy service members assigned to Naval Special Warfare Command unit s. They comprise over two dozen SEALs , plus Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewmen (SWCC), an Ordnance Disposal Technician (EOD), and three Divers (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). In November 2021, they sued President Biden, Secretary Austin, Secretary Del Toro, and the DoD (collectively, \"Defendants\"), challenging the Navy's COVID -19 vaccine policies, on their face and as applied, under the Religious Case: U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb et seq. , and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.2 Shortly t hereafter , Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. The district court held a hearing at which Plaintiffs presented live testimony and other evidence . We describe in detail the relevant evidence in the record and the district court's factual findin gs. i. As of November 2021, 99.4% of active- duty Navy service members had been fully vaccinated against COVID -19. Before and after vaccines became available, several Plaintiffs deployed overseas and completed missions, while others served as instructors in training commands. Operations continued without issue, as many Plaintiffs practiced mitigation techniques \u2014social distancing, testing, quarantining, etc. Defendants identif y no instance where a Plaintiff 's vaccination status \u2014or any service member's vaccination status \u2014compromised a special warfare mission. The Navy follows a six -phase, 50-step process to adjudicate r eligious accommodation requests. 3 During the first 13 steps, staff members verify the required documents submitted with the request. At steps 14 and 15, staff members add the requesting service member's personal information to a \"disapproval template\" form. There apparently is no approval template. At 2 Plaintiffs initially brought their claims against Secretaries Austin and Del Toro in both their individual and official capacities. And they also asserted claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701- 06. They have, however, since filed an amended complaint against the remaining individual Defendants in their official capacities alone without bringing any APA claims. President Biden is not named in the amended complaint. 3 See Deputy Chi ef of Naval Operations Standard Operating Procedure for Religious Accommodations (dated Nov. 2021). 7 step 33, staff members transmit an internal memorandum to Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, requesting that he \"sign . . . letters disapproving immunization waiver requests based on sincerely held religious be liefs.\" At steps 35 to 38, staff members review the accommodation request and list details in a spreadsheet with other requests for Vice Admiral Nowell to review. But by then, the disapproval is fully teed -up: the disapproval letter has been written; the disapproval and religious accommodation request has been packaged with similar requests, and the internal memorandum to Vice Admiral Nowell requesting disapproval has been drafted. In December 2021, the Navy reported receiving 2,844 requests for religious accommodations. A more recent report suggests that more than 4,000 active duty and Navy Reserve sailors have submitted such requests. The Navy has denied them all. Indeed, during the last seven years, the Navy has not granted a single religious exemption from any vaccination. Yet, with respect to the COVID -19 vaccine, it has approved at least \"10 permanent medical exemptions, 259 temporary medical exemptions, and 59 administrative exemptions for active duty sailors, along with seven temporary medical exemptions and 24 administrative exemptions for Navy Reserve sailors.\" At least 17 of the 259 temporary medical exemptions were granted to service members assigned to Naval Special W arfare. ii. Plaintiffs represent various Christian denominations within the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant Churches. They \"each object to receiving a COVID -19 vaccination based on their sincerely held religious beliefs.\"4 Plaintiff s each file d a request for a religious accommodation, which describe s his or her sincere religious beliefs and the substantial burden placed on them by the Navy's vaccine mandate. Many are supported by chaplain s' memoranda confirming the basis and sincerity of Plain tiffs' beliefs and positions with respect to the COVID- 19 vaccine. For purposes of this litigation, Plaintiffs also filed declarations, confirming their religious beliefs and emphasizing that they do not object to undertaking COVID -19 mitigation measures such as masking, social distancing, and regular testing. and their experiences during the accommodation -request process. The declarations also describe their experiences during the religious accommodation process. V arious command ers told several Plaintiffs that they risked losing their special warfare device , the SEAL Trident , if they requested a religious accommodation. Many were also declared \"medically disqualified,\" or \"non -deployable,\" simply as a result of submitting their requests. Many P laintiffs have also become ineligible for travel, transfer to other posts including trainings, and advancement in leadership simply because they are unvaccinated and have requested religious accommodations. For example, U.S. Navy S EAL 13 was removed from his leadership position, setting him back at least two years in progressing to the next rank. And U.S. Navy Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewman 1 was denied training and told by a commander that \"the Navy does not want to 4 Their objections include, inter alia , the vaccines' ties to aborted fetal cell lines, divine instruction not to receive the vaccine, and the mRNA vaccines' altering the divine creation of their body by unnaturally inducing production of spike 9 spend additional money training someone it is going to lose.\" Plaintiffs suggest that if the Navy discharges them and seeks recoupment of their training and education costs, those expenses could exceed one million dollars each. Plaintiffs claim their accommodation requests are futile because denial is a predetermined outcome. U.S. Navy S EAL 2's chain of command advised him that \"all religious accommodation requests will be denied,\" because \"senior leadership . . . has no patience or tolerance for service members who refuse COVID -19 v accination for religious reasons and want them out of the SEAL community,\" and that \"even if a legal challenge is somehow successful, the senior leadership of Naval Special Warfare will remove [his] special warfare designation.\" U.S. Navy S EAL 5 averred that \"[n]umerous comments from [his] chain of command indicate [d] . . . that there [would] be a blanket denial of all religious accommodation requests regarding COVID -19 vaccination.\" US Navy S EAL 8 averred that his \"chain of command . . . made it clear that request be approved and . . . provided [him] with information on how to prepared for separation from the U.S. Navy.\" U.S. Navy S EAL 11 declared that during a chief's meeting, his command master chief told him that \"anyone not receiving the COVID -19 vaccine is an 'acceptable loss' to the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) community\" and the \"legal department used language such as 'when they get denied,' not 'if they get denied.'\" iii. Three Plaintiffs testified at the preliminary injunction hearing. First , U.S. Navy S EAL 3 is stationed as an instructor for a medical training course in Mississippi. His missions and duties have been accomplished successfully since 2020 notwithstanding COVID -19. His chaplain supported his request for re ligious accommodation, and his commanding officer recommended 10 approval. In doing so, his commanding officer explained that \"[t]he training environment [of the command] often requires close quarters contact for prolonged periods of time, however, successfu l mitigation measures have been implemented since the onset of COVID -19 to ensure the safety of the staff and students.\" Further, \" [t]he cumulative impact of repeated accommodations of religious practices of a similar nature would mean my command is still able to safely accomplish its mission and protect the health and safety of its members\" (emphasis added). While his request was pending, U.S. Navy S EAL 3 was removed from his duty as an instructor to prepare for separation. As U.S. Navy S EAL 3's request moved up the chain of command, the Commander of Naval Special Warfare recommended disapproval without explanation. The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations then formally disapproved his request. He explained in generic terms that U.S. Navy S EAL 3 wo uld \"inevitably be expected to live and work in close proximity with [his] shipmates ,\" and disapproval was \"the least restrictive means available to preserve the [DoD's] compelling interest in military readiness, mission accomplishment and the health and safety of military Service Members.\" The disapproval offered no explanation specific to U.S. Navy S EAL 3's request. Second , U.S. Navy S EAL 2 is also stationed as an instructor for a special operations tactical program in Mississippi. He explained that teams around the country have deployed and were \"able to successfully accomplish their mission on those deployments through other mitigation tactics with respect to COVID -19 before the vaccine.\" And his specific training command has successfully accomplished its missions notwithstanding COVID -19. Navy S EAL 2's chaplain and two Catholic bishops supported his accommodation request. His commanding officer also recommended approval, for the same reasons stated in U.S. Navy S EAL 3's recommended approval. But the Commander of Naval Special Warfare recommended disapproval without explanation \u2014as he did for U.S. Navy S EAL 3. The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations subsequently disapproved U.S. Navy SEAL 2's request using the same boilerplate disapproval form with no information specific to his request. U.S. Navy S EAL 2 testified that he had \"seen a number of these denial letters\" and \"[e]very one of them [he has] seen [is] identical.\" His appeal remains pending. U.S. Navy S EAL 2 testified to adverse actions taken against unvaccinated service members requesting religious accommodations. He explained that \"personnel from different commands have been relieved of their milestone positions that, you know, essentially railroad their careers.\" Further, service members \"have been pulled from their commands ,\" which can set their careers back two or three years, and \"been made to do menial labor tasks, cleaners, sweeping clean grounds, in a temporary assigned duty from their actual parent command.\" Third , U.S. Navy EOD Technician 1 testified that he deployed to South Korea in support of a special operations command in early 2020 during a significant COVID -19 outbreak. His team completed 76 joint service engagements with 21 different U.S. and Korean partner forces, all w hile maintaining effective COVID -19 mitigation tactics in compliance with CDC guidelines. He even received a deployment joint service accommodation medal from the special operations command in Korea for COVID-19 mitigation. U.S. Navy EOD Technician 1 met with his superiors to discuss his religious accommodation request and his commanding officer's position, 12 which was to deny it. They told him that if he received an accommodation, \"they probably could not find a place for [him] within the community as a senior enlisted member.\" He believes he \"was being coerced into receiving the vaccine.\" They asked, \"with [his] religious beliefs, if [he] thought that martyrs would be remembered .\" The Commanding Officer of the Naval School EOD recommended disapproval of U.S. Navy EOD Technician 1's request, explaining that his \"reluctance to obtain vaccination has the potential to create total force health ramifications\" due to his \"close quarters, hands- on training that cannot be mitigated with COVID -19 protocols.\" With out a fully vaccinated staff and student population, the recommendation explained, the unit \"risk[ed] not being able to fully execute its mission.\" The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations subsequently disapproved the accommodation request on the same boilerplate form used to disapprove the requests of U.S. Navy S EAL s 2 and 3. iv. Following the hearing, the district court preliminarily enjoined Secretary Austin, Secretary Del Toro, and the DoD from \"applying Seals -cv-01236- *14 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 3, 2022) (O'Connor, J.). It further enjoined those Defendants \"from taking any adverse action against Plaintiffs on the basis of Plaintiffs' requests for religious accommodation.\" Id . The court excused Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust military remedies as futile, finding the Navy's religious accommodation process is \"an empty formality\" because \"the denial of each request is 5 The district court also dismissed President Biden from the suit. Case: Id. at *4; see also id. at *1 (describing process as \"theater\" and finding the Navy \"rubber stamps each denial\"); id. at *5 (\"[T]he Plaintiffs' requests are denied the moment they begin.\"). As to Plaintiffs' likelihood of success on their RFRA claims,6 the court found that Defendants could not show a compelling interest in vaccinating Plaintiffs because the religious accommodation process lacks \"individualized assessment\" and is underinclusive, \"includ[ing] carveouts for those participating in clinical trials and those with medical contraindications and allergies to vaccines,\" but not those with religious objections. Id. at *10. Defendants filed a timely interlocutory appeal. After the preliminary injunction took effect, the Navy formally denied U.S. Navy S EAL 16's appeal of his initially rejected religious accommodation request. The denial appears to be a boilerplate letter , mentioning nothing specific about S EAL 16's request. Plaintiffs submit that \"SEAL 24 has yet to receive his denial, but his command informed him that his appeal was denied on February 11. \" v. Defendants moved the district court to stay the preliminary injunction \"to the extent the order precludes Defendants from making the assignment and reassignment decisions that the military deems appropriate, taking into account Plaintiffs' vaccination status, including with respect to deployment and training.\" The court denied the motion , but i t clarifie d that the preliminary injunction : 6 The district court also concluded that the Defendants' actions violated the Plaintiffs' First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. We need not review that portion of the district court's ruling. not require[] Defendants to make any particular personnel assignments. All strategic decisions remain in the hands of the Navy. Rather, the preliminary injunction simply prohibits adverse action against Plaintiffs based on their requests for religious accommodation. This Court will not\u2014 and cannot \u2014require the Navy to place a particular SEAL in a particular training program. But it can \u2014and must \u2014prevent the Navy from taking punitive action against that SEAL by blocking him from the training program he would otherwise attend. Defendants subsequently moved this court to partially stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal \"insofar as it precludes the Navy from considering plaintiffs' vaccination status in making deplo yment, assignment, and other operational decisions.\" 7 They maintain that \"[f]orcing the Navy to deploy plaintiffs while they are unvaccinated threatens the success of critical missions and needlessly endangers the health and safety of other service members.\" II. Discussion \"Before addressing the merits, we must be sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under Article III.\" Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , 561 U.S. 1, 1 5, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 2717 (2010). If it is not, our inquiry will end. If it is, then we must consider whether Defendants have satisfied the four factors required to grant a stay pending appeal. See Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 426, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 1756 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill , 481 U.S. 7 While the interlocutory appeal and emergency motion have been pending in this court, proceedings in the district court continue. Plaintiffs sought class certification and moved for a class -wide preliminary injunction . They also sought a show cause order, arguing that \"Defendants are disregarding and willfully violating [the preliminary injunction] by continuing to apply the same policies and continuing to impose the same injuries on Plaintiffs that initially warranted injunctive relief[.]\" Defendants have meanwhile moved to dismiss or, alternatively, transfer venue. Case: 107 2113, 2119 (1987)). Th is dispute is justiciable. But Defendants have not carried their burden to warrant the issuance of a stay. A. Congress rendered justiciable Plaintiffs' claims under RFRA, which applies to every \"branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States[.]\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb -2(1). RFRA, in turn, sets the standards binding every department of the United States to recognize and accommodate sincerely held religious beliefs. It undo ubtedly \"applies in the military context.\" United States v. Sterling , 75 M.J. 407, 410 (C.A.A.F. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2212 (2017). This makes sense because service members \"experience increased needs for religion as the result of being uproote d from their home environments, transported often thousands of miles to territories entirely strange to them, and confronted there with new stresses that would not otherwise have been encountered if they had remained at home. \" Katcoff v. Marsh , 755 F.2d 223, 227 (2nd Cir. 1985). Federal courts are th erefore empowered to adjudicate RFRA's application to these Plaintiffs. Notwithstanding RFRA's broad scope, the district court below, as well as other courts, have believed themselves bound by a judicial abste ntion doctrine created in Mindes v. Seaman , 453 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1971) . In that case, the court sought to identify situations in which federal courts, faced with claims implicating internal military affairs, must withhold adjudication in favor of military decision -making . Mindes abstention is rooted in the federal common law principle of \" comity .\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 199 . But i t is likely that, following RFRA's enactment, based on no longer permissible.8 RFRA \"operates as a kind of super statute, displacing the normal operation of other federal law s[.]\" Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 175 4 (2020) . It would not be a stretch to conclude that RFRA must also displace a judge- created abstention doctrine . \"[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an unusual exercise of lawmaking by federal courts disappears.\" City of Milwaukee v. Illinois , 451 U.S. 304, 314, 101 S. Ct. 1784, 1791 (1981). In an abundance of caution and deferring to circuit precedent, however, we consider whether Mindes abstention ought to apply here. Mindes requires courts to \"examine the substance of [a plaintiff's] allegation [implicating internal military affairs] in light of the policy reasons behind nonreview of military matters.\" 9 453 F.2d at 201. In doing so, court s must first determine whether \"[t]he plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of consti tutional rights or that the military violated statutes or its own regulations[.]\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201). Courts must next assess whether the plaintiff has exhaust ed all available intra -service corrective measures. Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. If the plaintiff satisfie s both criteria, then the court considers a series of factors , which amount to a synopsis of pre -Mendes case 8 A respected treatise disagrees with Mindes on other grounds, stating that \"[t] here is nothing in the power of Congress to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, nor in the powers of the President as commander in chief, that ousts the power of courts to protect the constitutional rights of individuals against improper military actions.\" 13C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller , Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2942 n.80 (3d ed. Apr. 2021 update). 9 Among a number of reasons for imposing an exhaustion requirement, the court stated that \"the greatest reluctance to accord judicial review [of internal military affairs] has stemmed from the proper concern that such review might stultify the military in the performance of its vital mission.\" Id . at law that had adjudicated claims arising from military service : (1) \"[t]he nature and strength of the plaintiff's challenge to the military determination [;]\" (2) \"[t]he potential injury to the plaintiff if review is refused [;]\" (3) \"[t]he type and degree of anticipated interference with the militar y function [;]\" and (4) \"[t]he extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion is involved .\" Id. at 201 -02. i. Plaintiffs satisfy the first threshold Mendes inquiry because they allege constitutional violations of the First Amendment and RFRA, which \"secures Congress' view of the right to free exercise under the First Amendment[.]\" Tanzin v. Tanvir , 141 S. Ct. 486, 489 (2020) . With respect to the second inquiry , this court has held that \" [i]n the military context, the exhaustion requirement promotes the efficient operation of the military 's judicial and administrative systems, allowing the military an opportunity to fully exercise its own expertise and discretion prior to any civilian court review.\" Von Hoffburg v. Alexander , 615 F.2d 633, 637 - 38 (5th Cir. 1980) (citing Hodges v. Callaway, 499 F.2d 417 (5th Cir. 1974)). Nonetheless, exhaustion is unnecessary if, inter alia , the administrative remedy is futile and plaintiffs raise substantial constitutional claims. Id. at 638 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs are exempted from exhaust ing their administrative remedies for both of these reasons . 10 The Navy has not accommodated any religious request to abstain from any vaccination in seven years, and to date it has denied all religiously based claims for exemption from COVID -19 10 The two Plaintiffs whose appeals have been finally adjudicated require no such exemption, so this analysis only pertains to the 33 who have not received any final determinations. vaccination . It is true that futility is not a function of the likely ultimate success of administrative exhaustion . But evidence, recited previously and not meaningfully challenged here, suggests that the Navy has effectively stacked the deck against even those exemptions supported by Plaintiffs' immediate commanding officers and military chaplains . This is sufficiently probative of futility.11 Further, as explained more fully below, Plaintiff s raise substantial , legally clear -cut questions under RFRA. Courts are specifically equipped to address RFRA claims and, by the same token, the issues are less suitable for administrative adjudication . Plaintiffs have thus satisfied the threshold criteria required by Mindes . But a final justiciability determination depends on considering the four additional Mindes points . ii. The district court determined that each of the four additional Mindes consider ations favor s justiciability. We agree. The constitutional underpinnings an d meri t of Plaintiffs' claims weigh in favor of granting judicial review . Constitutional claims are \" normally more important than those having only a statutory or regulatory base[.]\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. Indeed, this court has favorably cited the Ninth Circuit's determination that \"[r]esolving a claim founded solely upon a constitutional right is singularly suited to a judicial forum and clearly inappropriate to an administrative board.\" Downen v. Warner , 481 F.2d 642, 643 ; , 615 F.2d at 638 (citing Downen , 11 Unlike in this case, the Marines in Church v. Biden \"advanced no argument or evidence demonstrating that obtaining review of any future discipline or removal pursuant to ordinary military review procedures would be futile or inadequate.\" 2021 WL 5179215 , at *11. Similarly, the court in Robert v. Austin , found that \"Plaintiffs' contention that they may be subject to discipline for refusing to take a vaccine appear [ed] to be based on nothing more than speculation. \" 2022 WL 103374, at *3. Plaintiffs here have done the so when a plaintiff's c laims are \"founded on infringement of specific constitutional NeSmith v. Fulton , 615 F.2d 196, 201 -02 (5th Cir. 1980) (citations omitted). Plaintiffs allege specific, and far from frivolous, violations of their f ree exercise rights under both the First Amendment and RFRA. Thus, the nature and strength of Plaintiffs' claims weigh in favor of judicial resolution. Plaintiffs also face irreparable harm if judicial review is denied . \"In general, a harm is irreparable where there is no adequate remedy at law, such as monetary damages.\" Janvey v. Alguire , 647 F.3d 585, 600 (5th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs Miss. , 697 F.3d 279, 295 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S. Ct. 2673, 2690 (1976) (plurality opinion) ). \"This principle applies with equal force to the violation of [RFRA] rights because [R FRA] enforces First Amendment freedoms, and the statute requires courts to construe it broadly to protect religious exercise.\" 12 Id.

By pitting their consciences against their livelihoods, the vaccine requirements would crush Plaintiffs' free exercise of religio n. 12 Opulent Life Church i nvolved claims under Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons as 374 U.S. 398, Ct. 1868, 1922 (2021) (Barrett, J., concurring) ; see also Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , 573 U.S. 682, 69 5, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2761 (2014) (citation omitted) (RLUIPA \" imposes the same general test as RFRA but on a more limited category of governmental actions. \"). Case: The mos t problematic of the Mindes considerations is whether judicial review of Plaintiffs' claims would seriously impede the Navy 's performance of its vital duties. Because \"there will always be some interference when review is granted ,\" courts ought to abstain only where \"the interference would be such as to seriously impede the military in the performance of vital dutie s[.]\" Mindes, 453 F.2d at 201. We are aware of the Navy's general objection that federal court resolution of these claims \"cause[s] direct an d immediate impact to mission execution.\"13 But the Navy acknowledges that it has granted hundreds of medical exemptions from the COVID -19 vaccine , at least 17 of which were temporary medical exemptions for those in Naval Special Warfare . 14 Only 35 Plaintiffs seek religious accommodations here. And \"5,035 active component and 2,960 Ready Reserve sailors\" remained unvaccinated as of January 27, 2022. It is therefore \"illogical . . . that Plaintiff[s'] religious -based refusal to take a COVID -19 vaccine would 'seriously impede' military function when the [Navy] has [over 5,000] service members still on duty who are just as unvaccinated as [the Plaintiffs ].\" 15 Air Force Officer , 2022 WL 468799, at *7. In fact, Vice Admiral 13 The commanding officer of two Plaintiffs, however, averred that \"the cumulative impact of repeated accommodations of religious practices . . . would mean [his] command is still able to safely accomplish its mission and protect the health and safety of its members.\" 14 The Navy's willingness to grant hundreds of medical exemptions undermines its reliance on decisions like Goldman v. Weinberger , 475 U.S. 503, 106 S. Ct. 1310 (1986), abrogated by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 774(a)- (b). The Goldman court held that \"the First Amendment does not require the military to accommodate [wearing a yarmulke] in the face of its view that they would detract from the uniformity sought by the dress regulations. \" Id . at 475 U.S. at 509 -10, 106 S. Ct. at 1314. The Navy is currently 99.4% uniform in its COVID - 19 vaccination status. To the extent that the remaining 0.6% are not uniform, the exemptions granted by the Navy belie its insistence on uniformity in this case. 15 The Navy had formally dis charged 45 sailors for refusing the COVID -19 vaccine as of January 27, Merz recently observ ed th at during operations conducted with fully vaccinated personnel, the Omicron variant in particular is \" coming and going all the time, [in] very small numbers, and [with] really no operational impact[.] \"16 Significantly , the Navy recently aligned its testing and isolation guidelines with updated , looser CDC protocols, which recommend isolation for those who test positive only \" for five days or until symptoms have cleared, depending on which is longer. \" Such individuals then only have to \"wear a mask for an additional five days.\" Thus , \"Navy teams are [] very, very attuned to watching their indications and reacting to [the virus ].\"17 Finally, the extent to which military expertise or discretion is involved does not militate against judicial review. \"Courts should defer to the superior knowledge and experience of professionals in matters such as promotions or orders directly related to specific military functions.\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201 -02. To be sure, \"[t]he complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments[.]\" Gilligan v. Morgan , 413 U.S. 1, 10, 93 S. Ct. 2440, 2446 (1973) The Navy may permissibly classify any number of Plaintiffs as deployable or non -deployable for a wide variety of reasons . But if the Navy's plan is to ignore RFRA's protections, as it seems to be on the record before us , courts must intervene because 16 Defendants insist that this quotation is taken out of context. But the \"context\" they emphasize is based on the article's summary of Admiral Merz's sentiments, not the words of Admiral Merz himself. We rely on the admiral's quoted words. 17 Also noteworthy concerning the comparative efficacy of vaccination is that the USS Milwaukee was \"sidelined\" in December 2021 by a COVID -19 outbreak despite having a fully vaccinated crew; and over 15 members of one Plaintiff's entirely vaccinated detachment contracted, or were exposed to , COVID -19 during a training \u2014especially when it comes to nuanced constitutional issues.\"18 Air Force Officer , Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable. B. When considering whether to grant a stay pending appeal, a court must consider: o First , whether the stay applicants have made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits; o Second , whether the applicants will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; o Third , whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties; and o Fourth , where the public interest lies. Nken , 556 U.S. at 426, 129 S. Ct. 17 56 (quoting Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776, 107 S. Ct. at 2119 ). The first two factors \"are the most critical.\" Id. at 43 4. i. Defendants argue that they are likely to prevail because Plaintiffs ' claims are non -justiciable and otherwise lack merit. But we reject non - justiciability , and the district court painstakingly explained why, at a minimum, their RFRA claims are meritorious. We elaborate on the district court's reasoning. As the Supreme Court has noted, RFRA affords even \"greater protection for religious exercise than is available under the First Amendment[]\" and provides that the: 18 Judge Tilman E. Self III is a former Army artillery officer. Id . at Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person \u2014(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. Holt v. Hobbs , 574 U.S. 352, 357, 135 S. 'exercise of religion' often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts[.]\" Employment Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 877, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 1599 (1990). And \"a government action or regulation c reates a 'substantial burden' on a religious exercise if it truly pressures the adherent to significantly modify his religious behavior and significantly violates his religious beliefs. \" Adkins v. Kaspar , 393 F.3d 559, 570 (5th Cir. 2004) (involving RLUIP A). Once a plaintiff demonstrates a substantial burden on his exercise of religion, \"RFRA requires the G overnment to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law 'to the person' \u2014the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.\" Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do (2006) 2000bb -1(b)). This is a \"high bar .\" Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania , 140 S. Ct. 2367, 239 2 (2020 ) (Alito, J., concurring). This already high bar is raised even higher \"[w]here a regulation already provides an exception from the law for a particular group [.]\" McAllen Grace Brethren Church v. Salazar , 764 F.3d 465, 472 (5th Cir. 2014) (citations omitted) ; see also Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1878 -83. The Navy does not even dispute that its COVID -19 vaccination requirements substantially burden each Plaintiff's free exercise of religion , but the nature of the injury bears emphasis. Plaintiffs have thoughtfully articulated their sincere religious objections to taking the vaccine itself . Accepting the vaccine would directly burden their respective faiths by forcing Case: 24 them to inject an un removable substance at odds with their most profound convictions. This injury would outlast their military service, making the decision whether to acquie sce far more difficult than just choosing between \"their job(s) and their jab(s).\" BST Holdings , 17 F.4th at 618. The vaccine requirements principally compet e against their faith s and secondarily against their livelihoods. Th ese circumstances impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs . See Little Sisters of the Poor , 140 S. Ct. at 2391 (c ontraceptive mandate impose d a substantial burden on employer s that had religious objection s to contraceptive s and believed that complying would make them complicit in the provision of contraceptive s); see also Holt , 574 U.S. at 361, 135 S. Ct. at (a grooming \"substantially burden[ed] n[]\" for contravening that policy) . In an attempt to subordinate Plaintiffs' protected interest , the Navy focuses instead on its institutional interests. Defendants ' position is that: The Navy has an extraordinarily compelling interest in requiring that s ervice members generally \u2014and these plaintiffs in particular \u2014be vaccinated against COVID- 19, both (1) to reduce the risk that they become seriously ill and jeopardize the success of critical missions and (2) to protect the health of their fellow service mem bers. The N avy has been extraordinarily successful in vaccinating service members , as at least 99.4% of whom are vaccinated. 19 But t hat general interest is nevertheless insufficient under RFRA. The Navy must instead \"scrutinize [] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants .\" O Centro , 546 U.S., at 431, 126 S. Ct. at 1220. \"T he 19 As the district court explained in denying Defendants' stay motion, s tatistically speaking, \" vaccinated servicemembers are far more likely to encounter other unvaccinated individuals off -base among the general public than among their then, is not whether [the Navy has] a compelling interest in enforcing its [vaccination] policies generally, but whether it has such an interest in denying an exception to [each Plaintiff] .\" Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1881 . And RFRA \"demands much more[]\" than deferring to \"officials' mere say -so that they could not 135 Ct. at 866 (RLUIPA context). That is because \"only the gravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, give occasion for permissible limitation []\" on the free exercise of religion. Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 1790 , 1795 (1963 ) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted ).20 Defendants have not demonstrated \"paramount interests\" that justify vaccinating these 35 Plaintiffs against COVID -19 in violation of their religious beliefs. Th ey insist that \"given the small units and remote locations in which special- operations forces typically operate, military commanders have determined that unvaccinated service members are at significantly higher risk of becoming severely ill from COVID -19 a nd are therefore medically unqualified to deploy.\" But \"[r]outine [Naval Special Warfare] mission risks include everything from gunshot wounds, blast injuries, parachute accidents, dive injuries, aircraft emergencies, and vehicle rollovers to animal bites, swimming or diving in polluted waters, and breathing toxic chemical fumes.\" There is no evidence that the Navy has evacuated anyone from such missions due to COVID -19 since it instituted the vaccine mandate, but Plaintiffs engage in life -threatening actions that may create risks of equal or greater magnitude than the virus. 20 Sherbert , of course, formed the foundation for RFRA. See Fulton, 141 S. Ct. More specifically, m ultiple Plaintiffs successfully deployed overseas before and after the vaccine became available, and one even received a Joint Service Commendation Medal for \"safely navigating restricted movement and distancing requirements\" while deployed in South Korea between January and June 2020.21 Plaintiffs also trained other SEALs preparing for deployments at various points during the pandemic while remaining unvaccinated . The Navy's alleged compelling interest is further undermined by other salient facts. It has granted temporary medical exemptions to 17 Special Warfare members , yet no reason is given for differentiating those service members from Plaintiffs. That renders the vaccine requirements \"underinclusive.\" Navy Seals 1 is often regarded as a telltale sign that the government 's interest in enacting a liberty -restraining pronouncement is not in fact 'compelling.' \" BST Holdings , 17 F.4th at 616 (citing Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 520, 542 -46, 113 2231 -34(1993)); See also Holt 367, 135 S. Ct. at 865 (RLUIPA context) (a policy was substantially underinclusive where a prison \"denied petitioner's request to grow a 1/2- inch beard [for religious reasons] [while permitting] prisoners with a dermatological condition to grow 1/4 - inch beards.\"). Moreover, in none of the letters denying religious accommodations to these Plaintiffs has the Navy articulated Plaintiff -specific reasons for its decisions. 22 Further evidencing that there is a pattern of 21 During this deployment, Navy EOD Technician 1 completed 76 joint service engagements with 21 U.S. and Korean partner forces, all while maintaining effective COVID -19 mitigation tactics in compliance with CDC guidelines. 22 On the contrary, some of the remarks uttered by superior officers to Plaintiffs could be regarded as outright hostile to their desire for religious accommodations. See Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n for RFRA rights rather than individualized consideration of Plaintiffs' requests, the Navy admits it has not granted a single religious accommodation. Yet surely, had the Navy been conscientiously adhering to RFRA, it could have adopted least restrictive means to accommodate religious objections against forced vaccinations, for instance, to benef it personnel working from desks, warehouses, or remote locations . Considering the record as a whole, we agree with the district court that Defendants have not shown a compelling interest to deny religious accommodations to each of these 35 Plaintiffs. Indeed, t he \"marginal interest\" in vaccinating each Plaintiff appears to be negligible ; consequently, Defendants lack a sufficiently compelling interest to vaccinate Plaintiffs. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S. at 727, 134 S. Ct. at 2779 (citing O Centro, 546 U.S. at 431, 126 S. Ct.at 1220 -21). In the absence of a compelling interest, the first Nken factor weighs against granting the requested partial stay. ii. Defendants also contend that \"[b]y requiring the Navy to disregard plaintiffs' unvaccinated status in making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions, the preliminary injunction irreparably damages the Navy and the public.\" We disagree. Despite their concerns, D efendants do not face irreparabl e harm in the absence of a stay . \"[B]ecause the Government has requested a stay pending completion of appellate proceedings, the relevant question is whether the Government will be irreparably harmed during the pendency of the appeal .\" State v. Biden , 10 F.4th 538, 559 (5th Cir. 2021) (emphasis in original). Defendants emphasize that the Navy \"must deploy only service members who are at the least risk of becoming severely ill, leaving their units shorthanded and potentially unable to complete missions.\" In any event, district court clarified that the preliminary injunction \"simply prohibits adverse action against Plaintiffs based on their requests for religious accommodation.\" Defendants therefore remain able to make decisions based on other neutral factors. And \"[e]ven if [Defendants are] correct that long -term compliance with the district court's injunction would cause irreparable harm, [they] present[] no reason to think that [they] cannot comply with the district court's [injunction] while the appeal proceeds.\" 23 Biden, 10 F.4th at 559. iii. Partially staying the preliminary injunction pending appeal would substantially harm Plaintiffs . As we noted , Plaintiffs' First Amendment freedoms are seriously infringed by the Navy's vaccine requirements . See BST Holdings , 17 F.4th 618; see Holt 574 U.S. at 361, 135 S. Ct. at 862; Little Sisters of the Poor , 140 S. Ct. at 2391. These infringements \"unquestionably constitute .\" Life Church , 697 F.3d at 295 (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373, 96 S. Ct. at 2690). No further showing is ne cessary for Plaintiffs to demonstrate that even partially staying the injunction would irreparably harm them. iv. The issuance of Defendants' requested stay would also disserve the public interest. Defendants contend that \"[i]n cases involving the government, the harm to the government and the public interest merge.\" 23 Any injury to Defendants is also \" outweighed by [Plaintiffs'] strong likelihood of success on the merits.\" Freedom From Religion Found., Inc. v. Mack , 4 F.4th 306, 316 (5th Cir. 2021) (collecting cases) . Relatedly, if the vaccine requirements violate Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights \u2014as they have demonstrated is likely at least under RFRA \u2014then the Navy's claimed harm \"is really 'no harm at all.'\" McDonald v. Long ley, 4 F.4th 229, 25 4 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Christian Legal Soc'y v. Walker , 453 That is mistaken. Th ose factors merge \"when the Government is the opposing party[,]\" i.e., when the government is not the party applying for a stay. Nken , 556 U.S. at 435, 129 S. Ct. 1762. Here the government Defendants are applying for a stay and Plaintiffs are the opposing party. The public interest factor is therefore distinct. At any rate, \"i njunctions protecting First Amendment freedoms are always in the public interest.\" Texans for Free Enter. v. Tex. Ethics Comm'n , 732 F.3d 535, 539 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Christian Legal Soc 'y, 453 F.3d at 859). III.

BIDEN, ., et al., \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 Defendants . \u00a7 ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect.1 Every president since the signing of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has praised the men and women of the mili tary for their bravery and service in protecting the freedoms this country guarantees.2 In this case, members of the military seek protection under those very freedoms. Thirty - five Navy Special Warfare servicemembers allege that the military's mandatory vaccination policy violates their religious freedoms under the First Amendment and Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Navy provides a religious accommodation process, but by all accounts, it is theater. The Navy has not granted a religious exemption t o any vaccine in recent memory . It merely rubber stamps each denial. The Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms 1 George Washington wrote in 1775 that \"When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen.\" Those words are carved into the marble of the Memorial Amphitheater in the Arlington National Cemetery. 2 See President William Clinton, Remarks at the V eterans Day National Ceremony (Nov. 11, 1999); President George W. Bush, Remarks at the Veterans Day Proclamation (Oct. 30, 2001); President Barack Obama, Remarks at the Veterans Day National Ceremony (Nov. 11, 2009); President Donald Trump, Remarks at the New York City Veterans Day Parade Address (Nov. 11, 2019); President Joseph Biden, Remarks at the National Veterans Day Observance (Nov. 11, 2021).

There is no COVID -19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution. Having considered the briefing, oral argument, relevant facts, and applicable law, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction should be and is hereby GRANTED . I. BACKGROUND This case arises from the United States Navy's mandatory COVID -19 vaccination policy . Plaintiffs are thirty -five Navy Special Warfare servicemembers, including SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewmen, Navy Divers, and an Explosive Ordinance Disposal Technician. Compl. 1, 8-9, ECF No. 1. Together, they sue President Biden, Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of the Navy Del Toro, and the United States Departme nt of Defense. A. Factual Background 1. The Navy's Vaccination Policy In August 2021, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") issued a vaccine mandate directing all DoD servicemembers to be vaccinated against COVID -19. Pls.' App. 146 -47, ECF No. 17. The Department of the Navy also implemented its own mandate requiring all active -duty Navy servicemembers to be fully vaccinated before November 28 or face the \"full range\" of disciplinary action . Pls.' App. 149 -50, ECF No. 17. For servicemembers assigned to Special Operations duty , the Navy's vaccination policy reads: [Special Operations] personnel refusing to receive recommended vaccines . . . based solely on personal or religious beliefs are disqualified. This provision does not pertain to medical contraind ications or allergies to vaccine administration. 3 Before the Court are the Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 15), filed November 24, 2021; Defendants' Response (ECF No. 43), filed December 10; and Plaintiffs' Reply (ECF No. 58), filed December 17. The Court held a hearing on the matter on December 20. ECF No. 61. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 2 of 26 PageID 2541Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 2 of 26 PageID 2541 32a 3 Manual 15-105(3)(n)(9); Pls.' App. 838, ECF No. 17. In addition to those with medical exemptions, \"[m]embers who are actively participating in COVID -19 clinical trials are exempted from mandatory vaccination\" until the trial concludes. Pls.' App. 149 -50, ECF No. 17. For those with pending religious exemption requests, being \"disqualified\" means becoming permanently nondeployable.4 Unlike those with medical exemptions and allergies to the vaccine, an unvaccinated servicemember seeking a religious exemption (the \"religious servicemember\") continues to be nondeployable , even if he receives the accommodation he requests . Pls.' App. 159 , 838 (Trident Order 12 - Mandatory Va ccination for COVID -19), ECF No. 17. To regain his \"deployable\" status, the religious servicemember must first receive his religious accommodation , and then seek a medical waiver under the Navy's MANMED . Defs.' App. 278 , ECF No. 44 -3. Each of these steps, by themselves, is monumental. Religious exemptions to the vaccine requirement are virtually non -existent. In the past seven years, the Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine requirement. Pls.' App. 295, ECF No. 17. 2. Plaintiffs' Religious Accommodations Requests By early November, 99.4% of active -duty Navy servicemembers had been fully vaccinated against COVID -19. Pls.' App. 284, ECF No. 17. Plaintiffs are part of the remaining 0.6%. Representing the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant branches of Christianity, Plaintiffs object to receiving the COVID -19 vaccine based on their religious beliefs. Id. These beliefs fall into the following categories : (1) opposition to abortion and the use of aborted fetal cell line s in 4 See Decl. of SEALs 1 -19, 21 -26, Pls.' App. 870 -5, EOD 1, App. 1016 -22; Decl. of ND 1 -3, App. 1004 -15.

See Davis v. Fort Bend Cnty. , 765 F.3d 480, 478 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing United States v. Ballard , 322 U.S. 78, 86 (1944)). Plaintiffs filed their religious accommodation requests as early as August and as late as December. See Supp. Decl. of SEALs, SWCC, EOD, ND, Supp. App. 1023 -1134. In many cases, the Plaintiffs' commanding officers recommended th eir requests be approved. See Supp. Decl. of SEAL 18, Supp. App. 1075 ; Hr'g Test. of SEAL 3 . Even so, as of December 17, the Navy has summarily denied at least twenty -nine of the thirty -five accommodations requests , the majority of which have been appealed . Supp. of SEALs, SWCC, EOD, ND, Supp. The Navy has made no final determinations on appea l. To adjudicate a religious accommodation request , the Navy uses a six -phase , fifty -step process. See Supp. Decl. of Andrew Stephens, Ex. 1, EC F No. 62. Although \"a ll requests for accommodation of religious practices are assessed on a case -by-case basis ,\" Phase 1 of the Navy guidance document instructs an administrator to update a prepared disapproval template with the requester's name and rank. Id. Based on this boilerplate rejection , Plaintiffs believe that this process is \"pre -determined\" and sidesteps the individualized review required by law . Id. 5 See Decl. of SEALs 1 -3, 5, 6, 8 -15, 17 -19, 21 -24, 26, App. 871 -84, 890 -97, 903 -37, 944 -72, 978 -80; Decl. of SWCC 1 -4, App. 1, App. 1016 -22; Decl. of ND 2, Ap p. 1009 -11. 6 See Decl. of SEAL 5, 9 -11, 13 -15, 18, 22, 25, 26, App. 890 -93, 909 -20, 926 -37, 948 -51, 961 -64, 974 - 80; Decl. of SWCC 1, 5, App. 982 -85, of EOD 1, App. 3, App. 1004 -07, 1013 -15. 7 See Decl. of SEAL 7 and 19, App. 899 -900, 954. 8 See Decl. of SEAL 13, App. 927; Decl. of EOD 1, App. 1018.

Procedural History On November 9, 2021, Plaintiff s filed this lawsuit challenging the Navy's vaccination mandate. See Compl. 38, ECF No. 1. In response to the Court's order for a status report, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 15), on November 24, 2021. Defendants respond ed on December 10. See Defs.' Resp., ECF No. 43. Plaintiffs filed their reply December 17. See Pls.' Reply, ECF No. 58. The parties presented evidence and arguments before the Court in a hearing on December 20. See ECF No. 61. Accordingly, the Motion is no w ripe for the Court's review. II. LEGAL STANDARD A preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary remedy\" and will be granted only if the movant s carry their burden on all four requirements. Nichols v. Alcatel USA, Inc. , 532 F.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir. 2008) . The Court may issue a preliminary injunction if the movant s establish (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable harm; (3) that the balance of hardships weighs in the movant s' favor; and (4) that the iss uance of the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest. See Daniels Health Health (5th also Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 . \"The decision to grant or deny a preliminary inju nction is discretionary with the district court.\" Miss. Power & Light Co. v.

ANALYSIS Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the vaccination policy , which they say violates RFRA and the First Amendment. Mot. 2, ECF No. 15; Pls.' Br. 2, ECF No. 16. They also assert that the Defendants' permanent medical -disqualification policy fails strict scrutiny. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not exhausted their intra -military rem edies and that their claims are nonjusticiable. Even if these claims are reviewable, Defendants argu e, a preliminary injunction would be inappropriate, because Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims. A. Jurisdiction and Reviewabilit y There are two threshold questions before the Court. The first is whether this Court has jurisdiction over the parties, and the second is whether Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable under the Mindes test. 1. Relief Against President Citing Newdow v. Roberts , Defendants argue this Court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the President. 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (\" With regard to the President, courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin him and have never submitted the President to declaratory relief .\" (citation omitted) ). \"[W] e cannot issue a declaratory judgment against the President. It is incompatible with his constitutional position that he be compelled personally to defend his executive actions before a court. \" Franklin v. Massachusetts , 505 U.S. 788, 827 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part). Defendants are correct . This Court has no declaratory or injunctive power against President Biden , and he is therefore DISMISSED as party to this case. 2. Justiciability Under Mindes Defendants also argue th at this case is nonjusticiable because Plaintiffs have not exhausted military remedies, and because they seek to have the Court intrude on internal military affairs. All Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 6 of 26 PageID 2545Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 6 of 26 PageID 2545 36a 7 Plaintiffs have submitted religious accommodation requests. The Navy has denied twenty -nine of those requests. It has granted none. Defendants say the Court must wait for the Navy to decide each request . As explained below , the record indicates the denial of each request is predetermined. As a result, Plaintiffs need not wait for the Navy to engage in an empty formality. In addition, whether the vaccine mandate violates Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights is a legal question well suited for the courts , not the Navy's administrative process . The Court finds that exhaustion is futile and will not provide complete relief , and therefore the case is justiciable. Generally, courts refrain from reviewing internal military affairs. The rationale is simple: \"[J]udges are not given the task of running the Army,\" or, in this case, the Navy. Orloff v. Willoughby , 345 U.S. 83, 93 (1953). Some military issues, however, are appropriate for judicial review. The Fifth Circuit has developed a test to determine whether a given military issue is justiciable , and appropriate for judicial review . That test f irst requires plaintiff s to pass a two -part threshold test by showing (1) \"an allegation of the deprivation of a constitutional right, or an allegation that the military has acted in violation of applicable statutes or its own regulations, \" and (2) \"exhaus tion of available intraservice corrective measures. \" Mindes v. Seaman , 453 F.2d 197, 201 (5th Cir. 1971). Then, if both criteria are met, the Court weighs four factors to determine whether the issue is justiciable: (1) the nature and strength of the plaint iffs' challenge; (2) the potential injury to the plaintiff s if review is refused; (3) the type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function; and (4) the extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion is involved. Id. at 201 -02. Before applying the Mindes test, the Court addresses Plaintiffs' argument that Mindes does not apply to RFRA. Plaintiffs suggest that applying Mindes here effectively reads an exhaustion Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 7 of 26 PageID 2546Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 7 of PageID 2546 37a 8 requirement into RFRA. See Pls.' Reply 7 -8, ECF No. 58. Pl aintiffs confuse statutory exhaustion and judge -made exhaustion. When a statute imposes an exhaustion requirement, \"Congress sets the rules.\" Ross v. Blake , 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016). Courts simply apply the text. They may not \"add unwritten limits \" or exce ptions to the statute's \" rigorous textual requirements .\" Id. If RFRA had an exhaustion requirement, the Court would apply it. But \"judge -made exhaustion doctrines,\" such as Mindes , are different. Id. The military exhaustion requirement in Mindes is a longs tanding prudential doctrine that applies to constitutional, statutory, and regulatory claims involving \"an 'internal military decision.'\" Meister 't, F.3d 332, 340 (5th Cir. 2000). The out -of-circuit cases Plaintiffs cite are unpersuasive . They discuss whether RFRA requires exhaustion,9 or whether certain RFRA claims satisfy prudential ripeness analysis.10 They do not analyze whether Mindes , a \"judicial abstention doctrine\" for military issues, applies to RFRA. Id. at 339. Plaintiffs challenge internal military decisions, so, in this Circuit, the Court must apply Mindes . a. The Two-Part Threshold Test Having determined that Mindes applies, the Court turns to the two -part threshold test. Defendants agree that Plaintiffs satisfy the first part \u2014they have alleged deprivation of their First Amendment rights and violations under RFRA. See Defs.' Resp. 24, ECF No. 43. The parties dispute the second par t\u2014whether Plaintiffs have exhausted their military remedies. The military exhaustion requirement is like other judge -made exhaustion doctrines. \"The major purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to prevent the courts from interfering with the 9 Singh v. Carter , 168 F. Supp. 3d 216, 226 (D.D.C. 2016) (\"RFRA certainly provides no textual support for the defendants' position that the plaintiff is required to exhau st administrative remedies . . . .\"). 10 Oklevueha Native Am. Church Inc. v. Holder , 676 F.3d 829, 838 (9th Cir. 2012) (declining \"to read an exhaustion requirement into RFRA\" for free exercise claims against the Drug Enforcement Administration). Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 8 of 26 PageID 2547Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 8 of 26 PageID 2547 38a 9 administrative process until it has reached a conclusion.\" Von Hoffburg v. Alexander , 615 F.2d 633, 637 (5th Cir. 1980). Military exhaustion is a matter of comity between the branches, \"to maintain the balance between military authority and the power of federal courts.\" Id. Application of the exhaustion requirement is therefore fact -intensive, requiring \" an understanding of its purposes and of the particular administrative scheme involved. \" McKart v. United States , 395 U.S. 185, 193 (1969). In contrast to statutory exhaus tion requirements, \"judge -made exhaustion doctrines, even if flatly stated at first, remain amenable to judge -made exceptions.\" Ross , 578 U.S. at 639. The Fifth Circuit has identified at least four such exceptions to military exhaustion: futility, inadequa cy of administrative remedies, irreparable injury, and a substantial constitutional question. Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 638. First , plaintiff s need not exhaust military remedies \"when resort to the administrative reviewing body would be futile.\" Hodges v. Callaway , 499 F.2d 417, 420 (5th Cir. 1974). They are required to exhaust only those remedies that would \"provide a real opportunity for adequate relief.\" Id. For example, exhaustion is \"obviously\" futile when the administrative body does not have the auth ority to grant the relief sought. Id. at 420 -21. In that situation, military relief is a legal impossibility. Similarly, exhaustion may be futile when military relief will not \" obviate the need for judicial review. \" Id. at 423. Although that \" is not usually a reason for bypassing \" the exhaust ion requirement, id., when the record all but compels the conclusion that the military process will deny relief, \" exhaustion is inapposite and unnecessary,\" id. at 420. The facts overwhelmingly indicate that the Navy will deny the religious accommodations. The Navy has denied twenty -nine of Plaintiffs' thirty -five accommodations requests.11 Outside of Plaintiffs' requests, the Navy has , to date , never granted a religious accommodation request for the 11 Supp. Decl. of SEALs, SWCC, EOD, ND, Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Page 9 of 26 PageID 2548Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page PageID 2548 39a 10 COVID -19 vaccine.12 In fact, in the past seven years, the Navy has never granted a single religious exemption for any vaccine.13 Several Plaintiffs have been directly told by their chains of command that \"the senior leadership of Naval Special Warfare has no patience or tolerance for service members who refuse COVID -19 vaccination for religious reasons and wants them out of the SEA L community.\"14 The Navy's accommodation process confirms those fears. The Navy uses a fifty -step process to adjudicate religious accommodation requests.15 Under the standard operating procedures for the process, the first fifteen steps require an adminis trator to update a prepared disapproval template with the requester's name and rank. In essence, the Plaintiffs' requests are denied the moment they begin. That prepared letter is then sent to seven offices for review. After those offices review the disapp roval letter, the administrator packages the letter with other religious accommodation requests for final signature. The administrator then prepares an internal memo to Vice Admiral John Nowell, asking him to \"sign . . . letters disapproving immunization waiver requests based on sincerely held religious beliefs.\"16 Then, at step thirty -five of the process, the administrator is told \u2014for the first time \u2014to read through the religious accommodation request. At that point, the disapproval letter has already been written, the religious accommodation request and related documents has already been reviewed by several offices, the disapproval has already been packaged with similar requests, and an internal memo has already been drafted requesting that Vice Admiral No well disapprove the religious accommodation request. The administrator is then tasked with reading the request and recording 12 Id. 13 Pls.' App. 295, ECF No. 17. 14 Id. at 879. 15 See Supp. Decl. of Andrew Stephens, Ex. 1, ECF No. 62. 16 See id.

At no point in the process is the administrator given the opportunity to recommend anyt hing other than disapproval. The materials are then sent to Vice Admiral Nowell. The entire process belies the manual's assertion that \"[e]ach request is evaluated on a case by case basis.\"17 Defendants argue that the process is not futile. They say, \" The fact that Plaintiffs may not anticipate a favorable outcome does not render the remedies futile .\" Defs.' Resp. 25, ECF No. 43. That dramatically understates the record. At the preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for Defendants suggested that exhaustion is not futile so long as the Navy has not denied the request. But that the Navy could hypothetically grant a request does not, on this record, \"provide a real opportunity for adequate relief.\" Hodges , 499 F.2d at 420. Plaintiffs need not exhaust military remedies when doing so would be futile . Second , plaintiff s need not exhaust military remedies when \"available administrative remedies are inadeq uate\" to grant him the relief he seeks. Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 640. The inadequacy exception and futility exception sometimes overlap. For example, \" an administrative remedy may be inadequate where the administrative body is shown to be biased or has ot herwise predetermined the issue before it. \" McCarthy v. Madigan , 503 U.S. 140 , 148 (1992). That the Navy has predetermined denial of the religious accommodations may indicate that the administrative process is both inadequate and futile. But the Fifth Circ uit has distinguished the two exceptions. See Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 640. That distinction is particularly salient here. Even if the religious accommodations are granted, Plaintiffs will not receive the relief they seek. Again, the record is replete wi th examples. Those who receive religious accommodations are still \"medically disqualified.\"18 That means Plaintiffs would be permanently barred from 17 See id. 18 Pls.' App. 159, 838, ECF No. 17. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 11 of 26 PageID 2550Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 11 of 26 PageID 2550 41a 12 deployment, denied the bonuses and incentive pay that accompany deployment, and deprived of the very reason they chose to serve in the Navy.19 By contrast, those receiving medical accommodations are not medically disqualified \u2014they receive equal status as those who are vaccinated.20 Some Plaintiffs were told by their chains of command that if their religious accommodation s were approved , they would lose their SEAL Tridents.21 Others will lose their Tridents merely for requesting the exemption.22 Evidently, even successfully exhausting the religious accommodation process would not grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek. In some instances, it may invite more harm. At best, the available remedies would accord Plaintiffs second -class status in a peerless community. Thus, t he available administrative remedies are inadequate. The Fifth Circuit has discussed two more exce ptions to the exhaustion requirement. These last two exceptions overlap somewhat with the first and second factors of the Mindes test, so the Court merely outlines them here. The third exception is that \"exhaustion is not required when the petitioner may s uffer irreparable injury if he is compelled to pursue his administrative remedies.\" Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 638. That resembles the second Mindes factor, which considers \"[t] he potential injury to the plaintiff if review is refused. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. The fourth exception to exhaustion is when \" the plaintiff has raised a substantial constitutional question. \" Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 638. That inquiry raises the same issues as the first Mindes factor, the \" nature and strength of the plaintiff 's challenge to the military determination ,\" which generally favors review of substantial constitutional questions. Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. The Court discusses these issues in greater detail in the next section. Here, the Court simply notes that to the exten t the analysis on 19 Id. at 928-29. 20 Id. at 159, 838. 21 E.g., id. at 906, 1021. 22 E.g., id. at 892, 900.

At least four recognized exceptions to the exhaustion requirement apply. If one is insufficient, the combination of the four re adily supports the Court's finding that the traditional justifications for military exhaustion are not served by the Navy's religious accommodation process. Plaintiffs have therefore satisfied parts one and two of the threshold Mindes test. b. The Four Minde s Factors Having passed the threshold test, Plaintiffs must next show that the four Mindes factors weigh in favor of justiciability. The factors are (1) the nature and strength of the plaintiff's challenge; (2) the potential injury to the plaintiff if revi ew is refused; (3) the type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function; and (4) the extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion is involved. Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201 -02. First , the nature and strength of Plaintiff s' claims weigh in favor of judicial review. As to the nature of the claim, \"[c]onstitutional claims [are] normally more important than those having only a statutory or regulatory base.\" Id. at 201 -02. But \"not all constitutional claims are to be weighed e qually.\" NeSmith v. Fulton , 615 F.2d 196, 201 (5th Cir. 1980). Courts tend to favor review of constitutional claims \"founded on infringement of specific constitutional rights, such as the Fifth Amendment privilege against self -incrimination or the First Am endment freedoms of speech and press,\" as opposed to constitutional claims that, for example, \" a serviceman 's due process rights were violated by arbitrary and capricious official action .\" Id. Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction based on specific violations of their constitutional rights under the Free Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 13 of 26 PageID 2552Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 13 of 26 PageID 2552 43a 14 Exercise Clause, plus similar violations of RFRA. Plaintiffs' claims are squarely in the category of claims most favorable to judicial review.23 Moreover, Plaintiffs' claims are strong. \" An obviously tenuous claim of any sort must be weighted in favor of declining review. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. The Court discusses the strength of Plaintiffs' claims in Section III.B as part of the preliminary injunction analysis. As a brief preview, the vaccine mand ate fails strict scrutiny. The mandate treats comparable secular activity (e.g., medical exemptions) more favorably than religious activity. First, the Navy has granted only secular exemptions \u2014it has never granted a religious exemption from the vaccine. Second, even if the Navy were to grant a religious exemption, that exemption would still receive less favorable treatment than its secular counterparts. Those who receive reli gious exemptions are medically disqualified. Those who receive medical exemptions are not. But the activity itself \u2014forgoing the vaccine \u2014is identical. Given the irrationality of the mandate, \"[i]t is unsurprising that such litigants are entitled to relief.\" Tandon v. Newsom curiam) . Under the first Mindes factor, the Plaintiffs have shown that the nature and strength of their claims weigh strongly in favor judicial review. Second , the potential injury to Plaintiffs if revie w is refused weighs in favor of judicial review. \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably 23 As mentioned in the previous section, that Plaintiffs raise substantial constitutional claims also warrants excusing the military exh austion requirement. See Von Hoffburg v. Alexander , 615 638 (5th Warner , 481 F.2d 642, 643 (9th Cir. 1973) (excusing administrative exhaustion because \"[r]esolving a claim founded solely upon a constitutional right is singularly suited to a judicial forum and clearly inappropriate to an administrative board\"); Roe v. Shanahan , 359 F. Supp. 3d 382, 403 (E.D.

Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion). This factor overlaps wit h the preliminary injunction analysis, so (again) the Court does not discuss it at length here. Two points bear mention. First, Plaintiffs are currently suffering injury while waiting for the Navy to adjudicate their requests. Plaintiffs have been declared nondeployable and suffer withheld promotions and travel.24 In one egregious example, Navy SEAL 26 was approved for a four-week program in Maryland to treat deployment -related traumatic brain injury.25 He told his commanding officer that he could travel in his own vehicle to the medical facility, which did not have a vaccine requirement for its patients. His commanding officer told him he was not allowed to travel because he was unvaccinated. SEAL 26 missed the opportunity to receive treatment, despite his pending religious accommodation request. Second, some Plaintiffs have suffered injury because they submitted religious accommodation requests. Many Plaintiffs have been told that merely requesting a religious accommodation will result in their removal from the Naval Special Warfare community and loss of their Trident.26 Withholding judicial review is particularly illogical when participation in the administrative process invites the very harm Plaintiffs seek to avoid. Third , the type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function weighs in favor of judicial review. \"[I] f the interference would be such as to seriously impede the military in the performance of vital duties, it militates strongly against relief. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. Defendants argue that judicial review would interfere with the military's decisions regarding duty assignments and medical fitness. See Defs.' Resp. 28 -30, ECF No. 43. But \"[i] nterference per se is insufficient since there will always be some interfer ence when review is granted .\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201.

The Navy already provides secular accommodations. Whether denying religious accommodations violates the First Amendment is a distinct legal question that would not \" seriously impede the military in the performance of vital duties .\" Id. Fourth , the extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion i s involved weighs in favor of review. \" Courts should defer to the superior knowledge and experience of professionals in matters such as promotions or orders directly related to specific military functions. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201 -02. This is not a suit in which \"commanding officers would have to stand prepared to convince a civilian court of the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions.\" United States v. Shearer , 473 U.S. 52, 58 (1985). Neither does this case involve \"complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force.\" Chappell v. Wallace , 462 U.S. 296, 302 (1983) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Whether the vaccine mandate passes muster under the Firs t Amendment and RFRA requires neither \" military expertise or discretion .\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. It is a purely legal question appropriate for judicial review. In sum, all four Mindes factors favor justiciability. To be sure, \"courts must \u2014at least initia lly\u2014indulge the optimistic presumption that the military will afford its members the protections vouchsafed by the Constitution, by the statutes, and by its own regulations.\" Hodges , 499 F.2d at 424. But they need not indulge that presumption to the point of absurdity. The record overwhelmingly demonstrates that the Navy's religious accommodation process is an exercise in futility. Plaintiffs need not wait for the Navy to rubber stamp a constitutional violation before 27 Id. at 284.

And this is pr ecisely the type of legal challenge that Mindes contemplates is appropriate for the courts to decide. Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable. B. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. Having established that Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable, the Court must consider the first of the four requirements under the preliminary injunction standard: whether Plaintiffs have established a \"substantial likelihood of success on the merits.\" Daniels Health Scis. , 710 F.3d at 582. In their motion, Plaintiffs make tw o substantive claims. First, they allege the vaccine mandate violates RFRA and the First Amendment. Second, they allege the mandate's permanent medical - disqualification provision fails strict scrutiny . The Court concludes Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on both claims . Because the mandate treats those with secular exemptions more favorably than those seeking religious exemptions , strict scrutiny is triggered, and Defendants fail to show a compelling interest with respect to the servicemembers before the Court. 1. Religious Freedom Restoration Act Plaintiffs allege that the vaccine mandate substantially burdens their religious exercise without satisfying the compelling interest required under RFRA . Defendants respond that even if Plaintiffs' beliefs are substantially burdened, the Navy has a compelling interest in keeping its force fit and responsive to national security threats . And while Defendants assert that vaccination is the least restrictive means to achieve this end, Plaintiffs suggest alterna tives exist . The Court concludes that Defendants have not demonstrated a compelling interest justifying the substantial burden imposed on the Plaintiffs' religious beliefs . Therefore, there is no need to discuss narrow tailoring. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 17 of 26 PageID 2556Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 17 of 26 PageID 2556 47a 18 The Religious Freedom Re storation Act \"was designed to provide very broad protection for religious liberty.\" Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014) . Passed in 1993 with nearly unanimous support, RFRA provides that the: Government may substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person \u2014(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 000bb -1. RFRA extends to the military, because under the text of the statute, \"government\" includes any \"branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States.\" Id. \u00a7 2000bb -2. Defendants do not dispute this. Defendants have substantially burdened Plaintiffs' religious beliefs . The government burdens religion when it \"put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.\" Thomas v. Rev . Bd. of Ind . Emp't Sec. Div. , 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981). That is especially true when the government imposes a choice between one's job and one's religious belief. See Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963). Here, Plaintiffs must decide whether to lose their live lihoods or violate sincerely held religious beliefs. Because they will not compromise these religious beliefs, Plaintiffs have been threatened with separation from the military and other disciplinary action . 3, ECF No. 1 - 3. Because the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial burden, Defendants must show that this burden further s a compelling interest using the least restrictive means. Plaintiffs claim Defendants cannot demonstrate a compelling interest as to these particular servicemembers.

Even if Defendants have a broad compelling interest in widespread vaccination of its force, they have achieved this goal without the participation of the thirty -five Plaintiffs here. At least 99.4% of all active -duty Navy servicemembers have been vaccinated. Pls.' App. 284, ECF No. 17. The remaining 0.6 % is unlikely to undermine the Navy's effort s. Today, Plaintiffs present a lower risk of infection and transmission than in the earlier days of the pandemic. Severa l Plaintiffs have tested positive for antibodies, showing the presence of natural immunity. See Decl. of SEALs 10, 22; SWCC 2, 4; Supp. Decl. of SEAL 12. With a 99.4 % vaccination rate, the Navy's herd immunity is at an all -time high. COVID -19 treatments are becoming increasingly effective at reducing hospitalization and death. See Pfizer Novel COVID -19 Oral Antiviral Treatment Study, Pls.' App. 310. Moreover, the Navy is willing to grant exemptions for non -religious reasons. Its mandate includes carveouts for those participating in clinical trials and those with medical contraindications and allergies to vaccines. Pls.' App. 154 -59. Because these categories of exempt servicemembers are still deployable, a clinical trial participant who receiv es a placebo may find himself ill in the high-stakes situation that Defendants fear.

Without a compelling interest, the Court need not address whether Defendants have used the least restrictive means . 2. First Amendment The Court turns now to the Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim. Plaintiffs argue that the Navy's mandate triggers strict scrutiny, because it is not neutral or generally applicable. Defendants insist they have carried their burden to demonstrate their compelling interest and the least restrictive means. The Court f inds that for the same reasons Plaintiffs succeed on their RFRA claim, they also prevail on the ir First Amendment claim. To assess neutrality and general applicability, courts consider both the structure of the law and any disparate outcomes it creates. \"A law is not generally applicable if it invites the government to consider the particular reasons for a person 's conduct by providing a mechanism for individualized exemptions.\" Fulton v. City of Phila ., 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021) ( cleaned up). \"[G]overnment regulations are not neutral and generally applicable, and therefore trigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause, whenever they treat any comparable secular activity more favorably than religious exercise. \" Tandon , 141 S. Ct. at 1296 (citing Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn , 141 S. Ct. at 67 -68). The Navy's mandate is not neutral and generally applicable. First, b y accepting individual applications for exemptions, t he law invites an individualized assessment of the reasons why a servicemember is not vaccinated. See Pls.' App. 15 3-55 (NAVADMIN 190/21) ( describing the exemption process and authority to grant exemption ). Consequently , favoritism is built into the mandate. Second , the \"comparable secular activity\" includes refusing the vaccine for medical reasons or participation in a clinical trial. These medically exempt, unvaccinated servicemembers Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 21 of 26 PageID 2560Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 21 of 26 PageID 2560 51a 22 are immediately deployable while unvaccinated servicemembers with religious objections are not. See MANMED \u00a7 15 -105(3)(n)(9 ); Pls.' App. 838. Defendants justify this discrepancy by contrasting the number of requests : \"Whereas there are only seven permanent medical exemptions for al l Navy and Reserve personnel from the COVID -19 immunization duty, there are more than three thousand pending requests for a religious exemption . . . .\" Defs.' Resp. 35 (citation omitted) . But a n influx of religious accommodation requests is not a valid re ason to deny First Amendment rights. No matter how small the number of secular exemptions by comparison, any favorable treatment \u2014in this case, deployability without medical disqualification \u2014defeats neutrality. For these reasons , the mandate triggers strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. As discussed in Section III.B.1, Defendants fail to satisfy the compelling interest requirement, so there is no need to consider least restrictive means. The Court will not repeat its strict scrutiny analysis here. Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their RFRA and First Amendment claims, satisfying the first requirement of the preliminary injunction standard. 3. Medical -Disqualification Provision The parties' briefing on the medical -disqualification issue echoes the RFRA and First Amendment analysis discussed at length in Sections III.B.1 and III.B.2 above. In short, the Court finds that, for the same reasons Pla intiffs' RFRA and First Amendment challenges to the mandate itself succeed, Plaintiffs' challenge to the medical -disqualification provision follows. A servicemember with a religious accommodation is permanently medically disqualifie d while a servicemembe r with a medical exemption is not. See MANMED \u00a7 15-105(3)(n)(9 ); Pls.' App. 838. In other words, Plaintiffs \u2014even if they were all to be granted religious accommodations immediately \u2014would remain nondeployable and would be forced to seek a medical waiver to have this penalty removed. In short, this disparate treatment triggers strict scrutiny . Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 22 of 26 PageID 2561Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 22 of 26 PageID 2561 52a 23 Defendants are unable to overcome strict scrutiny because they have not presented a compelling interest, as explained in previous sections. Thus, Plaintiffs are substa ntially likely to succeed on the merits of their medical -disqualification challenge. C. Plaintiffs face a substantial threat of irreparable harm. Under the second prong of the preliminary injunction standard, the movant s must establish a substantial threat of irreparable harm. Here , Plaintiffs argue th ey have suffered irreparable injury based on (1) infringement of religious liberties; (2) their nondeployable status, which reduces pay and advancement opportunities; and (3) the threat of court -martial and dis honor accompanying it. Defendants claim that Plaintiffs' harm is merely speculative because the religious exemption requests have not been finally adjudicated. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have improperly relied on BST Holdings , which applies only to civilian employment. It is incorrect to say that Plaintiffs' harm is merely speculative at this stage. Plaintiffs are already suffering injury while waiting for the Navy to adjudicate their requests. In some cases, Plaintiffs have suffered injury because they seek religious accommodation. Plaintiffs testify that they have been barred from official and unofficial travel, including for training29 and treatment for traumatic brain injuries;30 denied access to non -work activities, like family day;31 assigned unpleasant schedules and low -level work like cleaning;32 relieved of leadership duties and denied opportunities for advancement;33 kicked out of their platoon s;34 and threatened with immediate 29 Supp. Decl. of SEAL Supp. 1032; SEAL 26, ECF No. 31 of SEAL 26, Supp. App. 1103.

Alguire , 647 F.3d 585, 600 (5th Cir. 2011). As Defendants note, even a general discharge from the military \u2014the ultimate threat here \u2014is not an irreparable harm. See McCurdy v. Zuckert , 359 F.2d 491, 494 (5th Cir. 1966). No matter how remote the possibility, Plaintiffs could be compensated for their losses. They could be reinstated with backpay, retroactively promoted, or reimbursed for lost benefits like medical insurance and the GI Bill. But because these injuries are inextricably intertwined with Plaintiffs' loss of constitutional rights, this Court must conclude that Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable harm. Plaintiffs have suffered the more serious injury of \"infringement of their r eligious liberty rights under RFRA and the First Amendment . . . .\" Pls.' Br. 28, ECF No. 16. The crisis of conscience imposed by the mandate is itself an irreparable harm. See BST Holdings , 17 F.4th at 618; Sambrano v. United Airlines , 19 F.4th 839, 842 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J., dissenting) (citing Sampson v. Murray , 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974) ). \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Elrod , 427 U.S. at 373 (plurality opi nion). The same is true of RFRA. Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs , 697 F.3d 279, 295 (5th Cir. 2012). Thus, any losses the Plaintiffs have suffered in connection with their religious accommodation requests sufficiently demonstrate irreparable i njury. 35 Supp. Decl. of SEAL 24, Supp. EOD 1, Supp. App. 1126. 36 Test. of SEAL 3, Hr'g Ex. 9.

Resp . 45, ECF No. 43. But the principle the Supreme Court ar ticulated in Elrod v. Burns applies broadly , and the Fifth Circuit has acknowledged that any loss of First Amendment freedom satisfies the irreparable injury requirement , even in the national security context. See Def. Distributed v. U.S. Dep't of State , 838 F.3d 451, 457 (5th Cir. 2016). Thus, the second requirement for injunctive relief has been satisfied. D. The balance of hardships weighs in Plaintiffs' favor, and the issuance of the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest. The final two elements of the preliminary injunction standard \u2014the balance of the harms and whether an injunction will disserve the public interest \u2014must be considered together. \"These factors merge when the Government is the opposing party.\" Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). When balancing the harms, courts must consider whether the movant's injury outweighs the threatened harm to the party w hom they seek to enjoi n. The public interest element is broader in scope. Plaintiffs seek to preserve the status quo. They argue the balance of harms tips in Plaintiffs' favor, and an injunction is always in the public interest when it prevents deprivatio n of constitutional rights. Pls. Br. 29, ECF No. 16; see Jackson Women's Health Org. v. Currier , 760 F.3d 448 , 458 n.9 (5th Cir. 2014) . By contrast, Defendants claim that an injunction will cause the Navy significant harm, including illness, hospitalizatio n, and death among its ranks. Given the public interest in military readiness and national defense, they argue, the injunction should be denied. This Court does not make light of COVID -19's impact on the military. Collectively, our armed forces have lost 8 0 lives to COVID -19 over the course of the pandemic. Defs.' App. 263 , Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 25 of 26 PageID 2564Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 25 of 26 PageID 2564 55a 26 ECF No. 44 -3. But the question before the Court is not whether a public interest exists. Rather, this Court must address whether an injunction will disserve the public interest. An injun ction does not disserve the public interest when it prevents constitutional deprivations. Jackson Women's Health , 760 F.3d at 458 n.9. The Plaintiffs' loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy. Even the direst circumstances ca nnot justify the loss of constitutional rights. Fortunately, the future does not look so dire. Nearly 100% of the Navy has been vaccinated. Hospitalizations are rising at a much slower rate than COVID -19 cases. COVID -19 treatments are becoming more effecti ve and widely available. Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied the final two requirements for preliminary injunction. IV.

For the following reasons , the Court DENIES the Motion for Stay . I. BACKGROUND Because the parties are well -acquainted with the facts of this case, the Court will not repeat them at length here. On January 3, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, enjoining enforcement of the Navy's COVID vaccination policies against the thirty - five Plaintiffs , who object to the vaccine on religious grounds . See ECF No. 66. Since then, Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants are violating the injunction by preventing some Plaintiffs from attending training, receiving medical treatment, or returning to their job duties . See Mot. for Order to Show Cause, ECF No. 95. Defendants claim that P laintiffs' allegations are meritless and Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 1 of 10 PageID 3427Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 1 of 10 PageID 3427 57a2 that Plaintiffs' feared outcomes are speculative .1 See Defs.' Resp. 6 -12, ECF No. 110. Defendants filed a Motion for Stay on January 24, 2022. ECF No. 85. II. LEGAL STANDARD Just as the preliminary injunction itself is an \"extraordinary remedy,\" staying a preliminary injunction is similarly exceptional . \"A stay is an intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review, and accordingly is not a matter of right, even if irrepara ble injury might otherwise result to the appellant.\" Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 427 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) . Maintaining the status quo is \"an important consideration in granting a stay.\" Barber v. Bryant , 833 F.3d 510, 511 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Dayton of Educ. v. Brinkman , 439 U.S. 1358, 1359 (1978)). Courts must consider four factors in determining wheth er to stay a preliminary injunction pending appeal : (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay w ill substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. Nken , 556 U.S. at 426. Like the preliminary injunction factors, \"[t]he first two factors of the traditional [stay] standard are the most critical.\" Id. at 434. III. ANALYSIS Defendants seek to stay the preliminary injunction \"to the extent the order precludes Defendants from making the assignment and reassignment decisions that the military deems appropriate, taking into account Plaintiffs' vaccination status, including with respect to deployment and training.\" Defs.' Br. 5, ECF No. 86 . Having considered the law and the parties' briefing, t he Court concludes that (1) Defendants have not successfully shown they are likely to 1 The Court does not address the merits of the Motion for Order to Show Cause (ECF No. 95) here but mentions these developing facts as context for the following analysis. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 2 of 10 PageID 3428Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 2 of 10 PageID 3428 58a3 succeed on the merits , and (2) Defendants are not likely to be irreparably injured without a stay. Indee d, were the Court to grant the stay , Plaintiffs have shown they will face irreparable harm. Finally, the public interest weighs in favor of preserving the constitutional rights of the Plaintiffs and maintaining the status quo. For these reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion for Stay. A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits Defendants argue they are likely to succeed on the merits for two primary reasons: first, because this case is not justiciable , and second, because this Court's preliminary injunction relied on a mistaken understanding of medical disqualification and the waiver process. 1. Justiciability of Plaintiffs' Claims2 Defendants insist this case is not justiciable because decisions regar ding assignment and deployment are strictly within the scope of the Commander in Chief's authority \u2014not civilian courts. Defs.' Br. 12, ECF No. 86. In essence , the Court should not encroach on the decision - making power of the military, even when servicemembers' claims involve constitutional challenges. Id. Finally, Defendants argue that \"the Court erred in substituting its 'own evaluation of evidence for a reas onable evaluation' by the military regarding the necessity of [the COVID vaccination policy].\" Defs.' Br. 14, ECF No. 86 (quoting Rostker v. Goldberg , 453 U.S. 57, 68 (1981)). As to justiciability, Plaintiffs point to the Court's Mindes analysis . Plaintif fs argue they need not exhaust military remedies because the Navy's \"case -by-case\" analysis is predetermined and invariably results in a denial letter. In response to Defendants' claim that the Court must not 2 The Court's Mindes analysis in the preliminary injunction covers this topic at length. See Order on Prelim. Inj. 6-17, ECF No. 66. Nothing presented in the parties' briefing on this Motion alters that analysis. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 3 of 10 PageID 3429Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 3 of 10 PageID 3429 59a4 venture into military decisions, Plaintiffs insist that the Court's order was a legal determina tion, not a military policy . Pls.' Resp. 8-9, ECF No. 99. Military decisions involve complex and strategic factors. As a matter of practicality, \"courts are generally reluctant to review claims involving military duty assignments,\" because civilian judges lack military expertise . Harkness v. Sec'y of Navy , 858 F.3d 437, (6th Cir. United States , 723 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Defendants accurately state that civilian courts are unqualified to review \"[t]he complex , subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping and control of a military force.\" Gilligan v. Morgan , 413 U.S. 1, 10 (1973) ; see Defs.' Reply 4, ECF No. 102. But this case does not present a question of military strategy or personnel placement . \"Whether the vaccine mandate passes muster under the First Amendment and RFRA requires neither 'military expertise or discretion.' It is a purely legal question appropriate for judicial review.\" Order on Prelim. Inj. 16, ECF No. 66 (quoting Mindes v. Seaman , 453 F.2d 197, 201 (5th Cir. 1971)). Defendants do not dispute that RFRA applies to the military. This Court has not required Defendants to make any particular personnel assignments . All strategic decisions remain in the hands of the Navy. Rather, the preliminary injunction simply prohibits adverse action against Plaintiffs based on their requests for religious accommodation. This Court will not \u2014and cannot \u2014 require the Navy to place a particular SEAL in a particular training program. But it can \u2014and must \u2014prevent the Navy from taking punitive action against that SEAL by blocking him from the training program he would otherwise attend. Even the Gilligan Court noted that \"there is nothing in our Nation 's history or in [the Supreme] Court 's decided cases . . . that actual or threatened injury by reason of unlawful activities of the military would go unnoticed or unremedied.\" Gilligan , 413 U.S. at 12 n.16 (quoting Laird Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 4 of 10 PageID 3430Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 PageID 3430 60a5 v. Tatum , 408 U.S. 1, 15 -16 (1972)). The distinction between lawful and unlawful military activities also appears in Orloff v. Willoughby , 345 U.S. 83, 93 -95 (1953). There, the Supreme Court declined to review a servicemember's lawfully issued duty assignment. But it also hypothesized that, had the servicemember been unlawfully diverted into a duty assignment for which he was not conscripted , the Court may have had reason to review for bad faith and unlawful discrimination. Id. at 87 -88. Defendants also briefly d iscuss Goldman v. Weinberger , in which a Jewish servicemember challenged an Air Force regulation that prohibited him from wearing his yarmulke while on duty. 475 U.S. 503, 504 -07 (1986). The Supreme Court deferred to the professional judgment of military authorities regarding the unity of the force and concluded that the First Amendment did not afford the servicemem ber an exception to the dress code . Id. at 510. But in the vaccination context, courts have deviated from Goldman . When servicemembers challenged mandatory anthrax vaccines, one court found the plaintiffs' claims justiciable in civilian court, even when vaccine refusal could \"threaten the uniformity of the military.\" Doe v. Rumsfeld , F. Supp. 2d 119, 12 6-29 (D.D.C. 2003) (\"[H] ere there will be no visible differences between persons who choose to receive the vaccine and tho se who choose not to receive the vaccine. Thus, concerns about uniformity diminish and a judgment in this case would not affect the uniformity of military personnel to any substantial degree.\" ). Moreover, unlike a yarmulke , a vaccine cannot be added or removed at each shift change . For Plaintiffs, there is no way to partially comply with their sincerely held religious beliefs. The choice to be vaccinated is both binary and irreversible. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 5 of 10 PageID 3431Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 5 of 10 PageID 3431 61a6 2. Medical Disqualification and Neutrality Defendants also argue \"the Court based its injunction, at least in part, on a mistaken finding that 'those receiving medical accommodations are not medically disqualified \u2014they receive equal status as those who are vaccinated.'\" Defs.' Br. 13, ECF No. 86 (quoting Order on Prelim . Inj. 11 - 12, 14 , ECF No. 66 ). Defendants submitted a declaration by Force Medical Officer Littlejohn explaining that \"a service member who receives an exemption or accommodation from the COVID -19 vaccine requirement, whether for religious or secular reaso ns, is not [physically qualified] unless he or she obtains a separate medical clearance.\" Decl. of Littlejohn, Ex. 2, ECF No. 87. In other words, Defendants claim the policies are neutral as to the reason behind the servicemember's objection such that the regulations do not trigger strict scrutiny .3 The core question under the First Amendment claim is whether the Defendants treat all unvaccinated servicemembers neutrally. This issue then is only relevant to Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim, not the RFRA claim. Neutrality matters in this context because strict scrutiny is triggered under the First Amendment when a regulation treats comparable secular activity more 3 Here is a brief summary of the conflicting interpretations: The text of Trident Order #12 \"does not pertain to medical contraindications or allergies to vaccine administration.\" App. 99, ECF No. 44 -1. Thus, the provision applies only to those refusing the vaccine \"based solely o n personal or religious beliefs .\" These individuals \" will still be medically disqualified.\" Therefore, the \"separate waiver\" process that Trident Order #12 describes appears to only apply to those with religious and personal, not medical, reasons. Likewise , MANMED \u00a7 15 -105 disqualifies unvaccinated special warfare servicemembers who base their refusal on personal or religious beliefs. App. 229, ECF No. 44 -2. And once again, the provision does not apply to those with medical reasons for refusal. Based on thi s reading, someone with a medical exemption would not need a separate medical waiver. But according to the Force Medical Officer's declaration, a medically exempt servicemember is deemed NPQ: not physically qualified. Decl. of Littlejohn, Ex. 2, ECF No. 87. To return to PQ (physically qualified) status, the servicemember must seek a waiver , just as someone with a religious accommodation would. But besides general requirements for Special Operations in MANMED, the Force Medical Officer has not cited direct language medically disqualifying (NPQ) an unvaccinated, but medically exempt, servicemember. The Force Medical Officer notes, however, that \"all requests for permanent medical exemptions from COVID -19 vaccination for personnel falling under NSWC authority have been denied.\" Decl. of Littlejohn, Ex. 2, App. 37, ECF No. 87.

Tandon v. Newsom , 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1296 (20 21) (per curiam). But because strict scrutiny is required under RFRA, the Court need not resolve the neutrality issue to conclude that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of the RFRA claim. Thus, Defendants' Motion will be denied as to the R FRA claim, and resolution of this issue and its impact on neutrality under the First Amendment will be resolved at the merits stage. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the case is justiciable and the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merit s. B. Irreparable Injury Defendants warn of significant harm if the Court denies the stay. First, if forced to deploy unvaccinated servicemembers, the Navy would face an elevated risk of COVID spread and \"catastrophic\" results if a servicemember requires medical attention where healthcare resources are scarce. Defs.' Br. 7 -9, ECF No. 86. Second, Defendants contend that the preliminary injunction undermines discipline by allowing servicemembers \"to define the terms of their own military service.\" Defs.' Br. 11, ECF No. 86. Neither is sufficient evidence of irreparable harm to Defendants. 1. Risk to the Mission \"Requiring the Navy to allow Plaintiffs to deploy while unvaccinated would pose serious and specific threats to mission success.\" Defs.' Br. 7, ECF No. 86. Defendants explain that unvaccinated servicemembers present a higher risk of contracting and transmitting COVID. Because \"[e]very member of a SEAL team is vital,\" the Navy cannot afford to lose someone during a critical mission. Defs.' Br. 8, ECF No. 86 (quoting Decl. of Lescher, Ex. 1 \u00b6 21, ECF No. 87). Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 7 of 10 PageID 3433Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 7 of 10 PageID 3433 63a8 Plaintiffs point to Defendants' delay in requesting a stay, alleging \"there is no apparent urgency to the request for injunctive relief.\" Pls.' Resp. 13, ECF No. 99 Inc. , 464 F. Supp. 2d 603, 609 (N.D. Tex. 2006)). Further, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are not even complying with the Injunction and thus cannot be experiencing harm. They claim that any harm to the Navy is outweighed by harm to Plaintiffs. Defendants have not provided sufficient evidence that the Navy will be irreparably injured absent a stay . Vice Admiral Merz, deputy chief of naval operations, describes a highly effective force despite the spread of the Omicron variant. Pls.' App. 3-4, ECF No. 100. Even fully vaccinated ships ha ve experienced outbreaks, but \"Omicron has a quick turn around and isn't causing severe illness in sailors.\" Pls.' App. 4, ECF No. 100. In short, \"[Omicron] is coming and going all the time, very small numbers, and really no operational impact.\" Id. Defend ants' briefing presents a much grimmer version of the facts. They argue that unvaccinated servicemembers will derail missions, require medical attention where healthcare is limited, and jeopardize the health of other servicemembers. Defs.' Br. 7 -9, ECF No. 86. This Court is unconvinced that thirty -five unvaccinated Plaintiffs present an intolerably high risk to their vaccinated peers who themselves continue to contract and transmit COVID. Defendants provide an example that \"unvaccinated instructors can spread COVID -19 to dozens of candidates in training ,\" who will return to their units, further spreading the virus. Defs.' Br. 10, ECF No. 86. But suppose Plaintiffs were to agree to be vaccinated tomorrow. There is no guarantee they will remain healthy and ready to deploy. A vaccinated instructor may still infect his students. Regardless , vaccinated servicemembers are far more likely to encounter unvaccinated individuals off-base among the general public than amon g their ranks.4 4 Only 64.3% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. CDC COVID Data Tracker, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid -data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc -people -onedose -pop-5yr (last visited Feb. 12, Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 8 of 10 PageID 3434Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 116 Filed 02/13/22 Page 8 of 10 PageID 3434 64a9 In short, Defendants have not provided sufficient evidence of risk rising to the level of irreparable harm. 2. Discipline in the Ranks Defendants also allege that the Court's preliminary injunction \"undercut[s] the maintenance of military good order and discipline.\" Defs.' Br. 10, ECF No. 86. In his declaration, Lieutenant Commander Andrew Petralia explains that Plaintiff Navy Diver 2 is a student assigned to his command. Decl. of Petralia, Ex. 3, ECF No. 87. Diver 2 has \"refused to submit to weekly COVID -19 testing and claims that he will soon submit a separate religious accommodation request to be excused from this requirement.\" Defs.' Br. 10, ECF No. 86 (citing Decl. of Petralia, Ex. 3 \u00b6 5, ECF No. 87). The preliminary injunction is limited in scope. It enjoined the Defendants from applying the vaccine mandate to the thirty -five Plaintiffs here and prohibited adverse action on the basis of their religious accommodation requests . To be cle ar, if true , the behavior of Diver 2 is not within the scope of the Order. In his declaration, Diver 2 asserted that he \"view[s] his own life and the lives of [his] fellow service members as sacred.\" Decl. of U.S. Navy Diver 2, Supp. App. 1011, ECF No. 59. He has consented to \"mitigation measures consistent with [his] religious beliefs.\" Id. Diver 2, and Plaintiffs like him, are welcome to submit additional religious accommodation requests, but they may not defy mitigation measures un der the guise of following this Court's Order. C. Other Factors Finally, the Court considers the two remaining factors: (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding , and (4) where the public intere st 2022). By contrast, at least 99.4% of active -duty Navy servicemembers are fully vaccinated. Pls.' App. 284, ECF No. 17.

Having discussed the substantial injury to the Plaintiffs in the preliminary injunction , the Court now briefly addresses the public interest question. \"When the Government is a party, its interests and the public interest overlap in the balancing of harms.\" Nken , 556 U.S. at 420. Plaintiffs seek to preserve the status quo. They argue that protecting constitutional rights is always in the public interest. Pls. Resp. 15, ECF No. 99; see Jackson Women's Health Org. v. Currier , 760 F.3d 448, 458 n.9 (5th Cir. 2014). Here, preserving the status quo means maintain ing the preliminary injunction \u2014in other words, preventing Plaintiffs from being deprived of pay, training, medical treatment, travel opportunities, and more. The Court finds that the public interest supports a denial of the Motion for Stay. IV. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion for Stay .

NAVMED P-5055, Radiation Health Protection Manual, is the governing document for the Navy's Radiation Health Protection Program. To ensure that the requirements of NAVMED P-5055 are met and to eliminate any potential for conflicting guidance, the specific standards and examination pro- cedures for occupational exposure to ionizing radia-tion are found only in NAVMED P-5055, Chapter 2. The current version of NAVMED P-5055 is available on the Navy Medicine Web site at http://www.med. navy.mil/directives/Pages/Publications.aspx . 15-105 Special Operations Duty ( 1 ) Characteristics. Special operations (SO) duty takes place in every part of the world under harsh conditions at the extremes of human physical capabilities. Medical austerity and the presence of armed opposition are common. SO personnel, de- pending on service and warfare community, routinely engage in high-risk operations including parachuting, high angle activities, high-speed boat and unconven- tional vehicle operation, weapons operation, demoli- tions employment, and waterborne activities, to include SCUBA diving. As such, SO duty is among the most physically and m entally demanding assign- ments in the U.S. military. Only the most physically and mentally qualified personnel should be selected, and those who are or may b e reasonably expected to become unfit or unrelia ble must be excluded. ( 2 ) Applicability . Current and prospective mem- bers of the following communities (whether Navy, U.S. non-Navy, or foreign national): (a) Navy sea, air, and land personnel (SEAL). (b) Special warfare combatant craft crew- men (SWCC). (c) USMC Reconnaissance Marine (RE- CON). (d) USMC Forces Special Operations Com- mand (MARSOC); special operations officer (SOO), critical skills operators (CSO), and Special Amphi-bious Reconnaissan ce Corpsman (SARC). (e) Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel. Note: To be physically qualified for military parachuting (including basic, military free-fall, and high altitude low opening), Army Regulation 40-501 (AR40-501), applies. Article 15-105 standards are presumed to encompass AR40-501/5 standards; therefore, an individual meeting physical standards or possessing a valid waiver for special operations duty from BUPERS-3 or PERS-416 is medically qualified to participate in military parachuting. 15-82 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 69a Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-105 Note: SEAL, Navy EOD, and other SO personnel whose duties involve military diving or maintaining diving duty status must also be qualified under MANMED Chapter 15, article 15-102 (diving duty). Personnel who are SO qualified but do not dive or require dive qualification are not required to be qualified under MANMED Chapter 15, article 15-102. ( 3 ) Examinations applica- tion for initial training. Periodicity between exami-nations will not exceed 5 years up to age 50. After age 50, periodicity will not exceed 2 years, e.g., an individual examined at age 46 would be re-examined at age 51, an individual examined at age 47, 48, 49, or 50 would be re-examined at age 52. Beginning at age 60, the examination is required annually. Special operations duty examinations must be performed no later than 1 month following the anniversary date (month and year) of the previous physical exami- nation date. For example, for an examination per- formed on a 20-year old on 15 February 2018, the next examination must be completed by 31 March 2023. A complete physical examination is also required prior to returning to special operations duty after a period of disqualification.

Special Opera- tions candidates must have completed the Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B series prior to the start of training. If documentation of completed immunization is lacking or in doubt, demonstration of serological immunity is sufficient to meet this requirement. ( c ) Examiners . Examinations may be per- formed by any physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner with appropriate DoD clinical privileges. Examinations not performed by an undersea medical officer (UMO) must be reviewed and co-signed by a UMO. All reviewing authority signatures must be accompanied by the \"UMO\" designation. A UMO is defined as a medical officer (or physician employed by DoD who previously served as a UMO) who has successfully completed the entire UMO course con- ducted by the Naval Undersea Medical Institute (NUMI), which includes the diving medical officer (DMO) course conducted at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center (NDSTC), and who is curr- ently privileged in undersea medicine. For the purposes of this article, \"mental health professional/ provider\" refers to a doctoral-level provider (psychia-trist/psychologist) unless otherwise indicated. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-83 70a Article 15-105 Manual of the Medical Department ( 4 ) Standards . The standards delineated in this article define the conditions which are considered disqualifying for SO duty. The standards delineated in MANMED Chapter 15, Section III (General Stan- dards, some of which are restated below for emphasis) are universally applicable to all SO duty candidates, unless specifically addressed in this article. UMOs, based on their specialty training and subject matter expertise, are charged with applying the General Standards to qualified SO personnel when appropriate to ensure that they are physically and mentally ready to perform their duties without limitation. ( a ) General. Any condition or combination of conditions which may be exacerbated by SO duty, impair the ability to safely and effectively work in the SO environment, or increase potential for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) is disqualifying. Any dis- ease or condition causing chronic or recurrent dis- ability or frequent health care encounters, increasing the hazards of isolation, or having the potential for significant exacerbation by extreme weather, stress, hypobaric or hyperbaric environments, or fatigue is disqualifying. Conditions and treatments causing a significant potential for disruption of operations are disqualifying. Further, any condition, combination of conditions, or treatment which may confound the dia-gnosis of a heat, cold, or brain injury is disqualifying. Note: SO personnel reporting for duty following an absence of greater than 14 days due to illness or injury, hospitalization for any reason, or reported on by a me dical board must have a properly documented UMO evaluation to determine fitness for continued SO duty. ( b ) Ear, Nose, and Throat ( 1 ) S l e e p a p n e a w i t h c o g n itive impair- ment or daytime hypersomnolence is disqualifying. ( 2 ) H i s t o r y o f i n n e r e a r p a t h o l o g y o r surgery, including but not limited to vertigo, Meni- ere's disease or syndrome, endolymphatic hydrops, or tinnitus of sufficient severity to interfere with sat- isfactory performance of duties is disqualifying.

( d ) Eyes and Vision ( 1 ) C o r r e c t e d v i s u a l a c u i t y w o r s e t h a n 20/25 in either eye is disqualifying. ( 2 ) U n c o r r e c t e d v i s u a l a c u i t y w o r s e than 20/40 in the better eye is disqualifying for SEAL and SWCC. ( 3 ) U n c o r r e c t e d v i s u a l a c u i t y w o r s e than 20/70 in either eye is disqualifying for SEAL and SWCC. ( 4 ) U n c o r r e c t e d v i s u a l a c u i t y w o r s e than 20/200 in either eye is disqualifying for EOD, USMC RECON, and MARSOC.

( 6 ) D e f i c i e n t c o l o r v i s i o n , a s d e f i n e d b y MANMED article 15-36(1)(d), is disqualifying. Waiver requests for color vision deficiency will not be considered for EOD personnel or candidates. Other special operation communities will consider waivers. Waiver requests must include a statement from the member's supervisor stating that the member is able to perform his job accurately and without difficulty, and provide evidence that prima ry and secondary colors can be discerned. 15-84 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 71a Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-105 ( 7 ) S y m p t o m a t i c o r f u n c t i o n a l n i g h t vision deficiency is disqualifying.

Stable results from appliance or surgery must meet the applicable (paragraph 4(d)(1)-(4) of this article) cor- rected visual acuity standards and the patient must be discharged from ophthalmology follow-up with a disposition of \"fit for full duty\" and requiring no ongoing treatment. Qualified SO Service members may return to duty 1 month after refractive corneal or intraocular lens implant surgery if they are fully recovered from surgery and have an acceptable visual outcome per paragraph 4(d)(1)-(4) of this article. No waiver is required in these cases. ( 1 0 ) G l a u c o m a i s d i s q u a l i f y i n g . P r e - glaucoma requiring no treatment and follow-up inter- vals of 1 year or more is not disqualifying.

No waiver is required to return to SO Duty for short- term use (less than 6 months) of a psychotropic medi- cation. Long-term use (longer than 6 months) of a psychotropic medication is disqualifying and will require a waiver to return to SO Duty. Note: ASD(HA) Guidelines for Deployment-Limiting Psychiatric Conditions and Medications states that a member may not be deployed within 3 months of starting a psychotropic medication. Note: OPNAVINST 3591.1, Small Arms Training and Quali- fication, states that a member may not be issued a weapon while on psychotropic medications unless a waiver is obtained; personnel must be limited to administrative duties unless waiver has been granted. ( 4 ) W a i v e r i s n o t r e q u i r e d f o r s h o r t - term use (2 weeks or less) of a sleep aid (e.g., zolpidem for induction of sleep). ( l ) Neurologic.

P T A l e s s t h a n 1 h o u r i s disqualifying for at least 1 month. A normal brain MRI and normal examination by a neurologist or neurosurgeon is required before return to duty. If more than 2 years have elapsed since the injury, a normal MRI and a normal neurologic examination by the UMO are sufficient. Further specialty consultation is only indicated in the event of abnormal findings. 2 . P T A g r e a t e r t h a n 1 h o u r i s permanently disqualifying for candidates. Waiver may be entertained for designated SO personnel after 1 year if brain MRI and neurologic and neuropsychological evaluations are normal.

Any require-ment for a medication that necessitates close moni- toring, regular tests, refrigeration, or parenteral ad- ministration on a biweekly (every 2 weeks) or more frequent basis is disqualifying. Requirement for medication which would pose a significant health risk if suddenly stopped for 1 month or more is dis- qualifying. ( c ) S O d e s i g n a t e d p e r s o n n e l t a k - ing medicines prescribed by a non-DoD provider are disqualified until reviewed and approved by the Service member's UMO. ( 9 ) Vaccinations. Candidate or SO designated personnel refusing to receive recom-mended vaccines (preventive health or theatre speci-fic vaccines recommended by the Combatant Com- mand (COCOM)) based solely on personal or reli-gious beliefs are disqualified. This provision does not pertain to medical contraindications or allergies to vaccine administration. (4) Waiver and Disqualification Requests. Waiver and disqualification requests are essentially the same personnel action. The distinction between the two lies with whether the originator is requesting that one or more physical standards be waived or not. The outcome of either request is a determination by the responsible waiver authority as to whether the physical standard(s) is waived or not. BUMED-M95 serves as the senior medical reviewer for the waiver authority. (Certain waiver authorities have delegated adjudication of disqualification cases only to lower echelon commanders). (a) Requests for a waiver of physical stand- ards for SO personnel and candidates must be sent from the member's commander, commanding officer, or officer in charge, via any applicable immediate superior in command (ISIC) or type commander (TY-COM) and BUMED-M95, to the appropriate Bureau of Naval Personnel code (enlisted - BUPERS-3; offi-cers - PERS-416); or Headquarters, USMC (POG-40). (b) Originators must use the WEBWAVE 2 system to securely transmit cases (which contain HIPAA and PII-protected information). WEBWAVE 2 expedites case adjudication, allows tracking of cases under review and provides an accessible archive of closed cases. The system's business rules are designed to ensure that all necessary components of a request are submitted and requests are directed electronically via the proper routing sequence. BUMED-M95's guideline for timely internal review of routine waiver requests is 10 business days ; Urgent cases are acted upon with 24 hours of receipt. Access to WEBWAVE 2 is controlled by BUMED-M95. Commands needing to submit requests via WEBWAVE 2 but currently without access may contact BUMED-M95 directly to validate their requirement and obtain access/training. ( c ) For SO personnel, interim waivers may be granted by BUMED-M95 for periods of up to 6 months. ( 1 ) I n t e r i m w a i v e r s w ill not normally be considered for SO candidates, in as much as their suitability must be established before the Navy incurs the expense of TAD orders and training. ( 2 ) B e c a u s e i n t e r i m w a i v e r s a r e n o t r e - viewed by the relevant Waiver Authority, BUMED- M95 will only grant interim waivers for relatively routine, frequently encountered conditions for which it is confident of the waiver authority's eventual disposition. In any case, interim waivers should be requested sparingly. ( 3 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 m u s t r e c e i v e t h e f i n a l waiver request prior to the expiration of any interim waiver which has been granted (typically 6 months). The final waiver request must include a substantive interval history pertinent to the condition under review. ( 4 ) Individuals with lapsed interim wai- vers are not physically qualified to parachute or deploy until the final waiver request has been adjudicated. ( 5 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 ' s f i n a l r e c o m m e n d a - tion will be based on the member's condition at the time the final waiver request is made and may differ from the interim determination, if there has been a change in the member's condition or if information presented in the final request dictates a change in recommendation. (d) BUMED-M95 will perform 'courtesy screening' for SO candidat es, who are potential Navy accessions, referred by their local Navy Recruiting Districts (NRD); however, these screens are not waivers. (e) The required elements of a waiver or disqualification request are: ( 1 ) A special SF 600, prepared by the UMO, requesting the waiver (or disqualification), referencing the specific standard for which the member is NPQ, a clinical synopsis including brief history, focused examination, clinical course, appro- priate ancillary studies and appropriate specialty 15-90 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 77a Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-106 consultations, followed by an explicit recommenda- tion of \"waiver recommended\" or \"waiver not recommended\" with supporting rationale. Any on- going aftercare must be identified. ( 2 ) D D F o r m 2 8 0 7 - 1 / 2 8 0 8 , a n n o t a t e d t o reflect individual's pertinent findings. This may either be a new SO duty examination, a current SO duty examination, annotated as necessary, or a focused examination documenting pertinent positives and negatives. Circumstances will dictate which format is most appropriate. ( 3 ) C o p i e s o f o t h e r , p e r t i n e n t s t u d i e s supporting the waiver/disqualification. ( 4 ) C o p i e s o f p e r t i n e n t , s p e c i a l t y c o n - sultation clinical notes supporting the waiver or dis- qualification. ( 5 ) Endorsement by the member's com- manding officer or sponsoring unit. This endorse- ment should be substantive and address whether the condition, diagnosis, or current condition impairs the member's performance of SO duty and is compatible with the operational environment. Note: Office codes, titles and contact num bers are current as of the time of document release. It should be anticipated that these can and will change prior to the next revision of this article. Note: An individual who does not meet Article 15-105 physical standards and is denied a waiver by BUPERS- 3/PERS-416, and still wishes to participate in military parachuting, must be examined and meet standards per AR40-501. Waiver authority for the Air-borne School is the Commandant, U. S. Army Infantry School in coordination with U.S. Total Army Personnel Command (PERSCOM). 15-106 Submarine Duty ( 1 ) Characteristics. Submarine duty is charact- erized by geographic isolation, austere medical support, need for personnel reliability, prolonged habitation of enclosed spaces, continuous exposure to low level atmospheric contaminants, and psycho-logical stress. The purpose of submarine duty stand- ards is to maximize mission capability by optimizing mental and physical readiness of members of the submarine force. ( 2 ) Applicability. Current and prospective sub- mariners and UMOs. Non-submarine designated per- sonnel embarked on (\"riders\") with series. ( 3 ) Examinations ( a ) Periodicity. For candidates, no more than 1 year prior to reporting for initial submarine training. Periodicity between examinations will not exceed 5 years up to age 50. After age 50, periodicity will not exceed 2 years, e.g., an individual examined at age 46 would be re-examined at age 51, an individual examined at age 47, 48, 49, or 50 would be re-examined at age 52. Beginning at age 60, the examination is required annually. Submarine duty examinations must be performed no later than 1 month following the anniversary date (month and year) of the previous physical examination date. For example, for an examination performed on a 20-year old on 15 February 2010, the next examination must be com-pleted by 31 March 2015. A complete physical exami- nation is also required prior to returning to submarine duty after a period of disqualification. ( b ) Scope. The examiner will pay special attention to the mental status, psychiatric, and neu- rologic components of the examination, and will review the entire health record for evidence of past impairment. Specifically, the individual will be ques- tioned about difficulty getting along with other per- sonnel, history of suicidal or homicidal ideation, and anxiety related to tight or closed spaces, nuclear power, or nuclear weapons. The examination must be recorded on the DD Form 2807-1 and DD Form 2808. For female examinees, the NAVMED 6420/2 (Health and Reproductive Risk Counseling for Female Submariners and Submarine Candidates) is also re-quired. If within required periodicity, portions of the examination typically performed in conjunction with the annual women's health e xam (e.g., breast, geni- talia, pelvic, anus and rectum) may be transcribed with proper attribution rather than repeated, and need not be performed by the examiner performing the submarine duty exam. The following studies are required within 3 months prior to the exam unless otherwise specified: ( 1 ) P A a n d l a t e r a l x - r a y s o f t h e c h e s t (candidates only, upon program entry).

The date of the special adverse evaluation from paragraph 6.b. above constitutes a permanent withdrawal of advancement recommendation effective as of the date of the reporting seniors signature. An example NAVPERS 1070/13 for enlisted members pending advancement is available in BUPERSINST 1430.16G, Chapter 7. 13. Community sponsor flag officers are authorized to make determinations within their communities regarding removal of warfare qualifications, additional qualification designations (AQD), Navy Enlisted Classifications (NEC), or sub -specialties for Navy serv ice members refusing the vaccine. Any decision to remove warfare qualifications, AQDs, NECs, or sub -specialties shall be consistent with current community policies and normal practices for Navy service members who do not maintain deployability or indiv idual readiness through their own actions. These decisions, when based solely on refusing the vaccine, must be administrative in nature rather than punitive. 14. If in doubt as to how to adjudicate issues related to a Navy service member refusing t he vaccine, Commanders should seek guidance from their chain of command, their staff judge advocate, and/or the CCDA before acting. In all cases, Commanders are accountable to ensure the health and safety of their command while treating every Navy serv ice member with dignity and respect. 15. Points of contact.

Case No. 4:21-CV-01236-O SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF LANNY F. LITTLEJOHN I Lanny F. Littlejohn, hereby state and declare as follows: r I. I am a Captain in the United States Navy, currently serving as the Force Medical Officer of U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC), located in Coronado, California, whose mission is to provide maritime special operations forces (SOF) to conduct full spectrum operations, unilaterally or with partners, to support national objectives. As the Force Medical Officer, I am the senior ranking medical professional at NSWC and have ultimate responsibility for medical readiness, combat casualty care, quality healthcare delivery, medical research oversight, medical waivers to physical standards, and am the credentialing and privileging authority for all providers within the NSW claimancy. I make this declaration in my official Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 35 of 46 PageID 2744Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 35 of 46 PageID 2744 95aApp034capacity, based upon my personal knowledge and upon information that has been provided to me in the course of my official duties. 2. I have been assigned to my current position since January 10, 2020. Prior to my current assignment, I served as Command Surgeon, Naval Special Warfare Development Group; Chair of Emergency Medicine, Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune; Diving Medical Officer, EOD Group TWO; and Flight Surgeon, VMAQ-4. I am also a board certified Emergency Physician, Assistant Professor of Military and Emergency Medicine at the Uniformed Services bniversity, and Chair of the Technology Subcommittee for the Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care for the Defense Health Agency. In my current duties, I am responsible for setting policy and procedures relevant to the health, medical readiness, and medical capabilities of Naval Special Warfare operationally and in garrison. 3. I have reviewed the preliminary injunction order issued in the above captioned case on January 3, 2022. The order misinterprets Navy Instructions MANMED1 \u00a7 15- 105(3)(n)(9) and Trident Order2 #12 and draws incorrect conclusions regarding applicable Navy policies. Citing to MANMED \u00a7 15-105(3)(n)(9) and Trident Order #12, the order determines, \"[t]hose who receive religious accommodations are still 'medically disqualified.' That means Plaintiffs would be permanently barred from deployment, denied the bonuses and incentive pay 1 Navy's Manual of the Medical Department (\"MANMED\"), Chapter 15, Physical Examinations and Standards for Enlistment, Commission, and Special Duty. 2 Trident Order #12 was issued on September 24, 2021. The directive does not set forth new policies concerning vaccination requirements or processes by which members request medical or administrative exemptions, though it does set forth deadlines for Naval Special Warfare (NSW) personnel Oike for the 33 of the 35 Plaintiffs within the NSW claimancy in the above-referenced case) to submit such requests. Service members with questions related to medical exemptions were advised to consult with their medical provider. Trident Order #12 ,r 6.b. Service members were advised to contact their chaplain for assistance with religious accommodation requests. Id ,r 6.c. 2 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 36 of 46 PageID 2745Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 36 of 46 PageID 2745 96aApp035that accompany deployment, and deprived of the very reason they chose to serve in the iavy. By contrast, those receiving medical accommodations are not medically disqualified\u00ad ley receive equal status as those who are vaccinated.\" Op. 11-12. The order also concludes, \"even if the Navy were to grant a religious exemption, that exemption would still receive less favorable treatment than its secular counterparts. Those who receive religious exemptions are medically disqualified. Those who receive medical exemptions are not. But the activity itself:\u00ad forgoing the vaccine-is identical.\" Id. at 14. These findings incorrectly conflate the COVID- 9 exemption process with military medical readiness and deployability requirements. 4. A service member that meets all medical requirements for special operations (SO) uty is termed \"Physically Qualified\" (PQ). A service member that does not meet these medical iequirements is termed \"Not Physically Qualified\" (NPQ). The MANMED provides that \"[o]nly the most physically and mentally qualified personnel should be selected, and those who are or may be reasonably expected to become unfit or unreliable must be excluded.\" MANMED \u00a7 15- 1\u00b05(1 ). Special operations personnel are subject to stringent medical requirements by virtue of the nature of their military duties: Id Special operations (SO) duty takes place in every part of the world under harsh conditions at the extremes of human physical capabilities. Medical austerity and the presence of armed opposition are common. SO personnel, depending on service and warfare community, routinely engage in high-risk operations including parachuting, high angle activities, high-speed boat and unconventional vehicle operation, weapons operation, demolitions employment, and waterborne activities, to include SCUBA diving. As such, SO duty is among the most physically and mentally demanding assignments in the U.S. military. 5. MANMED \u00a7 15-105(4)(a) further describes the circumstances under which a Service member might become medically disqualified from special operations duty: 3 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 37 of 46 PageID 2746Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 37 of 46 PageID 2746 97aApp036Any disease or condition causing chronic or recurrent disability or frequent health care encounters, increasing the hazards of isolation, or having the potential for significant exacerbation by extreme weather, stress, hypobaric or hyperbaric environments, or fatigue is disqualifying. Conditions and treatments causing a significant potential for disruption of operations are disqualifying. Anyone that is NPQ must have a \"Waiver to Physical Standards\" recommended by the Navy Bureau of Medicine (BUMED) and approved by the Navy Bureau of Personnel (PERS). A PQ finding, or a waiver to the physical standards ifNPQ, is required to be medically fit for special operations and deployable. 6. A medical waiver to the physical standards is a separate determination that would come after a medical exemption or administrative exemption, such as religious accommodation, for the COVID-19 vaccine. Accordingly, if a service member receives an exemption/accommodation to the COVID-19 vaccine for any reason they would have to engage in this subsequent process to be cleared for full duty by the Navy. That is, a service member who receives an exemption or accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, lhether for religious or secular reasons, is not PQ unless he or she obtains separate medical clearance. Moreover, the service member may also need a separate medical waiver from the Combatant Command (CCMD) to enter that commander's geographic area of responsibility. Different CCMDs may have specific requirements for vaccination based on the endemic biomedical threats that naturally exist in their geographic area as well as any biowarfare threats from adversaries. An unvaccinated member who deployed to a geographic region where there is an endemic infectious disease would put not only his health at risk, but also the health of any other service member, any partner forces with which SOF work regularly, and other host nation personnel. Thus, a determination that a member is not deployable takes into account the isk to other personnel, the risk to mission as well as the unvaccinated member. These 4 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 38 of 46 PageID 2747Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 01/24/22 Page 38 of 46 PageID 2747 98aApp037deployability determinations do not take into account whether a member is unvaccinated for secular or religious reasons; all unvaccinated service members are treated the same for purposes of determining whether they should receive a medical waiver that would render them fit for special operations duty. 7. Receiving a medical exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine does not automatically rnder a service member deployable; he or she must undergo the process described in the prior laragraph. Indeed, many of the common reasons that a service member may receive a medical exemption from an immunization requirement may also make the service-= member NPQ and nondeployable. For example, BUMEDINST 6230.15B ,r 2.6 lists immune competence, pharmacologic or radiation therapy, pregnancy and/or previous adverse response to Lunization as common reasons for a medical exemption from an immunization. 3 The first Lee conditions would almost certainly lead to a NPQ finding for NSW and an inability for the service member to get underway on conventional Navy units. The remaining example\u00ad revious adverse response to immunization-may provide the basis for a permanent medical exemption request, but as I explained in my prior declaration, ECF 44, Ex. 14 (Deel. of Lanny Littlejohn) ,r 10 (App 278-79), all requests for permanent medical exemptions from COVID-19 1accination for personnel falling under NSWC authority have been denied. Moreover, FMED \u00a7 15-105(4)(a) specifically states that \"SO personnel reporting for duty following an Jbsence of greater than 14 days due to illness or injury, hospitalization for any reason, or reported on by a medical board must have a properly documented UMO [ undersea medical 3 BUMEDINST 6230.1 SB ,r 2.6 also lists evidence of immunity based on serologic tests, documented infection, or similar circumstances as a possible basis for a medical exemption for an immunization. However, pursuant to DoD policy a prior COVID-19 infection, by itself, is not grounds for a medical exemption to the COVID-19 vaccination requirement. 5 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 39 of 46 PageID 2748Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 39 of 46 PageID 2748 99aApp038officer] evaluation to determine fitness for continued SO duty.\" Again many of the reasons a service member might receive a medical exemption for an immunization would fall into this category. This is why a service member who cannot receive the COVID-19 vaccine for medical rns (or any other reason) will still be NPQ from SO ducy until a separate medical waiver is granted by BUMED and PERS. This requirement is specifically delineated in Trident Order !124 which states: For Special Operations qualification requires a separate waiver that is in addition to waiver of the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for all service members. Id. ,i 6.d. 8. Clinical Trials. I am not aware of any NSW personnel participating in clinical research trials concerning COVID-19 vaccines or other COVID-19 medications or treatments. Furthermore, I am not aware of DoD or the Navy conducting or sponsoring any such trials or studies. See DoDI 3612.02 and SECNAVINST3900.39E CH-I (promulgating standards for human research and clinical studies conducted or sponsored by DoD and the Navy). Choosing to participate in a clinical trial outside the DoD health care system or sponsorship is larticipating in an elective medical procedure. Navy personnel are required to receive counseling from a military health care provider prior to receiving or engaging in elective medical care outside the military health care system. BUMEDINST 6320.103, Encl. 2 ,i4.a. Personnel who do not receive counseling prior to receiving or engaging in elective medical care will be 4 Trident Order #12 was issued on September 24, 2021. The directive does not set forth new policies concerning vaccination requirements or processes by which members request medical or administrative exemptions, though it does set forth deadlines for Naval Special Warfare (NSW) I?ersonnel (like for the 33 of the 35 Plaintiffs within the NSW claimancy in the above-referenced case) to submit such requests.

Case No. 4:21-CV-01236-O DECLARATION OF WILLIAM K. LESCHER I, William K. Lescher, hereby state and declare as follows: 1. I am an admiral1 in the United States Navy, currently serving as the Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO), located in Arlington, Virginia at the Pentagon. The position of VCNO is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is the second highest uniformed Officer in the Navy. I have served in this position since May 29, 2020. I make this declaration in support of the Government's motion for a stay of this Court's preliminary injunction pending appeal. The statements made in this declaration are based on my 1 The rank of\"admiral\" is lhe highest military rank in the Navy.

Preliminary Statement 2. I have reviewed the preliminary injunction order issued by this Court on January 3, 2022. I believe the Court's injunction will cause immediate harm to the Navy, and in particular to the operations of Naval Special Warfare (NSW) and Special Operations Forces (SOF), and to the national security of the United States. Operationally, in 2021, the Navy executed more than 30,000 steaming days and one million flying hours to protect America, deter conflict and keep the sea lanes open and free. The Court's injunction directly impacts the Navy's ability to carry out its responsibilities to protect and maintain the health and safety of our Force, in particular our ability to halt the spread of COVID-19 through a mandatory vaccination requirement. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated service members are at higher risk to contract COVID-19, and to develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations that remove them from their units and impact mission execution. Vaccination against COVID-19 has proven to be essential in keeping Navy units on mission by mitigating the impact of COVID-19. Fully vaccinated naval forces are required to ensure readiness to carry out Navy missions throughout the world and, if required, to engage in combat operations. Restriction of the Navy's ability to reassign unvaccinated personnel in order to mitigate COVID-19 related risks to units preparing to deploy, or that are deployed, will cause direct and immediate impact to mission execution . Further, the harm caused by this injunction is not limited to 35 unvaccinated Plaintiffs . The heath, readiness, and mission execution of broader conventional Navy units and personnel who support these personnel are threatened as well. 2 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 5 of 46 PageID 2714Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 5 of 46 PageID 2714 103aApp004Naval Background and Experience 3. As the Vice Chief of Naval Operations,2 I work in coordination with the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), the senior admiral in the U.S. Navy, 3 in the execution of his statutory duties and responsibilities as they pertain to the employment of the Navy. Those duties include recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping, training, servicing, mobilizing, demobilizing , administering, and maintaining the Navy, as will assist in the execution of any power, duty, or function of the Secretary of the Navy or the Chief of Naval Operations. Additionally, the CNO delegated several specific responsibilities to me. I oversee programs and policies that impact Sailors and their families, including health affairs, and monitor and enact polices that promote good order and discipline in the Navy. 4. l have served in the United States Navy for nearly 42 years. A 1980 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, my experience includes command of the Vipers of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light (HSL) Squadron-48, the Airwolves of HSL-40 and the Maritime Strike Wing Atlantic. As Commanding Officer, HSL-48, my responsibilities included training, preparing, and executing Seahawk helicopter detachment deployments on Navy ships deploying worldwide. As Commanding Officer, HSL--40, I was responsible for the training, evaluation, and maintenance of the Seahawk helicopter squadron that trains all East Coast Seahawk pilots in employment of this weapon system. As Commander, Maritime Strike Wing Atlantic, I was responsible for the material readiness and training of eight Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) 2 \"The [VCNO] has such authority and duties with respect to the Department of the Navy as the Chief of Naval Operations, with the approval of the Secretary or the Navy. may delegate to or prescribe for him.

Between command of the Vipers and Airwolves, I was the executive officer of Mine Countermeasures Command and Control Ship USS Inchon (MCS I 2), a 20,000 ton vessel with a crew of 700. As the second in command, I was responsible for the supervision, training and development of the crew and the daily execution of the command mission, which included training and preparing the crew for deployment, maintaining and improving operational readiness and material condition of the ship. As a flag officer, I commanded Expeditionary Strike Group 5 (ESG-5) and Task Forces 51/59 (CTF 51/59) in Bahrain, leading multiple Amphibious Ready Groups, Marine Expeditionary Units and the afloat forward staging base USS Ponce (AFSB(l)-15) in execution of theater security events, combat operations , and emergent national taskings spanning the Middle East/Central Command region. My responsibilities as ESG-5 and CTF 51/59 included muhiple events working with NSW forces embarked on my ships and interoperability exercises with partner countries. I also served as Joint Staff deputy director for resources and acquisition, deputy assistant Secretary of the Navy for budget, and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for integration of capabilitie s and resources. Specific Functions of the United States Navy 5. The United States Navy and Marine Corps comprise the Nation's principal maritime forces. Their missions are to provide globally deployable forces in order to \"secure the Nation from direct attack; secure strategic access and retain global freedom of action; strengthen existing and emerging alliances and partnerships; establish favorable security conditions; deter aggression and violence by state, non-state, and individual actors and, should deterrence fail, prosecute the full range of military operations in support of U.S. national interests.\" See 4 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 7 of 46 PageID 2716Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 7 of 46 PageID 2716 105aApp006Department of Defense 6, 'I[ 5.a. -b (attached hereto). Effective execution of all of these discrete functions is vital to the national security of the United States, and is accomplished by providing fully trained and qualified naval forces to joint commanders4 to deter aggression and, if required, engage in combat operations and win decisively. Naval Special Warfare (NSW) and Special Operations Forces (SOF) 6. Naval Special Warfare (NSW) and Special Operations Forces (SOF) are composed of Navy SEALs5 and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC). The NSW team is a multipurpose combat force organized and trained to conduct a variety of special operations missions in all environments. Navy SEALs conduct clandestine missions infiltrating their objective areas by fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, Navy surface ships, combatant craft, submarines and ground mobility vehicles. Service members designated as Navy SEALs consist of officers and enlisted members who have been designated pursuant to Navy and NSW policies. SWCC focus on infiltration and exfiltration of SEALs and other SOF to include from other Services, and they provide dedicated rapid mobility in maritime environments, as well as the ability to deliver combat craft via parachute drop. SWCC operate and maintain state-of-the-art surface craft to conduct special operations. 7. In addition to SEALs and SWCC, combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS) personnel are assigned to NSW units to support the mission. CS/CSS personnel ~ Joint commanders arc the combatant vesled with aulhority and responsibility for mili1ary operalions within their area of responsibility . The Navy and other branches of the Armed Forces provide forces to the combatant commanders to execute those responsibilities and functions. The combalant commanders exercise authority, dircclion and control over the commands and forces assigned to them and employ those forces to accomplish missions assigned to the combatant commander.

Navy EOD personnel perform missions neutralizing explosive weapons, including various weapons of mass destruction. Their duties include detonating or demolishing hazardous munitions, neutralizing various ordnance, including sea mines, torpedoes or depth charges, performing parachute or helicopter insertion operations, and clearing waterways of mines in support of our military operations. Navy Divers perform a variety of military functions, including wreckage salvage operations and underwater repairs, harbor and waterway clearance operations, assisting in construction and demolition projects, executing search and rescue missions, performing deep submergence operations, and serving as technical experts for diving operations for numerous military special operations units. 8. Service members in the NSW force are responsible for performing special operations. Special operations require unique tactics, techniques, procedures and equipment. They are often conducted in hostile, austere or diplomatically sensitive environments, and are characterized by one or more of the following: time-sensitivity, clandestine nature, low visibility, working with or through host-nation forces, greater requirements for regional orientation and cultural expertise, and a higher degree of risk. These missions often require members of the NSW force to work in close quarters where social distancing is not possible. Small NSW teams may travel for an extended duration on boats, submersibles, helicopters, aircraft, or other vehicles that are less than six feet across, and/or which have limited ventilation. Service members may be in such close quarters while traveling that they must sit shoulder-to-shoulder. 6 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 9 of 46 PageID 2718Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 9 of 46 PageID 2718 107aApp008Additionally, members may be required to operate in subsea environments and may have to share diving rebreather devices and inhale one another's exhalation . Mandatory Vaccination Requirements in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic 9. On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense directed the Secretaries of the Military Departments to immediately begin full vaccination of all members of the Armed Forces on active duty or in the Ready Reserve. The Secretary of Defense determined that mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations are necessary to protect the health and military readiness of the force. The Secretary of the Navy directed implementation of Secretary of Defense's COVID-19 vaccination mandate6 via a Department -wide administrative message (ALNAV) on August 30, 2021. The ALNA V applies to both Services within the Department of the Navy (DON), the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. The ALNA V required all active duty DON Service members, who were not already vaccinated, exempted, or currently seeking an exemption, to be fully vaccinated with an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine within 90 days of the ALNAV, and all Reserve Component personnel to be fully vaccinated within 120 days. ALNA V 062/21 <j( 4. Active duty Sailors and Marines were required to become fully vaccinated7 by November 28, 2021, and Reserve Component Sailors and Marines by December 28, 2021.

The judgment of each of the Military Services is that vaccines are the most effective tool the Armed Forces have to keep our personnel safe, fully mission capable and prepared to execute the Commander-in-Chiefs orders to protect vital United States' national interests. As of January 5, 2022, 261,504 members of the Armed Forces have contracted the COVID-19 virus, resulting in 2,320 hospitalizations and 82 deaths. Eighty of 82 members who have died were unvaccinated. Of all active duty personnel who were required to be hospitalized because of COVID-19, 0.8% received a booster shot prior to hospitalization. Separately, there have only been six active duty personnel who have received a booster and had a breakthrough COVID-19 infection that required hospitalization. Among the active duty force, 12% of those required to be hospitalized have received a primary COVID-19 vaccine without the booster. Among Reserve and National Guard service members, 97% of those hospitalized with COVID were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated; 3% of hospitalized members received primary vaccination but no booster shot; 0.2% hospitalized members had received a booster shot. 8 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 11 of 46 PageID 2720Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 11 of 46 PageID 2720 109aApp010Sending ships into combat without maximizing the crew's odds of success, such as would be the case with ship deficiencies in ordnance, radar, working weapons or the means to reliably accomplish the mission, is dereliction of duty. The same applies to ordering unvaccinated personnel into an environment in which they endanger their lives, the lives of others and compromise accomplishment of essential missions. 12. The environment in which Navy personnel operate --in close quarters for extended periods of time --make them particularly susceptible to contagious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and renders mitigation measures such as social distancing unrealistic . In mid-March 2020, the aircraft carrier USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71) was deployed to the Western Pacific Ocean, a vital geo-political center of gravity encompassing several of the world's largest militaries and five nations allied with the U.S. through mutual defense treaties. The leadership of USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT began to see several COVID-19 cases among the crew. By April 1, 2020, USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT had been pulled off mission and into Guam with approximately 1,000 crew removed from the ship, with a reduced crew remaining to maintain the nuclear reactor and other essential systems. By April 20, 2020, 4,069 Sailors had been removed from the ship out of a crew of approximately 4,800. The ship was unavailable for 51 days to maintain presence in a strategically important area which includes the world's busiest sea lanes, creating a national security vulnerability in an area vital to our national interests. When USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT finally got underway on May 21, 2020, approximately 1,800 Sailors remained in Guam. Tragically, one Sailor succumbed to the COVID-19 virus and died. 13. Even with approximately 97% of the Navy vaccinated, the COVID-19 virus can degrade units and impact mission. Last month, USS MILWAUKEE (LCS 5), with a 100% Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 12 of 46 PageID 2721Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 01/24/22 Page 12 of 46 PageID 2721 110aApp011vaccinated 100-person crew, remained in port one week beyond its schedule because several members tested positive for COVID-19. Because the full crew was vaccinated, infected personnel were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and the impact to mission accomplishment was substantially mitigated compared to the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT's experience of more than 4,000 crew removed from the ship and a 51-day loss of mission. Given the hospitalizations and death statistics cited above, the MILW AUKEE's minor deployment delay would likely have been far worse with unvaccinated personnel. The MILWAUKEE is one example of a Navy manning model where each individual crew member has a high level of responsibility with little redundancy. The medical staff of the MILWAUKEE consists of only two Navy Hospital Corpsman, comparable to an Emergency Medical Technician in the civilian setting. There is little ability on ship to care for a service member with severe COVID symptoms. If a service member were to develop severe symptoms on this type of ship, it would require a return to port or an emergency medical evacuation by helicopter. Helicopter medical evacuation is not always viable due to the location of the ship and the limited range of helicopters. At the deployable unit level, NSW, EOD, and diver personnel operate in units that can be as small as a squad of four personnel. Medical evacuations in these small units can be even less practical and significantly more damaging than the loss of an equal number of crew on a ship the size of the MILWAUKEE. 14. The types of missions conducted by SEALs, SWCC, EOD and divers cannot be conducted remotely. A SEAL assigned to perform a counterterrorism mission in a foreign country cannot perform that task from home; a SWCC cannot drive a combatant craft and transport SEALs in a telework status; an explosive ordnance disposal technician -whose job it is to disarm and dispose of explosives-cannot perform that task remotely. Similarly , the arduous 10 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 13 of 46 PageID 2722Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 13 of 46 PageID 2722 111aApp012training necessary to prepare NSW personnel for these missions cannot be performed remotely. It is not possible for a Navy Diver to remotely prepare compressed air and oxygen tanks for personnel to complete their training dives. A safety diver must be physically present during a high-risk training evolution that may require rescue divers or oxygen technicians. In particular, Navy Divers assigned to NSW must be able to operate a diving recompression chamber- a small confined space where the Navy Diver must be in the chamber to assist with the personnel casualty -which cannot be done remotely. SEAL trainers cannot oversee dangerous swim or survival training from a physically distanced location. NSW personnel also routinely interact with the greater Navy population, on ships and aircraft, and in dining facilities and office environments across the globe. They are required to deploy with no-notice. NSW, EOD and diver training and operations necessitate our service members interact in close-quarters, confined spaces, and under conditions where telework, social distancing, and mask-wearing are not reliable mitigation options. Immediate Harm to Readiness and Mission Accomplishment 15. The preliminary injunction forbids the Navy from applying MANMED \u00a7 15- l 05(3)(n)(9), NA V AD MIN 225/21, NA V ADMIN 256/21 and Trident Order# 12. Order 26, ECF No. 66. MANMED \u00a7 15-l05(3)(n)(9) states that personnel who choose not to receive required vaccinations will be disqualified from special operations duty. NAVADMIN 225/21 provides guidance for disposition of offenses involving Navy service members who are not fully vaccinated by the required deadlines. Navy Service members who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine, absent a pending or approved exemption, are required to be processed for administrative separation .8 NAVADMIN 225/21 '( 2.

The order specifically references actions that Plaintiffs allege are being taken against them while they await a decision on their religious accommodation requests, actions such as restrictions on travel, access to non-work activities, unpleasant assignments, and being relieved of leadership duties. Order 26, ECF No. 66. This aspect of the order is intrusive and harmful to Navy operations, including deployment decisions. In the Navy, .. adverse action\" refers to an action that is punitive or the action itself has a direct adverse impact on one's career such as a court martial or discharge. The Court's order, however, indicates that routine personnel actions, such as assignment, official travel and specific duties, are adverse decisions. Contrary to the Court's apparent understanding, temporarily reassigning personnel to other units because they are unvaccinated, regardless of the reason they are unvaccinated (e.g., medical exemption, religious accommodation, or pending exemption request) is not an adverse action but a step to protect the health of the whole unit and maintain mission readiness. The Court's injunction appears to require the Navy to leave unvaccinated NSW, EOD, and diver personnel in their units, performing their same duties and deploying on missions regardless of the known risk to personnel and mission. Such an injunction will degrade NSW, EOD, and diver mission readiness, breakdown good order and discipline within the NSW force, unnecessarily limit the Navy's ability to conduct daily operations and operational missions, and could clearly result in mission failure in contingencies and crises that cause harm to national security. 17. NSW personnel must be fully medically ready and at peak fitness given that their training and missions are physically demanding and arduous. It is vital that all members of the NSW force be medically fit to perform daily operations and to train or deploy on short notice. Regardless of their current assignment, all naval forces, NSW in particular, must be ready to 13 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 16 of 46 PageID 2725Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 16 of 46 PageID 2725 114aApp015respond to contingencies and crises around the world. All NSW personnel are expected to meet this requirement, whether in a training status, on instructional duty, or at a headquarters, as the mission of NSW is to be ready to provide maritime SOF to conduct full spectrum operations to support national objectives. The Navy could easily require Navy Special Warfare Command to mobilize personnel outside from any unit, regardless of the planned deployment cycles of a unit or the currently assigned duties of NSW personnel to respond to the full range of contingencies and crises. Medical conditions or illness create risk, both medical and operational, not only for the service member afflicted, but for other members of the unit. As a result, unvaccinated personnel in a unit degrade the force health protection conditions in the unit, placing personnel in the unit at risk and degrading the unit's ability to safely conduct operations, regardless of the scope of the operation. The following publicly available mission event illustrates how rapidly a NSW unit can go from steady state in the United States to deploying forward on a mission of the highest difficulty, requiring peak medical, physical and mental readiness. This example illustrates the rapid manner in which a contingency or crisis could unfold, and although more than a decade old, is used due to the unclassified classification of my declaration. 18. On April 8, 2009, armed Somali pirates boarded the U.S.-flagged container ship, Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean, taking the crew, composed of U.S. citizens, hostage and making ransom demands. USS BAINBRIDGE (DDG-96) was the first ship of the international counter-piracy task force to respond. BAINBRIDGE's commanding officer realized he needed additional capabilities beyond what he had available on the ship. In response, on short notice, a SEAL team flew 8,000 miles from the United States to USS BAINBRIDGE and were recovered onboard. By the evening of April 12, 2009, the situation escalated and SEALs on BAINBRIDGE eliminated the threat to the remaining hostage, Maersk Alabama Captain 14 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 17 of 46 PageID 2726Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 17 of 46 PageID 2726 115aApp016Phillips, who was subsequently rescued. This is but one example, using a well-publicized mission, that illustrates how an unvaccinated member would put himself, his teammates, the conventional forces and the mission at great risk. While NSW personnel may be assigned to various units with various mission-sets, all naval forces must be ready to respond to global contingencies and crises on short notice. 19. If this type of crisis or contingency occurred today, with the Court's preliminary injunction in place, the Navy could be required to deploy a SEAL team with one or more unvaccinated members, risking a COVID-19 outbreak within that unit or on the host Navy destroyer. Destroyer crews, and others embarked aboard, sleep in confined shared berthing spaces, are in close proximity in passageways, and eat meals in a communal galley. An unvaccinated service member is not only more likely to contract COVID-19, but to experience significant disease symptoms, impact the mission and spread the disease to others. 20. Navy ships have limited health care facilities. A Sailor experiencing severe COVID symptoms would require the ship to pull into port instead of executing its mission. NSW forces often deploy in countries with little or no healthcare support structure and in remote areas where healthcare is scarce. This is why there has been a long-standing requirement for all members of the NSW force to be fully medically ready to deploy. A small number of SOF medical personnel provide limited medical support and patient movement; therefore, any encumbrance placed on that limited capability unnecessarily puts the mission and the force at\u00ad risk. While some SEALs are trained to perform emergency, life-saving procedures in remote and hostile environments, those personnel are not physicians or nurses. Unlike doctors and nurses, formal civilian medical licenses are not required for them. They do not generally have the capability, capacity or training to use a ventilator. Additionally, they do not have access to this 15 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 18 of 46 PageID 2727Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 18 of 46 PageID 2727 116aApp017equipment in the types of austere environments in which the NSW units operate. If a deployed team member contracts COVID-19, there is a strong possibility that the necessary equipment or treatment would not be readily available. Further, if medical evacuation is necessary for a member of the unit, this creates additional risk not only to the mission, but places those service members executing medical evacuation at a risk of harm to themselves such as when the member requires transport from a hostile, remote or diplomatically sensitive areas. 21. Redirecting these assets and their crew to perform preventable evacuations results in a degradation of the Navy's ability to accomplish its primary missions and incurs collateral impacts. Medical evacuations often require one or more member from the service member's unit to accompany the evacuated service member. The loss of even one member can degrade the effectiveness of small NSW units and may compromise the mission. This is similarly the case for SWCC personnel, who routinely operate with a crew of as little as four personnel on a combatant craft. Every member of a SEAL team is vital. 22. Unvaccinated NSW personnel put conventional Navy forces at risk as well. Navy SEALs are one of the most versatile elements of the SOF across all branches of the military services, in part, because the Navy can deliver them to their mission locations through a variety of conventional means (e.g., fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, surface ships and submarines) . All of these means of delivery are confined spaces in which social distancing is impractical. Because NSW personnel rely on conventional Navy forces to support their missions, any unvaccinated NSW personnel will put the crew of those conventional forces at unnecessary risk as well. The Navy must balance the risk to unvaccinated individuals and vaccinated personnel alike. That risk calculation led to the mandatory vaccination mandate and associated personnel policies pertaining to the COVlD-19 pandemic . It is imperative for the entire force, including 16 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 19 of 46 PageID 2728Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 19 of 46 PageID 2728 117aApp018every member of NSW, to be vaccinated and ready to deploy and execute assigned missions on short notice. 23. The capabilities NSW personnel provide include crisis response, support to forward presence operations, support to conventional Naval forces at sea and in training, support to Law Enforcement agencies and clandestine insertion operations. EOD personnel provide critical safety and response to units using live ordnance; Navy divers, EOD and SEALs support underwater surveys and route clearances. SEALs conduct insertions and extractions by sea, air or land; they capture high-value enemy personnel and terrorists around the world, carry out small-unit direct-action missions against military targets and perform underwater reconnaissance and strategic sabotage. SEALs, SWCC, EOD and divers frequently deploy to foreign countries to train partners and allies and participate in exercises. Reducing the Navy's ability to apply long-standing, proven medical readiness principles to this small, elite community will clearly negatively impact the NSW force's ability to conduct their operations and could have significant negative effects to the NSW force's ability to respond to large-scale contingencies or crises. This would damage the national security interests of the United States and our foreign allies and partners. 24. These concerns apply if the injunction requires the Navy to maintain these 35 Plaintiffs in their current status while an appeal is pending. Of the 35 Plaintiffs, 18 are assigned to nine different parent commands and may deploy anywhere in the world in the immediate future to perform the type of missions described. 15 Plaintiffs are assigned to the NSW Center or a NSW Center subordinate command, with 14 of them assigned to NSW Advanced Training 17 Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 Filed 01/24/22 Page 20 of 46 PageID 2729Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 87 01/24/22 Page 20 of 46 PageID 2729 118aApp019Command (ATC); 10 some as instructors who necessarily have close contact with ATC students in courses to prepare them for NSW operations and some as students attending an advanced training course before returning to their current or prospective assignment. Two Plaintiffs are currently assigned to non-NSW training commands. Because the court's order prohibits them from being temporarily reassigned, the 14 unvaccinated personnel at NSW ATC have close contact with fellow instructors and students. These students then circulate among the larger NSW community as soon as their courses at ATC end. Simply put, close quarters contact during training creates the opportunity to contract COVID-19 from the unvaccinated instructors at A TC detachments. The unvaccinated instructors can spread COVID-19 to dozens of candidates in training, and qualified SEALs, SWCCs, and other personnel, including fellow instructors, at NSW ATC training courses who will promptly return to their primary units or interact with additional training classes. 25. In summary, the Navy's judgment is that COVID-19 vaccines are a critical defense again~t COVID-19 and mitigate risk both to our force and to our mission. This judgment takes into account the environments our service members operate in, the operations the Navy conducts, and the absence of other effective COVID-19 mitigation measures in the environments in which we operate. The COVID-19 virus has had a proven substantial impact on Navy unit readiness. The Court's order, which bars implementation of the vaccine requirement and requires the Navy to keep service members it has determined are not medically fit for deployment in a ready to deploy status, will undermine military readiness through the spread of disease and cause ao ATC's mission is to provide slandardized and accredited individual training and education for qualified NSW and supporl personnel, U.S. SOF (i.e., from other Services), parlner nation SOF and other personnel, as required for NSW Operations .

Case No. 4:21- CV-01236-O DECLARATION OF CHRISTOPHER D. BROWN I, Christopher D. Brown, hereby state and declare as follows: 1. I am a Captain in the United States Navy, currently serving as the Chief of Staff of U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC), located in Coronado, California, whose mission is to provide maritime special operations forces (SOF) to conduct full spectrum operations, unilaterally or with partners, to support national objectives. I make this declar ation in my official capacity , based upon my personal knowledge and upon information that has been provided to me in the course of my official duties. 2. I have been assigned to my current position since September 24, 2021. Prior to my current assignment, I served as the Commander of Naval Special Warfare Group ONE; 127a2 Director of Operations at Special Operations Command -Central; Commanding Officer of SEAL Team ONE; Commander of Special Operations Task Force-Iraq; and Deputy Commander of Joint Special Operations Task Force-Philippines. A s part of my duties currently, I am responsible for supervising and coordinating the work of the staff of U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command. 3. Naval Special Warfare (NSW) SOF are composed of Navy SEALs1 and Special Warfare Combatant -Craft Crewmen (SWCC) . The NSW team is a multipurpose combat force organized and trained to conduct a variety of special operations missions in all environments. a. Navy SEALs conduct clandestine missions infiltrating their objective areas by fixed - and rotary- wing aircraft, Navy surface ships, combatant craft, submarines and ground mobility vehicles. Service members designated as Navy SEALs consists of officers and enlisted members who have been designated pursuant to Navy and NSW policies. b. SWCC focus on infiltration and exfiltration of SEALs and other SOF, and they provide dedicated rapid mobility in maritime environments, as well as the ability to deliver co mbat craft via parachute drop. S WCC operate and maintain state -of-the- art surface craft to conduct special operat ions. c. In addition to SEALs and SWCC, combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS) personnel are assigned to NSW units to support the mission. CS personnel include officers and enlisted Service members who routinely infiltrate to a target area with the SEAL or SWCC combat force, such as those identified in Plaintiffs' complaint (i.e., Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) personnel), as well as CSS officers and enlisted S ervice members performing a variety of other military functions (e.g. , 1 The term \"SEAL\" refers to \"Sea, Air, Land.\" 128a3 chaplains, medical personnel, mobile communications teams, tactical cryptologic support, etc.). d. Navy EOD perform missions neutralizing explosive weapons in almost every environment. Their duties include detonating or demolishing hazardous munitions, neutralizing various ordnance, including sea mines, torpedoes or depth charges, perform ing parachute or helicopter insertion operations, and clearing mines in support of our military operations. e. Navy Divers perform a variety of military functions, including wreckage salvage operations and underwater repairs, harbor and waterway clearance operations, assisting in construction and demolition projects, executing search and rescue missions, performing deep submergence operations, and serving as mission critical experts for diving operations for numerous military special operations units. 4. NSW personnel routinely deploy a round the globe and may be assigned to units throughout the United States or in foreign countries ; however, NSW personnel are assigned predominantly to commands located in three cities: Coronado, CA, Virginia Beach, VA, and Pearl Harbor, HI. 2 There are no NSW commands located in Fort Worth, TX. Trident Order #12 5. Service members in the NSW community are subject to Department of Defense and Department of the Navy policies. Following the Secretary of Defense directive of August 24, 2021, and the issuances of ALNAV 062/21 and NAVADMIN 190/21, Trident Order 3 #12 was 2 See Naval Special Warfare Command, Components , https://www.nsw.navy.mil/CONTACT/Components/ (last accessed Dec. 1, 2021). 3 NSWC promulgates community -wide policies and communications to subordinate units through \"Trident Orders,\" similar to Department of the Navy administrative messages (\"ALNAVs\") or Service- wide administrative messages (\"NAVAD MINs\"). 129a4 iss ued on S eptember 24, 2021. Trident Order #12 was issued to provide NSW personnel a consolidated reference to several policies relevant to the mandatory vaccination requirement, and to implement specific timelines for personnel to comply with the requireme nt. Specifically, NSW personnel were directed to report for vaccination or to receive an administrative counseling to comply with NAVADMIN 190/21 by October 7, 2021. Personnel were also directed to receive their first shot (if planning to become fully vacc inated using a two -dose series) or initiate a request for either a medical or administrative exemption by October 17, 2021. These dates were established to ensure the vaccine requirement was efficiently executed, while also affording NSW members both time and guidance to submit exemption requests, if applicable. 6. Trident Order #12 also stated that Service members with pending medical or administrative exemption requests would not receive the administrative counseling unless the request was denied. Exemption requests for either medical or administrative (including religious) reasons are adjudicated in accordance with the applicable Navy policy. Trident Order #12 directed Service members to contact their medical provider for questions about medical exemption s, or to contact the cognizant chaplain's office for assistance with their religious accommodation request. 7. Trident Order #12 also reminded SOF of a pre-existing policy outlined in the Navy's Manual of the Medical Department (\"MANMED\"), Chapter 15, Physical Examinations and Standards for Enlistment, Commission, and Special Duty. MANMED \u00a7 15 -105 relates to the medical disqualification of special operations personnel (also known as SOF) refusing to receive recommended vaccines based solely on their per sonal or religious beliefs. MANMED \u00a7 15- 105(4)(n)(9). Additionally, SOF were advised that a waiver from medical requirements under MANMED \u00a7 15 -105 for special operations personnel requires a separate waiver , in addition to 130a5 any medical or administrative ex emption request from the COVID- 19 vaccine requirement. This advisory was included in Trident Order #12 to ensure that all special operations personnel understood the unique medical requirement s applicable to them, because these unique requirement s for SOF were not addressed in ALNAV 062/21 or NAVADMIN 190/21 . 8. Since the issuance of Trident Order #12, no adverse administrative or disciplinary actions have been taken against NSW personnel based on that order. Religious Accommodation Requests 9. Navy Service members requesting a religious accommodation from vaccine requirements must comply with BUPERSINST 1730.1A and MILPERSMAN 1730-020. With the exception of the MANMED waiver referenced above, there are no additional requirements or procedures imposed on members within the NSW force . Requests for religious accommodation are initiated by the member and forwarded via the first commanding officer (if an O -6) 4 or immediate superior in command (ISIC) to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education) (\"DCNO N1\"). 5 Trident Order #12 reiterates the Navy policy commands with commanders in the grade of O-6 route exemption requests directly to DCNO N1, and only has direct subordinate commanders (i.e., Echelon III commands) copy NSWC Force Medical on exemption endorsements for awareness of requests from the force. Administrative Actions 10. I am aware of the adverse actions Plaintiffs claim they may face if they choose not to comply with the Navy's COVID-19 vaccine directive. Pls.' Compl. \u00b6 110. The potential adverse actions Plaintiffs recite are almost entirely outside the authority or discretion of NSWC. 4 In the Navy, an officer in the grade of O -6 is a captain. 5 DCNO N1 is identified by the alternate designation of CNP (Chief of Naval Personnel) in MILPERSMAN 1730 - 020). DCNO N1 and CNP interchangeable acronyms and refer to the same position and official. The current DCNO N1 is Vice Admiral John Nowell, Jr. 131a6 Specifically, authority to refer criminal charges to a court -martial or for disposition at non- judicial punishment is withheld to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. See NAVADMIN 225/21 \u00b6 5.b. Furthermore, the policy outlined in NAVADMIN 225/21 - that members who do not comply with the vaccine requirement are required to be processed for administrative separation - is not a policy requirement imposed on NSW personnel by NSWC. T his is a Navy -wide policy, and each Service member's case ultimately fall s under the cognizance of the Chief of Naval Personnel as the show cause authority (for officers) and separation authority (for enlisted). Se e id. \u00b6 5.d. Similarly, NAVADMIN 225/21 and NAVADMIN 226/21 outline other administrative actions , such as relief for cause for command leaders and promotion or advancement delays, that are mandatory administrative actions for those refusing the vaccine. 11. Navy Service members with specialized training or assignments may qualify for Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP) as outlined in Chief of Naval Operations Instruction (\"OPNAVINST\") 1160.6C and the implementing NAVADMIN. 6 Within the NSW force , members occu pying specific billets7 may be entitled to SDAP. In the event the Service member is removed from the billet, the member may no longer qualify for SDAP. See NAVADMIN 256/21. Similarly, certain Navy Enlisted Classifications 8 (NECs ) across the Navy can quali fy for enlistment bonuses and other financial incentives , which generally require additional obligated service. In the event a Service member fails to fulfill his or her required obligated service, the Service member may be subject to recoupment of the bonus or special pay that he or she 6 The NAVADMIN announcing SDAP recertification is revised annually. The current NAVADMIN 146/21 was released on July 2, 2021, and can be found at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Messages/NAVADMIN/NAV2021/NAV21146.txt . 7 A billet is a military term for the title of job or position . 8 The Navy Enlisted Classif ication (NEC) system supplements the enlisted personnel structure in identifying personnel on active or inactive duty and billets in manpower authorizations. NEC codes identify a non -rating (occupation) wide skill, knowledge, aptitude, or qualification that must be documented to identify both people and billets for management purposes 132a7 received . These are not NSWC policies, but Service policies that are generally applicable to members of the Navy. See NAVADMIN 256/21 \u00b6 8.a. (directing that bonuses, special pays and incentive pays become unearned as soon as the member is removed from the assignment or his or her associated NEC is removed). I am aware Plaintiffs claim that they may be subject to recoupment for costs of training as a Navy SEA L, SWCC, EOD technician, or Diver, which can be substantial. In my 27 years of experience, serving across various NSW commands and leading personnel , I am not familiar with any policy that would subject personnel to recoupment for costs associated with training, even where the service member is separated prior to fulfilling his obligated service under adverse circumstances. I am familiar with instances where the Service has required recoupment for higher education at universities or colleges where the member has not completed obligated service requirements, but that is diffe rent that Department of Defense military training. 12. Additionally, I am aware that Plaintiffs have alleged that they may be subject to the administrative removal of their NEC. Pls.' Mem. in Support of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 28-29, ECF No. 16. Removal of a member's NEC may also impact the member's eligibility for SDAP and the ir eligibility to wear the SEAL or SWCC insignia (i.e., the Trident pin for Navy SEALs). Authority to wear the SEAL or SWCC insignia is governed by MILPERSMAN articles 1220- 085 and 1220-090, respectively. Achievement of the SEAL or SWCC qualification entitles the member to wear the applicable insignia. If a member's NEC is removed for disciplinary or administrative action, however, the member is no longer authorized to wear the insignia. For NSW personnel, t he process for the administrative removal of a Service member's NEC is outlined in Commander, Naval Special Warfare Command Instruction (\"COMNAVSPECWARCOM INST\") 1221.1A, Enlisted Special Warfare Operator/Special 133a8 Warfare Boat Operator Navy Enlisted Classification Review Guidance .9 A commander may initiate revocation of the Service Member's NEC for the following reasons: (a) Non -performance of duties. Failure or unwillingness to perform duties required of the rating. (b) Failure to maintain rating eligibility such as: (1) Permanent revocation of a member's security clearance. (2) Permanent physical disability. (c) Professional performance failure such as: (1) Willful dereliction of duty. (2) Breaches of Ammunition, Arms, and Explosive, diving, parachute, or ordinance safety regulations, or Operations Security violations. (3) Loss of CO's faith and confidence in the member's ability to exercise sound judgment, reliability, and personal conduct. (d) SEAL or SWCC Qualification . Failure to attain SO (SEAL) or SB (SWCC) qualification as specified in references (e) and (f). (e) Alcohol Abuse. (f) Drug Abuse. Id. \u00b6 3.a. 13. However, t he administrative removal of a Service member's NEC is not to be used as a punitive measure or as an alternative to disciplinary or administrative action. Id. \u00b6 3.b. Moreover, COM NAVSPECWARCOM INST 1221.1A provides that \"[i]f a Sailor is unsuitable for continued naval service, appropriate administrative separation procedures shall be followed.\" Because NAVADMIN 225/21 directs mandatory separation processing for Service members who refuse the vaccine and who do not have a pending or an authorized exemption, removal of the member's NEC under COMNAVSPECWARCOMINST 1221.1A is neither warranted nor necessary. Therefore, it is not anticipated, nor desired, that this procedure would be used in addition to the various required administrative actions for Service members refusing the vaccine. Deployability and Training 9 The board procedures outlined are commonly referred to as a \"Trident Review Board.\" 134a9 14. Service members in the NSW community are responsible for performing special operations. Special ope rations require unique tacti cs, techniques, procedures, and equipment. They are often conducted in hostile or diplomatically sensitive environments, and are characterized by one or more of the f ollowing: time -sensitivity, clandestine or covert nature, low visibility, work ing with or through host-nation forces, greater requiremen ts for regional orientation and cultural expertise, and a higher degree of risk . These missions often require members of the NSW community to work in close quarters where social distancing is not possible. For example, a team may travel on boats, submersibles, helicopters, aircraft, or other vehicles that are not even six feet across , and/ or which have limited ventilation . Service members may be in such close quarters that they are literally sitting shoulder -to-shoulder or chest -to-back . Additionally, NSW personnel may be required to operate in subsea environments and may even have to share closed -circuit diving rebreathers, where COVID -19 could imperil one another because members are forced to share breathing devices, and literally inhale one another's exhalation . Moreover, the types of missions outlined above cannot be conducted remotely . For example, a SEAL assigned to per form a counterterrorism mission in a foreign country cannot perform that task from home; nor could a SWCC drive a combatant craft and transport SEALs in a telework status ; just like an explosive ordnance disposal technician\u2014whose job it is to disarm and dispose of explosives\u2014cannot perform that task remotely . Similarly, the arduous training necessary to prepare NSW personnel for these missions cannot be performed remotely. Training and operations necessitate our Service members interact in close -quarters, confined spaces, and under extreme conditions where telework, social distancing, and mask- wearing are not realistic options ; specifically, mask wearing is not mission appropriate for select missions . 135a10 15. SOF of te n operate in countri es with little or no healthcare support structure and in remote areas exposed to health threats. Proactive force health protection measures are often essential to minimize health risks to special operations personnel. When deployed, health support available to special operations forces is limited to a small number of medical personnel with enhanced medical skills, to include emergency treatment, preventive medicine, and limited dental care. SOF medical personnel can plan and conduct specialized medical support and patient movement; however, special operations forces may require support from conventional forces in the event a medical situation is beyond the limited capacity of the deployed medical personnel. Hospitalization capabili ties are generally not available and special operations forces must rely on either available theater health services assets or lo cal host nation capabilities if hospitalization becomes an urgent necessity . In many instances, the capab ilities of the local or host nation are far lesser than those available in the United States, therefore the risk of serious illness may be greater. If a team member contracts COVID -19, there is a possibility that the necessary equipment (e.g., oxygen, ventilators) or treatments would not be readily available. Additionally, quarantine or self-isolation are generally not going to be an option, and impact to the mission would be unavoidable. Further, if it became necessary to medically evacuate (\"medevac\") a member of the unit, this creates additional risk both to the mission (i.e., it encumbers the entire force and medevac structure) , and places those Service members executing the medivac at a significant risk of harm or death themselves (i.e., if the member r equires transport in a remote or diplomatically sensitive area, or under hostile fire). Every member of a NSW formation is vital, therefore, in the event any one of them were to contract COVID -19, it would necessarily have an adverse impact to the mission and to his fellow team members. 136a11 16. Risk of harm or death are inherent to the training and missions performed by NSW personnel. Given the missions performed by SOF, it is vital that a member of the NSW community be medically fit to train or deploy on short notice . Medical conditions can create additional risk, both medical and operational, not only for the Service member afflicted, but for other members of the unit. Consequently, unvaccinated NSW personnel are subject to limitations on their deploy ment eligibility or training eligibility by virtue of necessity . Additionally, a member's vaccination status may preclude travel or attendance for training courses depending on current theater and Service travel polic ies and any requirements specific to the training course itself. For example, if a mission is to take place in a partner nation, those nations may have their own vaccination requirements that preclude participation by unvaccinated individuals. Commands are also obligated to assess the cost, both financially and administratively, associated with restriction of movement that the member may incur by virtue of being unvaccinated. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed this 9th day of December , 2021. /s/ CHRISTOPHER D.

I am a captain in the United States Navy, currently serving as the Acting Deputy Director, Military Personnel Pl ans and Policy Division (OPNAV N13B), located in Arlington, Virginia. I make this declaration in my of ficial capacity, based upon my personal knowledge and upon information that has been provided to me in the course of my official duties. 2. I have been assigned to this posi tion since September 2021. My permanent assignment is as Branch Head, Enlisted Plans and Policy (OPNAV N132). Prior to my current assignment, I served as Deputy Director and Comptroller, Fiel d Support Activity (BSO-11) at the Washington Navy Yard. 138a2 (a) I have been a member of the U.S. Na vy since 1982, beginning my career as a Deck Seaman onboard USS Point Loma (AGDS-2) in San Diego, CA, before becoming an enlisted Disbursing Clerk. I was commi ssioned in 1991 after earning a bachelor's degree from the University of San Diego through the Navy's former Broadened Opportunity for Officer Selection and Training (BOOST). Since then, I have serv ed as the Communications Officer aboard USS Acadia (AD-42); Company Officer and adjunc t professor at the U.S. Naval Academy; Administrative and Manpower Officer for U.S. Naval Support Activity, Naples, Italy;.

Number of religious accommodation requests seeking exemption from COVID-19 vaccination. As of December 9, 2021, Navy personnel have submitted 3,259 religious accommodation requests seeking to be admini stratively exempted from the COVID-19 vaccination. There are 300 appeals of denials of religious accommodation requests pending. No appeals have been fully adjudicated as of December 9, 2021. Members with pending exemption requests or appeals are not subject to adverse administrative action whil e requests are pending. 139a3 4.

I am a Vice Admiral in the United States Navy, currently serving as the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Operations, Plans and Strategy (OPNAV N3/N5) , located in Arlingt on, Virginia at the Pentagon . I make this declar ation in my official capacity , based upon my personal knowledge and upon information that has been provided to me in the course of my official duties. 2. I have been assigned to my current position since August 6, 2021 . Prior to my current assignment, I served as Commander, U.S. SEVENTH Fleet ; the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfighting Requirements ; the Dire ctor, Undersea Warfare Division ; and 141a 2 Commander, Naval Mine & Anti -Submarine Warfare Command . I graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1986, and earned master's degrees from Catholic University and the Naval War Colle ge. As part of my duties currently, I am responsible for serving as the principal advisor to the Chief of Naval Operations1 (CNO) on operational matters, strategy, policy, and plans; international politico -military matters; and the current operational status of naval forces. As part of my responsibility for the current operational status of naval forces, CNO delegated responsibil ity to me for the Navy's COVID -19 policies. Those responsibilities include tracking the number of COVID -19 cases across the Navy, implementing Secretary of the Navy COVID - 19 plans and polic ies, planning for and ensuring the appropriate initial distributio n of COVID -19 vaccines, coordination across the Navy and with the other services on COVID -19 plans and policy , and providing input to the Secretary of the Navy on proposed COVID -19 plans and policy. 3. On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense directed the Secretaries of the Military Departments to immediately begin full vaccination of all members of the Armed Forces under DoD authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve.

The requirement to obtain f ull vaccination constitutes a lawful order under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) , and failure to comply may result in punitive or adverse administrative action, or both. ALNAV 062/21 \u00b6 5. 4. The United States Navy issued service -specific guidance via a separate administrative message (\" NAVADMIN \") on September 1, 2021. NAVADMIN 190/21 outlines Navy policy concerning the mandatory vaccination of Navy service members, vaccination administration and reporting requirements, and general guidance related to logistics and distribution of vaccines. The policy reiterates that COVID -19 vaccination \"is mandatory for all DoD service members who are not medically or administratively exempt\" under existing Navy policy . NAVADMIN 190/2 1 \u00b6 2, 3.a. Refusal to be come fully vaccinated against COVID -19 without an approved or pending exemption constitutes a failure to obey a lawful order and is punishable under Article 92, UCMJ .

On October 13, 2021, the Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP) was designated as NAVADMIN 190/21 \u00b6 3.d. provides t hat service members may seek two types of exemptions , medical and administrative. Medical exemptions are governed by Army Regulation (AR) 40-562, which is a consolidated Military S ervices regulation implemented by the Navy and Marine Corps via Bureau of Medicine (BUMED) Instruction 6230.15B (hereinafter BUMEDINST 6230.15B) . Medical personnel are responsible for reviewing and granting medical exemptions , whereas non-medical personnel (sometimes with the assistance of advising medical personnel) are responsible for reviewing and granting administrative exemptions . BUMEDINST 6230.15B, 2 -6. 6. The policy provides the following with respect to medical exemptions: a. Medical exemptions . A medical exemption includes any medical contraindication relevant to a specific vaccine or other medication. Health care providers will determine a medical exemption based on the health of the vaccine candidate and the nature of the immunization under co nsideration. Medical exemptions may be temporary (up to 365 days) or permanent. Standard exemption codes appear in appendix C. (1) General examples of medical exemptions include the following \u2014 (a) Underlying health condition of the vaccine candidate (for example, based on immune competence, pharmacologic or radiation therapy, pregnancy and/or previous adverse response to immunization). (b) Evidence of immunity based on serologic tests, documented infection, or similar circumstances. (c) An individual's clinical case is not readily definable. In such cases, consult appropriate medical specialists, including specialists in immunization health care. AR 40 -562, 2 -6a.(1) , (emphasis added). 144a 5 As the policy reflects, t hese are just examples of situations when health care providers may determine a medical exemption is warranted , but each exemption request is an individual determination based on the health of the individual and the disease at issue. Additionally, although there are some diseases for which serologic or other tests may be used to identify pre - existing im munity , there are some diseases for which these tests may not be used in such manner .4 7. Service members who seek a medical exemption first submit their request to Navy medical pro viders who follow BUMED policy w hen processing those requests . A Navy medical provider is defined as any uniformed, Navy -employed civilian, or contract -licensed independent medical practitioner whose scope of practice encompasses immunization healthcare d elivery, and Independent Duty Corpsmen. BUMEDNOTE 6300, \u00b6 7.b. Navy medical providers have the authority to grant temporary medical exemptions for pregnancy or other temporary medical contraindications. BUMED Notice 6150 (Sept. 21, 2021) . For requests fo r permanent exemptions, Navy medical providers have authority to disapprove temporary or permanent medical exemption requests that do not meet clinical contraindications for the COVID -19 vaccine . BUMEDNOTE 6300, \u00b6 6.c. Service members who are actively par ticipating in COVID -19 clinical trials are exempt from mandatory vaccination until the trial is complete. NAVADMIN 190/21 \u00b6 3.d.(2). 8. For either a temporary or permanent medical exemption request, medical providers evaluate the patient for medical contraindications based on documented medical history and/or clinical evaluation, and an assessment of the benefits and risks to the patient. 4 The AR states, \"Screening for immunity. For some vaccine -preventable diseases, serologic or other tests can be used to identify pre -existing immunity from prior infections or immunizations that may eliminate unnecessary immunizations.\" AR 40 -562, 2-1.g (emphasis added). 145a 6 BUMEDNOTE 6300 of September 3, 2021 , Clinical Consultation Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccine Permanent Exemption (published September 3, 2021). Additionally, medical provider s are encouraged to request expert consultation by an immunizations specialist, when necessary. Medical contraindications for the COVID -19 vaccine include : (a) A naphylaxis from a previous COVID -19 vaccine or COVID -19 vaccine ingredient; (b) M yocarditis or pericarditis after COVID -19 vaccin e administration or infection; (c) T emporary association of Stevens -Johnson Syndrome or Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome that cannot be attributed to another underlying cause within 6 weeks of COVID -19 vacci ne administration or infection; (d) Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) after COVID -19 vaccine administration ; (e) P ersistent c linical symptoms lasting 4 or more weeks following a COVID -19 infection that cannot be attributed to another underlying cause after evaluatio n and focused workup (\"Long COVID \"). Id. In the Clinical Consultation Guidance , providers are also encouraged to c onsult CDC guidance.5 5 An example of CDC clinical co nsiderations includes: If you were treated for COVID -19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID -19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more qu estions about getting a COVID -19 vaccine. If you or your child has a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children ( MIS- A or MIS-C), consider delaying vaccination until you or your child have recovered from being sick and for 90 days a fter the date of diagnosis of MIS -A or MIS -C. Learn more about the clinical considerations for people with a history of multisystem MIS -C or MIS -A. 146a 7 9. Medical rationale for disapproval based on serology : Serological test results that shows the presence of antibodies from a prior COVID -19 infection, standing alone, will not be a basis for a permanent medical exemption. S erologic testing, as a means to determine immunity, has no t been scientifically validated , and evidence suggests that prior infection does not prevent later infection. 6 Although AR 40 -562 indicate s that serology screening tests for immunity may be warranted, it applies to diseases or conditions where it has been established that serologic tests are able to determine one's immunological status .7 AR 40 -562 contemplates that serologic or other tests might be appropriate to determine immunity for some diseases, but n ot all vaccine - preventable diseases. AR 40 -562 \u00b6 2-1.g. In contrast to a disease such as varicella (\"chicken pox\"), where prior infection usually provides \"immunity for life\" and a second occurrence is uncommon, prior COVID -19 infection does not provide s imilar immunity. See CDC, \" Chicken Pox for Healthcare Professionals, available at https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/hcp/index.html ; Alyson M. Cavanaugh, et al., Reduced Risk of Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 After COVID -19 Vaccination , Morbidity and Mortality We ekly Report, Vol. 70, No. 32 (Aug. 13, 2021). 10. In addition to the procedures in BUMEDINST 6230.15B, authority to approve a permanent medical exemption for COVID -19 vaccination is the first Navy Medical Department See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/faq.html 6 One study found the following: \"[A]mong Kentucky residents who were previously infected with SARS -CoV -2 in 2020, those who were unvaccinated against COVID -19 had significantly higher likelihood of reinfection during May and June 2021.

BUMED Note 6150, \u00b6 5.b. During the pendency of a temporary exempt ion or once a permanent exemption is approved, a member will not be subject to disciplinary action. 11. The Navy Reserves is comprised of several categories of Reservist, including: (1) Ready Reserve; (2) Standby Reserve, consisting of the Standby Reserve -Active (USNR -S1) and Standby Reserve -Inactive (USNR -S2); or (3) Retired Reserve (USNR Personnel Instruction (hereinafter BUPERSINST) 1001.39F, Ch. 1, \u00b6 101. A Reservist's administrative requirements, entitlements, pay, or benefits eligibility is dependent on the status of the Reservist. See generally id., Figure 1 -2. Navy Reservists are required to meet physical qualifications for retention in the Reserve, and all members of the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve annually complete a pe riodic health assessment. Id., Ch. 2 \u00b6 201 ; U.S. Navy Manual of 8 \"Flag Officer s\" comprise th e highest ranks in the military. Officer ranks range from O -1 to O -10, with flag officers occupying the ranks between O -7 to O -10. In the Navy, a flag officer is any officer serving in the rank of Rear Admiral (Lower Half) or higher. 9 No disciplinary or a dministrative action will be initiated w hile a permanent medical exemption request is pending. 2 148a 9 the Medical Department, Ch. 15, Art. 15-23(2) (hereinafter \"MANMED\") . Drilling Reservists have additional requirements with respect to notifying the chain of command of any physical or dental problem that may delay or preclude their performance of drills, Annual Training (AT), or mobilization eligibility , including their vaccination status . BUPERSINST 1001.39F, Ch. 2, \u00b6 201. Unlike active duty Service members, Reservists are not automatically covered under TRICARE, the military's health care program, unless called to active duty for greater than 30 days. Reservists do have the option to obtain health insurance through TRICARE Reserve Select, a low -cost premium -based version of TRICARE . See TRICARE Reserve Select, https://tricare.mil/TRS , (last visited Dec. 7 , 2021). 12. For the annual physical evaluation, the Reservist's unit Medical Department Representative (MDR) reviews the Service member's periodic health assessment to evaluate all new or materially changed medical conditions. MANMED 15 -23(3). The MDR is encouraged to obtain additional information from reservists via outpatient medical records or other sources as appropri ate to develop as complete an understanding as possible of the condition(s). Id. If a potentially disqu alifying physical condition is discovered , such as the lack of a required vaccination , the supporting commanding officer will place the member in a Medi cal Retention Review (MRR) status. In this status, the medical officer or MDR will recommend that either the member be allowed or denied the opportunity to remain in a drill status. BUPERSINST 1001.39F, Ch. 2 \u00b6 203.2 . The commanding officer has the opti on to retain the member in the unit with or without drill authorization or reassignment of the member to a temporary unit in an authorized absence status. Id., \u00b6 203.2.a. 13. Like active duty Service members, Reservists are subject to immunization requir ements as outlined in BUMEDINST 6230.15B, but must be in a duty status to receive 149a 10 required immunizations. See BUMEDINST 6230.15B \u00b6 3-2.a.-b.

Administrative exemptions for an active duty or reserve service member may be granted for various reasons , including pending separation or retirement, permanent change of station, emergency leave, and religious accommodation. BUMEDINST \u00b6 6230.15B, 2 -6.b. Navy policy concerning requests for the accommodation of religious practices generally, including immuniza tions, is outline d in BUPERSINST 1730.11A (attached as Exhibit A to this declaration) , while specific guidance related to immunization exemptions for religious beliefs is found in the Naval Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN), Article 1730 -020 (attached as Exhibit B to this declaration) . a. An active duty or reserve service member10 seeking an exemption of immunization for religious reasons must submit the request in in accordance with BUPERSINST 1730.11A, \u00b6 5.e. The requirements include: (1) a writte n request via his or her commander stating the waiver sought; and (2) an interview with a Navy Chaplain, 10 \"This instruction applies to all active and reserve members of the Navy, including applicants for entry into the Navy and Navy Reserve, as well as midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) and in the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC), and officers and officer candidates in Navy officer accession program.\" BUPERSINST 1730.11A \u00b6 3.a 150a 11 who assesses whether the requestor's beliefs appear sincerely held for recommendation to the commander.

A member may appeal CNO N1 decisions to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). BUPERSINST 1730.11A, \u00b6 5.f. Template letters for approvals and approval recommendations are found in enclosure (4) of the instruction. c. Requests for religious accommodation are evaluated using criteria outlined in paragraph 5 of the instruction. Specifically, each request is evaluated on a case -by-case basis considering the following factors: (1) applicable operational or regional policies, (2) importance of the military policy, practice or duty in terms of mission accomplishment, including military readiness, unit cohesion, good order, disciplin e, health, or safety, (3) importance of the practice to the requestor, (4) cumulative impact of repeated accommodations of a similar nature and (5) alternate means to fulfill the request. 12 The authority to revoke approved religious accommodation exemptions has been withheld from commanding officers per NAVADMIN 225/21 \u00b6 7.g. In other words, commanding officers are not authorized to revoke an approved religious accommodation exemption from COVID -19 vaccination. 13 No disciplinary or administrative action will be initiated while a request for an exemption for religious accommodations is pending. 152a 13 d. Commanders will not deny or recommend denial of a religious accommodation unless the denial or partial denial furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government interest. Factors for commanders to consider include (but are not limited to) whether approving the accommodation would pose a health or safety hazard, or otherwise impair mission accomplishment, good order, discipline, morale or unit cohesion. BUPERSINST 1730.11A \u00b6 5.a.(2). 15. NAVADMIN 225/21 provides guidance for disposition of offenses involving Navy service members who are not fully vaccinated as required by NAVADMIN 190/21. Navy Service members who refus e the COVID -19 vaccine, absent a pending or approved exemption, are required to b e processed for administrative separation.14 NAVADMIN 225 \u00b6 2. A Navy Service member is considered to be \"refusing the vaccine, if: (1) the individual has received a lawful order to be fully vaccinated, (2) is not or will not be fully vaccinated by the dat e required, and (3) does not have a pending or approved exemption request. \" NAVADMIN 225/21 \u00b6 3.c. The policy designates CNP as the CCDA to ensure fair and consistent administrative processing across the service . NAVADMIN 225/21 \u00b6 5.b. For disciplinary m atters, a uthority to initiate disciplinary proceedings, either non -judicial punishment or court -martial , is withheld to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. Id. NAVADMIN 256/21 provides additional guidance on administrative separation process ing for those refusing the vacc ine, as well as guidance on other applicable administrative actions. These other applicable administrative actions include: cancellation of government travel for training or other official purposes ; potential reassignment withi n the local area ; adverse fitness reports and an evaluations ; prohibition on executing permanent change of station order s; potential termination of special duty and incentive pays ; 14 Although processing for separation is required, this does not automatically result in a member actually being separated. Members processed for separation may ultimately be retained in the service. 153a 14 potential recoupment of unearned bonuses ; termination of and potential reim bursement for Navy -funded education and training ;15 promotion delays ; and removal of additional qualification designations or Navy Enlisted Classifications .16 See NAVADMIN 256/21 \u00b6\u00b6 4.b.through 13. 16. Prior to the initiation of administrative or disciplin ary action, Navy service members are formally advised of the order to be fully vaccinated using a NAVPERS 1070/613 , \"Administrative 225/21 \u00b6 7.e.(1). A Page 13 is not a punitive action , but is a manner to document formal counseling of a Navy Service member . The inclusion of this Page 13, by itself, is not considered to be an adverse matter and will not affect a member's career. The Page 13 provides guidance to the Navy service member and serves to document that the member has been advised of his or her acknowledgement of the lawful order to be vaccinated against COVID -19. It also provides the service member with an opportunity to notify his or her commander of the member's intent to seek a medic al or religious exemption. 17. Officer administrative separation is initiated by a formal report of misconduct to Navy Personnel Command (NAVPERS) , as required by MILPERSMAN 1611 -010, and governed procedures 1920.6D (hereinaf ter SECNAVINST 1920.6D). SECNAVINST 1920.6D, and 15 \"A memb er, who enters into a written agreement with specified service conditions for receipt of a bonus, special or incentive pay, educational benefits, stipend, or similar payment (hereinafter referred to as \"pay or benefit\") is entitled to the full amount of th e pay or benefit if the member fulfills the required conditions. Failure to fulfill the conditions specified in the written agreement may result in termination of the agreement and the member may be required to repay the unearned portion of the pay or bene fit.\" (\"DoD Financial Management Regulation\") (emphasis added). Service members are subject to recoupment if they have entered into a contract agreeing to serve for a specified period of time in exchange for specia l pay or educational benefits. \"Training\" is not included in the scope of pay and benefits subject to recoupment. 16 Navy Enlisted Classifications define the work performed by Navy enlisted members and the requirements to perform specific \"ratings\" (i.e., occupations). See generally, MANUAL OF NAVY ENLISTED MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL CLASSIFICATIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS , VOL II NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATIONS (NAVPERS 18068F), April 21, 2021 (supplementing the enlisted rating structure in identifying perso nnel and billets [i.e., jobs] and skills, knowledge, aptitude, or qualifications that must be documented to identify both people and billets for management purposes). 154a 15 requires mandatory show cause proceedings for all officers who refuse the vaccine.

Id. \u00b6 4.a.(1). a. The specific procedures involved with processing an officer for misconduct are outlined in SECNAVINST 1920.6D, Enclosure (6), \"Policy Governing Involuntary Separation for Cause or Parenthood\", and Enclosure (7), \"Guidelines on Separ ations for Cause .\" The applicable procedures may vary in certain respects depending on the officer's type of appointment, years of service, and record of performance, amongst other factors. b.

NAVADMIN 225/21 \u00b6 7.b; NAVADMI N 256/21 \u00b6 2.a. a. Similar to officer administrative separation processing, the applicable procedures may vary in certain respects depending on the service member's specific community ( e.g., nuclear -trained Sailors), their years of service, and record of performance, amongst other factors. Processing o f enlisted Navy service members is initiated using a NAVPERS form 1910/31, \"Administrative Separation Processing Notice,\" and those service members may be processed using either notification procedures or administrative board procedures under MILPERSMAN 1910 -402. b. Notification procedures are appropriate where the least favo rable characterization is General ( Under Honorable Conditions). Id. \u00b6 1.a. For Navy service members with fewer years of service, notification procedures permit an opportunity to consult with counsel and submit matters for consideration to the separation a uthority. The CCDA serves as the separation authority for cases involving vaccine refusal, unless a higher separation authority is required by MILPERSMAN 1910 -704. NAVADMIN 156a 17 225/21 \u00b6 7.b. Navy service members with more than 6 years of service may elect an administrative separation board, which is a formal administrative hearing similar to a BOI except with regards to the composition of board membership and post -hearing administrative processing. See generally MILPERSMAN 1910 -010 through 1910 -710. 19. Timelines to complete administrative processing vary depending on whether the Navy service member is an officer or enlisted Sailor, the efficiency of administrative processing within any given command or unit, and what specific procedures apply to the memb er's case. For cases involving a Navy service member's vaccine refusal and no other misconduct or basis for separation, the following timelines offer a rough estimate for administrative separation processing: a. For officers, i t generally takes between 6 to 12 months from the time the officer is notified to show cause to the officer's approved separation . It takes approximately 86 days from notification of officer misconduct to NAVPERS before the officer is notified to show cause. The officer (\"responde nt\") normally has 10 working days to respond to the notice, and an extension of time may be granted for good cause. The commanding officer must forward the case to the Secretary of the Navy via NAVPERS and the Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP) . Review of th e case at each level of review takes approximately 50 to 75 days. In cases where a BOI is required, it typically takes another 120 days to complete all phases of the BOI process. The respondent is afforded a minimum 30 days' notice prior to the board con venes, and may request a continuance not to exceed 30 days for good cause. After review is completed and the officer's separation is approved, the decision is communicated to the command via naval 157a 18 message. The officer is generally required to complete se paration requirements within 60 days of the approved separation notice. b. Administrative separation of enlisted servi ce members often takes several months, although the range of processing timelines varies more so than with officer processing. Followi ng the notice of administrative separation, the service member generally has two working days to consult with counsel. For probationary service members, the individual may elect to submit matters to the separation authority and is given a reasonable time to do so , typically 5 working days. The commander must then route the case file to the CCDA for action as the separation authority. The approved separation is then forwarded to the command to complete separation processing requirements locally. Where a service member is entitled to , and thereafter elects an administrative separation board, the command must request qualified counsel be assigned to the member. The command and the member' s counsel then coordinate to set a date for the administrative hearin g. There is no required timeline, but generally the board should occur within 30 days of defense counsel appointment. Following the board, the command must generate a record of the board's proceedings and forward the case file to the CCDA using a formal letter format, which typically takes between 5 -10 working days. Where a higher separation authority is required by MILPERSMAN 1910 -704, such as for members with greater than 18 years of service or who are pending a Physical Evaluation Board (PEB), the rev iew timelines inherent to officer administrative separation processing apply. 20. While NAVADMIN 225/21 withholds authority to initiate disciplinary either non - judicial punishment or courts -martial for cases involving vaccine refusal, commanders generally 158a 19 possess a wide array of administrative and disciplinary options with which to dispose of service members' offenses under the UCMJ. Subject to the limits of the commander 's authority, the commander's administrative corrective measures include formal or inf ormal counseling, non- punitive letters of caution or censure,18 withholding of privileges, and extra -military instruction, as governed by the relevant service policy. Disciplinary options include non -judicial punishment under Part V of the MCM, disposition of the charges by court -martial where the commander has the auth ority to do so, or forwarding of charges for trial by court -martial where the commander does not. a. Non judicial punishment is a forum generally reserved for minor offenses, or those offenses which the maximum sentence would not include a Dishonorable Di scharge or confinement for greater than one year if tried by a general court -martial. MCM, Part V \u00b6 1.e. Punishments are limited by the rank and position of the cognizant commander, as well as the rank of the person accused of misconduct. Id. \u00b6 2, 5. Punishments and service limitations are outlined in MCM Part V and the Manual of the Judge Advocate General (JAGMAN), but commonly include some combination of the following: admonishment or reprimand, extra duties, restriction, reduction in rank, or forfeitu re of pay. MCM, Part V \u00b6 5; JAGMAN, 0111. Commanders are encouraged to permit the accused to speak with counsel subject to the immediate availability of counsel, the delay involved, and operational commitments or military exigencies. JAGMAN 0108 \u00b6 a.(1). Service members not attached to a vessel have the right to refuse non -judicial punishment and request trial by court -martial. MCM, Part V \u00b6 3 ; JAGMAN 0108 \u00b6 a.

MCM, Part V \u00b6 7; JAGMAN, 0 117. b. More serious offenses under the UCMJ may be subject to trial by court - martial. There are three types of courts -martial: summary court -martial, special court - martial, and general court -martial. Depending on the rank and position of the commander, he or she may or may not be authorized to convene certain types of courts - martial. UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 821-24. Further, the nature of the proceedings and punishments available are limited depending on the forum and rank of the accused. See UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. Chapter 47, Subchapters IV, VIII . The most severe punishments, such as the death penalty, a Dishonorable Discharge, Dismissal, or extended periods of confinement, are only available at general courts -martial, and certain offenses are only permitted to be tried by general courts -martial. Id. Summary courts -martial are less formal than either special or general courts -martial, which are equivalent in formality and procedure to civilian criminal courts ; however, each court -martial forum is governed by the p rocedures outlined in the MCM, Part II, Rules for Court Martial. Special court s- martial and general courts -martial, in particular, have substantial legal and procedural requirements with respect to pre -trial, trial, and post -trial judicial proceedings.19 The adjudication of trials by court -martial generally take months before the court is convened, 19 Relevant to a char ge of violation of Art icle 92 (disobeying a lawful order) for refusal to receive the COVID -19 vaccination, an accused member could choose to raise all available affirmative defenses, including the lawfulness of the order, at court -martial. 160a 21 and may take several months, depending on the matters involved in the case and the court's docket, prior to the trial date. Upon conclusion of the trial, the member may appeal the findings or sentence as provided in Chapter XI and XII of the MCM. 21. The administrative and disciplinary options available to commanders are the same for both active duty and reserve component Service members; however, the applica tion of such options with respect to Reservists is subject to unique jurisdictional and practical considerations. A member of a Reserve Component on active duty or inactive -duty training is subject to the UCMJ and they may be ordered to active duty for dis ciplinary proceedings. UCMJ Art. 2, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7802 0107 . Punishments awarded at non -judicial punishment are limited to the duration of the Service member's period of active duty or inactive -duty training. Id., 0112. Special procedures apply to r ecall members of the reserve component to activity duty for purposes of a court -martial, and such members may be retained on active duty to serve a punishment of confinement or restraint on liberty. Id., 0123. Administrative separation procedures are largely the same as those used with active duty Service members, with minor variations related to composition of the board and post -board administrative processing. See, e.g., a Reservi st member on officer and enlisted administrative separation boards). 22. Any service member who believes he or she has been wronged by his or her commanding officer may seek redress from the commanding officer's immediate superior in command under UCMJ, Ar ticle 138, Complaints of wrongs. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 938. Discharged service members may seek a review of his or her discharge through the cognizant Discharge Review Board (DRB) . 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1553. The DRB is empowered to change and issue a new discharge on grounds of equity or propriety. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 70.9. DRBs may consider factors such 161a 22 as the applicant's service history, awards and decorations, letters of commendation or reprimand, wounds received in acti on, acts of merit, length of service, convictions by court -martial or civilian convictions, non -judicial punishments, records of unauthorized absence, or records relating to the member's discharge. Id. Discharged service members may also seek an upgraded discharge from the appropriate Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR) , which is the Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR) for the Navy and Marine Corps personnel . 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552. The BC NR has more extensive authority than DRBs to upgrade discharges, void discharges, alter reenlistment codes, and remove otherwise inaccurate or adverse documents from a service member's record. The removal of inaccurate or wrongfully adverse documents from the service member's record may result in restorati on of additional qualification designations, Navy Enlisted Classifications and associated designations and insignia . Additionally, Navy and Marine Corps personnel who have not yet been discharged may petition the BCNR for relief. The BC NR may correct any military record when it is necessary to correct an error or remove an injustice. Id. The BCNR's action may result in a member being reinstated in the Navy , which may also result in back pay , including any special duty or incentive pays wrongfully withhe ld, and retroactive advancement or promotion . If a service member is unable to obtain relief through the appropriate DRB or BCMR, the service member may elect to challenge the agency's decision and administrative proceedings in federal court under applica ble federal law. 23. In summary, the Navy is providing its personnel opportunities to seek medical and religious exemptions from the requirement to be vaccinated. For those service members who do not wish to pursue an exemption or have their exemption requests denied after full adjudication including appeals and still refuse to be immunized, the Navy's interest in good order and 162a 163aIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS ____________________________________ ) U.S. NAVY SEALs 1-26, et al., ) ) v. ) Civil Action No. 4:21-cv-01236-O ) JOSEPH R.

I am currently employed by the U.S. Air Force as the Chief, Immunization Healthcare Division, Defense Health Agency - Public Health Directorate, located in Falls Church, Virginia. I have held the position since June 2017. I am a medical doctor and have been board certified in Allergy/Immunology since 2008 and was a board certified Pediatrician from 2001- 2015. 2. In my current role, my responsibilities include directing a responsive, evidence- based, patient-centered organization promoting optimal immunization healthcare for all DoD beneficiaries and those authorized to receive immunization from DoD. This includes assisting in policy development, providing implementation guidance and education, and engaging in clinical studies and research through clinical collaboration. The Defense Health Agency-Immunization Healthcare Division (DHA-IHD) routinely engages with the medical representatives from the military departments, U.S. Coast Guard, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, and others to develop 164a2standardized immunization implementation guidance in accordance with published policy for consistency across DoD where possible. 3. I am aware of the allegations set forth in the pleadings filed in this matter. This declaration is based on my personal knowledge, as well as knowledge made available to me during the routine execution of my official duties. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 4. As part of my official duties, I served as a member of the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Operational Planning Team (OPT), which was directed to develop and implement DoD's COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution plan. The Coronavirus Task Force (CVTF) provided overarching guidance to the OPT. The OPT provided routine and ad hoc updates on COVID-19 vaccine deliveries, administration, and adverse events to the CVTF. 5. The virus that causes COVID-19 disease is SARS-CoV-2, a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus from the Coronavirus family. Like any RNA virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates and evolves constantly and regularly as it infects and replicates in host cells. Mutations that are beneficial to the virus (i.e., make the virus more easily spread between hosts, evade the immune system) are integrated into the viral genome, thereby increasing \"survival\" and replication opportunity. This has been seen with the SARS-CoV-2 \"Delta\" variant, which is twice as contagious as previous variants.1 However, not all mutations are beneficial to the virus - some can result in virus death and therefore do not infect the host. This is part of the normal biology cycle of all viruses. 1https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html, last accessed December 8, 2021. 165a36. The latest reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus.2These droplets and particles can be inhaled by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, viral particles may contaminate surfaces. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected, especially in areas where there is poor ventilation. 7. COVID-19 disease can cause acute symptoms such as fever/chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of sense of smell or taste and/or sore throat. Symptoms appear 2-14 days (usually within 4-5 days) after viral exposure.3The infection can affect people in different ways: from asymptomatic, to limited and mild (for 2-3 days) to more severe (such as trouble breathing, chest pain, inability to think straight and inability to stay awake). Even with the availability of aggressive medical management and ventilator support in an intensive care setting for those with severe symptoms, hundreds of thousands with COVID-19 disease have died. As of December 1, 2021, CDC reports that over 48 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with COVID-19 disease, over 3.4 million have been hospitalized, and over 781,000 have died (approximately 1 in 500 in the total U.S. population of 330 million).4Per the CDC, the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic 2https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html, last accessed December 7, 2021. 3https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html, last accessed December 7, 2021. 4https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html, last accessed December 7, 2021. 166a4respiratory disease, obesity, pregnancy, immunocompromising conditions, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.5 8. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID-19 conditions (aka long/long-haul COVID, Postacute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), long-term effects of COVID, or chronic COVID). Post-COVID-19 conditions include a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems four or more weeks after infection. Those who were asymptomatic during their COVID-19 infection may still develop post-COVID-19 conditions. One systematic review assessing short and long-term rates of long- COVID in more than 250,000 COVID-19 survivors from 57 studies with an average age of 54 years demonstrated that more than 50% of these COVID-19 survivors continued to have a broad range of symptoms six months after resolution of the acute COVID-19 infection, of which the most common were functional mobility impairments, respiratory abnormalities, and mental health disorders.6 Another study comparing outcomes in patients referred to outpatient rehabilitation clinics after COVID-19 reported poorer general, mental, and physical health and functioning compared with patients with no previous diagnosis of COVID-19 referred for cancer rehabilitation. Those referred for rehabilitation following COVID-19 were more likely to be male, younger, and employed.7A study assessing clinical patterns and recovery time from COVID-19 illness in 147 international- 5https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical- conditions.html, last accessed December 7, 2021. 6Groff, et al, JAMA Network Open , Short-term of SARS-CoV-2 Infection, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/27849 18. 7Rogers-Brown JS, et al.

In both groups, fatigue, dry cough, and headache were the predominant symptoms.8As described further below, myocarditis associated with COVID-19 disease or mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is rare. However, the risk of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 disease is consistently higher than the risk of myocarditis associated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Hence, the risk to benefit ratio continues to be in favor of vaccination. COVID-19 Impacts on the Force9. Infectious diseases have been the single greatest threat to the health of those involved in military operations. As the standard military unit shrinks and becomes more mobile to rapidly respond to global threats, any decrease in personal or unit readiness can significantly decrease operational efficiency and result in military ineffectiveness. Similar to other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 virus can be easily transmitted to others prior to symptom development and therefore may infect significant numbers before being identified. DoD personnel, including service members, especially those in an operational setting (such as those working on ships, submarines, or engaged in the operation of aircraft and vehicles; those deployed to austere environments; or those engaged in routine field training and airborne exercises), work in environments where duties may limit the ability to strictly comply with mitigation measures such as wearing a face mask, avoiding crowded areas, maintaining physical distancing of at least 6 feet, increasing indoor ventilation, maintaining good hand hygiene, and quarantining if in close contact with a COVID-19 case. Therefore, upon exposure, these individuals may be at higher risk to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to those who can robustly maintain all recommended mitigation strategies. Further, although the elderly population and those with medical conditions 8Hull JH, et al. Clinical patterns, recovery time and prolonged impact of COVID-19 illness in international athletes: the UK experience. Br J Sports Med 2021;0:1-8. Doi 10.1136/bjsports- 2021-104392. 168a6are more likely to have severe disease, otherwise healthy Service members have developed \"long- haul\" COVID-19, potentially impacting their ability to perform their missions. Data presented from DoD's COVID-19 registry has demonstrated that of 111,767 active duty service members who had COVID-19 disease between February 1, 2020 to August 12, 2021, 37,838 (33.9%) had diagnoses for conditions requiring a healthcare visit 30-180 days following their illness, the most common being joint/muscle pain (15,614 or 14%) followed by chest pain/cough (7,887 or 7.1%). In comparison, only 8.3% and 1.81%, respectively, of active duty service members had a healthcare visit for those diagnoses 30-180 days after vaccination. All diagnoses associated with \"Long-COVID-19 Syndrome\" were found to be more common after COVID-19 disease than after COVID-19 vaccination . Some service members have unfortunately succumbed to the disease, as described further below. Service members and federal civilian employees are the military's most valuable asset; without a medically ready force and ready medical force, the military mission is at high risk of failure. Recommendations from evidence-based medicine must remain the core approach to medical readiness. These evidence-based recommendations will continue to be updated as our understanding of the disease, complications, and impact from vaccination continues to evolve. 10. Between February 2020 and November 2021, there were 209,133 new and repeat cases of COVID-19 among active duty service members (see \"Table\" below). The largest monthly peak in cases occurred in January 2021, with 28,345 cases identified (see \"Figure\" below). Other peaks occurred in August 2021 with 22,042 cases and in July 2020 with 11,610 cases. The percentage of cases that were hospitalized was highest at the start of the pandemic and trended downward through January 2021. The percentage of hospitalized cases then increased from 0.9% in January 2021 to 2.1% in May 2021, and decreased to 1.5% in September 2021. The 2 169a7percentage of hospitalized cases decreased to 0.8% in November 2021, but this trend should be interpreted with caution due to data lags. In total, 30 active duty service members have died from COVID-19 as of the end of November 2021. The number of active duty service members who died from COVID-19 remained very low throughout the first year of the pandemic, with a slight increase in the numbers of deaths occurring between December 2020 and February 2021, and a greater increase occurring between August and October 2021, coinciding with the increased spread of the Delta variant. More than one-half of the 30 deaths in active duty service members occurred between August and October 2021 (n=17). One active duty service member died from COVID-19 in November 2021. Table.

The DoD has provided information on its website concerning the number of vaccinations provided by DoD, the vaccination of the force, and health impact of those who developed COVID-19 infections.9 As depicted below, December 1, 2021 data, demonstrated that of the 393,671 COVID-19 cases within the DoD, 5,544 individuals were hospitalized and 612 have died, including 77 military service members (service members include Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard personnel). In both the civilian sector and in the military, the overwhelming majority of individuals hospitalized or who died were not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated. 12. The bed capacity at DoD's military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) has generally followed local civilian hospital utilization, with some MTFs having high admission rates and a need to temporarily curtail medical services. The National Guard has been called on extensively to provide medical support to the civilian population throughout the pandemic and Services have also provided \"manning assist\" to other DoD MTFs and civilian hospitals. 9https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Coronavirus-DOD-Response/, last accessed December 7, 2021. 172a10Vaccine Impacts 13. Immunization is a global health and development success story, saving millions of lives across the age spectrum annually from illness, chronic conditions, and potentially death. Immunizations provide benefit at both the individual and community level. First, by stimulating an active immune response, vaccinated individuals are largely protected from the disease of concern. Second, when a high proportion of individuals are immune (i.e., herd immunity) human- to-human transmission is disrupted, thereby protecting those who remain susceptible (i.e., those who may not be able to receive a vaccine or do not mount an adequate antibody response). Disease prevention through immunization also mitigates the need for pharmacologic treatment (antibiotics, etc.), reducing the risk of drug-resistant pathogen development. 14. As a key component of primary health care, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which provides regulatory allowance for immunizations, has licensed vaccines for over 20 different infectious diseases. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory committee of the CDC, develops recommendations on how to use vaccines to control diseases in the United States. The military also maintains awareness, surveillance, and provides guidance to DoD personnel and beneficiaries on vaccine-preventable diseases in the global setting. 15. According to the CDC, over 471 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the United States from December 14, 2020, through December 6, 2021.10 Evidence continues to show that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death is higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated persons. Although weekly rates can vary, the cumulative rate of 10https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html, last accessed December 7, 2021. 173a11COVID-19 associated hospitalizations in unvaccinated adults ages 18-49 years was about 13 times higher than fully vaccinated adults aged 18-49 years .11 Also, according to CDC data, deaths by vaccination status from April 4, 2021-October 2, 2021 showed that unvaccinated persons had a 5.8 times greater risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and a 14 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19.12 11https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination, last accessed December 7, 2021. 12https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status, last accessed November 18, 2021. 2 174a12 175a1316. Although COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against infection has decreased over time, this is seen more significantly in individuals 65 years of age and older. COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against severe disease (hospitalization and death) remains high.13 13https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectiveness, last accessed December 7, 2021. 176a14 17. As of December 7, 2021, DoD immunization sites have administered over 6.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine adverse events that are potentially related to vaccination are centrally captured through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) through passive surveillance, meaning that information is voluntarily reported by health care providers and the public. As of November 23, 2021, a total of 7,369 unique VAERS reports (approximately 11 VAERS reports/10,000 doses administered) were submitted by DoD beneficiaries or those authorized to receive vaccine from DoD. Note that the number of VAERS reports/10,000 doses administered for DoD beneficiaries is likely to be lower, as the denominator does not take into account beneficiaries who receive vaccine in the civilian sector though DoD would still receive their VAERS report if the submitter indicated military affiliation. Additionally, individuals who had an adverse event but did not submit a VAERS would not be known and therefore would not be counted. Of note, a VAERS submission to the CDC does not mean that the vaccine of concern caused or contributed to the medical issue reported. 18. As of December 2021, the DoD has received hundreds of thousands of BLA- manufactured, EUA-labeled vaccine doses and is using them. 2 177a1519. Approach to immunizations within DoD are outlined in DoD Instruction 6205.02, \"DoD Immunization Program\" dated June 19, 2019, which states that it is DoD policy that all DoD personnel and other beneficiaries required or eligible to receive immunizations will be offered immunizations in accordance with recommendations from the CDC and its ACIP. Army Regulation 40-562, Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery Instruction 6230.15B, Air Force Instruction 48-110_IP, Coast Guard Commandants Instruction M6230.4G, \"Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis for the Prevention of Infectious Diseases,\" October 7, 2013, further states the Military Service policy concerning immunizations follows the recommendations of the CDC, ACIP, and the prescribing information on the manufacturer's package inserts, unless there is a military-relevant reason to do otherwise. This document does also describe general examples of medical exemptions, which include \"evidence of immunity based on serologic tests, documented infection, or similar circumstances.\" Some interpret this as a diagnosis of COVID-19 disease and/or results of a COVID-19 serologic test means that a medical exemption should be granted. However, of significance is the phrase \"evidence of immunity.\" CDC defines immunity as \"protection from an infectious disease. If you are immune to a disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected.\"14There are two major types of testing available for COVID-19: diagnostic tests, which assess for current infection, and antibody tests, which assesses for antibody production, indicative of either past infection and (in some tests) a history of vaccination. The FDA states, \"We do not know how long antibodies stay in the body following infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. We do not know if antibodies give you protective immunity against the virus, so results from a serology test should not be used to find out if you have immunity from 14https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/bam/diseases/vaccine-basics.htm, accessed December 9, 2021. 178a16the virus. The FDA cautions patients against using the results from any serology test as an indication that they can stop taking steps to protect themselves and others, such as stopping social distancing or discontinuing wearing masks.\"15 As described below, lab test results also state that it is unclear at this time if a positive IgG infers immunity against future COVID-19 infection. Therefore, given the scientific evidence available at this time, a medical exemption based on the history of COVID-19 disease or serology results does not meet \"evidence of immunity\". The presence of antibodies is not the same thing as being immune. 20. The CDC states that \"COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 5 years and older, regardless of a history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection; this includes people with prolonged post-COVID-19 symptoms and applies to primary series doses, additional primary doses, and booster doses. Viral testing to assess for acute SARS-CoV- 2 infection or serologic testing to assess for prior infection is not recommended for the purpose of vaccine decision-making. Present data are insufficient to determine an antibody titer threshold that indicates when an individual is protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is neither any FDA-authorized or FDA-approved test nor any other scientifically validated strategy that vaccination providers or the public can use to reliably determine whether a person is protected from infection. Data from multiple studies indicate that the currently approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines can be given safely to people with evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\"16 15https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-disease-2019-testing-basics, accessed December 9, 2021. 179a1721. Further, CDC states \"current evidence suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is low after a previous infection but may increase with time due to waning immunity. Among individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, substantial heterogeneity exists in their immune response. (The term \"heterogeneity\" means that those individuals have diverse or varying immune responses which, when compared to the subsequent response of those receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, are not as reliable or consistent.) Conversely, the immune response following COVID- 19 vaccination is more reliable, consistent, and predictable. A primary vaccination series decreases the risk of future infections in people with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous immunologic studies have consistently shown that vaccination of individuals who were previously infected enhances their immune response, and growing epidemiologic evidence indicates that vaccination following infection further reduces the risk of subsequent infection, including in the setting of increased circulation of more infectious variants\".17 22. Although natural infection for some diseases, in some cases, can result in long- standing immunity (e.g., measles), there is risk of untoward outcomes from the disease itself, which can be chronic or even fatal. Examples of harmful outcomes outside of COVID-19 include Pneumonia or invasive group B Strep from chickenpox, meningitis or epiglottitis from Haemophilis influenza type B, birth defects from rubella, liver cancer from Hepatitis B, and death from measles. 23. Other examples of natural infections that do not mount long-standing immunity include Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Malaria, Whooping cough, and rotavirus; 17 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines- us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo- by-product%2Fclinical-considerations.html, accessed December 9, Multiple serotypes of some pathogen like influenza, pneumococcus, and possibly with the SARS-CoV-2 variants also makes determination of a protective serologic level more difficult, especially to say there is lifelong immunity. 24. In October 2021, prior to the presentation of the Omicron variant, the newest SARS-CoV2 variant of concern, CDC summarized a review of 96 peer-reviewed and preprint publications, providing an overview of current scientific evidence regarding infection-induced immunity.18Key findings include the following: Available evidence shows that fully vaccinated individuals and those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 each have a low risk of subsequent infection for at least 6 months. Data are presently insufficient to determine an antibody titer threshold that indicates when an individual is protected from infection. At this time, there is no FDA-authorized or approved test that providers or the public can use to reliably determine whether a person is protected from infection. o The immunity provided by vaccine and prior infection are both high but not complete (i.e., not 100%). o Multiple studies have shown that antibody titers correlate with protection at a population level, but protective titers at the individual level remain unknown. o Whereas there is a wide range in antibody titers in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2, completion of a primary vaccine series, especially with mRNA vaccines, typically leads to a more consistent and higher-titer initial antibody response. 18 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced- immunity.html, accessed December 9, 2021. 181a19o For certain populations, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, the levels of protection may be decreased following both vaccination and infection. o Current evidence indicates that the level of protection may not be the same for all viral variants. oThe body of evidence for infection-induced immunity is more limited than that for vaccine-induced immunity in terms of the quality of evidence (e.g., probable bias towards symptomatic or medically-attended infections) and types of studies (e.g., observational cohort studies, mostly retrospective versus a mix of randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, and cohort studies for vaccine-induced immunity). There are insufficient data to extend the findings related to infection- induced immunity at this time to persons with very mild or asymptomatic infection or children. 25. Debate continues about whether natural immunity versus vaccine-induced immunity is more protective against breakthrough infections (a reinfection in someone who was previously infected versus an infection in a previously not infected individual who was fully immunized). A frequently cited, though not peer reviewed, retrospective study from Israel found that the rates of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals, while very low (highest rate = 1.5%), were 13 times higher than the rates of reinfection and hospitalization in previously infected individuals19. These findings have not been reproduced in a peer-reviewed publication. However, an observational study,20 also out of Israel, 19https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1, last accessed December 9, 2021 20Barda N, et al. Safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in a Nationwide Setting N Engl J Med 2021; 385:1078-1090 182a20compared adverse events in Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals in addition to those who had a history of COVID-19 disease versus those who did not. As previously identified in multiple studies, vaccination with a mRNA vaccine like Pfizer- BioNTech was associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis compared to those unvaccinated (risk difference 2.7 events/100,000 people). However, when assessing the relative risk in those with a history of COVID-19 disease with those who did not have disease, the risk of myocarditis was substantially higher in those who had COVID-19 disease (risk difference of 11 events/100,000 persons). The risk difference is calculated as the difference between the observed risks in the two groups. The Omicron variant 183a2126. On November 26, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the Omicron variant a \"variant of concern\", upon recommendations of the Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution, which assesses if specific mutations and combinations of mutations alter the behavior of the virus.21The United States designated Omicron as a variant of concern on November 30, 2021 and following first detection in the United States on December 1, 2021, it has rapidly spread throughout the United States.22 Very preliminary data suggests that the omicron variant may spread more easily than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it is unknown how transmission compares to the Delta variant. Severity of disease caused by Omicron in those who are unvaccinated, had a previous history of disease, and in the unvaccinated population is unknown. Protection against the Omicron variant in those previously infected with COVID-19 is not yet understood. Vaccine effectiveness of current FDA- approved/authorized and WHO-Emergency Use List COVID-19 vaccines is also unclear, but preliminary data is expected in the next few weeks. Nevertheless, the CDC has stated that \"vaccination is anticipated to continue to offer protection against hospitalization and death, and vaccines continue to play a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.\"23 Risks from COVID-19 Vaccination 21https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2- variant-of-concern, last accessed December 9, 2021. 22https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html, last accessed December 9, 2021. 23https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/scientific-brief-omicron- variant.html , last accessed December 9, 2021. 184a2227. Risks from immunization, including COVID-19 vaccines are rare. CDC provides routine updates on specific adverse events temporally associated with COVID-19 vaccines.24 CDC updates as of November 30, 2021, include the following: A. Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare and has occurred in approximately 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated in the United States. B.Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccination is rare. As of November 24, 2021, more than 16.4 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine have been given in the United States. CDC and FDA identified 54 confirmed reports of people who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed TTS. Women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of this adverse event. C. Guillain-Barre Syndrome - CDC and FDA are monitoring reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) in people who have received the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. GBS is a rare disorder where the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover from GBS, but some have permanent nerve damage. After more than 16.4 million J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine doses administered, there have been around 268 preliminary reports of GBS identified in VAERS as of November 24, 2021. These cases have largely been reported about 2 weeks after vaccination and mostly in men, many 50 years and older. CDC will continue to monitor for and evaluate reports of GBS 24https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html, last accessed December 9, 2021. 185a23occurring after COVID-19 vaccination and will share more information as it becomes available. D. Myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. As of November 24, 2021, VAERS has received 1,949 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger who received COVID-19 vaccines. Most cases have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), particularly in male adolescents and young adults.. Through follow-up, including medical record reviews, CDC and FDA have confirmed 1,071reports of myocarditis or pericarditis. E. Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare . More than 459 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through November 29, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 10,128 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it's unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event that causes blood clots with low platelets, which has caused 6 deaths. 28. Additionally, on October 27 2021, the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) provided an updated statement regarding 186a24myocarditis and pericarditis reported with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, stating, in part: The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee notes that myocarditis can occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease) and that mRNA vaccines have clear benefit in preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. Countries should continue to monitor reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination by age, sex, dose and vaccine brand.
