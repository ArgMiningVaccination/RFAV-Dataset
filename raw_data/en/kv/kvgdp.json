Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and/or spinal cord. [Lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a disease in which [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ( [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) form in the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The lymph system is part of the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and is made the lymph) travel in and out of the [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CNS). It is thought that some of these lymphocytes become malignant and cause lymphoma to form in the CNS. [Primary CNS in the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [meninges](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46295&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the layers that form the outer covering of the brain). Because the eye is so close to the brain, primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye (called ocular lymphoma). Having a weakened immune system may increase the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma. Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop primary CNS lymphoma, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Primary CNS lymphoma may occur in patients who have [HIV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44985&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [AIDS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45950&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [Epstein-Barr virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or other [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the immune system, or who have had an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For more information about lymphoma in patients with AIDS, see [AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment](/types/lymphoma/patient/aids-related-treatment-pdq). Signs and symptoms of primary CNS lymphoma may include nausea and vomiting or seizures. These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by primary CNS lymphoma or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Tests that examine the eyes, brain, and spinal cord are used to diagnose primary CNS lymphoma. In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures: [Neurological exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)function. The exam checks a person's mental status, coordination, ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, [senses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=792756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. - Eye exam with [dilated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257207&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pupil](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=546600&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and pupil to the [retina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440115&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The inside of the eye, including the retina and the [optic nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46248&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There are several types of eye exams: [Ophthalmoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=749897&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. [Slit-lamp biomicroscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=534233&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called [gadolinium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597153&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)into the patient through a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). [Lumbar puncture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46303&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure used to collect [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CSF) from the [spinal column](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=396787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the [spine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap. [Stereotactic biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)procedure that uses a computer and a [3-dimensional](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(3-D) scanning device to find a tumor site and guide the removal of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. The following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed: [Flow cytometry](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [laboratory test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46590&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other) [markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)on the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient's [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and manage certain types of cancers, such as [leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45343&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and lymphoma. [Immunohistochemistry](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653117&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A laboratory test that uses [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to check for certain [antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46086&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)( [markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer. [Cytogenetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A laboratory test in which the [chromosomes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46470&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. [FISH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460228&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(fluorescence in situ hybridization): A laboratory test used to look at and count [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient's cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment. [Complete blood count (CBC) with differential](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=729979&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - The number of [red blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [platelets](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45840&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - The number and type of [white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - The amount of [hemoglobin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(the protein that carries [oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in the red blood cells. - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - The number of [Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. [HIV test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=759626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A test to measure the level of [HIV antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45711&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in a sample of blood. Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a [foreign](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=698772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)substance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been [infected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)with HIV. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depends on the following: - Whether the patient has HIV. - The patient's age and general health. - Whether the tumor is in the central nervous system, eye, or both. - The level of certain substances in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Treatment options depend on the following: - Whether the tumor is in the central nervous system, eye, or both. - The patient's age and general health. - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(come back). Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma works best when the tumor has not spread outside the [cerebrum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46484&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the largest part of the brain) and the patient is younger than 60 years, able to carry out most daily activities, and does not have AIDS or other diseases that weaken the immune system. Staging Primary CNS Lymphoma Key Points - After primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the brain and spinal cord or to the eye. - There is no standard staging system for primary CNS lymphoma. - Primary CNS lymphoma often recurs (comes back) after it has been treated. After primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the brain and spinal cord or to the eye. [Primary CNS lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) usually does not spread beyond the [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or the eye. The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is no standard system for staging primary CNS lymphoma. The following tests and procedures may be used to help plan treatment: [CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or swallowed to help the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)show up more clearly. This procedure is also called tomography, computerized [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in the body. A small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT. [MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). [Bone marrow aspiration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46505&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46506&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The removal of [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or [breastbone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=549425&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to look for [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of cancer. There is no standard staging system for primary CNS lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma often recurs (comes back) after it has been treated. Primary CNS lymphoma often [recurs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or the eye. Treatment Option Overview Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. - The following types of treatments are used: - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Steroid therapy - Targeted therapy - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Immunotherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Different types of treatment are available for patients with [primary CNS lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45345&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. [Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is not used to treat primary CNS lymphoma. The following types of treatments are used: Radiation therapy [Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain. This is called [whole-brain radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663332&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). High- [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and cause [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that can affect thinking, learning, problem solving, reading, writing, speech, and memory. Clinical trials have tested the use of [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) alone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the [bloodstream](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( [systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed ( [intrathecal chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46681&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( [regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is in the [CNS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45643&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or eye. Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and/or [intraventricular](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46144&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) chemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the [ventricles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45939&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ( [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-filled cavities) of the brain. If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye, anticancer drugs are injected directly into the [vitreous humor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=570638&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (jelly-like substance) inside the eye. Steroid therapy [Steroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. [Glucocorticoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45295&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are [steroid drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46601&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that have an anticancer effect in [lymphomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Targeted therapy [Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. [Monoclonal antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Monoclonal antibodies are [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They may be used alone or to carry drugs, [toxins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)material directly to cancer cells. [Rituximab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45525&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [nivolumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=767747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are types of monoclonal cell [membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46294&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. [Ibrutinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=754851&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat newly diagnosed or recurrent primary CNS lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. [Stem cell transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. [Stem cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient or a [donor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Immunotherapy [Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. [CAR T-cell therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=771302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): This treatment changes the patient's [T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient, and special [receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called [chimeric antigen receptor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787969&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma may cause side effects. For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, see our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) page. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from [recurring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer or to find out the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has changed or if the cancer has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back). These tests are sometimes called [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests or check-ups.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center) (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
