The incidence is alarmingly on the rise, and environmental factors are increasingly suspected to play a role. This paper investigates word frequency patterns in the U.S. CDC Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database. Our results provide strong evidence supporting a link between autism and the aluminum in vaccines. A literature review showing toxicity of aluminum in human physiology offers further support. Mentions of autism in VAERS increased steadily at the end of the last century, during a period when mercury was being phased out, while aluminum adjuvant burden was being increased. Using standard log-likelihood ratio techniques, we identify several signs and symptoms that are significantly more prevalent in vaccine reports after 2000, including cellulitis, seizure, depression, fatigue, pain and death, which are also significantly associated with aluminum-containing vaccines. We propose that children with the autism diagnosis are especially vulnerable to toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury due to insufficient serum sulfate and glutathione. A strong correlation between autism and the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine is also observed, which may be partially explained via an increased sensitivity to acetaminophen administered to control fever.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2012-11-07", "cleaned_text": "Empirical Data Confirm Autism Symptoms Related to Aluminum and Acetaminophen Exposure [https://doi.org/10.3390/e14112227](https://doi.org/10.3390/e14112227) immune function [ [2](#B2-entropy-14-02227), [3](#B3-entropy-14-02227), [4](#B4-entropy-14-02227), [5](#B5-entropy-14-02227)]. It can now no longer be denied that the incidence of ASD is alarmingly on the rise in the U.S. [ [6](#B6-entropy-14-02227)]. While it has been suggested that the observed increase in rates may be due mainly to a change in diagnosis criteria, the actual criteria have changed very little from 1943 to DSM-IV-TR [ [7](#B7-entropy-14-02227), [8](#B8-entropy-14-02227), [9](#B9-entropy-14-02227)]. Despite considerable research efforts devoted to trying to uncover the cause(s) of autism, thus far no definitive answer seems available from the research literature. However, the fact that ASD rates have been rapidly increasing over the last two decades strongly points to an environmental component. Indeed, autism is recently being reframed from being a strictly genetic disease to representing a complex interaction between genetics and environmental factors, suggesting that we should focus our attention more on \"environmentally responsive genes\" [ [10](#B10-entropy-14-02227)]. [11](#B11-entropy-14-02227)], an idea that has been vehemently denied by the vaccine industry [ [12](#B12-entropy-14-02227)], but nonetheless is still hotly debated [ [13](#B13-entropy-14-02227)]. A study published in 2011 has confirmed a positive correlation between the proportion of children who received vaccinations in each state over the interval from 2001 to 2007 and the incidence of autism or speech and language impairment [ [14](#B14-entropy-14-02227)]. For each 1% increase in vaccination rate, 680 additional children were diagnosed with autism or speech delay. [15](#B15-entropy-14-02227)], we proposed that a causative factor in autism is an inadequate supply of cholesterol sulfate, both in utero and postnatally. Cholesterol sulfate synthesis in the skin is catalyzed by sun exposure [ [16](#B16-entropy-14-02227)]. We hypothesized that autism may be induced by a combination of inadequate dietary sulfur and insufficient sun exposure to the skin, for both the mother and the child. A meta-study involving oxidative-stress related biomarkers present in association with autism identified a consistent deficiency in reduced glutathione [ [17](#B17-entropy-14-02227)], an important sulfur-based antioxidant that also plays a role in detoxifying aluminum. We proposed that cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid involved in the synthesis of glutathione [ [18](#B18-entropy-14-02227)], is depleted through redirection into an alternative pathway to produce sulfate, due to the impaired sulfate synthesis from thiosulfate in the skin. [19](#B19-entropy-14-02227)]. These same authors observed a marked reduction in serum sulfate in association with ASD in another paper [ [20](#B20-entropy-14-02227)]. In particular, the level of free sulfate in the blood stream was only 33% of the level found in control subjects. We hypothesize that sulfate deficiency results in insufficient ionic buffering in the vasculature, with grossly inadequate sulfation of the extracellular matrix proteins that are essential for proper colloidal suspension of particles and cells [ [21](#B21-entropy-14-02227), [22](#B22-entropy-14-02227)]. [23](#B23-entropy-14-02227)] and sulfate [ [24](#B24-entropy-14-02227)] are also essential for the detoxification of xenobiotics and commonly administered drugs like acetaminophen in the liver. Selenium, a trace metal in the same column of the periodic table as oxygen and sulfur, has been shown to protect against acetaminophen toxicity [ [25](#B25-entropy-14-02227)], and it has also been shown to be severely depleted in hair and nail samples from individuals on the autism spectrum [ [26](#B26-entropy-14-02227)]. [27](#B27-entropy-14-02227)]. The association of both asthma [ [28](#B28-entropy-14-02227)] and eczema [ [29](#B29-entropy-14-02227)] with ASD can be explained as an inadequate supply of filaggrin, due to the fact that cholesterol sulfate in the epidermis stimulates the production of profilaggrin, its precursor [ [30](#B30-entropy-14-02227)]. Filaggrin plays an essential role in maintaining the epithelial barrier [ [31](#B31-entropy-14-02227)], and its impairment leads to increased risk of both asthma [ [32](#B32-entropy-14-02227)] and eczema [ [33](#B33-entropy-14-02227), [34](#B34-entropy-14-02227)]. Thus cholesterol sulfate deficiency provides an explanation for the multiple links among autism, acetaminophen, asthma, and eczema. [35](#B35-entropy-14-02227)], which are conjugated with taurine, the only sulfonic amino acid [ [36](#B36-entropy-14-02227)]. Taurine administration in conjunction with aluminum greatly ameliorates the adverse effects of aluminum on the liver, and this was explained as possibly due to the ability of the sulfonate group in taurine to bind with heavy metals such as aluminum [ [37](#B37-entropy-14-02227)]. These results suggest that glutathione and taurine are both involved in aluminum detoxification in the liver. [38](#B38-entropy-14-02227)]. Furthermore, increased use of antibiotics leads to an alteration in gut flora which impairs the ability to detoxify toxic metals like mercury. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), an organosulfur compound with two thiol groups, has been found to be effective in ameliorating the symptoms of autism in placebo controlled studies [ [39](#B39-entropy-14-02227)], likely through its ability to enable the excretion of toxic metals such as lead and mercury [ [40](#B40-entropy-14-02227)]. It also led to a normalization of glutathione levels in red blood cells [ [40](#B40-entropy-14-02227)]. [41](#B41-entropy-14-02227)]. The over-zealous application of sunscreen is strongly implicated in autism, not only because sunscreen interferes with the production of vitamin D3 and cholesterol sulfate but also because it often contains aluminum, particularly the high Sun Protection Factor (SPF) sunblock products. Aluminum, due in part to its +3 ionic charge, is highly toxic to biological systems [ [42](#B42-entropy-14-02227), [43](#B43-entropy-14-02227)] as will be described more fully in [Section 2.1](#sec2dot1-entropy-14-02227). Indeed, there are no known life forms that utilize aluminum in any biological systems. The poorly developed barrier function of the autistic child's epidermis would likely lead to an increased penetration of aluminum through the skin. Furthermore, their serum sulfate deficiency leads to an impaired ability to dispose of aluminum. Aluminum would therefore be expected to accumulate over time, and, due to increased permeability of the blood brain barrier associated with autism [ [44](#B44-entropy-14-02227)], would almost certainly interfere with neuron function. 2. Aluminum and Mercury in Vaccines [45](#B45-entropy-14-02227)]. Vaccine clinical trials often include aluminum in the placebo, at the same or greater concentrations than the amount found in the vaccine [ [46](#B46-entropy-14-02227), [47](#B47-entropy-14-02227), [48](#B48-entropy-14-02227), [49](#B49-entropy-14-02227)]. A comparable number of adverse reactions between vaccine and placebo in these trials suggests that aluminum is an important source of toxicity in the vaccine. Indeed, intraperitoneal injection of aluminum-adsorbed vaccine in mice caused a transient rise in aluminum in brain tissues [ [50](#B50-entropy-14-02227)]. [51](#B51-entropy-14-02227)]. A highly informative recent review of a possible relationship between aluminum toxicity and Alzheimer's disease [ [52](#B52-entropy-14-02227)] also discussed issues related to the aluminum burden in children's vaccines. There, it was pointed out that children today receive a cumulative aluminum burden from vaccines that may exceed the FDA limit by a factor of 50. [53](#B53-entropy-14-02227)]. The use of weakened but live pathogens can lead to vaccine-induced disease in children with an impaired immune system, yet debris from dead pathogens may not always cause a sufficient reaction to induce the production of antigen-specific memory CD8 T-cells, required for protection against future exposure. The industry widely reports success in creating vaccines with dead pathogens by adding adjuvants such as aluminum, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli, and polycationic surfactants, to further stimulate the immune response [ [54](#B54-entropy-14-02227)]. It remains unclear exactly how aluminum achieves its effect of enhancing the immune reaction, but aluminum adjuvants are now thought to impact on humoral systems via their positive influence on the inflammasome complexes [ [55](#B55-entropy-14-02227)]. [56](#B56-entropy-14-02227)]. This effect would however also interfere with the human body's ability to break down the antigen from the vaccine, which may partially explain the heightened immune reaction. [57](#B57-entropy-14-02227)], the industry made an effort to significantly reduce the amount of mercury present in vaccines beginning in the late 1990's [ [58](#B58-entropy-14-02227)]. In parallel, they began storing the vaccines in individualized glass vials\u2014to avoid the ostensible need for a preservative to reduce the danger of contaminating repeated invasions of multidose vials. However, this raises another concern, as aluminum can be leached out of the glass vial and the rubber stopper during storage [ [59](#B59-entropy-14-02227)]. This same issue can also affect premature infants given serum albumin infusions, resulting in an inadvertent exposure to aluminum very early in life [ [60](#B60-entropy-14-02227)]. [61](#B61-entropy-14-02227)]. Leaching from a container is an ongoing process until the product is used. Storage containers contribute significantly to aluminum contamination in human serum albumin products. Because of impaired renal function, dialysis patients are at risk to developing encephalopathy and a severe form of dementia due to their inability to dispose of the small amounts of aluminum that could be present in the dialysis water base [ [62](#B62-entropy-14-02227)], although this problem has been largely corrected today. We suggest that the effect of aluminum on the brain of a person already on the autism spectrum may manifest a similar pathology. Mechanisms of Aluminum and Mercury Toxicity [22](#B22-entropy-14-02227), [63](#B63-entropy-14-02227), [64](#B64-entropy-14-02227)]. Its +3 charge and highly kosmotropic properties make it extremely destructive in water-based biological systems. One purely biophysical mechanism might involve its direct effect upon interfacial water tension. Another less direct mechanism might involve competition for calmodulin binding and the initiation of a signaling cascade with profound consequences. Both phenomena would likely induce biosemiotic entropy through both supramolecular and epigenetic effects. Thus, a focus limited solely to genetics and molecular biology is likely to be misguided. Long-range, dynamically-structured interfacial water is the medium which, when energy-loaded, both conveys the biological message and overcomes the thermal diffusion problem [ [65](#B65-entropy-14-02227), [66](#B66-entropy-14-02227)]. When interfacial water is energy-unloaded, the biological message is corrupted: unfolded protein responses and apoptosis follow. We posit that aluminum is a sine of biosemiotic entropyan exogenous interfacial water stressor. [67](#B67-entropy-14-02227)]. Recently, a group of researchers investigated the effect of aluminum sulfate on an in vitro culture of human neural cells [ [63](#B63-entropy-14-02227)], which was directly compared to the effect of magnesium-, iron- and zinc sulfate. They confirmed that, by contrast with the other salts, aluminum sulfate had an unusual and significant ability to induce NF-B signaling and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS), mediated by down-regulation of the important inflammation inhibitor, complement factor H (CFH). In a subsequent paper, the sulfates of 13 different cations were assessed for their ability to induce ROS in neuronal cultures, and aluminum was determined to stand out among all the ions studied for its remarkable ability to induce ROS, even compared with mercury and lead [ [64](#B64-entropy-14-02227)]. Aluminum induced a response that was a factor of seven higher than that of mercury and a factor of three higher than that of lead. [68](#B68-entropy-14-02227)]. Our research has led us to suspect disruption of calmodulin (CaM) signaling as one of the most destructive aspects of aluminum toxicity. CaM functions as a calcium sensor and signal transducer that regulates a number of distinct protein targets, influencing many different cellular functions [ [69](#B69-entropy-14-02227)]. Upon binding to calcium, CaM undergoes a conformational change, and subsequent transformations such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation can modulate its action. [70](#B70-entropy-14-02227)]. Normally, calmodulin (CaM), after binding to calcium, stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by both endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). An investigation of the interaction of aluminum ions with bovine brain CaM [ [71](#B71-entropy-14-02227)], confirmed that aluminum binds to CaM with an affinity that is an order of magnitude stronger than that of calcium. Interaction with aluminum induces a conformational change in the molecular structure. A molar ratio of 4:1 for aluminum/CaM completely blocks the activity of CaM-dependent phosphodiesterases. Highly hydrated aluminum ions profoundly influence the protein's flexibility and disrupt its structural integrity. [72](#B72-entropy-14-02227), [73](#B73-entropy-14-02227)]. Aluminum appears to interfere with iron-sulfur clusters in the mitochondria, causing impaired ATP synthesis, excess production of reactive oxygen species, and impaired formation of the cytoskeleton, which is essential for the cell's function in maintaining the health of neighboring neurons. Cells exposed to as little as 0.01 mM concentrations of aluminum show a disrupted actin cytoskeleton and a drastic morphological change into a globular configuration. Due to its cationic +3 charge, aluminum directly causes in vitro aggregation of neurofilaments characteristic of many human neurological diseases [ [42](#B42-entropy-14-02227)]. [74](#B74-entropy-14-02227)]. This resulted in the excess synthesis of NO by eNOS, and a subsequent signaling cascade, mediated by the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. We hypothesize that aluminum's propensity to bind strongly to CaM mediated this response. [75](#B75-entropy-14-02227)], an effect that is hypothesized to be due to an impaired glutamate-mediated neuronal-pruning developmental phase. Overgrowth is observed in cerebral, cerebellar, and limbic structures underlying cognitive, social, emotional, and language functions [ [76](#B76-entropy-14-02227)]. Significantly, a study involving prenatal aluminum exposure revealed an effect on neurons in rat brains suggesting resistance to apoptosis following glutamate signaling, a potentially related phenomenon [ [77](#B77-entropy-14-02227)]. Glutamate-induced neuronal death was significantly reduced in primary cultures of cerebellar neurons taken from aluminum-exposed rats. The effect was shown to be mediated by a disruption of CaM signaling to induce nNOS activity, analogous to the CaM-related effect of aluminum in endothelial cells. [21](#B21-entropy-14-02227)]: cells and complex molecules suspended in the blood avoid flocculation through a negative charge field maintained in the immediate surrounding space. One of the main functions of serum albumin is to control colloid stability in the blood [ [78](#B78-entropy-14-02227)]. [79](#B79-entropy-14-02227), [80](#B80-entropy-14-02227)]. The adsorption of aluminum onto serum albumin has a profound effect on serum zeta potential (ZP) [ [80](#B80-entropy-14-02227)], driving it even to positive values at physiological pH with sufficient concentrations of aluminum hydroxide. It is believed that much of the mercury that is filtered into the proximal tubular lumen in the glomerulus of the kidney is present primarily as a conjugate of albumin, bound to the sulfhydryl group of constituent Hg2+ salts bound to serum albumin would be expected to cause a similar effect as aluminum on serum ZP. [79](#B79-entropy-14-02227)]. A study on oral exposure to methylmercury in mice confirmed that the methylmercury is absorbed, taken up by the liver, and then exported via the bile acids, likely bound to bio-organic sulfate. These researchers demonstrated a complete inability to dispose of methylmercury in neonate animals, confirming that newborns are much more susceptible to mercury toxicity than adults [ [81](#B81-entropy-14-02227)]. It was shown that this impaired disposal was due in part to insufficient glutathione in the liver. [82](#B82-entropy-14-02227)]. Exposure to thimerosal leads to abnormal glutamate transport in neurons in mouse hippocampi [ [83](#B83-entropy-14-02227)]. Mercury also has an adverse effect on sulfate recycling in the glomeruli, leading to a net loss of sulfate via the urine. A noticeable reduction in the production of dermatan sulfate is associated with mercury exposure, via an effect on the mesangial cells [ [84](#B84-entropy-14-02227)]. Thus, mercury would be expected to either build up to toxic levels or further reduce sulfate bioavailability in the child with autism. 3. Related Work 3.1. MMR Vaccine [85](#B85-entropy-14-02227)]. A large population-based study involving children born in Denmark between 1991 and 1998 has seemingly proven otherwise [ [12](#B12-entropy-14-02227)]. In comparing 440,000 vaccinated children with 96,000 unvaccinated children, the authors claimed that no significant difference in the incidence of autism was detected between the two groups. However, there are several concerns with this study. The first one is that the reasons for not vaccinating were not determined, and it is likely that important reasons might have been the presence of autism in a close family member, thus predisposing the non-vaccinated population to autism due to the inheritability of the disease (or, the fact that the mother still has the nutritional deficiency that caused the older sibling's autism). Another possibility for exclusion is an actual diagnosis of autism, or an adverse reaction to some other vaccine, a feature that is also likely associated with increased risk of autism. [86](#B86-entropy-14-02227)]. If this is true, then this is in stark contrast to the U.S. policy, where thimerosal still appears in several vaccinations given to young children, including Hep-B and HiB Titer. Aluminum is present in several of the vaccines, for example, Hep-B, PREVNAR, all of the DTaP formulations, and H1N1 flu vaccine multidose vials. 3.2. Other Related Work [87](#B87-entropy-14-02227)]. A workshop was held in 2002 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, addressing the issues associated with aluminum in vaccines, with a particular focus on myalgias and fatigue in adults following vaccination exposure to aluminum [ [88](#B88-entropy-14-02227)]. A recently published article seriously addresses the question of the safety of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines, pointing out the neurotoxicity of aluminum [ [45](#B45-entropy-14-02227)]. A U.S.-based study published in 2010 [ [89](#B89-entropy-14-02227)] determined that a three-fold increased risk to autism was associated with neonatal administration of Hepatitis B (Hep-B) vaccine prior to 1999, compared with either no vaccination or a delay until after the first month of age. Notably, Hep-B contains both aluminum and mercury. [90](#B90-entropy-14-02227)], it was reported that six infants died suddenly within 48 hours of having received a hexavalent vaccine, a frequency that is abnormally high compared to the risk of SIDS in the general population. Unexpectedly high SIDS rates following vaccination are also reported in [ [91](#B91-entropy-14-02227)]. Researchers in Italy [ [92](#B92-entropy-14-02227)] report that the first vaccination carries an increased risk to SIDS in infants. In [ [93](#B93-entropy-14-02227)], through statistical analysis based on 300 cases of unexplained sudden death, a 16-fold increased risk was determined following the fourth dose in a series of vaccinations. In [ [94](#B94-entropy-14-02227)], it was reported that the observed rate of anaphylaxis following administration of the HPV vaccine to females aged 12 to 26 was significantly higher than the rate observed following other vaccines. In [ [95](#B95-entropy-14-02227)], precautionary monitoring is recommended following vaccination of premature infants, due to observed adverse reactions related to cardiorespiratory events, as well as a substantial increase in serum levels of C reactive protein, an inflammatory marker. This was particularly true for DTaP, an aluminum- containing vaccine, especially when it was combined with concomitant vaccines. [96](#B96-entropy-14-02227)] have previously examined the VAERS database, specifically looking at hospitalization rates and mortality statistics as a function of the number of vaccines simultaneously administered and of age. Linear regression analysis revealed several statistically significant trends, including a positive correlation between hospitalization rates and number of vaccine doses. In addition, mortality rates for infants under six months were significantly higher than rates for children between six months and one year of age, suggesting increased sensitivity of neonates. The authors suggested delaying administering of vaccines as a strategy for reducing risk of a severe adverse reaction. These authors also emphasize the value of VAERS as an important postmarketing safety surveillance tool. [97](#B97-entropy-14-02227)]. A case study published in 2009 described an adult's profound adverse reaction to multiple vaccinations containing aluminum, resulting in aluminum hydroxide deposits accumulating in macrophages in muscle cells, along with debilitating muscle pain and weakness associated with chronic fatigue syndrome and macrophagic myofasciitis [ [98](#B98-entropy-14-02227)]. 4. Our Studies with U.S. CDC VAERS Database [http://vaers.hhs.gov/index](https://vaers.hhs.gov/index)\" beginning in the year 1990. In this section, we will present the results of several experiments we conducted with the VAERS database, using standard statistical techniques based on word frequency information. [99](#B99-entropy-14-02227), [100](#B100-entropy-14-02227)], which provides a p-value associated with the likelihood that the observed distribution bias of the word or phrase could have occurred by chance. To improve statistical power, we collected the most frequently occurring words in the \"symptoms\" fields, and organized them into reasonable classes. For pain,\" \"abdominal discomfort,\" pain.\" [Table 1](#entropy-14-02227-t001)shows all of the words or phrases that were biased towards the autism data set with a p-value at or below 0.05. Constipation [ [101](#B101-entropy-14-02227)], anxiety [ [102](#B102-entropy-14-02227)], asthma [ [28](#B28-entropy-14-02227)], eczema [ [29](#B29-entropy-14-02227)] and premature birth [ [103](#B103-entropy-14-02227)] have all been found to be associated with autism in the research literature. We consider it to be a validation of our methods that we detected these features with a statistically significant p-value. This also implies that the VAERS database may be useful for predicting associations between symptoms and conditions, irrespective of any claim about the effects of a particular vaccine. Prematurity would be expected to be a risk factor for ASD, as the cholesterol sulfate supply from the placenta is normally greatly increased toward the end of pregnancy [ [104](#B104-entropy-14-02227)]. Premature infants may also suffer from additional aluminum exposure also been demonstrated that children with the autism diagnosis exhibit a heightened immune response to antigen stimulation [ [105](#B105-entropy-14-02227)], which we propose is caused by their global deficiency in sulfate supply. Thus, their increased vulnerability to infection in general likely parallels an increased likelihood of an adverse reaction to vaccines, particularly vaccines like MMR where the pathogen is only weakened but not killed. 4.1. Distribution of Vaccine Types in Autism versus Controls [Table 2](#entropy-14-02227-t002). We looked only at data for children under 6 years old, and we computed the percentage of events associated with each vaccine type in each data set. As shown in [Table 2](#entropy-14-02227-t002), MMR was significantly more likely to be associated with autism (41% of the autism-associated events as against only 15% of the non-autism associated events, with a ratio of 2.67). HiB Titer and hepatitis were also over-represented in the autism group, although to a lesser degree. [25](#B25-entropy-14-02227), [106](#B106-entropy-14-02227)]. It has been proposed that acetaminophen may mediate oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in autism [ [107](#B107-entropy-14-02227)], and acetaminophen has been demonstrated to be toxic to developing mouse cortical neurons in vitro suggests an impaired ability to metabolize toxic substances via a sulfation pathway. If the MMR vaccine is administered simultaneously with DTaP, an aluminum-containing vaccine (as is often the case), then the acetaminophen would likely interfere with the child's ability to dispose of the aluminum. [Figure 1](#entropy-14-02227-f001). It is striking that the number rises steadily over the last five years of the twentieth century, peaking around 2003. In the U.S., aluminum was allegedly phased in at the same time that mercury was phased out [ [110](#B110-entropy-14-02227)]. If the current CDC immunization schedule [ [111](#B111-entropy-14-02227)] is followed, babies are injected with nearly 5 mg of aluminum by 18 months of age. [110](#B110-entropy-14-02227)]. However, four doses of a new aluminum-containing pneumococcal vaccine were added to the vaccine schedule within the next few years [ [110](#B110-entropy-14-02227), [111](#B111-entropy-14-02227)], increasing the total aluminum burden by 20%. This could have masked any drops in autism rates consequential to the decreased mercury burden. 4.2. Relationship between Aluminum in Vaccines and Symptoms [Table shows a steady rise from about 1997 to 2003. It is conceivable that the workshop on aluminum held in 2002 [ [88](#B88-entropy-14-02227)] had some impact in reducing the aluminum burden in vaccines, although it is difficult to determine the adjustments of aluminum adjuvantion in vaccines over time, due to lack of transparency. [Figure 3](#entropy-14-02227-f003)shows the ratio of the total number of aluminum-related adverse reactions associated with a particular year to the total number of aluminum-containing events occurring during that year. This number rises steadily over the turn of the century, reaching above 1.0 starting in the year 2000, and peaking at 1.4 in 2003. This means that multiple adverse reactionscellulitis and reaction site macule, for example, are occurring in association with a single adverse event. The peak at 2003 corresponds well with the peak in autism-related reports. Thus there are introduced both an increase in the number of events around 2000 as well as an increase in the potency of each event to induce a reaction. This could be explained as an increased sensitivity to aluminum in the population, possibly due to a synergistic effect of cumulative exposure to multiple toxins [ [113](#B113-entropy-14-02227)]. 4.3. MMR Vaccine and Autism [Table 4](#entropy-14-02227-t004). As might be expected, a diagnosis of infection with measles, mumps, or chicken pox were highly significantly associated with the MMR vaccine, as well as the simple word \"rash\" (p = 0.00000003). However, respiratory tract infection (p = 0.042) and cough (p = 0.014) were also over-represented in the MMR subset; suggesting that children with an infection are more likely to react adversely to the vaccine. Since children with the autism diagnosis have a compromised immune function, they are more likely to be sick at the time of the injection. But, most interesting for our purposes were the association of fever (p = 0.024) and autism (p = 0.0067) with MMR. There were a total of 1840 adverse reactions mentioning fever in the MMR set. This suggests to us that the acetaminophen connection may be correctthat the fever associated with MMR exposure is treated with acetaminophen, which then becomes toxic to the brain of the child predisposed toward autism, because of their inability to dispose of it. Acetaminophen would also deplete sulfate needed to detoxify aluminum in any concurrent aluminum-containing vaccine B Vaccine and Autism [114](#B114-entropy-14-02227)]. In 1991, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended that all infants be injected with the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Since the states control mandatory vaccination policy, this recommendation was gradually put into law in nearly all of the states over the subsequent decade. By 1998, most children in America were required to show proof of three doses of Hep-B prior to entering public school. Since Hep-B contains both mercury and aluminum, and since it is administered at birth, it is likely to be a major factor contributing to the steady rise in autism-related events in the latter half of symptoms with a p-value less than 0.05. The counts and p-values we obtained for aluminum are shown alongside the results for Hep-B for easy comparison. [89](#B89-entropy-14-02227)]. The association of aluminum-containing vaccines in general with autism does not quite make statistical significance (p = 0.06) compared to non-aluminum-containing vaccines. We explain this observation through the high fever associated with MMR, a non-aluminum-containing vaccine, that leads to the common practice of administering acetaminophen [ [25](#B25-entropy-14-02227)], which the autistic child cannot adequately detoxify. However, the fact that autism is so clearly associated with Hep-B gives one pause. 4.5. Limitations of the VAERS Database and the Experiments [115](#B115-entropy-14-02227)]. We identified only 1,734 mentions of autism in the entire dataset, whereas the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, established in 1988, reports over 5,000 claims that autism is associated with vaccines. Another limitation is that it is not easy to distinguish cases where autism may have been a preexisting condition affecting the child's sensitivity to the vaccine, as contrasted with cases where the vaccine may have preceded, and therefore may potentially be causative in, a later diagnosis of autism. Finally, both patients and physicians can submit reports, so quality control due to reporting bias or lack of expertise may be an issue. Not all of the reports contain a record of the date of the vaccination, and this introduces some error in the temporal relationships. 5. Discussion [116](#B116-entropy-14-02227)], it is argued that safety assessments for vaccines have not included appropriate toxicity studies because vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic, but that this point of view should be revisited in light of the increased awareness of the potential toxicity of aluminum, particularly for infants and young children. They argue further that it is now well established that a bidirectional neuro-immune cross-talk regulates both the immune system and brain function. [117](#B117-entropy-14-02227)]. However, the result on mercury contradicts another study which showed reduced mercury in the hair of infants with autism [ [118](#B118-entropy-14-02227)], and a third study which showed no statistical difference in mercury content of hair between children with autism and controls [ [119](#B119-entropy-14-02227)]. A study in rats showed that oral antibiotics dramatically inhibit mercury excretion to 10% of normal levels [ [120](#B120-entropy-14-02227)]. It is conceivable that an inability to export aluminum into the hair, due to severe sulfate depletion, could complicate the interpretation of a metric based on aluminum content in hair. [113](#B113-entropy-14-02227)]. [121](#B121-entropy-14-02227)]. We believe that the VAERS database is a rich resource, many of whose secrets are yet to be revealed. 6.
