But did you know that [acupuncture](https://www.healthline.com/health/acupuncture-for-weight-loss) can actually help you achieve your weight loss goals? As of 2015, the [CDC ](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html)reports that 93.3 million adults in the United States are overweight \u2014 39.8% of the population. Whether the extra weight comes from stress, addictive eating, overindulging over the holidays or having a baby, acupuncture for weight loss is by no means a cure-all, but can be a powerful tool when combined with other healthy practices. \"Acupuncture can be effective in helping you lose weight because it affects the hormones,\" says Lauren Buckley, licensed acupuncturist and founder of [South Philly Community Acupuncture](https://www.southphillyacupuncture.com/). \"It helps with promoting healthy digestion and metabolism, helps to relieve stress and can help with sugar cravings and addictive eating.\" There are loads of indirect benefits as well. \"Since it affects your nervous system, it gives you better sleep and energy, so you'll probably want to be more active,\" Lauren says. \"If your body is in fight or flight mode, then your metabolism isn't going to work because your cortisol levels are high.\" When it comes to acupuncture for weight loss, different treatments are required for different situations. If you're trying to lose baby weight or extra holiday pounds, improving digestion and metabolism is the main tactic. If you have a food addiction, however, additional treatment is needed. \"That's when you would need to come in three times a week for about six weeks, just like any other addiction,\" Lauren says. \"We're dealing with the psychology around the addiction as well as the physical need and cravings.\" Auricular acupuncture, targeting points in the ear, is often used to treat various types of addictions. For food addiction specifically, it helps stop the craving for sugar and carbs. \"Nothing is going to take the food out of your mouth, including acupuncture needles,\" Lauren says. \"It's really a matter of lifestyle changes.\" Lauren advocates for eating a clean diet that includes cutting out sugar, carbs, greasy foods, processed foods and casein. \"I can help stimulate your digestion and boost your metabolism, but to really see results, it's up to the patient to embrace a holistic approach when it comes to their health,\" she says.
