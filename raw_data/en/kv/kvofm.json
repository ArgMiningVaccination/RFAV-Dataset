BRILEY MELANIE RUDD JENNIFER AAKER Research shows that optimism can positively impact health, but when and why people feel optimistic when confronting health challenges is less clear. Findingsfrom six studies show that the frames people adopt when thinking about healthchallenges influence their optimism about overcoming those challenges, and that their culture moderates this effect. In cultures where the independent self is highly accessible, individuals adopting an initiator frame (how will I act, regardless of thesituations I encounter?) were more optimistic than those adopting a responderframe (how will I react to the situations I encounter?); the converse occurred for individuals from cultures where the interdependent self is highly accessible. Moreover, mediation and moderation evidence revealed that this interactive effectof culture and frame on optimism was driven by people's ability to easily imaginethe recovery process. These effects held for distinct health challenges (cancer, diabetes, flood-related illness, traumatic injury) and across single-country and cross-country samples, and they impacted positive health outcomes and decisionsranging from anticipated energy, physical endurance, and willingness to take onmore challenging physical therapy to intentions to get vaccinated, stick to a doctor-recommended diet, and undertake a physically strenuous vacation. Keywords : optimism, health, culture, mental simulation, framing At some point during their lives, most people will face a traumatic health event, and mounting evidence sug- gests that psychological factors are vital to recovery(Taylor and Broffman 2011 ). One such critical factor is op- timism, defined as a generalized belief that good outcomesare possible ( Scheier and Carver 1985 ). Optimism improves mental and physical well-being, augmentingone's ability to cope with stress and recover from surgery,fostering better health habits, reducing physical symptomsof illness, and even extending lives ( Carver, Scheier, and Segerstrom 2010 ;Scheier and Carver 1985 ;Taylor et al. 1992 ). Yet, despite the clear benefits, little is known about when and how people cultivate optimism when confrontedwith a health challenge. These questions are particularlyimportant in the context of consumer behavior, whereresearchers have increasingly sought to identify ways toencourage people to adopt actions or treatments to improve physical health (e.g., vaccines, diets, or physical therapy regimens; Agrawal, Menon, and Aaker 2007 Peracchio, and Block 2010 ;Keller and Lehman 2008 ). In our research, we show that the mental frame people adopt when considering how to cope with a health chal-lenge significantly impacts their optimism about recovery,and that culture moderates this effect. Across six studies we predicted and found that, when facing a health chal- lenge, people with an independent cultural backgroundDonnel A.

We also show that this greater optimism is reflectedin people's health-related decisions and leads to beneficialhealth outcomes, including greater anticipated energy andphysical endurance; stronger preferences for more inten-sive physical therapy and physically strenuous leisure; and increased intentions to use doctor-recommended treatments. Through this research, we hope to contribute theoretic- ally to a number of literatures, including consumer behav-ior, mental imagery, and framing. For instance, althoughprior research has found that imagining the processesinvolved in reaching a goal can facilitate goal attainment (Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1979 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ), various styles of process-oriented imagining have beenstudied in the literature. Our work contributes to this litera-ture by exploring when and why it is more beneficial toadopt one of these imagining styles over another. In par-ticular, we examined the effectiveness of two such styles\u2014 one in which imagery in the mind is understood through a person-focused, initiator frame, and another in which it isunderstood through a situation-focused, responder frame. The present research also contributes to extant literature by showing that when an individual uses mental imagery tofind solutions to a health challenge, effective cultivation ofoptimism depends not only on how that person frames images (initiating actions vs. responding to situations), but also on whether this framing is consistent with the person'sculturally influenced self-view (i.e., independent vs. inter-dependent). In particular, we show that when there is align-ment between one's cultural background and the frameadopted, optimism about recovering increases because it is easier to imagine oneself taking necessary steps to get bet- ter (Jiang et al. 2014 ;Petrova and Cialdini 2005 ). Although prior research has shown that matching effects can havemany consequences ( Avnet and Higgins 2003 ,2006 ; Cesario, Grant, and Higgins 2004 ;Lee and Aaker 2004 ), the present research extends this literature by identifyingboth a novel positive outcome of frame alignment (greater optimism) and a novel mechanism (ease of imagining one's recovery). Last, the present research answers mounting calls for studies that increase the range of consumption-relatedbehaviors examined, contribute to conversations thatstretch across disciplines ( Dahl et al. 2014 ), and fundamen- tally improve consumers' well-being ( Goldberg 2008 ; Mick et al. 2012 ). Indeed, from an applied perspective, our work offers insights to help consumers recover after theyexperience a serious health challenge (e.g., recoveringfrom surgery, battling cancer) and help practitioners to positively impact consumers' health-related decisions. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Mental Simulation and Framing The path to health recovery is often complicated by un- certainty and unpredictable circumstances, which can ham- per good decisions ( Haidt and Rodin 1999 ). However, these obstacles can be better managed when people im-agine themselves taking steps to overcome their healthchallenge, which entails generating picture-like mental rep-resentations ( Jiang et al. 2014 ;Kosslyn 1976 ). This par- ticular type of imagery generation, which emphasizessimulating the process needed for reaching a goal, is referred to as process-oriented mental simulation or process-oriented imagining ( Taylor et al. 1998 ). Though other forms of mental simulation (e.g., fantasizing success,painful ruminations, outcome-focused simulating) are oftenunhelpful Sharma, and 2013 ;Oettingen 1996 ;Silver, Boon, and Stones 1983 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ), process- oriented imagining has been shown to be beneficial forgoal attainment ( Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1979 ; Markus and Ruvolo 1989 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ). This is be- cause imagining the process needed to reach a desired endstate offers a view of a hypothetical reality that transcends the here and now\u2014providing a platform for envisioning possibilities, anticipating emotional states, building motiv-ation, exploring one's own potential, and ultimately, plan-ning for the future effectively ( Markus and Nurius 1986 ; Oyserman and Markus 1990 ;Pham and Taylor 1999 ; Ruvolo and Markus 1992 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ). Extant literature, however, also suggests that there are different styles of process-oriented imagining that people might adopt when envisioning the future (e.g., when imag-ining the process of recovering from a health challenge).First, some research suggests that people might benefitfrom accepting and embracing the uncontrollable,ever-changing nature of long-term health recovery by developing situation-focused, if-then contingency plans (Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1979 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ). Another perspective, though, is that those on the road to re-covery should focus internally, emphasizing their own abil-ities and strengths when planning, thereby bolstering self-confidence ( Niemiec, Ryan, and Deci 2010 ). Thus, prior research has variously touted styles of process-oriented imagining that fit both the former, situation-focused ap- proach and the latter, person-focused approach for imagin-ing one's future ( Markus and Ruvolo 1989 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ). However, what remains unclear is when and why it might be more beneficial to adopt one of these imaginingstyles over the other when facing a health challenge.896 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018To address this question, we suggest that these two gen- eralized approaches can be understood as different framesthat one might adopt when imagining the future: the\"initiator\" frame (how will I act, regardless of the situa-tions I encounter?) and the \"responder\" frame (how will Ireact to the situations I encounter?). These two proposed frames are in essence knowledge structures stored in mem- ory that guide image generation, and are subject to thesame rules as other cognitive procedures (e.g., they can beactivated by external prompts). But notably, whereas mostcognitive procedures directly guide behaviors, the frameswe propose guide the depiction of behaviors one imagines when thinking about how to reach a goal, such as recover- ing from a health challenge. Thus, once activated, a framecan influence which representations drive one's imaginingsand how emerging images are interpreted. Consistent with the aforementioned situation-focused approach, a person might in some cases adopt a responderframe when imagining her or his recovery process. When this is the case, the images and scenes called to mind are likely to center on future situations that may be encoun-tered. One's actions are seen as embedded within their sur-rounding context, sensitive to the flow of externalinfluences. Alternatively, consistent with the person-focused approach, a person might adopt an initiator frame when imagining her or his recovery process. In this case, the resulting images and scenes are likely to highlight theindividual rather than particular situations she or he mightface. The individual is often depicted more abstractly,without detailing the surrounding context or particular sit-uations, narrowly focusing on efforts necessary foraddressing the health challenge. At a deeper level, the initiator-responder distinction can be characterized by the nature of the representations that are likely to predominatewhen imagery is generated. In particular, responder versusinitiator frames might be more likely to call up event (situ-ation-related) rather than entity (person-related) representa-tions, or to call up situation-related representations that are less broad or generalizable ( Wyer 2004 ). Though parallels can be drawn between the initiator- responder frame constructs and some extant consumption-relevant dichotomies that also distinguish between beingmore or less situation-focused, key differences separateour constructs from these other dichotomies. First, otherdichotomies differ from ours in that they often pertain only to a particular domain of activity (e.g., shopping; Massara, Liu, and Melara 2010 ). Second, whereas these other dichotomies are limited to describing the extent towhich situational context draws attention and influencesjudgments and behaviors, the frames we propose charac-terize imagined (rather than actual) behaviors and activ- ities, and thus operate in the domain of mental imagery, where the creations of people's minds are at work.Exploring the influence of frames for imagining is im-portant because the rules governing real-world behaviordo not necessarily apply to the imagined world ( Markus and Nurius 1986 ). Third, the defining principles underlying the frame di- chotomy we propose also differ from the traditionalcontext-dependence dimension. In particular, context de-pendence (vs. independence) is characterized by a greater tendency to be content rather than struggle with encoun- tered situations, to acquiesce or bend to the environment,and to align oneself with group needs ( Ji, Peng, and Nisbett 2000 ;Kuhnen, Hannover, and Schubert 2001 ; Singelis et al. 1995 ;Weisz, Rothbaum, and Blackburn 1984 ). However, unlike the context-dependence construct, the initiator-responder distinction does not describe the ex- tent to which one is in harmony with, or subordinates con-trol to, her or his environment. This distinction insteadidentifies one's orientation (situation-focused, person-focused) when imagining the process needed to reach a tar-get end goal such as health recovery\u2014not the intensitywith which one actively pursues this end goal. Along these lines, it is also important to note that initi- ator and responder frames can be used to envision the samebehavior or activity. For instance, when faced with a ser-ious injury and imagining the process for recovering, an in-dividual might see herself as a responder and, therefore,generate images that depict various situations she will face during recovery and how to address them. With this per- spective, she might anticipate particular difficult situations(sleepless nights due to pain) and form a plan for address-ing these occasions (physical therapy). Alternatively, shecould see herself as an initiator and imagine the future withless sensitivity to the specific situations that might emerge.She might develop general person-focused solutions to pur- sue in this case, such as committing to spend more time doing physical therapy. As this anecdote illustrates, thesame physical therapy solution can arise via the initiator orresponder imagining process, though the resulting mentalimagery either ties the activity to the situation (responder)or individual (initiator). Culture and Consumer Choice Consumers' cultural backgrounds, we suggest, affect which of these frames is most effective for cultivating opti- mism when one imagines one's health recovery. In the lastthree decades, researchers have conceptualized culture interms of the view of the self: Over time, as people graspand internalize the prevailing norms and values of the soci-ety in which they live, they tend to develop either a chron-ically accessible interdependent or independent self-view. Westerners typically adopt an independent view of the self, and East Asians typically adopt an interdependent view(Markus and Kitayama 1991 ). This distinction has implica- tions for how people make sense of the social world aswell as their basic cognitive processes ( Briley, Wyer, and Li 2014 ;Mourey, Oyserman, and ).BRILEY, RUDD, AND AAKER 897 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018People with highly accessible independent selves define themselves by their distinct attributes, qualities, and char-acteristics, and gaining this important knowledge requiresdrawing generalizations across situational contexts. For ex-ample, a student might be described as hardworking be-cause he puts a great deal of effort into his classes, job, and sports activities. Thus, in the process of developing an in- dependent self-view, one becomes accustomed to centeringone's thinking on the individual and organizing knowledgestructures accordingly. On the other hand, those with inter-dependent selves define people based on important rela-tionships and connections to others. Because the acquisition of this knowledge depends on attending to so- cial context and adjusting to its changes ( Kuhnen et al. 2001 ), people with a dominant interdependent (vs. inde- pendent) self-view tend to see people and the surroundingsthey encounter as intertwined and inseparable, adopting amore holistic view that integrates person and situation(Masuda et al. 2008 ;Monga and John 2007 ). Our contention is that imagery-generation processes can be influenced by one's self-view. As a starting point, priorresearch has shown that the accessibility of situation-specific information in memory differs depending on self-view. For instance, when describing themselves in theTwenty Statements Test ( Cousins 1989 ), Japanese individ- uals use more situation-qualified descriptors (e.g., I work hard at tennis), whereas Americans use more situation-irrelevant descriptors (e.g., I am hardworking). Morris and Peng (1994) provided further evidence of this assertion by analyzing news reports of mass murders. They comparedarticles about two assailants\u2014Gang Lu (a Chinese physicsstudent) and Thomas McIlvane (an American postal worker)\u2014that appeared in the leading English-language (New York Times ) and Chinese-language ( World Journal ) newspapers. These newspapers were targeted at Americanand Chinese communities, respectively. In the articles,Chinese reporters most often suggested that situationalforces impinging on the assailant caused the tragedy (e.g., a recent firing, or isolation from loved ones), whereas American reporters most often attributed the events tocharacteristics internal to the assailant (e.g., a bad temperor mental instability). Further evidence of this pattern has emerged in examinations of cognitions guiding judgments rather thandecisions or behaviors. In a study by Masuda et al. (2008) , American and Japanese participants assessed the happiness of a person who appears in a photo with otherpeople in the background. The Americans relied on the fa-cial expression of the focal person to determine his happi-ness, whereas the Japanese spent relatively more timefocusing on the facial expressions of the people in the background and drew on these contextual factors when assessing the focal person's happiness. This researchshows that for the interdependent self, behaviors areunderstood to be intertwined with and to emerge from thecontext in which they occur. For the independent self, the context is less important. In our research, we seek to forge a connection between this work and the literature on matching and fit effects. Inparticular, we posit that when people are facing a healthchallenge, optimism should be most effectively cultivated under conditions that activate a frame that is more aligned with their culture's normative viewpoint. Prior researchhas shown that alignment between the task at hand and aperson's goal orientation can influence many judgment anddecision-making outcomes ( Avnet and Higgins 2006 ; Cesario et al. 2004 ;Lee and Aaker 2004 ). The present re- search aims to extend this literature by exploring a differ- ent type of alignment\u2014that between one's culturalbackground and the type of mental simulation frame oneadopts\u2014and identifying its effect on optimism, an outcomethat has yet to be examined in the extant matching and fitliterature. In particular, we posit that, to generate greateroptimism when imagining how to address a health chal- lenge, people with an independent self-view should adopt an initiator frame, which elicits imagery focusing on the in-dividual and his or her actions rather than the situations inwhich these actions occur. Those with an interdependentself-view, on the other hand, should embrace a responderframe, which elicits imagery focusing on situations one might encounter and appropriate responses. We also posit that having such alignment increases opti- mism by facilitating one's ability to imagine undertakingthe steps needed to overcome the health challenge. Whenalignment occurs between the mental simulation frame thata person adopts and her or his predominant self-view, thefuture activities he or she imagines should be depicted more readily and in a more familiar way. Indeed, research has shown that people have a harder time comprehendingrelevant task information when they approach the task witha perspective that differs from that which they are disposi-tionally inclined to use ( Lee and Labroo 2004 ;Wyer, Hung, and Jiang 2008 ;Wyer and Xu 2010 ). And if it is eas- ier for the person to imagine the process of recovering, the recovery plan should seem more definite and feasible, andthe attainment of the desired health outcome should be per-ceived as more likely to actually occur ( Mandel, Petrova, and Cialdini 2006 ;Sherman et al. 1985 ). Consequently, op- timism about recovering should increase. Notably, the mechanism we propose departs from prior research, in that past work has generally pointed to a per- son's feelings of fit (processing fluency) as the driver ofmatching-related effects. Fit creates a feeling of being rightabout reactions to stimuli, increasing the importance of andengagement in these reactions, whether positive or nega-tive ( Avnet and Higgins 2006 ). However, feelings of fit cannot adequately account for our predicted optimism effects in the health recovery domain. When facing ahealth challenge and imagining one's future experiencesand behaviors, one is likely to have positive reactions to898 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018imagined triumphs or progress, and negative reactions to imagined struggles, pains, or setbacks. Consequently, anaccount based on feelings of fit would predict that the im-portance or strength of all of these reactions\u2014both positiveand negative\u2014would be equally enhanced and that, as a re-sult, optimism could potentially increase, decrease, or be left unchanged, depending on the mix of positive and nega- tive reactions. This differs from the ease-of-imagining ac-count, which offers a straight prediction of greateroptimism. Regardless of how difficult that recovery pro-cess is envisioned to be, when it is easier for people to im-agine themselves undertaking the recovery process, they should believe that recovery is more likely to actually occur, boosting optimism. Returning to our previous example, a woman who has suffered serious injuries might imagine doing physicaltherapy to get better (and this activity could be consideredregardless of whether she adopts an initiator or responderframe). But importantly, we propose that the ease with which she can imagine herself engaging in and completing this imagined activity should be influenced by the combin-ation of the frame she adopts (initiator or responder) andher cultural background. If she is Chinese and thus likelyhas an interdependent self-view, she should be able tomore easily imagine these therapy sessions with a re- sponder (vs. initiator) frame in place and, as a result, should become more optimistic about the recovery ahead.On the other hand, if she is European American and thuslikely has an independent self-view, she should be able tomore easily imagine these sessions with an initiator (vs. re-sponder) frame in place and, as a result, should becomemore optimistic about the recovery ahead. In sum, we pre- dict an interactive effect of culture (independent vs. inter- dependent) and frame (initiator vs. responder) onoptimism, an effect that is mediated by the ease with whichpeople can imagine carrying out activities planned forrecovering from their health challenge. H1a: For participants facing a health challenge, their cul- tural background and frame will have an interactive effecton their optimism about recovering: (a) when participantswith independent self-views imagine activities for recover-ing from a health challenge, they are more optimistic aboutrecovering if they adopt an initiator (vs. responder) frame;(b) when participants with interdependent self-views im-agine the process of recovering from a health challenge,they are more optimistic about recovering if they adopt a re-sponder (vs. initiator) frame. H1b: For participants facing a health challenge, the inter- active effect of a participant's culture and frame on their op-timism will be reflected in health-related decisions (willing-ness to take on more challenging physical therapy duringrecovery, preference for physically challenging leisure, andintent to use or follow recommended treatments). H2: For participants facing a health challenge, the inter- active effect of a participant's culture and frame on theiroptimism is mediated by the ease with which they can im- agine engaging in the activities they are planning for over-coming their health challenge. OVERVIEW OF STUDIES We present six studies to examine how cultural back- ground and the frame participants adopt impact their opti-mism when confronting a health challenge. In study 1, Asian American and European American participants imagined they had been seriously injured in a car accident,had either a responder or initiator frame activated whenthinking about what they would do to recover, and thentold us what vacations and diet plans they would choose inthe wake of this incident. In line with our predictions, par-ticipants made choices reflecting a more optimistic outlook when their cultural backgrounds and frame matched. Asian Americans who adopted a responder (vs. initiator) framewere more likely to choose the more physically demandingvacation plan and believed they could follow the diet for alonger time, whereas European Americans who adopted aninitiator (vs. responder) frame were more likely to choose the more physically demanding vacation plan and believed they could follow the diet for a longer time. In study 2, Asian American and European American cancer survivors adopted either a responder or initiatorframe when thinking about how to address their illness,then reported how optimistic they were about overcomingtheir cancer and, for convergent validity, told us how much physical energy they anticipated feeling in the future. We expected these two measures to converge because apatient's outlook for recovering and perceptions of avail-able energy for fueling this fight are related ( Achat et al. 2000 ;Schro \u00a8der, Schwarzer, and Konertz 1998 ) and are both positively associated with recovery, echoing the inex- tricable link between physiological and psychological states ( Crum et al. 2011 ;Crum, Salovey, and Achor 2013 ; Taylor et al. 1992 ). As predicted, Asian American cancer survivors were more optimistic about recovering whenthey adopted a responder (vs. initiator) frame, whereasEuropean American cancer survivors were more optimistic when they adopted an initiator (vs. responder) frame. Participants' anticipated physical energy showed a similarpattern. Building on these findings, study 3 showed effects of initiator versus responder frames on people's physical en-durance, directly establishing that the influence of theseframes encompasses physiological outcomes. We asked Asian Americans and European Americans to imagine they were recently diagnosed with cancer. After being promptedto adopt either an initiator or responder frame, they consid-ered how they could stay active while fighting the disease,and repeatedly squeezed a handgrip while developing apersonal plan for exercising. We recorded the force theyBRILEY, RUDD, AND AAKER 899 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018applied to the handgrip and used this as a behavioral meas- ure of physical endurance. The results replicated the pat-tern found in study 2: Asian Americans exhibited greaterphysical endurance when adopting a responder (vs. initi-ator) frame, and European Americans exhibited greaterphysical endurance when adopting an initiator (vs. re- sponder) frame. Having established the interactive effect of culture and frame on optimism, in the remaining studies (studies 4-6)we focused on testing the mechanism underlying it. Study4 showed that the ease with which participants could im-agine their coping activities after a serious injury mediates the influence that culture and frame have on optimism. Study 5 sought to provide additional support for our pro-posed mechanism via moderation: this study manipulatedthe extent to which participants could readily produce men-tal imagery and found converging evidence for the role ofease of imagining the recovery process. Last, in study 6,US flood victims had initiator or responder frames acti- vated while reading an advertisement about a vaccine that protects against flood-related illnesses and then indicatedtheir likelihood of getting vaccinated, optimism about thevaccine's effectiveness, and the ease with which they couldimagine getting vaccinated. Importantly, study 6 used adifferent measure of cultural background for convergent validity. Rather than use participants' ethnicity as an indi- cator of their self-views, we included a direct measure.Supporting our model, a moderated serial mediation ana-lysis revealed that the interactive effect of frame and self-view (i.e., independence-interdependence) on reportedlikelihood of getting vaccinated was serially mediated byease of imagining and optimism. STUDY 1: CULTURE, FRAME, AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR The primary objective of study 1 was to test our predic- tion that, when people are facing a health challenge, therewould be an interactive effect of their culture and frame(i.e., initiator vs. responder) on their optimism for recov-ery, as reflected in health-related decisions. We recruited Asian American and European American participants, asked them to imagine that they had just been severelyinjured in a car accident, and prompted them to adopt ei-ther an initiator or responder frame while considering howthey would address their health challenge. We then askedthem to consider: (a) which of two vacation packages theywould prefer in the wake of this injury, a highly physical \"adventure\" package or a \"relaxing\" package that did not require much physical exertion; and (b) how long theythought they would be able to follow a healthy diet planrecommended by their doctor. We expected that whenthere was alignment between participants' cultural back-ground and frame, they would more strongly prefer thephysically strenuous adventure package and stick with the doctor-recommended diet plan for a longer period oftime\u2014decisions that reflect greater optimism about theirrecovery and future health. Though our predictions are cross-cultural in nature, study 1 relied on a single-country sample that included par- ticipants from both interdependent (Asian Americans) and independent (European Americans) cultural backgroundsfor two reasons. First, cross-national comparisons cannotcontrol for many nonculture factors that might affect studyresults. Thus, to attenuate potential confounds, we focusedon participants with substantial experience and residency in a single country. Second, since bicultural Asian Americans are likely to have experienced at least some ac-culturation to Western society, their comparison toEuropean Americans should provide a strong, conservativetest of our predictions. Participants and Procedure Participants were 100 European Americans ( Mage\u00bc 36.70; 49 females) and 100 Asian Americans ( Mage\u00bc 31.25; 34 females). They were recruited from European American and Asian American MTurk panels, told that the researchers were interested in understanding how peopledeal with illnesses or injury, and paid $1.00 for participat-ing. The study used a 2 (ethnicity: European American,Asian American) /C22 (frame: initiator, responder) design, with all manipulations between-subjects. Participants were asked to imagine being in a car acci- dent in the future and regaining consciousness in the hos-pital only to discover that they have multiple leg fractures,a badly broken hip, and spinal vertebrae damage. Theywere told these injuries could cause nerve damage and re-quire several surgeries and a long period of physical ther-apy. They were asked to consider how they would address this health challenge and to describe the behaviors, activ- ities, and coping mechanism they had in mind. In the initi-ator condition, they were told to \"consider how you wouldact,\" write down the \"actions you would take,\" and de-scribe \"each action that comes to mind.\" In the respondercondition, they were told to \"consider how you would react,\" write down the \"responses you would have,\" and describe \"each response that comes to mind.\" After participants had read the injury scenario and con- sidered what to do to recover from the injury, we presentedthem with two different scenario questions (the order inwhich these questions were shown was randomized). Inone scenario, participants were told they would be going on a vacation a year from now, but that they would need to begin planning and making reservations for their chosendestination right away. They were presented with two vac-ation packages\u2014an \"adventure vacation package\" thatinvolved lots of opportunities for physical activities (e.g.,hiking, biking, swimming, and rock climbing) and a900 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018\"relaxing vacation package\" that involved scenic and relaxing activities (and required little physical activity).Participants were also told that their doctor had advisedthem that the average person suffering from injuries liketheirs would reach full recovery in one year, but that theirrecovery could be faster or slower. Participants then told us which of these vacation packages they would be more likely to choose for their upcoming vacation (0 \u00bcrelaxing vacation package, 1 \u00bcadventure vacation package). In the other scenario, participants were told that, after careful consideration of their particular nutritional andphysiological needs, their doctor and nutritionist recom- mended that they follow the South Beach Diet during their recovery. After reading a short description of the diet plan,participants learned that most people recovering from aserious injury are able to stick to strict healthy diet planslike this if their recovery is proceeding well, but that thosewho struggle during their recovery (e.g., chronic pain, slowrecovery progress) typically have a much more difficult time consistently sticking with the diet plan. They were also told that their doctor recommends they try to strictlyfollow the diet for 14 months. Participants then told us howlong they thought they would be able to stick with the dietplan (1 \u00bcless than 2 months, 2 \u00bc2 months to <4 months, 3\u00bc4 months to <6 months, 4 \u00bc6 months to <8 months, 5 \u00bc8 months to <10 months, 6 \u00bc10 months to <12 months, 7\u00bc12 months to 14 months). Last, participants provided demographic information. Results and Discussion We conducted logistic regression analyses to examine participants' choice of vacation package (relaxing package\u00bc0, adventure package \u00bc1) as a function of their cultural background (European American \u00bc0, Asian American \u00bc 1) and frame (initiator \u00bc0, responder \u00bc1). The results revealed the predicted significant interaction between frame and culture ( b\u00bc2.31, v 2(1)\u00bc11.71, p<.01). European American participants in the initiator condition(38%) were more likely to choose the physically strenuousadventure vacation package than were the EuropeanAmerican participants in the responder condition (16%; b\u00bc-1.23, v 2(1)\u00bc6.41, p\u00bc.01), whereas Asian American participants in the initiator condition (18%) wereless likely to choose the physically strenuous adventurepackage than were Asian American participants in the re-sponder condition (38%; b\u00bc1.08, v 2(1)\u00bc5.32, p\u00bc.02). We also conducted a two-way ANOVA to examine how long participants thought they could stick with the doctor- recommended diet plan as a function of their cultural back- ground (European American \u00bc0, Asian American \u00bc1) and frame (initiator \u00bc0, responder ( F(1, 196)\u00bc11.67, p<.01). European American participants in the initiator condition ( M\u00bc5.73, SD \u00bc1.64)reported that they would be able to stick with the doctor- recommended diet plan for a longer period of time than didEuropean Americans in the responder F(1, 196) \u00bc6.84, p\u00bc.01). In American were in the respondercondition ( M\u00bc5.61, SD \u00bc1.68) reported that they would be able to stick with the doctor-recommended diet plan for a longer period of time than did Asian Americans in theinitiator was significant ( Fs< .08, NS). Taken together, the findings of study 1 provide initial support for our prediction that, when one is facing a health challenge, there is an interactive effect of the person's cul-ture and frame on decisions and judgments pertaining toher or his future health. This pattern held for participants'selections of physically challenging activities, and assess-ments of their own future success at maintaining a doctor-recommended diet plan\u2014both of which relate to optimism about the progress of health recovery. In our next study, we use a direct, self-report measure of optimism to test ourpredictions. Moreover, instead of having participants im-agine that they are facing a health challenge, study 2 high-lights the generalizability of our findings by surveyingcancer patients. STUDY 2: CANCER PATIENTS' OPTIMISM AND ANTICIPATED ENERGY Study 2 was designed to highlight the role that optimism can play in health recovery by replicating the pattern foundin study 1 using a direct measure of optimism. Further, wesought to establish the external validity of our findings bytesting our predictions using participants who are experi- encing a real health challenge. To achieve both goals, we recruited European American and Asian American cancersurvivors, prompted them to adopt either an initiator or re-sponder frame, and asked them to consider how they wouldaddress their cancer illness in the future. We then exam-ined how optimistic they felt about beating the disease, and how much energy they had to do so. Participants and Procedure Seventy-one European American and 61 Asian American cancer survivors (54% female; Mage\u00bc36.8; MTimeSinceDiagnosis \u00bc6 years, 8 months) were recruited by an online market research firm, paid $20 for participating, and told that the study was about how people with cancer address health challenges. All participants had been diag-nosed with cancer after turning 21 years of age. The studyrelied on a 2 (culture: 901 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018Participants were first prompted to think about how they would address the problems raised by their cancer illness:\"Consider your illness, and its effect on your health. Thenthink about how you will deal with the problems and issuesyou will face in the future. What is your long-term plan forstaying as healthy as you can?\" To activate a responder frame or initiator frame, we manipulated the wording of the subsequent instructions. In the initiator condition, par-ticipants were told to consider \"how you will act to addressthis health threat\" and to \"indicate actions you have inmind by writing a phrase or sentence to describe each ac-tion that you are considering.\" Participants in the responder condition were told to consider \"how you will react\" and to \"indicate responses you will have by writing a phrase orsentence to describe each response you are considering.\" All participants reported their feelings of optimism about overcoming their illness using four measures thatdraw upon Reed et al. (1999) and that indicate problem- specific optimism (\"have a positive outlook,\" 1 \u00bclow chance to 7 \u00bchigh chance), confidence about the course of recovery (\"getting better quickly,\" 1 \u00bclow probability to 7 \u00bchigh probability), expectations about the course (\"recovery speed,\" 1 \u00bcslow to 7 \u00bcfast), and perceived control over the situation (\"can beat this challenge,\" 1 \u00bc strongly agree to 7 \u00bcstrongly disagree). These items were averaged to form an optimism index ( a\u00bc.86). Next, participants reported how much energy they expected to feel in the near future, so that we could under-stand whether greater optimism does indeed precipitate thebelief that one possesses greater energy resources.Specifically, they told us how often during the next fewmonths (1 \u00bcnone of the time, 6 \u00bcall of the time; Lorig et al. 1996 ) they expected to \"feel out\" (reverse- scored), \"have a lot of energy,\" \"have enough energy to dothings you want to do,\" and \"feel full of pep.\" These itemswere averaged to form an anticipated energy index ( a\u00bc .71). Last, participants provided demographics and weredebriefed. To ensure that the frame manipulation (initiator vs. re- sponder) used in this study indeed influenced people's per-spectives as expected, we ran a post-hoc pre-test. Sixty-two European Americans and 55 Asian Americans read ascenario in which they were asked to imagine having a can-cer illness, then were presented with our study stimuli.They thought about how to deal with this health challenge, and were prompted to do so with either the initiator or re- sponder version of the instructions. After writing theirplanned activities, they indicated (1 \u00bcstrongly disagree to 7\u00bcstrongly agree) the extent to which, while planning, they \"focused on situations you might encounter,\"\"avoided thinking about details of your own actions,\" \"focused on actions you might take\" (reverse-scored), and \"avoided thinking about details of the situations you couldface\" (reverse-scored). These items were averaged to forma person-situation index ( a\u00bc.76), with higher scoresindicating greater focus on the situation. As expected, a 2 (culture: European American, Asian American) /C22 (frame: initiator, responder) ANOVA revealed only a sig-nificant manipulation ( F(1, 113) \u00bc4.29, p<.05; other M\u00bc5.06, SD \u00bc.71) reported being more situation-focused (vs. person-focused) than did those in the initiator condition ( M\u00bc4.58, SD \u00bc.82). Results and Discussion A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze feelings of op- timism as a function of cultural background (EuropeanAmerican, Asian American) and frame (initiator, re-sponder). As expected, the interaction was significant ( F(1, 128)\u00bc8.35, p<.01). Asian Americans were more adopt a p<.05). European had the opposite pattern: they had a more opti-mistic outlook in the initiator condition ( M\u00bc5.32, SD \u00bc SD F(1, Fs<.07, NS). Another two-way ANOVA examined participants' energy. revealed a significant inter-action ( F(1, 127) \u00bc4.05, p<.05). European Americans thought they would have more energy when prompted toadopt an initiator frame ( M\u00bc3.24, SD \u00bc.48); F(1, 127) \u00bc4.00, p\u00bc.05). The opposite pattern held for Asian Americans: they anticipated having more energy in the responder con-dition ( M\u00bc3.19, SD M \u00bc3.04, SD \u00bc.73), this not reach sig- nificance ( F(1, 127) \u00bc.79,p\u00bc.38). Finally, we looked for evidence that participants' expectations of having energy in the future were driven by their feelings of optimism. If this were true, we might ex-pect that the influence of the culture-by-frame interactionon energy expectations is mediated by felt optimism. Wetested this prediction using a moderated mediation boot- strap analysis (10,000 resamples; PROCESS model 8). We predicted energy reports using frame type (initiator \u00bc0, re- sponder \u00bc1) as the independent variable, cultural back- ground (European American \u00bc0, Asian American \u00bc1) as the moderator, and optimism as the mediator. Results sup-ported this prediction: the confidence interval for the esti-mate of the indirect effect did not include zero, suggesting significant moderated mediation ( b\u00bc.17, SE \u00bc.09, 95% CI [.04, .40]). Additional examinations of the conditionalindirect effects indicated significant mediation forboth European Americans ( b\u00bc-.07, 95% [.01, .27]).902 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018In sum, using a sample of cancer survivors, study 2 showed that Asian Americans reported greater optimismabout recovering when they considered their futures with aresponder (vs. initiator) frame, whereas EuropeanAmericans expressed greater optimism when consideringtheir futures with an initiator (vs. responder) frame. Study 2 also found that a similar pattern emerged for the amount of energy participants anticipated having during their re-covery (the initiator vs. responder contrast for AsianAmericans did not reach significance, however), and thatfeelings of optimism drove this perceived anticipatedenergy. Importantly, to extend the generalizability of the opti- mism findings from study 2, we conducted a follow-upstudy to examine the interactive effect of culture and frameon optimism when samples from different countries (asopposed to single-country samples) were compared.Participants were 108 European American college studentsand 80 Chinese college students and the study used a 2 (culture: American, Chinese) /C22 (frame: responder, initi- ator) this used thesame serious injury/health challenge scenario and framemanipulation used in study 1, and measured optimism as instudy 2. As predicted, a two-way ANOVA on the optimismindex revealed a significant frame-by-culture interaction (F(1, 184) \u00bc6.13, p<.01). Consistent with the results of study 2, European Americans were more optimistic whenthey adopted an initiator ( M\u00bc4.90, SD 184) \u00bc 5.42, p<.05), whereas Chinese respondents were more optimistic when they adopted a responder ( M\u00bc5.10, SD \u00bc.96) 184) \u00bc4.96, p<.05). Having replicated in our follow-up study the pattern of optimism results from study 2, using a different healthchallenge and operationalization of culture, we next soughtto provide more evidence of the tie between our frame ma-nipulation and energy resources so as to bolster the find- ings from study 2's anticipated energy analysis. Moreover, to show that our effects encompass physiological (in add-ition to psychological) aspects of recovery, we focused ona recovery-relevant behavioral measure: physicalendurance. STUDY 3: CANCER AND PHYSICAL ENDURANCE Study 3 examined whether the interactive effect of cul- tural background and frame extends from the energy peo- ple anticipate having to that which they physically expendonce the frame is activated. In particular, Asian Americansand European Americans considered what they would do ifthey were to find out that they have cancer and then, whileplanning exercises they could undertake to stay healthyafter this diagnosis, squeezed a handgrip repeatedly. Importantly, we manipulated the handgrip task instructionssuch that participants were prompted to adopt either an ini-tiator or responder frame. Moreover, our health scenariohad participants consider getting colon cancer, which has asimilar likelihood of occurring for Asian Americans and European Americans ( U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group 2014 ). Participants and Procedure Fifty-five European American ( Mage\u00bc25.1, 27 female) and 54 Asian American ( Mage\u00bc21.7, 37 female) students at a West Coast university were recruited through an onlinepanel and paid $20 to participate. All completed the studyindividually in a lab equipped with a computer, whichshowed all stimuli and collected all responses, and a hand dynamometer. Two Asian Americans and four European Americans did not complete the handgrip exercise and thuswere not included in the analyses. The study used a 2 (cul-ture: Asian American, European American) /C22 (frame: initiator, responder) between-subjects design. In the study, participants read that researchers were interested in understanding how people deal with illness. They were then asked to imagine making a routine visit tothe doctor, having some follow-up tests, and discoveringthat they have a small cancerous tumor in their colon. Theywere also told that surgery and other treatments would beneeded to fight the disease. Next, to help participants better understand and empathize with the challenges cancer sur- vivors face, they were presented with some personal storiesof cancer survivors. Specifically, they watched a 4 minuteinformational video in which real cancer patients talk can-didly about their fight with the disease. Participants then completed some filler tasks before reading the cover story that explained the key task, which involved a handgrip (i.e., a dynamometer, which senses and records the squeeze force applied by a participant overtime). They were told to think about how they could stayactive while fighting the disease and to develop a plan forexercising with this in mind. Then, participants saw a slide-show in which each slide had a description of an exercise and a picture of a person performing that exercise. They viewed 20 exercises, each appearing for 10 seconds, andthought about which of these exercises they wanted to doand how often. They were asked to multitask while doingtheir planning, to reflect the type of environment theywould naturally encounter in real life, and told that theywould be randomly assigned to one of several different tasks\u2014although, in reality, all participants took part in the handgrip task. Following the approach of previous hand-grip studies, no specific goal was set ( Park and Roedder John 2014 ); participants were just told to firmly and repeat- edly squeeze and release the handgrip with their dominanthand, to use a steady rhythm, and to be as smooth andBRILEY, RUDD, AND AAKER 903 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018consistent as possible. The handgrip is initially easy to press but becomes more difficult (due to fatigue) as it ispressed more times. Importantly, we manipulated the wording of the final handgrip task instructions so that either an initiator or re-sponder frame was activated, using the same type of word- ing manipulation used in study 1. In the initiator condition, participants were told to consider \"how you will need toact daily to exercise regularly,\" \"what actions you willneed to take,\" and \"how you should act to ensure hardwork and success\" when exercising. In the responder con-dition, they were asked to consider \"how you will need to react daily to exercise regularly,\" \"what responses you will need to have,\" and \"how you should react to ensure hardwork and success\" when exercising. Last, they completeddemographics, were asked the purpose of the study (noneguessed correctly), and were debriefed. Results and Discussion We allowed participants 10 seconds to adjust to the squeezing task, and examined the average force they appliedto the grip in the subsequent minute. Mean force during this timeframe was analyzed as a function of ethnicity (Asian American, European American) and activated frame (initi-ator, responder). The results revealed a significant two-wayinteraction ( F(1, 96) \u00bc8.41, p<.01): the force applied to the handgrip by European Americans was greater in the ini-tiator ( M\u00bc25.98, SD \u00bc24.79) F(1, 96) \u00bc4.51, p<.05), and the force applied by Asian Americans was greater in the re-sponder ( effect was significant ( Fs<1). The results of study 3 established that, once activated, frames can influence the energy participants expend on a physical task. Namely, European Americans put forth more effort when squeezing a handgrip after adopting an initiator(vs. responder) frame, and Asian Americans put forth moreeffort after adopting a responder (vs. initiator) frame.Therefore, the results of studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that,when contemplating future health recovery activities, the impact of a person's frame and cultural background is reflected in both psychological indicators (i.e., optimismand anticipated energy) and physiological indicators (i.e.,physical endurance) of positive health outcomes. Moreover, we ran another ancillary study to further test whether, as our theory proposes, our responder (vs. initi-ator) frame manipulation affects participants' tendencies to have situation-focused (vs. person-focused) thinking and to rule out alternative explanations (by including measures ofrelevant variables that could be responsible for our effects).In particular, it is possible that our manipulation could alsoalter how vulnerable participants feel to a health threat,their affective state, or their motivational inclinations.To examine these possibilities, 126 European Americans (M age\u00bc37.1, 53% female) and 124 Asian Americans (Mage\u00bc30.1, 44% female) read a scenario in which they were asked to imagine having cancer and to consider howthey would deal with this health challenge, prompted withthe same responder or initiator language as in studies 1-3. Participants wrote about their planned activities and then, to examine the effect of our manipulation, we asked them toindicate the extent to which they had been situationallyfocused when imagining the pro cess of recovering by indicat- ing their agreement with three items serving as a manipula- tion check (adapted from Choi, Koo, and Choi 2007 ). Participants were asked to indicate (a) the importance of con- sidering the situation a person faces to understand her or hisbehavior, (b) whether things that happen have numerous un-known causes, and (c) whethe r things that happen entail a number of unknown consequences (1 \u00bcstrongly disagree, 7 \u00bcstrongly agree; a\u00bc.83). Participants then reported their perceptions of the likelihood that they currently have cancer (0\u00bcI definitely do not have it, 100 \u00bcI definitely have it) or might get the disease in the future (1 \u00bcnot at all likely, 7 \u00bc very likely), positive and negative affect ( a American) /C22 initi- ator), with age and gender as covariates, on the three-itemmanipulation-check index. As expected, there was a main effect only of frame ( F(1, 151) \u00bc7.60, p<.01; other Fs<1, responder conditions ( M\u00bc 5.23, SD \u00bc.81) reported holding a stronger situation- focused perspective than did those in initiator conditions(M\u00bc4.88, SD \u00bc.73). Thus, the frame manipulation worked as intended. We also ran full 2 /C22 ANOVAs on all other measures; the results revealed no significant main or interactive effects ( Fs<1.5, NS), suggesting that pos- sible spurious variables were not at play and garneringgreater confidence in our explanation. Having established the predicted pattern of optimism effects and ruled out several alternative explanations in stud-ies 1-3, we turn to examinations of the mechanism underly- ing these effects in our remaining studies. In particular, study 4 tests hypothesis 2, empirically exploring the driverof the interactive effect of culture and frame on optimism. STUDY 4: EASE OF IMAGINING AS A MEDIATOR People spontaneously generate picture-like representa- tions of actions they are planning, and the development of904 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018such images can be hindered when processing is difficult during decisions ( Jiang et al. 2014 ). If true, the images of planned activities held in memory should be more cogni-tively available ( Tversky and Kahneman 1973 ) when the mental simulation frame one adopts aligns (vs. does notalign) with one's usual way of thinking. In particular, our theory predicts that the mental images pertaining to the process of overcoming a health challenge should be easierto generate when people in independent cultures adopt aninitiator (vs. responder) frame, and when people in inter-dependent cultures adopt a responder (vs. initiator) frame.And when the ease of imagining health-related activities is facilitated in this way, we predict greater optimism is cultivated. To test this predicted mechanism, we asked participants in study 4 to make plans for addressing a health threatwhile adopting either an initiator or responder frame, thenreport their optimism (as in the prior studies). But in add-ition, as a measure of the availability of the underlying mental images, they indicated how easily they could im- agine themselves undertaking their planned activities andbehaviors. If the interactive effect of frame and culture onoptimism is indeed due to differences across conditions inthe ease with which these mental images are formed, weshould find that ease of imagining mediates our effects. For convergent validity, study 4 used a different health challenge\u2014diabetes\u2014and a different initiator-respondermanipulation. In studies 1-3, we activated different framesby using initiator-related words (act, action) or responder-related words (respond, response). Though our manipula-tion check pretest (discussed in study 2) and post-test (dis-cussed in study 3) offer evidence that this approach effectively manipulated participants' sensitivity to future situations and context during the planning task, it is pos-sible that exposure to our key phrases had other, con-founded associations that could affect our results (e.g.,different tendencies to indicate urgency or elicit emotionalreactions). Thus, in study 4, we instead manipulated the ex- tent to which participants' own actions (initiator frame) versus the situational contexts they might face (responderframe) were made salient in the instructions. Participants and Procedure Participants were 100 European Americans ( Mage\u00bc 32.8, 50% female) and 74 Asian Americans ( Mage\u00bc29.3, 42% female). They were recruited by a market researchfirm, paid $1 for participating, and told that the study wasabout how people deal with their health challenges. The study used a 2 (culture: European American, Asian American) /C22 (frame: initiator, responder) between- subjects design. First, participants were presented with a diabetes scen- ario. They were asked to imagine a routine visit to the doc-tor in which they find out they are developing diabetes andneed to improve their eating habits. According to their doc- tor, the consequences of not doing so include serious healththreats such as \"glaucoma and deteriorated vision, cardio-vascular disease, high blood pressure, and kidney disease.\"After imagining this scenario, they were asked to writedown four things they would do to address this health threat, using a phrase or sentence. The instructions for this part of the task included our manipulation of frame. In theresponder condition, the instructions drew participants' at-tention to the various types of situations and events thatmight emerge by having them focus on \"situations youmight face,\" \"circumstances that arise,\" and not getting \"lost thinking too much about the details of your own actions.\" In the initiator condition, the instructions insteaddrew participants' attention to their own acting, regardlessof the context in which it occurs, by having them focus \"onyour own actions,\" taking \"action regardless of the circum-stances\" and not getting \"lost thinking too much about thedetails of all of the situations you could face.\" After completing the diabetes scenario task, participants reported their current optimism using the same four-itemscale as in study 2 ( a\u00bc.87). Then, after some filler items, they completed our measures of ease of imagining. Tounderstand how readily they could construct mental imagesof the activities they had listed during the diabetes task, we asked them to think about the activities they had planned and to indicate how \"detailed\" and \"strong\" their mentalimages of these activities were (1 \u00bcnot at all, 7 \u00bcvery; Petrova and Cialdini 2005 ). These two items were aver- aged to form an ease-of-imagining index ( a\u00bc.84). Last, participants provided demographics and were debriefedand dismissed. Results and Discussion First, we used a two-way ANOVA to examine feelings of optimism as a function of cultural background (Asian American, European American) and frame (initiator, re-sponder). As expected, and consistent with the results ofthe prior studies, the interaction was significant ( F(1, 170) \u00bc11.56, p<.01). Among European Americans, optimism was greater for those who were in the initiator condition and primed to focus on their own actions ( M\u00bc5.60, SD \u00bc .99) compared to those who were in the responder condi-tion and primed to focus on the situations they would face(M\u00bc5.12, SD \u00bc1.14; F(1, 170) \u00bc5.46, p<.05). The re- verse was true Asian American participants: those inthe responder condition ( M\u00bc5.49, SD \u00bc.98) were more optimistic were those in the initiator condition ( M\u00bc 4.91, SD \u00bc.99;F(1, main effect was significant ( Fs<1, NS). Second, to determine if the ease with which participants could imagine their recovery-oriented activities mediatesthe interactive effect of culture and frame on optimism,we analyzed the ease-of-imagining index using a 2BRILEY, RUDD, AND AAKER 905 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018(culture: Asian American, European American) /C22 (frame: initiator, responder) ANOVA. For the recovery activities ( F(1, 170) \u00bc5.63, p<.05). The reverse was true for Asian American participants, though this result was marginally significant ( M Initiator\u00bc used a bootstrap analysis (10,000 resamples; PROCESS model 8) to test for moderated mediation. We predicted optimism using frame (initiator \u00bc0, responder \u00bc 1) as the independent variable, cultural background(European American \u00bc0, Asian American \u00bc1) as the moderator, and the ease-of-imagining index as the medi-ator. Supporting our prediction, the confidence interval forthe estimated indirect effect did not include zero, suggest-ing moderated mediation ( b\u00bc.49, SE \u00bc.18, 95% CI [.18, .89]). Additional analyses of the conditional indirect effects at both levels of the moderator (cultural back-ground) revealed that our significant mediation result heldfor both European Americans ( b\u00bc-.25, SE 95% CI [.01, .52]). These results replicate the pattern of optimism findings from study 2. When facing a health challenge, EuropeanAmericans who adopted an initiator (rather than responder)frame reported greater optimism, whereas AsianAmericans who adopted a responder (rather than initiator)frame reported greater optimism. But further, this samepattern applied to the ease with which participants could imagine the activities and behaviors they planned to under- take to address their health challenge (the contrast forAsian Americans, however, was only marginally signifi-cant). Importantly, moderated mediation analyses revealedthat the increased optimism was driven by the ease withwhich one could imagine oneself addressing the health challenge. If, in our studies, participants have greater optimism be- cause they can more easily imagine themselves undertakingthe steps needed to recover, as our theory and study 4's find-ings suggest, limiting their capacity to conjure mentalimages should attenuate our effects. Study 5 tested this idea.A second contribution of study 5 was to examine partici- pants' preference for more challenging therapy programs, an important behavioral indicator of optimism, rather than ask-ing them directly how optimistic they would feel. STUDY 5: MANIPULATING EASE OF IMAGINING The primary objective of study 5 was to provide further evidence of our proposed ease-of-imagining mechanismvia moderation. Similar to study 1, Asian American and European American participants thought about being ser-iously injured in the future and considered how they wouldaddress this health challenge. However, prior to this task,half of the participants were asked to remember specificvisual information throughout the study, suppressing their visual memory capacity ( Jiang et al. 2016 ) and hindering their ability to imagine future activities. The other halfwere encouraged to imagine and visualize prior to the in-jury task. Subsequently, in our target task, participants indicated their preference between two physical therapy programs that differed in difficulty and the extent to which one would need to make strong, consistent progress in order forthe therapy to be effective\u2014a preference that reflects par-ticipants' optimism about their recovery process. This pref-erence measure served as our key dependent variable.According to our proposed theoretical model, the inter-active effect of culture and frame on optimism is driven by the ease with which people can imagine the process of get- ting better. Thus, if ease of imagining the recovery processis indeed the underlying mechanism, we should expect asignificant culture-by-frame interaction on our dependentvariable in the facilitated imagining condition, but thisinteraction should be attenuated in the suppressed imagin- ing condition. Participants and Procedure Participants were 244 European Americans ( Mage\u00bc 36.86; 111 females) and 186 Asian Americans ( Mage\u00bc 31.41; 75 females). They were recruited from EuropeanAmerican and Asian American MTurk panels, told that theresearchers were interested in understanding how peopledeal with illnesses or injury, and paid $1.00 for participat- ing. The study used a 2 (ethnicity: European American, Asian American) /C22 (imagining capacity: suppressed, augmented) /C22 (frame: initiator, responder), between- subjects design. In this study, participants were presented with the same injury scenario, initiator (vs. responder) frame manipula- tion, and activity-generating task used in study 1. However, before participants read the scenario, we manip-ulated their ability to generate imagery when completingthe injury scenario task, following procedures used in Jiang et al. (2016) . Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, wherein their imagining capacity was ei-ther facilitated or suppressed. In the facilitated imagining condition, we first told participants to practice generating mental imagery by imagining themselves driving a car. Wetold them to close their eyes, imagine this scene in theirmind, and describe it. These participants were then pre-sented with the injury scenario and target activity-generating task.906 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018In the suppressed imagining condition, participants were exposed to a purported memory task that involved memo-rizing a visual stimulus. They were shown a 5 /C25 grid with an X in some of the cells, asked to remember whichcells were marked, and told they would need to recreatethe grid at the end of the session. Participants were then presented with the injury scenario and target activity- generating task. By occupying participants' visuospatialworking memory with unrelated visual imagery ( Jiang et al. 2016 ), this task was designed to dampen their cap- acity to generate new imagery during the target activity-generating task. Notably, as prior work has shown that this task does not affect participants' capacity to encode, pro- cess, or recall visual information more generally ( Jiang et al. 2016 , 716), it should deter ease of imagining but not impede other aspects of visual processing. After participants had read the injury scenario and con- sidered what to do to recover from the injury, we showedthem two different physical therapy programs\u2014an \"advanced pace program\" and a \"moderate pace pro- gram\"\u2014and asked them to indicate their preference be-tween them. Participants were told that the advancedprogram requires more hours and is more difficult than themoderate program. They were also told that the advancedprogram offers the best results only for those who are able to keep up by making strong, consistent progress, whereas the moderate program would offer better results for thosewho are not able to do so. Participants then told us whichprogram they would be more likely to choose using a six-point scale (1 \u00bcdefinitely the moderate program, 6 \u00bcdef- initely the advanced program). To examine the effectiveness of our imagining capacity manipulation, we then asked participants to report the ease with which they had formed self-related mental pictureswhen thinking about the activities they planned to engage into help them recover from their injury (1 \u00bcnot at all, 9 \u00bca lot). Then, after some filler questions, participants provideddemographic information and were debriefed and dismissed. Results and Discussion Our imagining capacity manipulation check was submit- ted to a full 2 (ethnicity: European American, Asian the effect ofimagining capacity condition ( F(1, 422) \u00bc9.46, p<.01). Participants reported greater ease of imagery generationwhen thinking about activities if they were in the facili- tated ( M\u00bc7.13, SD \u00bc1.82). Also, European Americans ( M\u00bc7.12, SD \u00bc1.69) reported greater ease of imagery Asian Americans(M\u00bc6.66, SD \u00bc1.57; F(1, 422) \u00bc8.20, p<.01). 2 /C22/C22 ANOVA to examine partici- pants' therapy program preferences as a function of their ethni-city (Asian American, European American), imaginingcapacity condition (facilitated, suppressed), frame condition (initiator, responder), and all interactions. As expected, thethree-way interaction was significant ( F(1, 422) \u00bc7.69, p< .01). Only one other effect was significant in the model: participants whose capacity for imagining was facilitated ( M\u00bc 4.35, SD \u00bc1.46) rather than suppressed ( M\u00bc3.96, SD\u00bc1.63) preferred the more physical therapy pro- gram ( F(1, 422) \u00bc5.04, p<.05). To understand the nature of the three-way interaction, we conducted separate analyses of participants who had their capacity to imagine facilitated and suppressed, usingethnicity (Asian American, European American), framecondition (initiator, responder), and the interaction of thesetwo variables as predictors. Supporting our proposedmodel, the results revealed that, for participants in thefacilitated imagining condition, only the ethnicity-by- frame interaction was significant ( F(1, 191) \u00bc8.38, p< .01; other Fs<1.5, NS). Asian Americans more strongly preferred the advanced therapy program if they had a re-sponder ( M \u00bc4.50, SD \u00bc1.16) \u00bc1.56; F(1, 191) \u00bc3.99, p<.05), whereas European Americans showed a greater preference for the advanced therapy program if they had an initiator ( M\u00bc 191) \u00bc4.53, p<.05). Also in line with our proposed model, there was not a significant ethnicity-by-frame interaction (nor any significant main effects) forparticipants in the suppressed imagining condition ( Together, the results of study 5 provide further support for our prediction that the interactive effect of culture andframe on optimism is driven by ease of imagining. A stron-ger preference for the more difficult, advanced therapy pro- gram\u2014a preference that reflects greater optimism about one's recovery process\u2014was exhibited by AsianAmericans who adopted a responder (vs. initiator) frameand European Americans who adopted an initiator (vs. re-sponder) frame. However, this interactive effect of cultureand frame on therapy program preference emerged onlywhen participants' ability to imagine the activities they might undertake to overcome their injury was facilitated. When participants' ability to imagine was suppressed, cul-ture and frame did not affect therapy program preferences. STUDY 6: TESTING THE FULL CONCEPTUAL MODEL Building upon the findings of study 5, study 6 again examines decision making in the domain of health.BRILEY, RUDD, AND AAKER 907 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018However, in this case, we examined participants' responses to a marketing communication and manipulated framesusing the wording in this communication. Second, ratherthan use participants' ethnicity or nationality as an indirectindicator of their independence-interdependence, we useda direct measure of self-views, providing convergent valid- ity. Study 6 also offers a more comprehensive test of the interrelationship among the variables in our model byexamining, in one study, the interactive effects of cultureand frame on the ease of imagining implementing a healthsolution, optimism about this solution, and intentions toimplement the solution. Last, study 6 sought to rule out alternative explanations for our observed effects and provide a test of theory speci-ficity. Namely, one might argue that the ability of cultureand frame to enhance people's optimism about recoveringcould be driven by general processing fluency, processinginvolvement, or ease of imagining in general (e.g., the easewith which one can imagine experiencing the health chal- lenge rather than, as we predict, the ease with which one can imagine overcoming the health challenge). Thus, wemeasured these constructs in study 6. To test the specificityof our account, we also tested if the interactive effect ofculture and the frame one adopts when facing a healthchallenge impacts people's optimism about things other than their health. Because our theory specifically relates the interactive effect of culture and frame to people's opti-mism about recovering from their health challenge, we pre-dicted that the interaction of these constructs would notaffect general optimism or optimism about non-health-related topics (e.g., finances or the environment). Study 6 was conducted in a major metropolitan area shortly after torrential rains and severe flooding. We pre- sented university students living in the affected area withinformation about illness-causing agents that can be pre-sent in and around flood waters (e.g., parasites, typhoid,mold, cholera), told them about a vaccine that could boosttheir immune systems and protect against these health haz- ards, and asked them about their intention to obtain this vaccine if it were made available through the university'shealth clinic. Schools, colleges, and public transportationin the region were closed when the flooding began, and weadministered our study at a local university after classesresumed. At the time of the study, the floodwaters had yetto recede in many parts of the region, and local news reports were still warning residents about the dangers of floodwaters (including flood-related illnesses). Participants and Procedure Two hundred fifty-seven students ( Mage\u00bc22.25, 145 fe- male) were recruited from an undergraduate subject pool,and all received course credit for participating. Among ourrespondents were 53 European Americans, 73 Hispanics,69 East Asians, 26 South Asians, 21 African Americans, 6Middle Easterners, and 9 who identified as some other ethnicity. As a cover story, participants were told that the purpose of the survey was to get students' opinions about how theuniversity's clinic might address health threats caused bythe recent flooding. First, participants read a mock \"CDC Fact Sheet,\" which was developed using information from the CDC and other government websites. The fact sheettold them about the various health risks and illness-causingagents spread by floodwaters. Several health threats com-mon after flooding were described, including communic-able diseases spread by contaminated water (e.g., typhoid and cholera), illnesses from parasites and mosquitoes, and dangers caused by exposure to mold and mildew. Next, participants were told that the university's health center was considering obtaining a vaccine that strengthensone's immune system against flood-related illnesses, andthat the health center wanted to gauge students' interest inthis vaccine. We subsequently presented them with an ad- vertisement for a vaccine called Immunasil (see the web appendix). In reality, the Immunasil vaccine is fictitious,and we developed the marketing communication shown toparticipants. The message mentioned the health threatsassociated with flooding disasters, described the vaccine,and discussed both the benefits and potential side effects of the product. According to the message, the vaccine was developed specifically for victims of hydrological disastersand can boost the body's immune system and reduce theseverity of and chances of contracting flood-related ill-nesses. The side effects mentioned were pain, burning, andswelling at the injection site; headaches, muscle pain, andjoint pain; and nausea. A picture of the product was shown, and its biochemical makeup was described. Importantly, the text of the message was manipulated so that either initiator or responder language was used forsome key phrases. In the initiator condition, for example,the text indicated \"Act now to protect yourself\u2014get vacci-nated!\" \"How will you act to address this health threat?\" and \"When considering what actions to take after the flood, consider Immunasil.\" In responder conditions, on the otherhand, these passages read \"Respond now to protect your-self\u2014get vaccinated!\" \"How will you react to address thishealth threat?\" and \"When considering how to respondafter the flood, consider Immunasil.\" After reading the message about Immunasil, participants were asked how likely they would be to get the vaccination if it were offered by the university's health center (1 \u00bcnot at all likely, 7 \u00bcvery likely). Next, we asked them how op- timistic they were about the vaccine's ability to help themaddress flood-related health problems they might experi-ence. Adapting the four optimism items ( a\u00bc.92) from study 2 to the current setting, we asked participants their perceptions of the probability that the vaccine would helpthem get better quickly (1 \u00bclow probability, 7 \u00bchigh probability), the speed of their recovery with the vaccine908 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018(1\u00bcslow, 7 \u00bcfast), the extent to which the vaccine would make them feel they could beat the challenges of flood-related illnesses (1 \u00bcnot at all, 7 \u00bcvery much), and the chance the vaccine would enable them to maintain a posi-tive, healthy outlook (1 \u00bcvery low, 7 \u00bcvery high). Participants then completed measures indicating how easily they could imagine both getting the vaccine (vaccine ease-of-imagining index; a\u00bc.95) and suffering from a flood-related illness (illness ease-of-imagining index; a\u00bc .90). \"how difficultis it,\" and \"how much do you struggle when trying\" to im-agine or visualize yourself taking the step of getting vacci- nated and to imagine or visualize yourself experiencing or facing a flood-related illness, respectively (1 \u00bcnot at all, 9 \u00bcvery; all items reverse-scored; Jiang et al. 2014 ). Participants then indicated the extent to which they feltprocessing fluency and involvement when considering thepossibility of getting vaccinated. For processing fluency,they completed two items indicating how difficult or easy the vaccine information was to \"process\" and \"understand\" (1\u00bcdifficult, 7 \u00bceasy; a\u00bc.85; Lee and Aaker 2004 ). For involvement, they told us how involved they felt whenprocessing this information (1 \u00bcnot at all, 7 \u00bcvery; Labroo and Lee 2006 ). We also asked participants how optimistic they felt about other aspects of their lives. They reported their gen- eral feelings of optimism using five items from theRevised Life Orientation Test (1 \u00bcI disagree a lot, 5 \u00bcI agree a lot; a\u00bc.77;Carver et al. 2010 ): \"If something can go wrong for me, it will\" (reverse-scored), \"I'm optimisticabout my future,\" to go myway\" (reverse-scored), \"I rarely count on good things hap- pening to me\" (reverse-scored), and \"Overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than bad.\" Participantsalso indicated their optimism about their financial futures(a\u00bc.80) and global warming ( a\u00bc.64), using measures adapted from the five items used to measure general opti-mism. For example, to measure optimism about global warming, one item asked participants if they were optimis- tic about reducing global warming. After reporting their feeli ngs of optimism, participants used a seven-point scale to complete two items that measuredindependence ( a\u00bc.60) and two items that measured inter- dependence ( a\u00bc.61; adapted from Singelis et al. 1995 ). For independence, they indicated their agreement with the self- descriptions: \"One should live one's life independently of others\" and \"What happens to me is my own doing.\" Forinterdependence, they indicated their agreement with the self-descriptions: \"I feel good whe n I cooperate with others\" and \"I hate to disagree with others in my group\" (1 \u00bcstrongly disagree, 7 \u00bcstrongly agree). Finally, participants completed some demographic questions , guessed the purpose of the study, and were debriefed (e.g., alerted that this vaccine was fictitious) and dismissed. Non e correctly guessed the study's goals, nor detected our deceptions.Results and Discussion We formed an interdependence-independence index by computing the difference between participants' scores onthe interdependence and independence subscales ( Holland et al. 2004 ), such that larger scores indicated greater ten- dencies toward interdependence. We then examined our three key dependent variables: ease of imagining getting vaccinated, optimism about the vaccine's ability to helpthem address their health challenge, and intention to getthe vaccine. According to our theory, the interaction between frame (i.e., initiator vs. responder) and interdependence-independence should influence the ease with which people can imagine themselves getting vaccinated, which should in turn influence their optimism that the vaccine will helpthem overcome their health challenge, which should inturn influence their likelihood of getting the vaccine.Specifically, our model predicts a first-stage interaction be-tween frame condition and interdependence-independence, such that an initiator (vs. responder) frame leads to greater ease of imagining oneself taking the step of getting vacci-nated (and, consequently, greater optimism that the vaccinewill help them overcome their health threat and greaterlikelihood of getting the vaccine) when one is high in inde-pendence, but that a responder (vs. initiator) frame leads togreater ease of imagining oneself taking the step of getting vaccinated (and, consequently, greater optimism that the vaccine will help them overcome their health threat andgreater likelihood of getting the vaccine) when one is highin interdependence. To test this conceptual model, we con-ducted a moderated serial mediation analysis (10,000resamples) using PROCESS and the procedures outlined in Hayes (2015) . In the model estimated by this analysis, frame condition (responder \u00bc0, initiator \u00bc1) was the manipulated independent variable, the vaccine ease-of-imagining index was the first mediator, vaccine optimismwas the second mediator, vaccination intentions was thedependent variable, and interdependence-independence was the measured moderating variable. The analysis revealed the following results (see figure 1 ). First, there was a significant frame condition by interdependence-independence interaction on vaccine easeof imagining responder) framehad a significantly negative influence on the ease with which one could imaging getting the vaccine when interdependence-independence was one standard deviationabove the mean responder) frame had a signifi-cantly positive influence on the ease with which one couldimagine getting the vaccine when interdependence- independence was one standard deviation below the mean (b\u00bc2.28, 95% CI: [1.49, 3.07]). In other words, a re- sponder (vs. initiator) frame led to significantly greaterBRILEY, RUDD, AND AAKER 909 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018ease of imagining oneself getting vaccinated when one was high in interdependence, but an initiator (vs. responder)frame led to significantly greater ease of imagining oneself getting vaccinated when one was high in independence. Second, ease of imagining getting vaccinated had a signifi-cant positive influence on people's optimism that the vac-cine would help them address their health challenge ( b\u00bc .20, 95% CI: [.13, .26]) and this greater vaccine optimismin turn had a significant positive influence on their inten- to get vaccinated ( b\u00bc.75, 95% CI: and importantly, the index of moderated medi- ation for the serial indirect effect through both vaccineease of imagining and vaccine optimism was significant(95% CI: [-.20, -.09]), indicating that the interactive effectof frame condition and interdependence-independence onvaccination intentions was serially mediated by vaccine ease of imagining and vaccine optimism. Namely, the initi- ator (vs. responder) !vaccine ease of imagining !vac- cine optimism !vaccination intentions pathway was significant and negative when interdependence-independence was one standard deviation above the mean(b\u00bc-.26, 95% CI: -.41, -.14]), but was significant and positive when interdependence-independence was one standard deviation below the mean ( b\u00bc.34, 95% CI: [.19, .51]). In other words, for were high ininterdependence, adopting a responder (vs. initiator) framemade them more likely to get the vaccine (and this effect was serially driven by greater ease of imagining getting thevaccine and greater optimism about the vaccine); for par- ticipants who were high in independence, adopting an initi- ator (vs. responder) frame made them more likely to getthe vaccine (and this effect was serially driven by greaterease of imagining getting the vaccine and greater optimismabout the vaccine). Together, these results confirm the pre-dicted moderated serial mediation. To provide further support for our conceptual model, we also tested several alternative explanations for our effects:ease of imagining a flood-related illness, processing flu-ency, processing involvement, general optimism, financialoptimism, and global warming optimism. We analyzedeach in a separate model using the (continuous)interdependence-independence scores, frame condition (initiator, responder), and the interaction of these two vari- ables as predictors. Across these six analyses, no effectswere significant ( Fs<2.2, NS). Thus, none of these con- structs could account for our observed effects. In contrast, the same analysis (separately) performed on the vaccine ease of imagining, vaccine optimism, and vac- cination intentions variables revealed the predicted signifi- cant frame condition by interdependence-independenceinteraction (vaccine ease of THE MEDIATING EFFECT OF EASE OF IMAGINING VACCINATIONS ON VACCINE OPTIMISM AND VACCINATION INTENTIONS AS A FUNCTION OF INTERDEPENDENCE-INDEPENDENCE NOTE.\u2014Numbers in parentheses indicate standard errors. indirect effect of frame condition (initiator vs. responder) on vaccination intentions vi a both mediators is b\u00bc/C0.26 (CI: [ /C0.41,/C0.14]) at one standard deviation above the mean of the interdependence-independence scale and b\u00bc.34 (CI: [.19, .51]) at one standard deviation below the mean of the interdependence-independence scale.910 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018vaccination intentions: F(1, 253) \u00bc31.91, p<.001). Replicating the results of the moderated serial mediation,spotlight analyses revealed that the simple effect of the ini-tiator (vs. responder) frame manipulation was significant atone standard deviation above the mean ofinterdependence-independence (vaccine ease of imagining: b\u00bc-1.71, SE \u00bc.34,p<.001) and at one standard deviation below the mean of inte rdependence-independence (vaccine ease of imagining: b\u00bc1.43, SE \u00bc.33,p<.001). No main effects were significant in any of these three analyses ( Fs<1, NS). Study 6 shows that the effects we predict hold for inten- tions to use a health product, a downstream variable be-yond optimism. In the aftermath of regional flooding,affected college students who were high in interdepend-ence were more likely to indicate an intention to get vacci- nated if the Immunasil message used responder (vs. initiator) language, whereas those high in independencewere more likely to do so if the Immunasil message usedinitiator (vs. responder) language. This same patternapplied to their feelings of optimism regarding the vaccineand the ease with which they could imagine getting vacci- nated to stay healthy. Our moderated serial mediation ana- lysis also revealed that the interactive effect of self-viewand frame influences ease of imagining the process of get-ting the vaccine and, in turn, optimism about the vaccineand intentions to get vaccinated. GENERAL DISCUSSION Optimism fuels health and recovery, yet we still know little about how and when people experience greater opti- mism when confronted with a health challenge. To tackle this question, we ran six studies in the lab and field (withover 1,300 participants) and uncovered significant culturaldifferences in how optimism was cultivated. In cultureswhere the interdependent (vs. independent) self is morehighly accessible, individuals adopting a responder (vs. ini- tiator) frame when facing a health challenge were more op- timistic about their recovery (studies 2, 4, and 6), madedecisions that reflected this greater optimism (studies 1, 5,and 6), anticipated feeling greater energy (study 2), anddemonstrated stronger physical endurance (study 3). Theseresults held for people facing various health challenges(i.e., cancer, diabetes, flood-related illness, and traumatic injury), both imagined and real, in both single-country and cross-country samples. Further, these results persistedacross dependent measures\u2014from self-reported optimismto preferences for remedial health programs, preventativetreatments, and vacations to intentions to follow a doctor-recommended diet plan. Importantly, these effects weredriven by the ease with which participants imagined the re- covery process, as indicated by both mediation (studies 4and 6) and moderation (study 5) analyses. Together, theseresults enrich our theoretical understanding of when andhow optimism can be cultivated and highlight optimism'simportance to consumer behavior. But also, we forge yet identified connections across seemingly disparate literature domains, including streams addressing cultural patterns inthinking styles ( Masuda et al. 2008 ), fit effects ( Avent and Higgins 2003 ,2006 ), and generation of mental imagery (Jiang et al. 2014 ;Markus and Ruvolo 1989 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ). Our findings also address recent calls to advance con- sumer welfare ( Mick et al. 2012 ) and to help consumers achieve better health outcomes ( Bublitz et al. 2010 ; Goldberg 2008 ). Although prior social psychological re- search has revealed that optimism can benefit physicalhealth ( Scheier and Carver 1985 ;Taylor et al. 1992 ), re- search has been largely silent on its effects. Our research lays the groundwork for a roadmap for building optimism in the face of a health challenge, and further adds to the ex-tant well-being literature by offering novel insights into theimportance of culture, frames, and mental imagery whenencouraging consumers to make helpful health-relatedjudgments and decisions. For instance, by showing how a positive outlook can be best achieved across cultures, our findings provide further evidence challenging the notionthat autonomy and independence are indispensable, univer-sal prerequisites for well-being ( Markus and Schwartz 2010 ). It is often assumed that people are at their best\u2014 motivated, satisfied with life, healthy\u2014when they havefreedom from external forces and influences (e.g., self- determination theory, dissonance theory, reactance theory), but this assumption may be more relevant for some peoplethan others. For Westerners generally, and Americans inparticular, autonomy and self-determination are treasuredideals. People from cultures that value an interdependentself-view, however, are subject to a different set of core beliefs and assumptions regarding such needs. This research also advances our understanding of the emerging literature that shows how a person's state ofmind can help achieve positive health outcomes. Thoughframes are transitory, they can influence vital physiologicalprocesses and shape responses to inputs and stimuli peopleencounter. For example, the stomach's hormonal response to eating can differ depending on whether one adopts an in- dulgent rather than sensible eating frame ( Crum et al. 2011 ). Relatedly, when people believe that stress is benefi- cial rather than debilitating, they have more moderate cor-tisol responses to stressful situations ( Crum et al. 2013 ). Our studies are added evidence that a person's frame dur- ing critical periods can have important, potentially life- saving effects on their health. We aim to contribute to thisbody of work by identifying a particular frame dimension,initiator versus responder, and illuminating how it canBRILEY, RUDD, AND AAKER 911 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/895/3876300 by University of Houston user on 12 January 2018differentially impact both subjectively experienced and physiologically grounded health-related outcomes acrosscultures. Further, the current research makes important theoretical contributions to the mental imagery literature by sheddinglight on why culture moderates the effectiveness of initi- ator versus responder frames. Although prior research has shown that engaging in process-oriented imagining can beadaptive and beneficial for goal attainment ( Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1979 ;Markus and Ruvolo 1989 ;Niemiec et al. 2010 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ), prior research diverges with regard to the frame that one should adopt when under- taking such imagining. Whereas some research suggests that people who imagine the future should focus on the in-dividual and her or his own potential (person-focused, initi-ator frame; Markus and Nurius 1986 ;Markus and Ruvolo 1989 ;Niemiec et al. 2010 ), other research suggests people should focus on the future situations they will face andtheir responses to these challenges (situation-focused, re- sponder frame; Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1979 ;Pham and Taylor 1999 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ). Thus, by showing that each of these mental simulation frames can be optimal,depending on the cultural background of the personenvisioning the process needed to recover from a healthchallenge, our research offers insights that could help rec- oncile these conflicting findings to identify when and why it would be more beneficial to adopt one process-orientedframe over the other. From a practical perspective, our findings also offer guidance for organizations and individuals\u2014includinghealth care providers and specialists, counselors, policymakers, and health-oriented businesses\u2014who wish to com- municate with consumers about health-related matters. As one example, the names and slogans chosen by marketersfor health-related products or services (e.g., the iFit Act fit-ness tracker vs. the ReAct trainer machine) may triggerone frame or the other, and our research suggests that couldaffect consumers' resulting optimism. The imagery under- lying wording and phrases used in communication might also prompt one or the other frame. For instance, whenfaced with a health challenge we are often urged to \"grabthe bull by the horns\" and \"act on our thoughts andinstincts,\" or at other times told to \"wait and see what hap-pens\" and \"be ready to react to whatever comes your way.\"Similarly, promotional materials for health-related prod- ucts and services reactions\"). that if one fails to consider a person's cul-tural background when making these types of recommen-dations or when designing marketing stimuli, one may inadvertently hinder that person's ability to maximize their optimism. Finally, the results of our studies point toward paths for future research. One avenue is to examine how differenttypes of mental simulation might moderate the observed effect of ease of imagining on optimism or other importantgoal-related outcomes. Though our research examines theeffects of two process-oriented imagining frames (as suchframes are generally adaptive and beneficial for goal at-tainment; Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1979 ;Markus and Ruvolo 1989 ;Niemiec et al. 2010 ;Taylor et al. 1998 ), other types of mental simulation also exist. And prior workhas shown that not all types of mental simulation areequally effective for helping people attain their goals andregulate their behavior. Indeed, fantasizing ( Kappes et al. 2013 ;Oettingen 1996 ), painful ruminations Horowitz 1976 and mental sim- ulations ( Taylor et al. 1998 ) have all been shown to inter- fere with goal pursuit and achievement. Thus, one questionthat future research could explore is whether greater easeof imagining under these circumstances would instead en-hance the maladaptive nature of these forms of mentalsimulation and, therefore, reduce positive outcomes like optimism. Optimism has been shown to be a cornerstone of suc- cessful recovery in the face of a health challenge ( Scheier and Carver 1985 ;Taylor et al. 1992 ). However, how to best cultivate that optimism is much less understood, par-ticularly across cultures. The present research aims to posi- tively impact consumer welfare by anchoring on optimism and showing that how people can best cultivate it during ahealth crisis depends on the degree to which their culturalbackground encourages them to consider their actions inlight of specific situations (vs. their own actions regardlessof the situation). Our findings highlight that there is not asingle, universal path to achieving optimism, and that one's culture plays an important role in determining which path is likely to be the most effective and fruitful. With this per-spective, our work seeks to fuel research streams focusedon improving people's lives\u2014in this case, by offeringnovel insights about how those facing health challengescan most effectively maintain an optimistic, healthy outlook.
