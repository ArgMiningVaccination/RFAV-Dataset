Ingredients GO Capsules - Magnesium - Magnesium is a mineral that can support healthy protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, and energy production. Low magnesium levels can lead to increased risks of diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Magnesium has been shown to help move blood sugar into muscles and dispose of lactate, which can build up during exercise and cause fatigue. - Acetyl L-Carnitine - Acetyl-L-Carnitine, a product made in the body from L-Carnitine, is important for several body processes such as the burning of fat for energy. Through several studies, supplementation of Acetyl-L-Carnitine has been shown to decrease heart rate during exercise, reduce muscle damage, and increase rate of fat burn. - Ashwagandha Root Extract - Ashwagandha, also known as Withania somnifera, is an herb found in Asia and Africa commonly used in herbal medicine. With its adaptogenic properties, ashwagandha has been shown to improve resistance towards stress, sleep quality, and muscle size and recovery. - Rhodiola Rosea Extract (1% Rosavins) (3% Salidroside) - Rhodiola rosea is cultivated in the mountains of Europe and Asia and is commonly used in herbal medicine. Studies on Rhodiola rosea suggest the herb may reduce fatigue, improve time to exhaustion, and improve sexual function. - Phosphatidylserine - A phospholipid found primarily in meat and fish, studies have shown phosphatidylserine to support increases in cognitive function and time to exhaustion during exercise. - Theobromine - Theobromine, a natural compound found in most cocoa products, has been shown to have longer lasting effects than caffeine as well as raising levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol. - Natural Caffeine Anhydrous - Green Coffee Beans - A commonly consumed stimulant found in coffee beans, tea leaves, and energy drinks, caffeine has been shown to increase peak performance, reduce fatigue, and increase positive metabolic responses. - L-Theanine - L-Theanine is a non-essential amino acid commonly found in green tea and some mushrooms.

I work out in the morning around 7am everyday and take 3 pills at 630am where the effects set in right as I am starting my workout. I can feel the difference in the workout I have and the after effects of the supplement kicking in. When not working out I can feel the energy boost I get and overall ability to focus on my work at hand that day. So far the only downside to taking this is 1) on an full stomach as it does not seem to have the same effect 2) later in the day there is not a crash but if I start to feel a bit tired I will take 1 pill around 1-2pm but it varies in the effect it has. Typically it does not give me the kicker dose I am looking for. However I am still in the beginner phase of trying this so tinkering with timing is still a factor - Life Changer I decided to try GO because I enjoy Jocko Molk so much. I've tried many many thermogenics/energy pills in my life and figured I'd give this one a try also due to the ingredients and that it is made by an FDA lab. (I worked for a well know vitamin chain in the 90's-00's that my family owned.) After a few weeks of taking GO I noticed more energy, clearer thinking and an overall greater quality of life day. Unfortunately I have 2 autoimmune diseases and can feel super sluggish both body and mind on some days. This really helps with that. I'm on bottle 4 now I believe and it's now a staple in my supplements daily. Thanks Jocko! - Jocko Go My favorite thing about the Jocko Go capsules is the level energy. I dont get a spike and crash, I dont get twitchy or shaky. I just feel good and I am able to GO! The recommended dose is 3 and I only take "}
