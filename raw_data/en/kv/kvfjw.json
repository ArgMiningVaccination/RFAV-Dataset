Need/Rationale: Surgical performance is crucial for patient clinical outcomes (1). T he current criter ion standard for surgeon evaluation is by the surgeon's previous case volumes, or by peer review of the surgery. These methods are subjective, which cannot meet the needs for surgical education and quality improvement (2). Systems data cap tured directly fr om the surgical robot provide a novel opportunity to more accurately and objectively measure surgeon performance (3). Utilizing machine learning (ML), a form of artificial intelligence, we can recognize broad patterns of the robotic system data, and learn surgical performance traits that are otherwise imperceptible to human reviewers. In this study, we present a novel ML method of processing automated performance data to evaluate surgical performance and predict clinical outcomes after robo t-assisted radical prostatectomy (RRP). Methods: With a novel recording device, the \"dVLogger\" (Intuitive Surgical), we captured automated performance metrics (instrument motion tracking metrics and system events recorded in Cartesian coordinates) directl y from the da Vin ci Surgical System during RRP. We then trained a \"Random Forest\" ML model utilizing automated performance metrics (training material) and hospital length of stay (LOS; label) (2 days and >2days) after RRP. The trained model then categorized study cases into \"Predicted expected LOS (pExp- LOS)\", and \"Predicted extended LOS (pExt- LOS)\" groups. We compared the clinical outcomes of the two groups using Kruskal -Wallis test and Fisher's exact test. We then trained the model to directly predict in dividual clinical outcomes, and we determined the association between the ML predicted results and the actual patient outcome using Spearman's correlation study and Fisher's exact test. Finally, we identified the five most relevant metrics adopted by the m odel during learning and prediction. Evaluation Plan/Results: Seventy -eight RRPs from August 2016 to March 2017 were studied, 67 patients had LOS 2 days, 11 patients had LOS >2days. The ML model predicted 73 cases as \"pExp - LOS\" and 5 cases as \"pExt -LOS\". The predictive accuracy was 87.2%. Surgeries in the \"pExp -LOS\" group outperformed the \"pExt -LOS\" group in surgery time (3.7 vs 4.6 hours, p=0.007), LOS (2 vs 4 days, p=0.02), and Foley catheter duration (9 vs 14 days, p=0.02). Patient outcomes predicted by the ML model ha d significant association with the 'ground truth' in surgery time (p<0.001, r=0.73), LOS (p=0.05, r=0.52), and Foley duration (p<0.001, r=0.45). The five most relevant metrics adopted by ML model in predicting surgery time, LOS, Foley duration and pelvic d rainage volume were all related to metrics involving the surgeon's manipulation of the robotic camera position. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Automated performance metrics and ML algorithms may help assess surgical performance and predict clinical out comes. With further refinement, this process will become more accurate and sophisticated. In the near future, we will be able to personalize surgeon training.

Need/Rationale: Racial minorities are projected to constitute a majority of the US population by 2050, therefore it is important this be reflected in the workforce. Failure to attract and retain minority youth towards heal th care careers continues to be challenging (1). In order to increase healthcare professionals coming from underserved communities, the number of college bound students needs to increase. Studies found that perceived barriers were the most influential factor in students' ability to reach their educational goals (3). These perceived barriers are often based on what is experienced at home and in school. Even students with very challenging social contexts can f ormulate high expectations if they have verbal enc ouragement, opportunities for vicarious learning, and step -by-step mastery experiences related to their educational goals (2). This is where successful partnerships with the community can attempt to increas e the number of underrepresented minority students entering health professions. Methods: In 2016 the family medicine residency program at White Memorial Medical Center began a collaboration with Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School located in Los Angeles , CA. Roosevelt is composed of 98.7% Hispanic/Lati no students of which 97.2% are socioeconomically disadvantaged. The Los Angeles School District Fall 2017 college/career indicator showed that only 20% of the students from Roosevelt were identified as bein g prepared for college. The collaboration aimed at supporting the biomedical sciences curriculum at Roosevelt High School by preparing monthly presentations to a classroom consisting of 16 students. This took place from September 2017 to May 2018. The idea is to spark interest, mentor, and expose students to different careers in the medical field. Lectures were led by residents from the family medicine residency program and focused on topics that aligned with what was being covered in class, including diabe tes, heart disease, preventative medicine, and gen etics. At the end of each session, time was allotted to allow students to ask general questions. The final session took place at White Memorial Medical center where students participated in a suturing session, a tour of the hospital, and heard from a panel of medical professionals that included residents, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, social work, and speech therapy. By exposing these students to different careers, they might be more likel y to engage and pursue careers. Evaluation Plan/R esults: To evaluate students baseline knowledge regarding the array of medical careers, pre - and post - surveys were collected. Pre -surveys conducted for the 2017 -2018 cohorts consisted of 16 students. When asked if they could list at least five careers in the medical field, 25% said they could, 44% were not sure, and 31% said they could not. With regard to interest in pursuing a career in the medical field, 56% agreed, 31% not sure, and 12% disagreed. After the yearlong monthly classroom sessions, the post - survey found that there was an increase to 86% of individuals that were interested in pursuing a career in the medical field. The ability of being able to list at least five careers in the medical field increased to 42%, those who were unsure was 58%, and none of the individuals disagreed. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Classroom sessions can increase interest in health care careers and can ultimately lead to a more diverse workforce, however without a larger group of students it is difficult generalize results. We will continue to engage, motivate, and empower these students to pursue their goals. References: 1) Behnoosh, A., Santos, R., MBA, Angulo, M, & Muratori, W.

The program took place in the nursing school simulation center. Students in groups of 3 -4 rotated through three stations, each for 20 minutes: 1) Simulated vaginal deli very demonstrated to students by nurse educator and OBGYN resident. Each student gu ided in delivering a baby; 2) MFM faculty gave interactive presentations on fetal heart rate (FHR). Then, a student nurse role played with each student to inform their under standing, communication and clinical reasoning skills as assessed by OSCE format; 3 ) OBGYN resident and basic science faculty taught students and assessed students on cervical dilation using \"blinded\" and \"open\" cervical models. Students completed the same surveys on attitude (6 questions, range 1 -5), and knowledge (6 questions, maximum score 15) before, after and 7 months after the curriculum. The mean Likert scores of the pre - and post -survey scores were compared using t test to determine significant differences. A p value <0.05 was taken as significant. Evaluation Plan/Results: Of 95 students, mean scores for the FHR OSCE were: identifies FHR baseline = 0.97, identifies of periodic pattern= FHR category= 0.67 and orders appropriate medical interventions=0.93.For t he cervical station OSCE, the mean score on cervical examination skills after training was 75%., For the knowledge questions on obstetrics and fetal heart rate monitoring, s tudents obtained a mean pre -score of 2.57 + 0.09, post- simulation the mean score in creased to 3.24 + 0.11 (p<0.001) and 8 months later it was 2.37 + 0.12 . Pre- simulation; students scored their comfort level with obstetrical procedures as 12.2 + 0.63, after simulation the mean score increased to 28+ -.63(p<0.001) and 7 months later it dec reased to (p=0.001). Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: An OSCE- based inter -professional course improved students' short- term knowledge, however, this knowledge dropp ed back to baseline 7 months after the program was completed. Students' comfort lev el increased immediately post -training then decreased, but overall was still higher than baseline at 7 months.

Need/Rationale: Following the ESCAPE Trial in 2005 the use of pulmonary arterial catheters (PACs) has waned within our facility . An unintentional byproduct of a reduction in PAC use was decreased familiarity with PACs among our Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) staff; namely CCU Registered Nurses, Residents, and Fellows. To combat staff trepidation, we created a core lecture series delivere d on- line in a \"Khan Academy\" format. There are five total modules, taken in series. In order, we pro vided a general introduction to PACs, acquisition of hemodynamic data, interpretation of PAC waveforms, hemodynamic calculations, and case -based applicatio n of invasive hemodynamic care. We measured staff perceptions toward the various subjects as well as knowledge in both pre/post assessments. Methods: A core content consisting of five modules, each lasting less than 20 minutes was created, and delivered via web content. Both pre- and post -questionnaires were administered in tandem with each module. Two q uestions were Likert -scale based targeting learner confidence around the core lessons for a given module, and three questions assessed the learners' master y of module content. Independent student's t -test was used to compare means of independent continuous variables. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 25.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) and significance defined as 2 -tailed p<0.05. Evaluatio n Plan/Results: This data represents a Phase I rollout. A total of 17 critical care unit registered nurses, 11 internal medicine residents, and 5 cardiology fellows completed the training modules and assessments. Pre- education nursing learner confidence across the platform was rated as \"2.8 out of 5,\" resident learner confidence was rated as \"1.2 out of 5 ,\" and cardiology fellow learner confidence across the platform was rated as \"1.9 out of 5.\" All learners report improvement post -educational module with average rating of \"4.8 out of 5.\" Pre -education content mastery was 27% for nursing learners, 21% for residents, and 34% for cardiology fellows. Post -education content mastery was 88% for nurses, 91% for residents, and 98% for cardiology fellows. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The implementation of a succinct web -delivered invasive hemodynamic curricul um to a multidisciplinary team in the CCU lead to improved attitudes as well as an increased mastery of core knowledge required for caring with individuals with PACs.

The objective of this study was to identify factors that facilitate or hinder the process of clinical supervision. Furthermore, to have a better understanding of the relationship between self -efficacy, residents' learning environment and Clinical Supervisor competence through residen t and supervisor responses. Methods: A descriptive survey design and census sampling technique was used, including all residents registered with Postgraduate Medical Education (PGME) at Aga Khan University (AKU) and all full -time clinical supervisors. Different self -administered questionnaires were completed by the residents and supervisors. Resident evaluations by supervisors and super visors' evaluations by residents were also obtained. Descriptive analysis was conducted with factor and regression analysi s with 80% level of significance (p -value <0.05). Responses were applied to a CS Model to develop a theoretical framework. Evaluation Plan/Results: Residents and CS response rates were 74.38% and 74.04%, respectively, with Cronbach's of 0.97 and 0.92, r espectively. Maximum responses were received from R2 (87.5%) followed by R1 (77.6%). Subscale I, Self -Efficacy had a Cronbach's of .85, Subscale II PHEEM had a Cronbach's of 0.95 and Subscale Supervisor Evaluation had a Cronbach's of 0.93. Regre ssion analysis showed significant relationship (p= 0.000) between self -efficacy and learning environment and between self -efficacy and supervisor evaluation. Majority of the clinical supervisors (37.5%) had an experience of ten or more years of teaching e xperience. Majority of the supervisors (62.5%) had attended the Introductory Short Course in Health Professions Education (ISC -HPE), a mandatory course for all incoming faculty members at AKU. Responses showed that 1) structured clinical supervision was needed; 2) senior resident self- efficacy levels were higher than those of junior residents; 3) formal supervisor- resident relationship w as essential for a conducive learning environment; 4) CS self - evaluations were higher than residents' evaluations of their supervision, and were unaware of the differing needs at different resident levels. Factor analysis elicited three, two and one factor for the three Residents Survey subscales. One factor was elicited for the Supervisor's Questionnaire. Regression analysis showed correlations between resident self -efficacy, learning environment and supervisor evaluations. Potential Impact/Lessons Learne d: CS is a multidimensional process and confirms the interrelationship of resident and clinical supervisor factors that fa cilitate or hinder effective CS processes.

Teaching Motivational Interviewing and Empathic Communication Ring, Jeffrey; Saffier, Kenneth Health Management Associates; Co ntra Costa Regional Medical Center Workshop Description: Research shows that Motivational Interviewing (MI) is more effective than advice -giving in facilitating patient behavior change. As such, MI is a powerful and effective tool for enhancing shared- decision making, relationship -building and both patient and practitioner wellness. MI is built on principles of empathy, autonomy, relationship, and respect. This workshop will provide participants with a deeper understanding of Motivational Interviewing and the Readiness to Change Model . Objectives: By the conclusion of this presentation, participants will: 1. Deepen their understanding of Motivational Interviewing and the Stages of Change Model 2. Enhance their capacity to teach empathic communication and MI 3. Obtain resources for clinical applications of Motivational Interviewing as well as instructional tools Intended participants: Anyone who provides clinical care and/or instructs other in practitioner- patient communication . Methods: This workshop is design ed to be interactive and engaging. The sessi on will reflect a mix of group discussion, mini -didactic presentations and opportunities to learn and practice core aspects of Motivational Interviewing. The instructors will regularly pause to provide group refl ection on the teaching skills involved in ea ch portion of the workshop, with an eye to applications back at their home sites. Moreover, the presenters will demonstrate Motivational Interviewing throughout the entire workshop. Activity Timeline: 00:00 - 00:15 Introductions to presenters, participants and agenda 00:15 - 00:45 Verbal and non -verbal empathic communication and reflective listening: Overview, Skills and Practice 00:45 - 01:15 Motivational Interviewing, Stages of Change, Righting Reflex, Open Ended Questions, Decision Balance and Readiness Ruler: Overview, Skills, and Practice 01:15 - 01:30 Case , 1:00 - 2:30 PM Conference Workshop The Who, Why, and How of Video -Based Education on a Shoe String Budget Phitayakorn , Roy Workshop Description: Video -based education (VBE) i s an increasingly important topic in medical education as many medical schools are starting to incorporate flipped classroom approaches to their didactic curricula. These approache s require the ability to create effective videos and asynchronous instructio nal techniques utilizing adult learning theories. This workshop will give its learners an opportunity to learn more about the need for video -based medical education and how to sele ct the right format for a video Rationale: In a lecture -based setting, many concepts are challenging to explain using only text and images. However, videos allow for instructors to use images and text in an entirely different manner, which improves learne r outcomes including attention, motivation, and knowledge retention. Additio nally, videos align well with different \"types\" of learners, especially those that value a more visual type of learning for certain topics. Furthermore, the dramatic evolution in t echnology allows instructors to cost effectively create and distribute educa tional video- based material beyond the classroom setting. Unfortunately, it can be difficult for medical education instructors to find training in how to create and integrate video s into their existing curricula. This workshop will be 90 minutes long and is ideally suited for up to 20 participants to ensure a high faculty to learner ratio. Participants will receive approximately 15 minutes of didactic education and have the remaining time to practice video filming, editing, and incorporation into teaching materials. The faculty of this workshop proposal have conducted this workshop format successfully in other medical education forums and feel it is an ideal way to learn new skills in a brief time frame. Learner Outcome Objectives: At the end of this work shop, participants will be able to: 1. Explain the value of video -based education within the larger medical education landscape. 2. Demonstrate how to shoot a clear video with a cceptable audio using their mobile device. 3. Edit the video using a free video editi ng tool. 4. Integrate their video into an existing medical education presentation or teaching session. Intended Participants: Health care professional educators and/or clini cians interested in new medical education learning technologies. Methods: The facu lty of this workshop will use a combination of short interactive didactic education with hands- on skill building practice sessions. This workshop will support adult learning principles that follows a Kolb experiential learning model/approach. Activity Ti meline: Introduction of faculty and participants (10 minutes) Didactic education on the current state of learning technologies and video -based education in the setting of Millennial learners (15 minutes) Demonstration and practice of setting up and filmi ng a video shoot (10 minutes) Demonstration and practice of editing a video (35 minutes) Demonstration and practice of integrating a video into existing teaching materials (10 minutes) Debrief and wrap -up (10 minutes) Take Home Tools: Participants wil l be able to take home all advance organizers distributed during this workshop including a list of video -based education resources and the video they create during the workshop. 30 References: 1) Colasante M (2011).

Need/Rationale: GA is known to be beneficial to most, if not all specialties within medicine. T he Keck School of Medicine (KSOM) is one of many that uses c adaveric teaching. GA is a unique aspect of medical training that provides a platform for strengthening academic learning through teambuilding and communication. While the literature touts the ben efits of NPT, there is a dearth of research that explains the added value of the longitudinal relationship between near -peer mentor and student in a structured context. A longitudinal NPT experience can facilitate students reaping the benefits that GA alre ady provides. Our intervention, the Keck Anatomy Mentorship Program (KAMP) supplements KSOM's cadaveric curriculum with NPT by pairing two first -year (MS1) students with a second -year (MS2) mentor over the course of an academic year. The program aims to: 1 ) Accelerate MS1s' GA performance; 2) Provide a platform for MS2s to develop leadership skills. Methods: KAMP was piloted during AY2016 -2017 as a supplement to the existing GA curriculum. The Office of Academic Support Services identified 21 MS1 mentees f rom the class of 2020 and 10 MS2 mentors from the class of 2 019 to voluntarily participate in KAMP. MS1s who did not have prior GA experience, were non- science majors were invited to participate. MS2s were selected based on exemplary performance on 5, firs t-year GA exams and interpersonal communication skills. Each mentor was paired with two MS1s for the duration of the program. One group consisted of one mentor and three MS1s. Mentors were tasked with leading a 2 -hour teaching session in the cadaver lab th at corresponded with each lab dissection. KAMP student perfo rmance was analyzed through three distinct methods: 1) comparing KAMP students' scores to the scores of their class of 2020 peers; 2) comparing KAMP students' scores to a post -hoc control group co nstructed from a sample of classes of 2015 -2019 students' gr ades; 3) Comparing KAMP students' actual exam performance to their expected performance based on a predictive model created using historical data. Prior to conducting analyses, all students' incom ing undergraduate GPA and MCAT scores were combined into a c omposite score using the formula (GPA x 10) + MCAT (i.e., Lizzy M; a commonly used metric by which pre -medical students assess their competitiveness for medical school applications). Comparisons were made using Mann - Whitney U tests ( < .05). Evaluation Plan/Results: KAMP enrollees made up 11% of the class of 2020 (n=21), non -KAMP students comprised 89% (n=166). KAMP students were found to have significantly lower incoming LizzyM scores than their non -KAMP peers (64.6\u00b12.9 vs. 72.1\u00b12 .9, p<0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between LizzyM scores and composite GA practical exam scores (r=0.24, p<0.001). A line of best fit was calculated (y=43.11+0.58x). We used this line of best fit as a historical model to predict the GA practical exam performance of the class of 2020. Students' composite GA practical exam scores (n exams = 4) were plotted against the line of best fit, and the numerical distance from the line for each stude nt (i.e., the residual) was recorded. KAMP stu dents were found to have significantly higher residual scores than their non -KAMP peers. KAMP students performed an average of 6.22 points above their predicted score, while non -KAMP students performed an avera ge of 0.46 points below their expected score (p<0.001). Comparisons of the average performance on four exams indicated that KAMP students scored significantly higher than non -KAMP students (86.6\u00b15.6 vs. 83.9\u00b16.6, p=0.03). KAMP student's LizzyM scores (n=21 ; Mdn = 64) did not differ significantly from those of non - KAMP post- hoc control scores (n=102, Mdn=65.10) (p=0.358). KAMP students' composite GA practical exam scores were significantly higher than non- KAMP post- hoc control students' (Mdnnon -KAMP = 86.38 81.29, p = 0.0015). 32 Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Completion of KAMP improved participants' GA practical exam scores. The program has expanded to service additional students and has the potential to be scaled up. Further study will invo lve analyzing focus group data to assess fidel ity of implementation and perceived benefit. References: 1) Leveritt S, McKnight G, Edwards K, Pratten M, Merrick D.

University of Alberta Idea/Problem Statement: This project evaluates an innovative approach in teaching the MSK physical examination (PE) skills and the effect on learner self -reported confidence. Need/Rationale: Musculoskeletal disorders are well recognized as common clinical conditions that comprise a significant number of health care visits to generalist and specialist physicians. Despi te the prevalence of such conditions, Monrad et al. (2011) highlighted suboptimal teaching of MSK medicine at the undergraduate medical educa tion level. One significant component of MSK medicine curricula is the teaching and learning of PE skills specific to MSK. Competence in these skills is essential for physicians, but Day et al. (2007) has shown low learner confidence and competence in MSK skills. With this context in mind, this project examined the following: 1) Are students entering clerkship with a level of confidence in the MSK PE matching that of other fundamental PE skills?; 2) Can the teaching method and delivery of MSK PE skills infl uence student confidence in performing these clinical skills?; 3) Does early interest in MSK specialty and shadowin g experiences influence students' confidence in MSK PE? Methods: Musculoskeletal PE skills are taught in the second year of our 4 -year under graduate medical education program. Students complete 4 sessions covering the regional joint examinations. Historically, 2 sessions were facilitated by trained patient volunteers with chronic MSK diagnoses, and 2 were facilitated by MSK clinicians. The pat ient volunteer program was discontinued and a new curriculum was implemented in 2017 -18. This new curriculum utiliz ed spaced practice and a standard framework. The framework focused on deconstructing each regional joint exam into component parts. The initi al session focused on surface anatomy, range of motion, and palpation, followed by a second session 1 -2 weeks later that focused on MSK special tests. This new curriculum was facilitated entirely by clinicians. Students were invited to complete a voluntary anonymous survey at the beginning of third -year, just prior to starting clerkship rotations. Survey questions incl uded self -confidence in performing the core system PEs. Two cohorts were recruited, one prior to (2017) and one after (2018) the curricular c hange described. Mean values of the self- reported confidence scores were compared using repeated measures ANOVA and significant differences in confidence between system PE and between cohorts were calculated using SPSS V24. Path analysis was completed usin g Mplus V7.11 to identify factors associated with higher self -confidence in the MSK PE. This project had ethics app roval. Evaluation Plan/Results: Response rates for the online survey were 83% (134/162) for the 2017 cohort and 75% (123/164) for the 2018 c ohort. Mean self- assessed confidence was significantly lower for the MSK PE (2.5/4.0 2017 cohort, 2.8/4.0 2018 cohort) than the cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations in both cohorts (all p < 0.001). MSK PE confidence was not statistically different than confidence in the neurological PE (p = 0.859). Significant improvement in MSK PE confidence was not ed between the 2017 to 2018 cohorts (+0.32, p < 0.001), with no other significant changes in confidence noted in any other system PE between the two years. Path analysis demonstrated that students with early preference for an MSK -related specialty had sign ificantly more shadowing experiences in physical medicine & rehabilitation (standardized regression coefficient b = 0.304, p = 0.013), which then contributed to significantly higher MSK PE confidence (b = 0.121, p = 0.024). In addition, early preference fo r an MSK specialty also had a significant direct positive effect on MSK PE confidence (b = 0.493, p < 0.001). Potential Impact/Lessons Learn ed: Our innovative MSK PE curriculum significantly improved medical student confidence in performing this essential clinical skill, but it still remains lower than other system PE's. Early interest in MSK specialties is associated with higher confidence, b ut engagement of all learners remains important. 34 References: eletal education in US medical schools: lessons from the past and suggestions for the future.

Need/Rationale: For the past two years, we have incorporated a required EBM assignment into our emergency medicine clerkship using standardiz ed case vignettes focusing on four clinical conditions relevant to the practice of emergency medicine. The assignment has been well received (1 ). Specific guidelines and instructions for submitting the assignment have been developed and updated annually as needed. We have since identified the need to develop a more consistent and uniform way of evaluating this assignment. This is important as the assignment is completed by more than 200 students annually and is worth 5% of the end of rotation grade. To addr ess this need, we sought to develop and implement a grading rubric to allow faculty to better evaluate this assignment along with providing con sistent written feedback to the students in a more standardized and uniform fashion. Methods: In conjunction wit h our health science research librarians, we developed an original rubric to evaluate a required EBM assignment. The rubric contains 6 domains which are used to grade each student's assignment. The rubric was developed with anchors to assist in completion. The rubric is based upon the submission guidelines and is available to the students to review prior to completing their assignment. 5 of 6 dom ains are evaluated as: \"Below bulk of the evaluati on focused on whether the submission met expectations or whether the write up exceeded or did not meet expectations based on predefined anchors . The five domains evaluated in the three -tiered approach are: 1) Identifies an article; 2) Describes the importa nce of the clinical condition; 3) Describes the study methodology; 4) Describes the study results; 5) Overall write up. After each assignment i s reviewed and the six domains assessed, an overall grade is assigned for each case using a 5 point scale: 1 -2, Below Expectations; 3, Meets Expectations; 4- 5, Above Expectations. For each completed assignment, written feedback is also provided to the stud ents highlighting each of the 6 domains. Evaluation Plan/Results: In the first 5 months of the 2018 -19 academic year, 79 EBM assignments were submitted by 75 students (4 students completed a 2nd rotation and completed a 2nd assignment). Fifty (66%, n -75) students completed the post -rotation questionnaire. Forty nine (98%) students reported it was helpful to receive a completed rubric after their EBM assignment was graded. Thirty nine (78%) felt the grade they received (5 point scale) was a fair assessment of their completed assignment. The students rated the written feedback they received as: excellent (30%); very go od (38%); good (18%), fair (12%), poor (2%)). Forty five (88%) reviewed the rubric before completing their assignment. All 5 students who did n ot review the rubric before completing their assignment reported the grade they received was a fair assessment an d all reported that the written feedback they received was positive. In five (6%) of the 79 submitted assignments, students did not correctly a pply the study results to answer their clinical case / question. Overall, in applying the rubric to grade the EBM assignments, 50 (63%) assignments were evaluated at an \"Above Expectations\" level (4 or 5 points), 21 (27%) at \"Meets Expectations\" (3 points) and 8 (10%) at \"Below Expectations\" (2 points), no assignment received a grade of 1 point. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Most students report that it was helpful to receive a completed rubric for their assignment. Many students felt the grade they re ceived was a fair assessment and most rated the feedback they received as positive. Overall, the implementation o f the grading rubric appears to have been successful. 36 References: 1) Wald DA, Roepke C, Fane K, Barrett J.

Need/Ration ale: Evidence -based pharmacotherapy exercises that address clinical reasoning develop the skills needed to master patient management concepts assessed in 20 -80% of the content of NBME examinations [1- 3]. Importantly, these principles of patient -specific ma nagement translate into the clinical setting, where clinicians often consult resources and guidelines to optimize treatment strategies or to meet standards of best practice. Our goal was to integrate evidence based pharmacotherapy exercises in an organ sys tems based curriculum. We developed an interprofessional, longitudinal series of Pharmacotherapy Integration and Longitudinal Learning Sessions (PILLS) in collabor ation with medical students and licensed pharmacists. The curriculum outcomes are described a t levels of learner reaction, learning, and behavior. Methods: Our longitudinal model was piloted in two courses (one each in Year 1 and 2). The first -year medica l students (n=177) participated in a semi- guided, problem -based exercise to work through a clinical case. This exercise consisted of: 1) generate a summary statement; 2) provide a differential diagnosis; 3) select evidence -based treatment option(s). The ex ercise was scheduled after relevant content had been covered in lectures. The exercise used a n online, dynamic, question- based modality to evaluate patient -specific characteristics and select optimal pharmacotherapy. Second -year medical students participat ed in a similar, self -directed (not guided) exercise to determine evidence -based pharmacotherapy for two complex clinical cases. Primary outcomes include student reported comfort navigating evidence -based resources, ability to appropriately source and evaluate evidence- based materials, and accuracy of final application for management plans. Free -text and Likert- scale responses were utilized to capture these outcomes. Subsequently, free -text responses were translated into categorical variables as per a prior i definitions. Evaluation Plan/Results: 177 students participated in the PILLS exercises in the Pulmonary (Year 1) and Genitourinary (Year 2) courses. Year 1 student comfort as assessed through eight different domains increased post exercise. There was a significant increase in student -reported comfort with general pharmacology material, with applying pharmacology material to clinical cases, and with accessing and applying published treatment guidelines (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant increase in student- reported comfort with accessing and applying evidence -based information sources (p < 0.01). In terms of resources utilized, first search engine and most useful resource were captured through free -text responses. The most common resource do cumented that was first accessed was up to date (45.5%), which was also identified as the mos t useful source (63.6%). Of the most useful resources documented, 80.6% were identified as scientifically evidence -based. Most students (94.4%) correctly identifie d the first step of patient management, and further, a large majority (89.9%) of students ult imately identified either an allergy or clinical nuance about the patient case that required adjusting therapy according to evidence -based resources. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: PILLS is feasible to implement in organ systems courses, requiring limited faculty resources and allowing practice of evidence -based clinical reasoning while enhancing student appraisal of and confidence with validated resources. We p lan to implement similar practice into other integrated courses. References: 1) USMLE. Step 1: Content Outline and Specifications. http://www.usmle.org/step -1/#content -outlines.

Journal of advances in medical education & professionalism. 2017;5(3):95. 39 Friday, 2/22/2019 , 2:45 - 4:15 PM Oral Presentations of Innovations, Undergraduat e Health Professions Education Exploring Clerkship Students' Learning Styles to Aid in Design of a Pediatric Discharge Curriculum Molas -Torreblanca, Kira; Maniscal co, Jennifer Children's Hospital Los Angeles/Keck School of Medicine at USC; Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital Idea/Problem Statement: Transitions of care is a required element of medical student education. It is unclear how to design a pediatric clerkship curriculum on this topic. Need/Rationale: The Liaison Committee on Medical Education requires education related to patient safety and transitions of care (TOC) for medical students. However, there are no published pediatric clerkship curricula that incorporate safe TOC, medication safety and hospital discharge education. As the \"millennial generation\" favors social media platforms and other technology -based learning modalities, educators must consider using these instructional strategies to promote efficient, accessible, and effective teaching and learning. The aim of this study w as to conduct a needs assessment of medical students' learning preferences related both to a pediatric -focused hospital discharge curriculum and the use of technology- based instructional modalities preferred by students in an already packed, busy clerkship. Data from this study will aid in instructional design of our clerkship curriculum with the intent to evaluate the feasibility via a pilot study as our next steps. Methods: This is a qualitative study using focus group methodology and a phenomenological approach to data analysis. The focus group was facilitated by an experienced focus group study leader and comprised of 8 third year medical students rotating at Children's H ospital Los Angeles. A detailed moderator packet and instructional guide was develo ped, and the moderators participated in a training session led by the investigative team. After the creation of interview questions, a mock focus group was formed and facili tated by the principal investigator prior to the study. Sample size was determined based on likelihood of achieving thematic saturation. Participants were recruited via email and participation was voluntary. Inclusion criteria for recruitment consisted of students in good standing with the medical school and recently completed their pediatric clerkship. Non- participants either declined to participate, had schedule conflicts, or were not needed due to reaching the target sample size. Three questions were audio -taped and transcribed. In addition, verbatim and contextual notes were scribed b y an assistant moderator for the remaining 13 questions. Three investigators are independently coding the data and using a research analysis software program for identificat ion of themes. This study was approved by our institution's IRB. Evaluation Plan/R esults: Preliminary analysis indicates that participants recognize the importance of and are interested in a pediatric TOC and hospital discharge curriculum, particularly on e that incorporates evidence -based medicine. Participants prefer \"hands -on\" instructional strategies, such as observing or participating in a \"process of patients leaving the hospital.\" Regarding general study habits, most participants indicated that they like to study at home, prefer self- study compared to groups learn ing, and are comfortable using technology. Regarding various instructional strategies used during pediatric clerkships, most participants felt OSCE's were not helpful in certain environments and half disliked reflection exercises. Most participants stated that in- person workshops, case- based learning, and procedure training were favored. Almost all participants indicated that they do not like the use of podcasts for delivery of educational material. Final data analysis is ongoing and is expected to be compl eted by November 2018. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Medical students identify TOC curricula as important and prefer active learning strategies during pediatric clerkships. Technology -based modalities may offer benefits in terms of efficiency and acce ssibility, but these modalities were not clearly favored by participants. References: 1) Boysen, D. G. (2010).

What is going right on our best days and what is missing on our toughes t days. We will use the lens of PERMA (P ositive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Achievement) to help us examine positive factors and barriers in our work environments. Each participant will complete a needs assessment and together we will begin the development of action plans. Rationale: Burnout is prevalent among learners and all levels of health care practitioners and adversely affects both learner wellbeing and patient care. Acknowledging this, academic health centers have developed wel lness programs and curricula for learner s and for faculty, while attempting to improve the learning/work environment. Despite these efforts stress and burnout appears to be on the rise. One hypothesis for this paradoxical effect is that wellness efforts of ten seem reactive, sub optimally integra ted into the environment, and for the most part focused on 'respite' activities. Moreover, such programs often seem to lack an explicitly articulated theoretical framework to guide them. Whether these activities prom ote (or hinder) resilience and 'flourish ing', as opposed to purely providing a venue for people to decompress and compartmentalize their lives, is deserving of exploration. Intended Participants: Educators and educational administrators involved in curric ulum development, admissions and student affairs who are interested in wellbeing and professional development of faculty and students Learner outcome objectives: At the end of this workshop participants will be better able to: 1. Identify positive factors an d barriers in the work environment in re lation to our wellbeing 2. Use the lens of PERMA (Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Achievement) to examine our own wellbeing, and 3. Begin to make a plan to enhance resilience and flourishing for o urselves, our learners and our workplace Methods: This workshop will use a variety of methods including brief formal presentations, small and large group activities with debriefing, and paired -work utilizing a worksheet. Activity Timeline: Timeline (minu tes): Activity 01-20: Small group activity: Participants will generate lists of barriers and facilitators for their own wellbeing. A large group list will then be developed. (objective 1) 21-40: Didactic and large group discussion to linking the barriers a nd facilitators above to a) the workplace arenas noted by Maslach (workload, control, reward, community, fairness, values), and to PERMA (Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Achievement) from Seligman. (objective 2) 41-55: A handout a nd brief discussion of concepts and tools to help yourself or learners enhance wellbeing. From the 21st century mindset concepts will include mindfulness, growth mindset, self - compassion, vulnerability, grit and resilience. We will also provide links to to ols useful in self - discovery and enhancing elements of wellbeing. 56-75: Participants will work in pairs, using a worksheet to begin to develop an action plan to enhance wellbeing for self, others, with one idea for how their organization needs to \"change \" to better promote wellbeing. (objective 3) 76-90: Wrap up, take home ideas and session assessment. 42 Friday, 2/22/2019 , 2:45 - 4:15 PM Conference Workshop Your Student Posted What on Twitter?! Defining and Teaching eProfessionalism in the Digital Era Davis, Mark [1]; Harlan, Greg Mojarad, Sarah [2] [1] California of Technology; [2] Keck School of Medicine of USC Workshop Description: Do you remember a time before the Internet?

Need/Rationale: Wayne State University School of Medicine (WSUSOM) is the larg est, single- campus medical school in the United States. Providing exposure to urban, clinical care, coupled with small team learning and support to c lass sizes of 290 -300 students presents challenges. A Year 1 segment review identified the need to develop a longitudinal, competency- based clinical skills curriculum that spanned the first two years of medical school. The curriculum needed to align with t he learning objectives defined by the AAMC Recommendations for Clinical Skills Curricula in Undergraduate M edical Education (2008). The program provides students with opportunities for repeated practice with formative feedback, and real-time intervention a nd enrichment opportunities. The goal of the program is to help students develop clinical competence prior to entering clerkship. Methods: A competency -based clinical skills curriculum will be implemented over the course of one academic year with Year 1 m edical students. A class of 300 students will engage in ten, 90- minute sessions to interact with a returnin g patient whose chief complaint changes to reflect the body system studied in lectures. With each visit, the patient will experience increased challe nges that will affect their health, behavior, and presentation. The innovation lies in the development of p erformance rubrics and formative feedback systems anchored to the AAMC Recommendations for Clinical Skills Curricula in Undergraduate Medical Educati on (2008). The AAMC objectives were grouped into six domains: Professionalism, Communication, History -Takin g, Physical Examination, Oral Presentation, and Note - Writing. Each domain was divided into competencies and four levels of achievement, based on qualitative descriptors instead of numerical scores. The scoring rubric is designed to show progress in 77 competencies, along a continuum ranging from Undesirable (not competent), to Entry, Developing, and Aspirational (highly competent). Verbal and written f eedback is provided by a standardized patient, a peer, and a Year 4 medical student during each session. Students also have the opportunity to watch videos of their performance to reflect upon their progress. The process of repeated practice, formative feedback, and reflection helps build self -regulated medical learners. Evaluation Plan/Results: During each of the ten sessions, students are provided with feedback on 77 competencies. Students making adequate progress are offered self -selected enrichment opp ortunities after each session. Students struggling to make adequate progress are required to participate in enrichment sessions. Enrichment opportunities include faculty- led workshops, practice on physical exam maneuvers with a standardized patient, and on e-on-one meetings with faculty, determined by individual student need. Mid -term and end -of-year summative e valuations are used to document student growth and determine promotion. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Repeated practice with regular, formative feedback based on qualitative descriptors instead of numerical scores shifts students focus towards learnin g outcomes instead of achievement scores, promotes reflection, and helps builds self -regulated medical learners.

Assessment is an essential part of medical education; it provides evidence of how well s tudent learning objectives are be ing achieved. One of the ways to enhance learning is to address the method of assessment, because students clearly concentrate on what is going to be examined for better grade achievement and self satisfaction. Computer bas ed testing (CBT) has the capabili ty to test students regarding their clinical competence by using high resolution images, radiology films, drawings, multimedia and patient simulation scenarios. The above parameters of clinical competence are not well explo red by paper testing. In our stud y, CBT was implemented in all pediatric rotation assessments, for the purpose of enhancing student motivation for clinical encounter s, in addition to other benefits of CBT such as easiness to perform and rapid feedback . Methods: In Faculty of Medicine, Beirut Arab University, over a period of one year, a total of 85 undergraduate students passing through pediatric rotation (in medicine year 4) were subjected to evaluation of their motivation for learning, especially acquisi tion of clinical skil ls. Evaluation of student learning motivation as an outcome to introducing CBT was done by more than one method in trial to eliminate confounding variables such as learning environment and curricular changes. This was performed while i mplementing CBT rich in patient images, drawings, radiology films, and patient simulation formats as an alternative to paper testing in all continuous and final tests in this year. First, there was direct teacher observation of clinical bedside attendance and student attitude to clinical settings, taking into consideration previous year clinical attendance in the same rotation as control (before starting CBT). Second, clinical case presentation skills were assessed during the rotation using previous year as control. Third, we c onducted student survey concerning CBT as compared to paper testing, and request ed student response to parameters: is it enhancing knowledge learning, is it enhancing clinical skills learning, is it helping in achieving educational obj ectives, and can CBT be a method of teaching by itself. Survey results were categorized into four point scale: strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree Evaluation Plan/Results: Direct teacher observation of clinical bedside attendance was me asured by interview o f teachers. Compared with previous year in the same rotation before using CBT, no significant change in student attendance and keenness to learn was observed by teaching staff. Second outcome variable was observing clinical case presen tation skills by stud ents in the program phase (1 year) in comparison with previous year (pre -implementation period). Case presentations during the year of CBT implementation were done on weekly basis with two case presentations per student in rotation. Presentations were found to be done more professionally, with plenty of higher thinking analysis as reported by teaching staff. T he third outcome variable was a student survey concerning previously addressed questions. Question 1: is it enhancing knowledge l earning. Response was 12% strongly agree, 33% agree, 35% disagree, and 20% strongly disagree. Question 2: is it enhancing clinical skills learning. Response: 32% strongly agree, 51% agree, 10% disagree, and 7% strongly disagree. Question 3: is it helping i n achieving education al objectives. Response: 24% strongly agree, 49% agree, 25% disagree, and 2% strongly disagree. Question 4 \"was a high yield\": can CBT be a method of teaching by itself. Response: 42% strongly agree, 46% agree, 9% disagree, and ngly disagree. Previo us conclusions are strongly suggestive of the potential for enhancing student clinical session learning through implementing CBT Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Enhancing undergraduate student motivation for learning especially clin ical skills and reaso ning ability is expected to occur after implementing CBT rich in patient 46 pictures and simulation formats. Limitation for widespread implementation of CBT in other institutions should be considered as well References: 1) Douglass, J. \"The Learning Outcomes Race: the Value of Self - Reported Gains in Large Research Universities\".

In order to meet their needs and to move toward a competency -based assessment model, an interdisciplinary team of KSOM faculty developed the Clinical Assessment Tool (CAT) in 2015 as a workplace -based assessment (WPBA) tool of learner performance in core -clerkships. All preceptors now use the CAT to assess the clinical, interpersonal and communication skills as well as professional behaviors of their learners. The dev elopment team included three medical education researchers and faculty from family medicine, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and neurology. This collaborative effort produced a valid assessment instrument thro ugh the use of standardized descriptors of common clinical behaviors across all settings. (1, 2) Through a modified Delphi process, representatives from all clerkships contributed to the language used in the descriptors to ensure understandability by preceptors across disciplines and settings. In the spring of 2016, the committee constructed a prototype consisting of 11 items with 9 levels of performance for pilot- testing. Quantitative and qualitative feedback from the pilot - testing resulted in modification of the tool. The number of items was increased from 11 to 14, and the number of performance levels was reduced from 9 to 7. For each item, preceptors can choose from a range of narrative anchors describing observable behaviors, rather than arbitrary Liker t-type responses (such as numerical ratings or ranking statements) that tend to distract raters from making objective assessments. (3) The specificity of these narrative anchors promotes more objective and consistent assessments of learners' skills across multiple raters, whose assessments ultimately contribute to entrustment decisions. (4) Furthermore, in an effort to make the assessment process and instrument transparent to both preceptors and learners, we have incorporated th e same CAT content into the mid-clerkship feedback activity. Students are required to assess themselves using the CAT descriptors prior to meeting with their preceptors (faculty or resident) for feedback. The behaviors described in the narrative anchors fa cilitate more explicit feed back by preceptors and help guide students in their development relative to the ACGME competencies . (5) The CAT is being fully implemented in 2016 -2017. As part of ongoing validity assurance and quality control, the development team will be reviewing the performance of the instrument in every clerkship rotation during the implementation year. At the time of this report, three clerkships have completed two full rotations' worth of assessment. Feedback received from rotation 1 prec eptors has led to a modific ation aimed at improving the visual clarity of the tool. Data from rotation 2 will be used to assess the effect of this modification. The purpose of this presentation is to share the step -by-step development of a WPBA tool which can be used by preceptors in any clinical setting to provide valid data for entrustment decisions. We will discuss some of the potential roadblocks that could have interfered with the success of this initiative. Since the design of the tool has evolved from its inception, we will s hare the different iterations of the tool (prototype, CAT 1.1 and CAT 2.1) and the underlying rationale for the modifications. Lessons Learned: 1. Consider the platform on which the assessment tool will be hosted and incorporate i ts constraints and limitati ons early in the developmental phase of the tool. 48 2. Solicit feedback from as many users as possible and pilot -test every iteration of the tool design. 3. Design an effective and feasible rater training protocol to ensure standardizati on and accuracy. Reference s: 1) General Medical Council. Workplace based assessment: a guide for implementation.

Need/Rationale: Graduate medical education (GME) programs use EPAs as a basis for competency - based assessment (1). Undergraduate medical education (UME) programs are beginning to use them to align with GME outcomes (2). Formative assessment in the EPAs coupled with coaching can help prepare our learners to achieve the EPAs prior to graduation. The goal of coaching is to \"guide learners to develop and grow an internal locus of control and ma ster new skillsets\". The four EPAs chosen are from the list of the Final 13 Core EPAS for entering residency(3). They are: 1. Gather a history and perform a physical examination; 2. Prioritize a differential diagnosis following a clinical encounter ; 3. Provide an oral presentation of a clinical encounter ; 4. Give or receive a patient handover to transition care responsibility. Proving a safe environment for learners to implement these EPAs, would be a step towards increasing competence and confidence of the learners, enhancing patient safety, and increasing residency program directors' confidence in their new interns. Methods: The Subinternship (Sub -I) Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) will consist of 3 stations. Both the University of Southe rn California, Keck School of Medicine and Loma Linda University School of Medicine will be implementing this OSCE. At the first station, the learners will take a history, perform the physical examination and educate and counsel the patient. This will be r ated by the standardized patients. On completion of this station, the learners will move to Station 2, where they will input the history and physical examination into the computer. During this time, they will receive a call from a \"standardized\" nurse abou t a cross coverage patient. This interaction will be rated by the nurse. At Station 3, they will present the case to an attending physician, including their differential diagnoses and their care plan. The attending will use a checklist to rate them and pro vide coaching and feedback. The attendings will have a dialogue with the learners to explore their clinical reasoning. After this, learners will then \"hand -off\" the patient using the IPASS format and lear ners will be rated on this as well. Evaluation Plan/Results: The learners will be rated by the standardized patient and the standardized nurse on the history and physical examination and the cross -coverage phone call. They will receive extensive feedback and coaching from the faculty in Station 3 on three of the aforementioned EPAs - oral presentation skills, clinical reasoning , and hand- off. Faculty will evaluate the learners' progress toward achievement of graduation competencies. In addition, we will be having focus group discussions with the learners on the usefulness of the OSCE in subsequent rotations and a follow -up survey to be sent next year when they are in their residency. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Core EPAs are important for entrustment decisions. Assessment of learner's p rogress in achievement of these EPAs through direct faculty -student interaction in a standardized setting can provide information for determining readiness for graduation.

Need/Rationale: High quality physician -patient communication indicates excellence in healthcare. (1) SPs are used to prepare learners for real -world patient encounters. Research indicates that SP and AP ratings provided different information about physicians' communication style (2) Despite calls for new directions in communication research to better understand physician -patient interactions (3), few studies have shed light on why differences exist. This is the first stu dy to do so. Methods: A sequential mixed methods design was used to study patients' assessments of 28 PGY -3 residents' communication skills. Five items on the Abbreviated Communication Rating Scale (ACRS), part of the OSCE administered in PGY -1, were used. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test for matched pairs was conducted in SPSS to determine congruence of assessments based on the ranked order magnitude of the difference in ratings. Focus groups were conducted with residents to understand potential differences in physician -patient interactions over time and the context of their communication practices. Group interviews were audio -taped, transcribed, and coded for themes in Dedoose. Evaluation Plan/Results: A significant difference was found on one ACRS item: s ummarized and/or clarified information (Z = -2.25, p = 0.02 [two -tailed]). Focus groups indicate differences between APs and SPs influenced residents' interactions with each group and contextual limitations (e.g., patient load and limited time) influenced the quality of their communication overall. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Residents adapted their approach to patient communication depending on context. References: 1) Matusitz J, Spear J.

May, Win, MD, PhD; Novak, Daniel, PhD; Liu, Alan, MD; Vo, Anne, PhD Keck School of Medicine of USC Idea/Problem Statement: Does congruence between student self -assessment and feedback predict and correlate with student's clinical performance? Need/Rationale: Reflection -on-action is an important skill when learners evaluate their behavior after completing an experiential activity (1). Studies have shown that learners may be unaware of their strengths and weaknesses (2); however, a combination of feedback from faculty and self -assessment have improved medical student learning from video review (3, 4, 5) . Congruence between faculty and learner assessments and their relationship to student performance has not yet been stud ied with sufficient rigor (6). Best practices for guided reflection remain underdeveloped in the clinical context. We address this gap by examining the alignment between faculty and third year medical students' assessments of reflective capacity on video reviews of clinical performa nce, and the relationship of this congruence with students' OSCE performance scores. Methods: 84 students third -year medical students were asked to partner with 27 senior faculty member to engage in reflection on videos of their OSCE exam. Students and faculty members watched the videos together and filled out a worksheet that asked both parties to reflect on what went well, what could be improved in the student's performance, and a brief growth plan in the video along several me asures. Following the indep endent reflections, students and faculty compared their reflections, and faculty gave each student a 1 -5 score on the congruence of the students' self -assessment with their own assessment. Evaluation Plan/Results: In a linear regression analysis on the OSCE and Reflection Congruence Average (RCA) z -scores, RCA scores predicted a small but significant portion of OSCE outcomes b = .308, t(82) = 2.50, p < .05; RCA scores explained a small but non -trivial portion of the variance, wit h R2 = .071, F(1, 82) = 6.2 53, p < .05. When the regression was reversed to test bidirectionality of the effect, b = .230, t(82) = 2.501, p < .05, with R2 = .071, F(1, 82) = 6.253, p < .05. This indicates that there is a positive linear relationship betwee n scores. A bivariate Pearson correlation was also run to test the degree of correlation between the OSCE and RCA scores. In this test, the two variables were strongly correlated with r(82) = .266, p < .05. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Findings indic ate a small but significant relationship between faculty ratings of student reflective ability and their score on the standardized clinical performance exam. Future research is necessary to examine how this phenomenon can be used to improve student outcomes on OSCE -style tests. References: 1) Schon D.

Rationale: Successful transition to residency is based on character, skill preparation and the qual ity of the environment (1). Knowledge about the skills residents bring to residency could assist in planning orientation and other early training session, especially when multi -year data is uti lized. Further, residency programs need to certify residents ea rly in training to be able see patients on their own. To accomplish this requires expertise, faculty time and residency resources. Many individual programs lack expertise. Combining resources to produce hospital -wide multi -station clinical examinations (M SCE) to assess entry- level performance in relation to ACGME competencies may be a partial solution for many academic health centers since MSCE assessment has been shown to be reliable (2,3). Methods: Adventist Health - White Memorial began conducting the MSCE each year during Orientation in 2007 (12 years). Resident being programs in Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics and Podiatry have been assessed. The emph asis for this exam continuum is on tracking resident progress, and on using the data for program improvement. Scores were computed by station as well as areas of Competence (Professionalism, Communication Skills, Medical history, Psychosocial history/risk assessment, Physical Exam, Problem Solving, Patient Education). The assessment of individual resident performance is part of each program's early assessment as part of competency -based assessment. Results: Data across the 12 years will be reported across each areas of competence and across the stations included in th e examination. Potential Impact and Lessons Learned: Other program nationally can learn from our data and from our lessons learned. Many things have gone very well: 1) Program Directors working well together to assist individual residents and enhance trai ning for programs as indicated by results; 2) Consistent administrative support; 3) Administration of all tests very smooth; 4) Faculty willing to observe and provide feedback; 5) Residents cooperative in completing all tasks; and 6) Most residents have performed well. There have also been challenges and lessons learned: 1) Developing activities early in residency to help those whose skills were low is time consuming and continu es to be inconsistent; and 2) For those with overall low performance individual mentoring across time has worked well for most, but the mid- second year MSCE has demonstrated that a few residents continue to struggle with some of the \"basic\" skills.

Need/Rationale: Ultrasound (US) guided peripheral venous access is a common procedure that reduces the use of central lines and their complications such as pneumothorax and arterial puncture (1). One barrier to wider adoption of the technique is provider comfort which inc reases via training on phantoms. Phantoms allow instructors to train clinicians and assess their learner performance. Despite the commercial availability of procedural training phantoms, their w idespread availability is limited due to their cost. Thus, many institutions have described methods of developing low -cost phantoms, but many of these models lack fidelity and have suboptimal US image quality/echogenicity (2). There is also a lack of objective comparisons of these do -it-yourself solutions and commerc ially available phantoms. This study seeks to provide an approach for comparison and uses said approach to assess our low -cost solution to show that it can be used to assess learner performance like an expensive commercial phantom. Methods: Ballistics gel (Clear Ballistics - Smith, Arkansas), dye, and flour were heated and mixed in a metal container for 2 hours. Once melted, the liquid gel was poured into a 3D printed nylon mold with steel rods placed to simulate blood vessels. Then the mold was placed in an oven for 30 minutes at 300 to allow time for bubbles to clear. After cooling, the metal rods were removed from the phantom leaving the simulated blood vessels behind which were melted shut a t both ends and injected with water. Five experts who perform/ teach ultrasound guided peripheral access were asked to target two veins in Block A (our model) and Block B (commercial model) and then fill out an assessment form. Five categories important for assessing learner performance were used for comparison: US im age realism, US needle visualization, vein compression, haptic feedback, and vein depth. The small sample size in this case is validated by a mathematical model that shows 5 experts in a field w ill capture 80% of the data that is available about a model (3 ). Evaluation Plan/Results: The data suggests that experts find no difference between the Block A and Block B in all five categories since the average rating for US needle visualization, vein c ompression, haptic feedback we're not statistically different (3.6, 3.2, 3.0) and a two -tailed t- test yielded p -value=0.374 and 0.704 (=0.05) for US image realism and vein depth respectively. Furthermore, the data also suggests that 80% of the experts prefer Block A over Block B for training. In terms of cost, Block A is $7.90, with negligible cost to re- melt the phantom over many years, and the commercial model is $628. The results indicate that the main difference between the two models is in cost. In terms of factors used to assess learner performance, there is no difference in the two models suggesting that Block A can be as effective in assessing learner performance as the Block B. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This high -fidelity phantom can allow institutions to save thousands of dol lars on commercial phantoms and readily provide instructors around the world a platform to assess learner performance. In turn, more clinicians and learners can be trained in US guided peripheral venous access.

Need/Rationale: MCQs in medical education are generally relegated to the role of formal assessment. While they are extremely effective in this role, they are a more dy namic medium and can be used in other areas as well. Storytelling principles have long been used to engage listeners and humans are well-adapted to remember stories (1, 2). By utilizing these principles, and combining them with principles of good MCQ design, educators can better engage learners and foster an improved learning environment. Additionally, improved explanations of answer choi ce in MCQs can help make the medium more of a learning tool, rather than simply formal assessment. As medical education m oves to an increasingly more active style of learning, it is imperative that we adjust our current conceptions of the tools that we cur rently utilize, and expand their usage as necessary to adapt to the changing climate. Methods: A workshop can be used to help faculty become acquainted with best item writing practices and begin to convert existing questions first into high -quality items with guidance from the NBME Gold Book. In addition to this conversion, the workshop can help introduce the idea of storyt elling as it pertains to MCQs and the techniques used in creating interactive scenarios. First, faculty are shown how to lay out the story that they are trying to tell and list the outcomes they would like to explore. Next, they are shown how to outline th e various pathways that the question can take, and how to link between the nodes. Following outline completion, stems are designed arou nd the desired outcomes and placed into the greater story of the scenario. Testing for thoroughness and quality is easily accomplished by pairing up and sharing the stories. Finally, there is an additional step to assess the veracity of the content by content experts. Evaluation Plan/Results: Evaluating the intervention will ultimately be accomplished by implementation in a classroom, assessing for student reception, and overall impact on confidence with the material and change in grades. It is important t o assess for more than just the impact on grades as student engagement has been shown to be important in the impact of ac tive-learning strategies (3). This stage of the idea is very open to the future innovations of those who would choose to implement it. While MCQs are well -assessed in the educational field, their usefulness in learning in and of themselves, and their usefulness when applied to storytelling needs to be further researched. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: When considering the future of active learning curricula, we recognize that passive questioning to assess knowledge retention will not go away, but there is a profound need for more innovative ways to engage learners and verify that they are grasping the concepts needed in order to be s uccessful.

Shenoy, Ranjit Angeles. Idea/Problem Statement: We are developing an oral exam for pediatric endocrinology fellows to help uncover critical knowledge deficits, thereby guiding future learning. Need/Rationale: Pediatric endocrinology fellowship programs in the United States typically utilize only two methods of assessment of fellow physicians, both of which have numerous limitations. The first method is the global ratings form, in which faculty provide subjective asses sments via Likert scale with comments on strengths, weaknesses, etc . (1) This assessment is subject to multiple threats to validity including limited direct observations of trainees, rater bias, inaccurate recall, and lack of specific clinical skills or ta sks to rate (2). The second method of assessment is the Subspecialty In -Training Examination, which is a four hour, computer -based exam consisting of approximately 150 multiple choice questions (3). This assessment is objective, but also limiting given the primary purpose is to \"predict performance on a subsequent certifying exam\" per the American Board of Pediatrics (3). This certifying exam frequently assesses knowledge related to rare, atypical, or very challenging clinical scenarios or basic science and molecular biolog y rather than knowledge of common clinical scenarios. Another limitation of the assessment is the multiple choice format, which can result in cueing, can seem artificial and removed from real situations (2). An oral exam to assess clinical competency objec tively would not have many limitations of current assessments and may enhance overall assessment, and thus overall training of pediatric endocrinology fellows throughout the country. Methods: Thirty- four commonly encountered clinical case scenarios in ped iatric endocrinology are being developed and peer -reviewed by four senior pediatric endocrinology fellows and three pediatric endocrinology attending physicians. Each question will have an evidence -based, peer -reviewed scoring rubric as we ll. The exam will be pilot tested prior to administration to fellows throughout the country. At least 20 pediatric endocrinology fellows throughout the country will be recruited to take this oral exam. A faculty member will administer the exam to a fellow individually, onc e, during the spring of 2019. Total time for administration of the exam is estimated to be 2 -3 hours per fellow and will take place in the faculty member's office. We will use qualitative assessments, such as Likert scale questionnaires wi th short answers, to determine whether this oral exam uncovers previously unidentified knowledge gaps and provides useful direction and motivation for future learning. These assessments will be administered to both fellows and faculty immediately before an d after each case . Evaluation Plan/Results: The oral exam document, along with qualitative assessments, will be sent to participating faculty via email. Faculty will send completed assessments back to us via fax or email. The stakeholders, in our case, wo uld be the faculty administering the exam as they must be sufficiently satisfied with the exam to invest the time needed to administer the exam to fellows on a yearly basis. The faculty will be surveyed at the end of the exam to provide feedback on the qua lity, feasibility , and usefulness of this exam as a formative feedback tool. The fellows, will also be surveyed with a variety of questions to determine whether the exam provides useful direction and motivation for their future learning, and if so, how the y plan to change their study habits specifically. A follow up questionnaire will be administered at the end of the academic year to determine whether the fellows' study habits were altered as a result of the exam. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: An oral exam may uncover critical knowledge deficits of fellows, providing useful direction and motivation for future learning. The ultimate goal is to transition easier to unsupervised practice by improving their ability to provide high quality clinical care immediately out of fellowship. 57 References: 1) Schwartz A, editor. 2011.

Need/Rationale: Individual learner competence in core procedu ral skills are an important goal of medical training. National medical education organizations have identified core procedural skills that medical school graduates should master during training. Increasingly, post -graduate programs are requiring medical gr aduates to enter internships with competence in basic procedural skills. The Objective Structured Clinical Examination is considered the gold standard for clinical skills evaluation. However, evaluation of individual learn er procedural skill competence is consumptive of faculty time, with clinicians identified as the ideal evaluator for procedural skills. Further, administration of the OSCE usually takes place during business hours, and often require faculty to divert time away from patient care activities. Methods: In 2018, suturing skills evaluation stations were embedded into both the Surgery and OB /GYN required clerkship OSCEs. A standardized checklist for suturing use in both clerkship OSCEs was collabor atively developed. All learner per formances are recorded and evaluated within the skills center learning management system. During the Surgery OSCE , clinician evaluators use the traditional evaluation method of directly observing and evaluating individual students during actual performance of the skill. During the OB/GYN OSCE, one roving faculty member provided learner support, being immediately available to answer any learner questions. Subsequently, in the week following the OSCE, OB/GYN faculty asynchron ously reviewed learner videos and evaluated individual learner performance. To assure evaluation equivalency, two faculty members independently evaluated each learner performance. The faculty scores were averaged to determine learner performance scores. Evaluation Plan/Results: During the academic year, results of suturing station results are being tracked to provide feedback on faculty performance. Class average performance scores to date: Clerkship Rotation 1 Rotation 2 Rotation tracking results have been sufficiently comparable to support the decision to complete the academic year utilizing both evaluation modalities. When complete data set is available, at end of academic year, comparison of individual learner performance across clerkship's will be calculated. Additionally, depending on former results, evaluations that will be considered include a retrospective asynchronous learner evaluation of direct observation learners by async hronous faculty. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Asynchronous evaluation of learner competence in procedural skills appear to be a reliable and valid method. The ability to evaluate learners asynchronously, allow s faculty to perform this important task in time periods that do not impact direct patient care productivity. References: 1) Daniel B.

Background: Individual learner competence in procedural skills is one goal of medical training. Increasingly, post -graduate programs are requiring medical graduates enter internships with co mpetence in basic procedural skills. National medical education groups have identified core procedural skills that medical school graduates should master during training. (AAMC, 2005; APGO, 2017; Daniel B. Jones et al., 2017; Dudas et al., 2014) The Objective Structured Clinical Examination is considered the gold standard for clinical skills evaluation. These evaluations are resource consumptive, with clinicians assumed to be the evaluators for procedural skills. Methods: The process for training standardi zed patients to evaluate clinical skills of history taking and physical examination are well established. Three sessions of 2.5 hours each were led by pediatric nurse practitioner, and medical educators (2). Utilizing established SP training frameworks as a core (May, 2008), SP's reviewed knowledge articles, watched videos, and practiced with equipment and task trainers. As a by -product of this training, a detailed rubric outlining the parameter s for clinical performance for the procedural checklist was dev eloped. Traditional role -playing established consistency between performance prior to exam day. On day of exam, SP's interacted with learners, while the medical educators simultaneously evaluat ed each learner remotely. During the interstation exercise, all three raters reviewed their scoring to reach consensus. Evaluation Plan/Results: Preliminary data (30 students) demonstrates interrater reliability between standardized patients is achievable . This limited data also seems to indicate that standardized pa tients score more strictly than faculty. We hypothesize that these outcomes may be related to bias of faculty towards student competence. By the time of this presentation, faculty raters will a synchronously have evaluated student performance on 90 learners to assess interrater reliability between faculty and standardized patient scoring. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Faculty availability for evaluation individual learner competence is a uni versal challenge. If standardized patients prove to be efficaci ous in assessing clinical competence in basic clinical procedures it would be a huge time/resource- saving solution to this assessment need. Limitations of this project include a very small number of participants, with only one clinical procedure. Referenc es: 1) AAMC. (2005). Recommendations for Clinical Skills Curricula 2005.pdf>.

Need/Ration ale: Each year new interns start their careers as physicians with varying levels of preparation and skills (King, 2017). Inevitably, some interns at every institution will struggle with the efforts of patient care and systems -based demands. Early recogniti on of these struggling interns, with interventions to correct their deficiencies, allows for the greatest chance of success both for the interns and the patients they ca re for. Many residency programs lack a structured mechanism of identification and inter vention for struggling interns outside of a formal remediation or probation program. We believe there is a need to develop and formalize early interventions in order to avoid the need for later remediation where possible. Methods: The objective of this in novation is to identify poor performing interns by the end of their first inpatient rotation, pinpoint their strengths and weaknesses, and intervene by providing a coach to work with them individually to improve needed skills. We designed a checklist of re quisite skills an intern needs to develop proficiency in. The checklist is completed by the intern's attending and resident to identify areas in need of improvement. Thi s project starts at the beginning of the year, with skills analysis completed within th e first two months, and coaching commencing thereafter for as long as is needed to achieve proficiency with intern skills. Evaluation Plan/Results: We will use the skil ls checklist to assess intern competencies prior to the intervention and after the intervention. Each intern's supervising resident and attending will evaluate the intern based on the checklist. Additionally, we will use a Likert scale and a qualitative su rvey to assess attitudes toward the intervention among interns and their residents and attendings. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The ultimate goal of this innovative program is to increase competency among early interns to provide improved, higher qua lity, more efficient patient care, while enhancing intern satisfaction and reducing intern burnout.

This mission naturally leads to greater demographic and academic diversity among matriculants. The benefits of student diversity al so come with challenges as these students more often report bei ng disadvantaged, which has been, albeit not consistently, associated with slower academic progress (2,3). In order to sustain the mission -based admissions process and facilitate the success of all students, there is an unmet need to develop models that ca n predict future academic performance to guide early intervention and ensure seamless academic progress. This single center study was conducted to test a series of time-ordered models of demographics and early academic performance in medical school to predict success in subsequent high stakes standardized exams. Methods: Data available at matriculation and early academic performance data (year 1 and 2) were obtained for 331 students from 2014 -2016. We evaluated the incremental predictive value of a series of linear regression models of USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores beginning at admission. For the USMLE Step 1 models, predictors included gender, self -reported disadvantaged status, prematriculation me trics (GPA and MCAT), pre- clerkship course scores, and the comp rehensive basic science exam (CBSE). For the USMLE Step 2 models, we included and all of the aforementioned predictors plus Step 1 score. Estimates of sensitivity and predictive value positive (PPV) for passing the exams were also obtained for both USMLE Step 1 and Step 2. Evaluation Plan/Results: 59% of the students were female and 59% self -reported as having a disadvantaged status. Average metrics for the entire cohort were 3.6 for GPA, 73.9 percentile for the MCAT, 220.3 for Step 1, and 241.8 for Step 2 . Lower Step scores were associated with female gender and disadvantaged status. There was a positive relationship between GPA, MCAT percentile, pre - clerkship, and CBSE scores, and Step scores. For Step 1, the R2 (variance explained) was 59% after the first curricular block with incremental increases after subsequent courses with an increase to 70% with the addition of the CBSE score. For Step 2, the R2 (variance explained) was 41% after the fir st curricular block with incremental increases after subsequent courses with an increase to 67% with the addition of the Step 1 score. The Step 1 and step 2 models had a sensitivity of 66% and 75% and PPV of 52% and 43% respectively for predicting a passing score on the exams. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Early identification of at risk students is feasible. Cost -effective interventions can now be developed with the goal of maximizing student progress while minimizing stigma. Future directions include developing models for predicting clinical compe tence and assessing the impact of interventions.

Need/Rationale: Healthcare professionals are held to a high social standard when wor king with a diverse patient population. There is little published about the current teaching and training of diversity and inclusion (D&I) curricula in professional schools. In an era of increasing awareness of these complex issues, we explore the current accreditation and curricular materials with the aim of discerning the prevalence, depth, gaps, and trends in teaching D&I- related concepts. Methods: Accreditation and curricular documents of various healthcare professional training programs were selected. Documents were evaluated for the following concepts: cultural competency (general, communication, implicit bias, diversity, humility); social disparities (general, dimensions, health inequality, social determinants); and advocacy (general, levels of advoc acy, and response). Concepts were ranked by two independent raters to yield an average score from 0 (does not address) to 4 (detailed teaching instructions) to determine the depth and detail described for the 15 sub -topics within these general categories. Scores were then averaged and tallied for individual domain scores and an overall score. Documents were then further assessed for strengths and weaknesses. Representatives from each professional program reviewed the findings to ensure comprehensive evaluations. Evaluation Plan/Results: Nineteen documents were reviewed for eight fields (audiology (2); dental (2); nursing (5); occupational therapy (2); pharmacy (2); physical therapy (2); medicine (3); social work training (2)). There were 11 accreditation an d 7 curricular documents. One was a policy statement. Programs scored an average of 16.5/48 points and ranged from social work, with 31 points, to audiology and dental with 8.5 points. Accreditation documents scored an average of 12.3; curricular scored 23 .4. The teaching of and r equirements for D&I related concepts are not standardized across healthcare professions. Programs were inconsistent in their definition of terms (e.g., diversity) as well as expectations for curricular implementation and student pe rformance. No profession had a comprehensive curricular guide. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal requirements and teaching strategies. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: By first recognizing the need for a consistent, detailed curriculum , we can now collaborativ ely develop a tool to improve education for future healthcare providers and standardize interprofessional D&I related communication about patient care.

Need/Rationale: Scheduling is the bane of program directors' and coordinators' existence for good reason. Creating, entering, modifying and maintaining annual block and daily rotation schedules consumes significant time and energy. We reviewed the \"X+Y\" and \"Clinic First\" models currently touted as the solution to continuity and team -based care and realized that the solution for our program was much simpl er. Our facility does not rely on residents for provision of service or access. Starting with only 6 residents (with 18 at full buildout), we have flexibility in scheduling without service coverage expectations. Given this setting, we implemented a pure 2 -week block schedule to enhance spaced repetition of the main rotations: Hospital Based Service (HBS or Inpatient Medicine); Pediatrics; OB/GYN; Emergency; Surgery and Procedure Clinic. As we started our new residency program, we developed a model that prov ided an orderly progression of rotations, was internally cohesive and facilitated stronger resident bonds. We built in Clinical Skills (CS) and Professional Development (PD) blocks each year to provide robust training in these areas. Residents participate in CS/PD blocks with their cohort to improve team camaraderie which is often lacking. With six residents and 24 blocks per year, we were able to divide the rotations into four quarters and balance the rotations in each quarter, while maintaining a stable o verall block schedule, and allowing for easier schedule changes. Methods: PubMed searches for \"alternative residency scheduling\", \"2 week residency block schedule\", and \"X+Y residency block schedule\", yielded few articles providing guidance for our model. We utilized principles set forth by Bodenheimer et al. in their \"Clinic First\" model, including scheduling clinics on separate days as inpatient duties, increasing clinic half days, and engaging leadership in the planning and implementation of the schedul e. Our \"A- HA!\" moment was adding the CS/PD blocks to the schedule, which left 24 blocks each year (52/2 - 2=24). This meant we could divide our rotations into 6 blocks per quarter. Because the schedules repeat 6 times per quarter, each 2 -week schedule look s the same, only with different residents in each rotation, further decreasing variability of schedules. This also allows residents to inform the incoming resident about the next rotation. Each cohort of residents (PGY1, PGY2, and PGY3) will go through the CS/PD blocks with their own class to increase team bonding. For schedule changes, we can swap one resident's quarter schedule with another, but the overall schedule stays the same. No more \"domino effect\" of schedule changes requiring multiple changes to multiple schedules! To move a rotation, we only need to swap that block with another rotation from another quarter. We can also load -level our longitudinal clinics (FMP, dermatology, community, urgent care) by moving clinics to different day, which then ad justs the whole quarter schedule. Evaluation Plan/Results: The principle of spaced repetition was used to set the recurrence of the repeated rotations. However, since the exposure to each rotation is brief, non -Family Medicine faculty have less time to fa miliarize themselves with our residents during each rotation. Many faculty have voiced their concern about residents' ability to adapt to each rotation at this pace. We will investigate these concerns utilizing our rotation evaluations from both faculty an d residents. This schedule has made fine tuning much more focused (1 quarter at a time) without significant concerns about downstream effects disrupting the overall schedule. We will need to track the total number of changes to the schedule (2-week rotatio n or annual block) to determine how much disruption occurred with these changes. Future plans for evaluation include use of ethnographic research methods (observation and fieldnotes) to document the 2 -week blocks' effects on residents and faculty, using sp ecific reflective writing prompts. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The 2- week block/quarter schedule can potentially decrease the time residencies spend managing schedules. For programs not on a 2 -week block schedule, certain principles may simplify sch eduling. Example: modular quarter -based schedules allow swapping schedules just by changing the assigned resident. 64 References: 1) Clinic First: 6 Actions to Transform Ambulatory Residency Training.

Need/Rationale: Your brain is equi pped with automatic, emotional responses biased to protect you from people who might be dangerous, infectious, or time -consuming. These emotions can sneak up on you and replace compassion with fear, disgust, or anger. Particularly for thos e in interprofess ional settings with complex and marginalized populations, teaching and delivering team -based humanistic care require a shift in how humanism in medicine is learned, taught, and implemented. Existing practices can be time and labor intensive and challenging to implement for interprofessional teams that can span a myriad of professional and patient contexts. Our \"cool idea\" - the Humanism Pocket Tool (HPT) - emphasizes explicit strategies and techniques designed for providers to promote patie nt-centeredness b y counteracting reflexive, dehumanizing responses to patients with challenging behaviors. Using the Swiss Army Knife as a metaphor, the HPT pulls from the realms of appreciative inquiry, storytelling, active listening, and mindfulness to c reate a more comp act and prescriptive humanism curriculum for interprofessional collaboration and learning. Methods: We developed a standardized, quick, and explicit tool for interprofessional teams in their care of homeless Veterans and applied and integrated simple yet effective intrapersonal and interpersonal techniques into common clinical interactions. Via our HPT, clinicians and trainees learn to: 1) coach themselves; 2) be warm; 3) listen actively; 4) condense each patient's personal story into a hi ghly compact form , termed a 'Vivid Vignette'; 5) use the Vivid Vignette to identify the patient in progress notes and in conversations with colleagues, so as to inspire and coordinate care; 6) appreciate differing professional perspectives on the patient; and 7) know their team members as people. Each technique builds upon each other to progress towards creating, or enriching, the patient's story and using this story to inform, prioritize, and strengthen the quality of care. Rooted in evidence -based literat ure and best practices as well as the long -championed practice of narrative medicine, the HPT continues to evolve as an interdisciplinary tool that members of the interprofessional team can engage with and seamlessly incorporate into their daily practice. Evaluation Plan/Results: The HPT is still a work in progress and we intend to continue its evolution as we learn more about how different teams teach and practice and the various obstacles they run into during patient care. Much of the HPT's ongoing devel opment and dissem ination has occurred organically and we consider our evaluation plan to be grounded in an exploratory phase, driven by collaboration. To date, we have over 15 collaborators across the country that have begun using the HPT at their respecti ve sites and we'v e begun a process of reaching out to these providers to learn more about how they utilize the HPT and what can be done to improve it. We would like to use the IME forum as an opportunity to extend this discussion and connect with other lik e-minded colleagu es in an effort to delve into conversations about time efficiency as it relates to the HPT, other best practices that may enhance the HPT, and the role of the HPT in non -team -based care environments. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We s trongly believe t he HPT can help all clinicians maintain, or strengthen, their humanistic attitudes and behaviors in even the most challenging environments. In our interprofessional setting, it has enhanced collaboration, teaching and enriched our care of homeless Veterans .

Need/Rationale: Two programs have long histories. Medical College of Georgia (MCG) was established in 1828, and the Medical Illustration program in 1948. Having good visuals are imperative to medical education; just as having the appropriate medical applications are imperative to medical illustrations. Three years ago, the two programs partnered to explore how they could mutually benefit from working together. The team included leaders of two programs: a medical educator and a med ical illustrator. Based on the needs of both programs, a number of projects were planned but had to be developed before applying it to life processes. The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate the developed proces s and the subsequent projects implemented, as well as, the benefits of partnering the two programs and its future directions. Methods: We are focusing on two areas: projects and the development process. For each project the following outline was developed : 1) Identify need; 2) Find experts an d assemble team. Considerations: What content do experts need and what is their availability? Set expectations regarding their involvement; 3) Timeline for project; 4) Identify content; 5) Determine delivery method; 6) Create outline and/or storyboard of e ducational intervention; 7) Assemble media - photos, videos, illustrations, animations; 8) Build product; 9) Test with end users; 10) Implement intervention; 11) Evaluation of impact. In the last three years, our partn ership's completed projects are a surface anatomy training session, body painting with physical exam training, HEENT and OB/GYN E -Guides, multimedia library guide, drawing course for GYN resident, medical illustration master's projects: Ovarian Neoplasms, Heart Conduction. Current projects inc lude neurologic and musculoskeletal E -Guide and a virtual patient simulation case. Future directions include medical illustration practical projects/medical education elective, medical student elective to improve visual skills. Evaluation Plan/Results: Every project includes evaluation of impact. We developed two semi - structured surveys with a focus on Level 1 of the Kirkpatrick model (1) to assess how students react to the learning event. The utilization -focused evalu ation is focused on delivery and content for pre -session. This survey assessed students' experience with the pre -session materials. The session is an event when students apply the material they learned from developed resource. The student post -session surv ey is focused on how the developed res ource helped achieve learning tasks during the session. Students in the post -session survey are asked to evaluate their perception of preparedness for participation. We asked for feedback on how we can improve the mate rial during this time as well. Data fr om the student surveys analyzed with descriptive statistical analysis and comments using qualitative methods. Once again, there is variation of this approach based on the project. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Visualization of complicated concepts in medicine allows to build a visual vocabulary to interact with colleagues and patients, in addition to increasing comfort level in learning physical exam. This collaboration can serve as a model for development of partn ership with medical illustrators and m edical education. References: 1) Kirkpatrick DL. Evaluation of training. In: Craig RL, editor.

Need/Rationale: Medical students have a vast amount of information to learn. In most university courses, medical stude nts are commonly taught by a lecturer usi ng a PowerPoint presentation. However, as medicine advances, there is an ever- increasing amount of information to learn in an ever -dwindling amount of time. Therefore, there is a need to produce short and engaging t ools to educate medical students, allowin g students to easily recall the information given to them. In particular, students should know how to manage emergencies, as these are time dependent and often life -threatening. Evidence suggests that using song lyr ics as opposed to spoken words enhances t he recall of information. (1) To our knowledge there is no current literature examining the effect of rap music, specifically, on recall of information. However, Purnell- Webb et al. (2) showed that rhythmic informat ion accompanied by a rhythmic beat, even without a musical melody, also increased participants' ability to recall information. Therefore, one may hypothesise that as rap music is based on rhythmic beats, that this should also increase recall and could be a good educational tool. Videos are succin ct and easily accessible at any time and therefore, provide a perfect vessel for delivering a rap for medical education. Tackett et al. (3) showed that millions of viewers are already watching medical based YouTube videos, so why not utilise such videos in medical education? Methods: The study has ethical approval from Swansea University Medical School Research Ethics Sub- Committee. The lyrics for the rap were written by one of the authors (Cara Thomas) and put to a backing track using a mobile application called 'RapChat' (with permission of use). The authors and Dr. Vallabhaneni directed the video, which starred themselves and other medical students as doctors treating a paediatric patient with status epilepticus. The video was shot and produced by Steve Atherton from Morriston Hospital Medical Illustration Department. A lecture -style presentation was made containing identical clinical information and voice -over done by one of the authors (Rachel Deller). Participan ts were first and third year Graduate Ent ry Medical students attending Swansea University Medical School at the time of the study. First year students were selected in a set teaching slot, where groups of 4 -5 students were allocated to either intervention on an alternating basis. Third year stude nts were selected using convenience sampling and randomised using computer generated block randomisation. Evaluation Plan/Results: Students were asked to fill in a quiz after the interventions to assess how well they had learned the information. This was marked out of nine. 68 participants took part, 36 in the rap music video group and 32 in the presentation group. Results showed no statistically significant difference between average participant scores in the rap m usic video group and the presentation gro up (6.92 (SD=1.63) and 7.47 (SD=1.44) respectively, p=0.145). This indicates our novel rap music video is as good as the common teaching method medical students currently receive. Students were asked to give anonymous feedback about the intervention. The rap music video received more positive feedback than the presentation. Students found the rap video \"entertaining\", \"engaging\" and \"memorable\". The presentation was \"succinct\", \"clear\" but \"boring\". Our rap music vid eo may, therefore, provide a more appeali ng and engaging alternative teaching method. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Educational rap music videos offer an exciting and effective alternative teaching method that could be expanded out of the classroom to teach not only one cohort of medical stu dents but millions of students worldwide via channels such as YouTube. 68 References: 1) Kilgour AR, Jakobson LS, Cuddy LL.

Need/Rationale: Burnout in medical trainees is a growing problem and is estimated to occur in 75% of residents across discip lines (1). Burnout is a state of depersonalization, mental, and physical exhaustion. In our residency, we have found that most residents experience burnout during their second year, where they spend 7+ months in the inpatient setting. While sleep deprivati on is an attributing factor, many residents self -report feeli ng \"not themselves\" or \"like robots.\" We believe it is possible to regain a sense of self and purpose during this time. Inspired by the article written by Sgro (2), we expanded upon his \"Bring Yo urself to Work\" idea and turned it into a lecture series prom oting wellness by embracing personalities, goals, and hobbies and finding a way to meld them into work. Methods: PGY 1 -4 pediatric residents (N=74) will attend a total of 12 monthly \"Bring Yours elf to Work\" hour-long lectures during their scheduled mornin g report. Each lecture is prepared in advance by a co - resident, attending, or faculty member in the pediatric department. Lecturers are allowed 60 -minutes to talk about something meaningful in th eir life. Examples thus far include \"Narrative Medicine,\" \"Cartooning\", \"Percussion,\" and \"Juggling.\" The lecturers are encouraged to describe why this matters to them and how this ties back to their roles as pediatricians. Lecturer selection is done on a voluntary basis. In addition to residents, the audience is co mposed of attendings, nurses, or other hospital providers. They are welcomed to listen, ask questions, and participate in activities that occur during the lecture. Funding has been approximately $100 per lecture, however no one has used or requested it. The last lecture of the series will be one of self reflection, and through guided practice, each attendee will write a notecard about what is meaningful to to them and how they will bring it to wor k each day. The notecards will become part of a mural outside the chief residents' office to serve as a constant reminder of the sentiments expressed in the lectures. At the end of the year, lecturers and attendees should be able to describe what aspects of their lives are considered meaningful to them and how they can try and incorporate those aspects into their role as physicians Evaluation Plan/Results: Attendee reaction will be assessed with an online evaluation sent after each lecture. These currently provide feedback to the speaker and medical education office with regards on value of the lecture and effectiveness of the speaker. The chief resident reviews and distributes the evaluations in aggregate to the lecturer. Lecturers also complete a post -event survey that reflects on the value gained while creating an d giving the lecture. We also look to compare this year's results of the annual resilience survey to that of last years and see if the \"Bring Yourself to Work\" lecture series is mentioned. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: In order to prevent burnout in m edical trainees, we must encourage them to covet and foster their core values, even when the the journey of their practice gets unremittingly tough.

Need/Rationale: Patient harm from medical miscommunication has increased over the past decade, and is now considered a contributing factor to medical errors, the third leading cause of death in the United States. A reported 7149 medical malpractice cases occurred due to communi cation errors ending in patient injury or death (Makay, 2017). Additionally, errors cost the U.S. $1.7 billion in 2015 (CRICO Strategies, 2015). The purpose of this study i s to investigate creative communication strategies in resident -patient relationships and to evaluate the efficacy of SUNY Upstate University, College of Medicine's creative residency teaching module: Education Thru Theater Arts (ETTA). This model was devel oped to improve resident and patient communication, safety and satisfaction. Additio nally, ETTA aligns with a number of ACGME Competencies: Practice Based Learning and Improvement, Patient Care and Procedural Skills, Systems Based Practice and Professional ism. Methods: A mixed methods research design was used. The qualitative module enta iled non -verbal vignette sessions between medical residents and student actors from Syracuse University's Theatre Department, held at Syracuse Stage in Syracuse, New York. These sessions were observed and followed by resident feedback interviews. Quantitat ive analysis utilized Internal Medicine Resident Program Evaluations of ETTA through MedHUB, the electronic web -based Residency Management System, as well as Press Ganey Pa tient Survey data from resident clinics. Participants were selected through purposef ul selection from a participant pool consisting of first through third year medicine residents (PGY1's - PGY3's) at SUNY Upstate Medical University's Internal Medicine Resi dency Program. Evaluation Plan/Results: Completion date for collection of data: Jul y 1, 2019. This study hopes to outline the importance of resident- physician/patient relationships and how resident's emotional intelligence and communication strategies pla y a role in health literacy to promote patient care, safety and satisfaction. Hypothesis: Education Thru Theater Arts improves resident -patient relationships, satisfaction and safety outcomes. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: National Level: 1) Increased patient safety & satisfaction; 2) Increased resident satisfaction & wellness; 3) De creased errors & cost. Program Level: 1) Meets ACGME Internal Medicine Residency Program Requirements; 2) Meets ACGME Requirements; 71 Friday, 2/22/2019 , 4:30 - 6:00 PM Large Friday Poster Session, Poster #010 Can Google Docs Help Evaluate and Train Docs? Soufan, Rami; Samir, Fontana Idea/Problem Statement: To develop a simple and readily available application for real time evaluation of residents' performance during daily workhours and on call duties. Need/Rationale: Assessment of residents' performance outside the operating room or in other non - operative specialties is paramount. It helps identify gaps in many of the core competencies i n real time such as medical knowledge, patient care, and even professionalism. We explored the possibility of using Google Docs as the platform by which such a tool would be made available to all residency programs at no cost. Methods: Using Google Docs w e were able to build a template for the evaluation of residents' performance during daily work hours and when on call. The tool focuses on specific measurable metrics such as punctuality, efficiency, attention to details, and completion of tasks by which t he residents are evaluated. This platform was tested and proved to be versatile and easy to apply. Evaluation Plan/Results: The faculty member wil l be the one to evaluate the residents' performance on the areas listed above. The compiled data will be made available to all parties involved. This data can be anonymous. There is also a space for free texting for additional feedback or clarifications. T he program director will analyze the data and looks for patterns regarding residents' performance, and whethe r the data is consistent between different faculty members regarding any individual resident. The tool is not validated yet. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: There are many concerns regarding residents' evaluation, particularly the end of rotation evalua tion. A major concern is the lack of specific metrics that residents can be held accountable to. Having a simple and versatile tool will enable faculty to complete an immediate evaluation for feedback.

Soufan, Rami; Samir, Fontana Idea/Problem Statement: To develop a simple and readily available application for real time evaluation of residents' operative skills and the level of faculty supervision. Need/Rationale: Assessment of operative skills and the level of faculty supervision can be challenging. Several tools and models have been developed and validated in the literature. However, their use has been limited to a few residency programs due to propriety right s. One such validated tool is the Zwisch model (1,2). We explored the possibility of using Google Docs as the platform by which such a tool would be made available to all residency programs at no cost. Methods: Using Google Docs we were able to build a te mplate of the Zwisch model for evaluation of residents' operative skills, and the faculty level of supervision that can be acce ssed from any smart phone. This platform was tested and proved to be versatile and easy to apply. Evaluation Plan/Results: For every case, the resident is going to assess the level of the faculty supervision using the Zwisch model. Every faculty member wi ll assess the operative skill of the resident using the same model. There is also a space for free texting for additional feedbac k or clarifications. The compiled data will be made available to all parties involved. This data can be anonymous. The program director will look if the residents' evaluation correlates with that of the faculty. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Teaching in the OR is challenging, which is compounded by the evaluation of residents' performance and providing timely feedback. Waiting until the end of rotation to provide such assessments and or feedback enables several evaluation biases such as the halo effect, the horns effect and contrast bias.

Need/Rationale: There are now plenty of different curricular approaches to medical education. The integration of disciplines is o ne of the main trends, yet, in many cases, continues to remain a challenge (1). The challenge includes the organization of the process, itself, the le vel of detail to each integrated course, and relevance of teaching material. It is widely discussed in the literature that integrated programs promote deep learning and better retention of knowledge (2,3). Because of the increasing role of genetic discover ies in understanding of the mechanisms of development, we believe that it could be helpful for students' u nderstanding of both subjects to integrate Embryology and Genetics courses. The purpose of these curricular changes is to allow students to learn the material in a more convenient, accessible, coherent manner. Methods: The courses of Embryology and Geneti cs were initially taught as separate subjects. Since then, the topics of Embryology and Genetics have been combined into one course for term 1 student s. The new course, Early Human Development, includes genetics topics about DNA structure and function, replication, transcription, protein synthesis, DNA mutations and repair, regulations of gene expression, mechanisms of inheritance, in addition to topics of Clinical Genetics (chromosomal disorders, mosaicism and prenatal genetics). The Embryology portion of the course covers topics of gametogenesis, fertilization and general aspects of the first trough eight weeks of the development, including the develop ment of the musculoskeletal system and birth defects. The cardiovascular, digestive, urinary and genital systems development is taught in the Embryology course for term 2 students and coordinated with Anatomy organ systems course. To compare outcomes betwe en term one and term two students, Embryology standardized questions were used. We compared the level of s tudents' performance in the Embryology part of the material before the course was integrated with Genetics versus after. The students were also survey ed on their perception of the effectiveness of the integrated course. Evaluation Plan/Results: The new Ea rly Human Development course was introduced in Summer 2016. The course is taught three times per year. The quality of responses to the standardised Em bryology exam questions after it was integrated with the Genetics course increased up to 17.7% in 2016, an d up to 18.3% in 2017. In 2018, overall sentiment remained positive with students' performance increasing 18.1%. The difference was statistically significant (p< 0.01). Overall, 268 students were evaluated between the Summer 2016 semester and Summer 2018 s emester. The students' responses to the effectiveness of the integrated course was overall positive. Several responses suggested the faculty to rearrange several topics within the course for a better flow of the material, which was implemented in 2016. The level of feedback was 60.8% (163 students). Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: With our study we have confirmed that integration of the Embryology an d Genetics courses might help students learn both subjects with better outcomes. We plan to compare the standardised Genetics questions as the next step of our study. This experience can be transferred to any other school. References: 1) Hopkins R. et all.

In January of 2017, there were 17,565 people counted as homeless statewide. Need/Rationale: Nationally and statewide, a small fraction of the US homeless population is chronically homeless (without housing for several consecutive months). The majority (roughly 85%) of the US homeless population is transiently homeless (i.e., onl y on the streets for a few days, but often couch surfing, etc.) due to income and housing instability. Most resources for homeless populations have historically been allocated to the chronically homeless (as they tend to represent the most 'extreme' need) but recent efforts have shifted to prevention. In line with national tr ends, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) seeks to shift efforts toward homelessness prevention as part of an approach to reducing homelessness statewide. The landscape scan was conducted as part of this effort. Methods: Objectives: 1) Co nduct a landscape scan and provide a report to MDPH summarizing current homelessness prevention strategies employed in comparable settings internationally and within the United States; 2) Make recommendations to MDPH establishing short term and long term h omelessness prevention priorities and goals. Approach: The landscape scan included findings from the academic literature on homelessness prevention, government data and statistics, annu al evaluations and reports from relevant projects, and other credible s ources. The approach was not to conduct a systematic review of the literature only, but rather, to summarize what is well established in the literature and also collect information on n ovel efforts that may lack robust representation in the academic litera ture to date. Furthermore, this report is not all -inclusive of the multitude of homelessness prevention efforts to date, but rather seeks to highlight effective and/or novel efforts. Fo r the systematic portion of the scan, the inclusion/exclusion criteria were used below to focus on policies most comparable and relevant to the United States and Massachusetts. The landscape scan final report is divided into five sections: 1) International scan; 2) Landmark US Homelessness Prevention Federal Policy Summary; 3 ) US National Non- profit Initiative scan; 4) US local initiative scan (state, county, city and local non -profit initiatives). Evaluation Plan/Results: Results of part 1 and 2 of the fi nal report are summarized in accompanying figures. Below are example in sights from parts 3 and 4 of the final report. Part 3: United States National Non- profit Initiative Scan: Big picture lessons: Two national non -profits, The National Alliance to End Hom elessness (NAEH) and Community Solutions have demonstrated impressive, comprehensive efforts in many cities across the US to unify stakeholders, accelerate progress, and reduce homelessness using many tools (both chronic homelessness reduction and preventi on using Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data. Part 4 - US Local Initiative Scan: State, county, city and local non -profit initiatives: Summary of findings: 12 standout local efforts are detailed as case studies with effective or unique prevention methods highlighted. Example of case study program: I was impress ed by the County of Santa Clara, California's Community Plan to End Homelessness 2015 -2020, led by the non -profit Destination: Home. This non -profit has effectively unified County government, healthcare stakeholders, institutional (i.e. prisons), and private sectors (i.e. landlords, for profit HMIS companies) along with community engagement efforts and holds all to a high standard targets and timelines. The program has documented signifi cant progress for homelessness reduction and prevention, which they imp ortantly view as a continuum that should be addressed together. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This report is used as a guide by MDPH to further homelessness prevention efforts. Add itionally, based off of knowledge gained from this project in Massachus etts, along with Marl Ayson, USC pharmacy student, we submitted a winning policy proposal to LA County Medical Association's policy challenge. 75 References: 1) Byrne, T., Treglia, D., Cul hane, D.

Linking resources and patients can lead t o improved wellness on a population level. Need/Rationale: Patients are often instructed to \"exercise daily\" or \"find stress reducing strategies\", but are given little guidance or concrete means by which to attain this goal. Community or recreational centers are often underutilized and underrepresented whic h does a disservice to patients because they are often cost- effective and convenient means to improve wellness. Additionally, these centers may be utilized by populations that often have difficulty accessing healthcare such as adolescents and elderly patients with limited means of transportation. By extending the boundaries of healthcare beyond the office setting, we hope to utilize the biopsychosocial model to improve healthcare outcomes. Nevada Health C enters (NVHC), a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), is the largest provider of primary care for uninsured and underinsured patients in the state of Nevada. The 2017 Health Resources and Services Administration Uniform Data Services report reveals th at 67 percent of NVHC patients live at or below the poverty line. Approximately 25% are uninsured, 44% have Medicaid and 9% utilize Medicare. Prevalent disease processes in our patient population mirror those of the nation as a whole; 34% of patients have hypertension and 16% have diabetes. As providers working in the community, it is our responsibility to combat the disease burden in novel and practical ways to better engage patients in improving physical and mental wellness. Methods: During a community m edicine rotation, PGY -1 family medicine residents from the Sunrise Health GME Consortium were given the opportunity to explore the community near the residency's FQHC partner to better understand the needs of the patient population. One main rotation objec tive was to develop a project to foster the patient -provider alliance. Armed with increased awareness of how to work with available resources, we are better able to serve our patients by offering realistic and reasonable options to improve healthcare outco mes. Initially, our goal was to find resources for pa tients to improve physical fitness. However, after analyzing a 1.5 mile radius around the clinic, we were unable to find any gyms or fitness centers, but instead found nine parks and four community cente rs. Visiting the easily accessible parks in the neigh borhood proved to be a revealing exercise. Many areas were littered and occupied by homeless individuals, clearly a deterrent to utilization. However, many parks offered walking tracks and kinetic fitnes s equipment. Recreation centers offered sessions such as diabetes education, aerobic classes geared towards seniors, and various sports and leadership opportunities for teens. By visiting various community centers in the surrounding neighborhood, we hope t o develop a reciprocal relationship by which we can s teer patients towards these resources. In turn, we can overcome barriers to healthcare access by reaching out to patients in different settings. Evaluation Plan/Results: As conditions such as diabetes m ellitus and hypertension increase the healthcare burden, providers must find ways to overcome barriers to patients' physical and mental wellness. The community project will be presented to all family medicine residents in the Sunrise Health Graduate Medica l Education Consortium program. Additionally, informa tion about nearby community resources will be displayed throughout the clinic. Residents will be given a survey to evaluate the usefulness of content and their confidence in recommending these resources to patients. Questions will include queries such as \" How useful was this information?\" and \"How likely are you to recommend these resources to your patients?\". This will help to direct improved provider education on community resources as well as strategie s to engage patients in utilization. Future direction s include patient surveys about awareness of resources, subsequent access and satisfaction with their engagement and interest in future projects. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Community rotations ad dressing social determinants of health can lead resid ents to create new strategies for cultivating community engagement. Linking community 77 resources and patients' needs can solidify the bond between patient and provider to collaborate to improve healthcare outcomes. References: 1) 2017 Nevada Health Centers, Inc.

It also involves working with other staff. Need/Rationale: Today, more than ever, there is a need for medical professionals to be more sensitive to the cultural, religious, racial/ethnic and sex ual orientation of patients. Evidence shows that by being able to address these issues there are a higher level of compliance and quality outcomes. Review of literature, best practices, and the environment shows that new learners have little or no exposure to these situat ions in an observable manner. While specific exposures may exist for students any longitudinal curriculum is lacking. Methods: Our introduction starts with a six station OSCE that incorporates the different cultural, religious, racial/ethn ic and sexual or ientation groups of our community. Our new interns then go through each station. We do a direct observation and list our findings on a standardized grading scale that includes room for narratives. Our nurses are directly involved with this, as well, as they help room the patient prepare any proactive health maintenance issues, etc. After all interns have completed the OSCE, they break and have a debrief. The debrief consists of talking through the issues regarding access and maintaining qual ity health care for each group and then individually discussing with each intern their evaluations. Evaluation Plan/Results: As mentioned above, we grade our interns based on a standardized evaluation form we have created. It has both room for scaled scor ing as well as n arrative feedback. After the OSCEs, we debrief together to go over particular health issues for each group of patients. Then, we discuss how to access and work with our Language Line or TTY line, in addition to the use of interpreters and t he legal ramifications of misusing interpreters. We have developed an ongoing subsequent evaluation form that we use longitudinally for our residents that assesses their ability to meet the Culturally Responsive needs of their patients. This way, the resid ents know that w e continue to value their approach to culturally responsive care and leanings are continuous and onging. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: From our work with multiple intern classes and attendings, we have found this to be an invaluable addition to our training program. For our work in San Diego, it helps address many needs of our community. It has helped improve our patients health outcomes by aligning nursing and learners together.

Need/Rationale: Despite having practice privileges in over 50 countries, many immigrant minority communities in the United States are unexposed to osteopathic physicians (DO) prior to re -establishing healthcare in the United States and thus may be reticent to osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). The objective of this study is to identify literature in osteopathic outreach to minority communities and assess osteopathic awareness in New York City's Chinese community. Secondary objectives include characterization of potential barriers in hindering access to osteopathic medicine, and by extension, other minority groups. Methods: An anonymous survey prepared in Chinese and English was used to gather demographics, education level, healthcare habits, and knowledge of the osteopathic profession. To provide a clinical scenario, a health h abit question regarding low back pain (LBP), one of the most common reasons for doctor visits and one for which OMM has been shown to effectively treat, was provided to participants. Participants over the age of 18 were randomly selected to complete a pape r survey, with the option to decline. Evaluation Plan/Results: 96 surveys fit inclusion criteria, with participants questioned on familiarity with DOs and OMM. Results were categorized based on: 1) gender; 2) age; 3) highest level of education attained; 4 ) country of birth; and 5) English proficiency. Overall, only 18% of surveyees indicated knowledge about OMM while only 16% seemed to recognize the DO profession. There exists a general lack of awareness of OMM and DOs within the Chinese community in New Y ork City. History, linguistics, and international practice rights were discussed as possible influences that could factor in the lack of osteopathic awareness in Asian communities. In turn, this study may provide a framework for assessing other ethnic mino rity communities and their knowledge of the osteopathic field. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: By identifying potential barriers that hinder access to osteopathic medicine, future endeavors can develop education and outreach to increase utilization of D Os as a health resource.

Need/Rationale: Forty -two million Am ericans live in food insecure households. Food insecurity is defined as the occasional or constant lack of access to adequate food needed for a healthy, active life. Food insecurity is a major public hea lth problem and has a major impact on an individual's well-being (2), but it is seldom addressed during health care visits. (1) By providing Family Medicine resident education and information, through lectures and implementing food security screening quest ionnaires in patient encounters, we aim to increase their knowledge and confidence in addressing food insecurity and providing resources in their patient encounters. Methods: The participants are the 21 residents in the Adventist Health White Memorial Med icine Residency in Los Angeles, California. The inter vention is to: 1) administer a needs assessment survey to all 21 residents; 2) Develop a training module to provide education to all 21 residents on food insecurity and its impact on health; 3) Administe r a pretest and posttest to each resident; 4) Impleme nt a 2 question food security screening questionnaire by resident providers during each patient encounter. Evaluation Plan/Results: 1) Attendance will be taken during educational session; 2) Pre- and post -test to assess improvement of resident knowledge; 3) Post session survey to assess resident attitudes, behavior, screening rates, and confidence in screening and discussing patient's food security status and its impact on health. Potential Impact/Lesso ns Learned: Increase family medicine provider awarene ss and knowledge that food insecurity is associated with poor health outcomes and should be routinely addressed in health care.

Need/Rationale: The Mizzou Pediatric Residency advo cacy track was established several years ago in collaboration with the three other pediatric residency programs in the state. One of the track requirements is working on a longitud inal project throughout the last two years of residency. In 2016, one resident with an interest in immigrant and refugee health established community relationships with Refugee and Immigrant Services as well as other local agencies serving this population. The Interagency Council for Immigrant and Refugee Health (ICIH) was created as a collaborative of community stakeholders to address developmental and socioemotional needs of the population. In continuation of the previous track residents, our advocacy pro jects have been designed to help improve health literacy and health access w ithin the refugee and immigrant populations in Columbia, Missouri. Current ongoing projects include a video series about accessing healthcare as well as a text messaging series to provide anticipatory guidance to families. It is important, as a community, to be culturally aware and understand the needs of the community. Methods: The Medical Access Videos were filmed by Columbia Access TV with MU Center for Health Policy, School of Journalism, and the Interagency Council for Immigrant and Refugee Health. Th e focus of the video series is to give a better understanding of the type of medical care refugee and immigrants have access to in Columbia, MO. The video was officially released o n April 27th, 2018. It is currently being played on Columbia Access TV, YouT ube, with links located on Facebook. It has been distributed to Refugee and Immigrant Services, Columbia Public Schools, Daniel Boone Library, First Chance for Children, Well Baby Nursery, Center for Early Learning, Family Health Center, MU Child Psychiatr y, and MU marketing for primary care clinics. In addition, there is a great need to address mental health in the refugee and immigrant population. An animation video is currently b eing produced to help with the acceptance of mental health. Evaluation Plan /Results: The goal is to impact the health of the refugee population. As stated above, this video has been distributed to several locations in Columbia MO. It has been decided to f ocus on the well baby nursery and the introduction of the video to all famil ies. This will allow us to understand the impact of the video. There will be a pre- and post - questionnaire, with a total of 4 questions (1 question for each location: ER; Urgent; Pharmacy; and General Pediatrics) to assess the understanding of the video. These questionnaires will be given at numerous visits during the first year of life. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The impact our team hopes to capture in addition to health access and health literacy in the refugee community, is to help improve our c ommunities appreciation of all cultures and work together to better a community.

Need/Rationale: Studies have demonstrated that good language concordance between patient and provider improves quality outcomes and patient satisfaction (1,2). In the U.S ., Spanish is the most commonly spoken language after English. Therefore, Spanish proficien cy is a valuable skill for practice. Two- thirds of U.S. medical schools surveyed in 2015 reported offering Spanish language resources, including formal curricula, to improve proficiency among their students. There is thus strong advocacy among educators to include Spanish communication in medical curricula. However, medical language courses require significant resources which include hiring fluently bilingual professi onals to teach and assess students. As with any competency, medical Spanish proficiency nee ds to be assessed throughout a course to track and improve student performance and document curricular effectiveness. Traditional language assessment is a complex pr ocess that includes the assessment of writing, listening and verbal communication skills wi th a combination of written and conversational tests which add significant burden to teaching medical Spanish during medical training. We propose the 'cool idea' tha t standardizing the assessment of medical Spanish proficiency by training students and facu lty using a video representing different levels of proficiency will enhance both the teaching and assessment of medical Spanish. Methods: We developed a standardize d set of videos to represent five different levels (1 to 5) of medical Spanish proficiency during a patient encounter, using the validated InterLanguage Roundtable (ILR) one - item scale with detailed descriptors (3). The standardized videos for each of five -levels of Spanish proficiency were based on actual student performance in medical Spanish test stations where students interviewed monolingual Spanish -speaking standardized patients (SPs) and were assessed for their medical Spanish proficiency using the ILR. We invited students who demonstrated performance typical of each level to return as ac tors and to repeat their performance (retaining the same level of proficiency) for videotaping. We shortened each video from twelve to two to three minutes to illust rate only the core elements that distinguished each level of proficiency. We then developed a detailed written guide for each proficiency level to explain the nuances of language for both listening and speaking skills, reflecting each level of proficiency. Our goal with the cool idea is to use the videos to train students of medical Spanish to e valuate their own proficiency, to anchor their expectations of improving their own medical Spanish. If their self -assessment is accurate, then the ratings can also b e used to assess course outcomes. Evaluation Plan/Results: Sixty students from one PA stud ent class will be shown the videos at entry (August 2018) and asked to rate their own ILR proficiency. Students will also be asked to rate their peers during conversations in Spanish. They will then conduct interval self -assessment of proficiency at course midpoint (March 2019) and course end (November 2019). At course midpoint all students will participate in a Spanish Objective Structured Clinical Encounter in Spani sh with a Spanish -speaking standardized patient (SP) and will be rated using the ILR. The S Ps will be trained using the same videos. The instructor will rate each student using the videos of the OSCE encounter. Score concordance between the students (self) , SP and faculty will be calculated. We will examine the utility of the videos in improving student accuracy using the faculty score as the gold standard. We will also survey students and SPs about the usefulness of the videos in guiding proficiency development. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Our resource has the potential to be shared on a public platform (eg., YouTube) for others to access. Future studies will address whether use of the videos will improve longitudinal tracking of proficiency acquisit ion in different medical Spanish courses. 83 References: 1) Flores G, Abreu M, Barone CP, Bachu r R, Lin H.

Need/Rationale: Ethical and moral issues are inseparable from the clinical practice of medicine. Pediatric residency programs frequently provide combined education on professionalism and ethics to fulfill ACGME core competency requirements. However, due to time constraints and \"curricular crowding\", residents receive limited exposure to analysis of complex ethical issues that they encounter in their daily clinical work. In order to pre pare residents for independent practice, foundational education in bioethical issues can provide tools for navigat ing future ethical dilemmas. While some may advocate role modeling or \"learning on the job\", the absence of a structured curricular foundation for ethics education places resident physicians at risk of not adequately achieving this competency. The Romanell Report suggests that ethics education is best delivered in a longitudinal manner with opportunities for active resident participation. This m anner of education will improve reasoning and decision -making skills. The current state of medical ethics educatio n in pediatric residency programs suggests that more formalized training is necessary in order to adequately prepare residents for future prac tice. Methods: Prior to initiation of the curriculum, a pre -participation survey will capture participant demographics and background experiences in ethics. The survey will also provide an opportunity to residents to share areas of interest in ethics and to demonstrate their knowledge through a modified version of the TREK -P, a validated test of resident knowledge of pediatric bioethics. The discussion groups will be adapted from topics presented in Diekema et al.'s \"American Academy of Pediatrics Bioethic s Resident Curriculum: Case -Based Teaching Guides\" in conjunction with the ACGME core competencies in ethics for p ediatrics residents. Cases adapted from this guide will be emailed to all residents prior to discussion groups. In addition, relevant AAP ethi cs position statements and articles will be provided. Presentation of cases will be held during noon conferences w ith an attending physician experienced in handling ethics cases facilitating associated discussion sessions. Sessions may take on various form ats, predominantly with small group work and opportunities for discussion which allow residents to work with and l earn from others. Pre - and post -discussion surveys will be administered as well, to assess how residents would 'lean' on various cases. Evalu ation Plan/Results: Attendance will be taken at sessions to determine how many residents participate in these sessions. Residents' baseline level of knowledge in pediatric bioethics will be captured with a pre -participation TREK -P score. Following their pa rticipation in the discussion groups, residents will take another TREK -P assessment to evaluate their competency i n navigating fundamental topics in pediatric bioethics. Topics will be developed in conjunction with the ACGME's core competencies and include areas such as consent and decision- making, professionalism, and the patient - physician relationship. Resident feed back on discussion groups will be actively solicited to evaluate the effectiveness of these sessions and to tailor the sessions to areas of re sident interest. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This curriculum will formalize the AAP's ethics curriculum in a pediatrics residency program through discussion groups and teaching sessions. Pediatric residents will gain competency in navigating ethical complexities relevant to their daily practice. References: 1) Carrese, J.A., et al.

Need/Rationale: The curriculum implemented during residency training of new family medicine physicians provides extensive opportunity to affect both immediate treatment decisions as well as the future treatment choice s of our nation's primary care doctors. The nation's health care crisis exemplifies the need to implement innovative treatment and education of our nation's new physicians in an effort to combat morbidity and mortality on an institutional scale. Family med icine residents and physicians are on the front lines of treating musculoskeletal joint p ain. Joint pain has steadily increased as our aging population increases in number and individual life expectancy's are extended. The implementation of a joint injection lecture series within a sports medicine curriculum in residency with specific training for family medicine residents in topics of joint injection for joint pain provides increased treatment options both to the patient and the physician. Methods: The study will look at the newly chartered Citrus Valley Health Partners Family Medicine Reside ncy Program located in West Covina, California. The 3 -year training program currently boasts 20 full time Family Medicine Residents with an additional 10 scheduled to begin training in 2019. The resident's outpatient Family Medicine based training occurs e xclusively at the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), East Valley Community Health Center located in West Covina, California. Utilizing the FQHC's electronic hea lth records, we have identified ICD -10 diagnosis codes utilized for common joint pathology and hope to cross reference those codes with CPT procedure codes relating to joint injections. Additionally, evaluation of a newly implemented sports medicine reside nt curriculum, including training on common joint injections, will be analyzed. Through r esident/faculty workshops and didactic education consenting participating residents have been trained in joint injection indication, procedure, and technique. Resident 's have been objectively tested via written multiple -choice examination prior to training , immediately after training, and one week post training. Treatment choice and resident knowledge is currently being analyzed and compared prior to and after resident training, correlating with both resident pre - and post -training knowledge. Evaluation Pl an/Results: Citrus Valley family medicine residents consented to being the subjects of the study and agreed to undergo additional training in joint injection indicatio n, procedure and technique. Resident, Dr. James Pearson, in conjunction with Sports Medic ine faculty, Dr. Hamed Shalikar, established the teaching joint injection curriculum. Additionally, hands on teaching was provided by Dr. Pearson and Dr. Shalikar in t he model of the AAFP's joint injection workshop provided nationally at the AAFP national conference. Resident's were objectively tested on their knowledge via a 10 question multiple choice examination before, directly after and one week after the joint inj ection lecture and hands on workshop. Pre- lecture objective results included a mean score of 25%, median score of 25% and mode of 20%. Direct post -lecture results included a mean score of 70%, median score of 65% and mode of 70%. One week post- lecture resu lts included a mean score of 66%, median score of 70% and mode of 60%. Data is currently being analyzed regarding pre- lecture ICD and CPT resident diagnosis and treatment. This pre -lecture data will then be compared to post -lecture resident diagnosis and t reatment changes with regard to the approach to musculoskeletal pathology. Potential Imp act/Lessons Learned: Innovations in resident training, including implementing joint injection curriculum for residents caring for musculoskeletal joint pathology, has the opportunity to increase physician knowledge and treatment choice today and for genera tions in the future. 87 References: 1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Need/Rationale: The discipline of clinical informatics cuts across all medical fields and specialties. As information technology plays an increasing role in delivery of patient care across all specialties, it becomes important to cultivate interest amongst future physicians. Grand Strand Health is a multi- facility health system located on the coast of South Carolina and has facilities throughout the area to provide qualit y patient care. At the center is Grand Strand Medical Center, a 369 -bed acut e care hospital. Grand Strand Medical Center launched its ACGME -accredited Transitional Year Residency in June 2016 with 12 interns. During the 2017 -2018 academic year, an elective rotation in Clinical Informatics was launched, supervised by the program di rector to increase the program's elective offerings. The goal of this rotation was to expose trainees to an important field of medicine during the PGY1 year alongside preparation for their advanced specialty residencies and their careers beyond. Methods: At the start of the 2017 -2018 academic year, a novel four- week clinical informatics curriculum was created. Core components of the curriculum included daily didactic and discussion sections with the program director paired with independent reading and rese arch time. \"Core Content for the Subspecialty of Clinical Informatics\" (JAMIA, 2009) was used by the program leadership as a blueprint for identifying topics and organizing the con tent approach. The primary textbook source for this elective course is the \"Health Care Information Systems: A Practical Approach for Health Care Management\" text. Additionally, exercises in both leadership and management are drawn from the Harvard ManageM entor Suite. At the start of each block, residents are required to choose a self-directed research area based on their clinical interest and additional primary source reading is incorporated based on the topic selection. Completion of a written scholarly p roduct is required by the end of each rotation. Evaluation Plan/Results: Transitional Year Residency offers a unique opportunity to expose individuals going into a variety of fields to a broad overview in the important field of Clinical Informatics. Durin g the 2017- 2018 academic year, 8 of the 12 Transitional Year interns (75%) c hose to complete our Clinical Informatics elective. For the 2018 -2019 academic year, 11 of the 12 Transitional Year Interns (92%) are enrolled in this rotations. (Through September 2018, a total of 12 Transitional Years Interns have completed the Clinical Informatics Elective). Future areas of residency for the residents completing the Clinical Informatics elective include: Anesthesia, Interventional Radiology, Diagnostic Radiology, Dermatology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Radiation Oncology, and Ophthalmology. All participants have provided formal feedback through end of rotation evaluations. The residents overwhelmingly agreed that this elective rotation was important to their residency experience and specialties of interest. The residents also u niversally agreed that by participating in this rotation, their knowledge base dramatically increased. An additional outcome of this rotation was the production of multiple complet ely independent research projects culminating in presentations at the local, regional, and national level; as well as in peer -reviewed publications. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Clinical informatics rotations may be successfully designed and achieved in the community -based hospital setting. Ongoing tracking of outcomes related to ultimate career pursuits of trainees who complete this rotation may be an area of further research. References: 1) Gardner RM, Overhage JM, Board of Directors.

TY program leadership is tasked wit h providing this broad- based clinical experience, as wel l as ensuring that the interns are professionally mature enough to move to the next phase of their training across a wide range of specialties. Recognizing the need for a dedicated TY curriculum and t he importance of fostering cohesion among trainees in th e program while scattered across a variety of clinical settings, we solicited feedback from our trainees and faculty members to create a novel, longitudinal curriculum termed \"TY Tuesday.\" Using liter ature and feedback, we designed our curriculum around to pics of leadership, professionalism, and the business of medicine to create a dynamic and well - received offering. Methods: Program Leadership began this didactic content in July 2017. Monthly two -hour sessions with all 12 transitional year residents were scheduled on Tuesdays. Sessions included internal program faculty as well as invited external guest speakers, in a combination of group discussion and reflection meetings. Topic examples include: lead ership style, negotiation, practice management, networking, and mentorship. A variety of materials, from both the healthcare literature and the business world, were used for these didactic sessions. The Transitional Year Residents evaluated the impact of \" TY Tuesday\" (speaker quality, professional impact, and c ontent delivery) both informally -- through verbal feedback following each session -- and through formal post- meeting surveys. The program was renewed for a second year in July 2018. Evaluation Plan/Results: All 24 Transitional Year Residents (12 per class from the 2017 and 2018 starting academic years) have provided formal feedback. The residents overwhelmingly agreed that the didactic session provided curriculum that was important to their roles within the patient care team. The residents also agreed that by participating in this course, they improved their leadership skills, addressed their personal strengths and weaknesses, and left with the ability to strongly manage clinical team conflict. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Effective leadership sk ills have been associated with better patient care, strong communication/interpersonal skills, and increased measurement on the ACGME Milestones. We believe that our curriculum could be replicated and implemented in a variety of medical training programs a nd specialties. References: 1) Jardine D, Correa R, Schultz H, et al.

Need/Rationale: Making therapeutic decisions is a critical activity among physicians. It relies on the ability of physicians to use cognitive processes and specific knowled ge in the context of clinical pharmacology. As such, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) has identified core entrustable professional activities (EPAs) as a set of vital skills and knowledge all incoming medical residents should competently demonstrate on day o ne of their residency. The American College of Clinical Pharmacology (ACCP) has further identified EPAs specific to clinical pharmacology that is essential for medical education. The proposed EPAs include: 1) basic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; 2) dosage adjustment for age and for organ impairment; 3) drug -drug interactions; 4) biologics, including vaccines; 5) adherence; 6) identifying, understanding, and interpreting drug information sources; 7) summarizing common problem dru gs; and 8) how to work within an interprofessional healthcare team. The clinical pharmacology EPAs related to basic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and identifying common \"problem drugs\" are crucial for new medical residents since recent statistics r egarding medication m isadventures account for 700,000 emergency department visits yearly and approximately 5% of hospitalized patients have documented adverse drug events. Thus, my study aims at enhancing pharmacology knowledge related to the common \"probl em drugs\" to first and second- year medical students. Methods: I developed a definition for \"problem drugs\" to include drug therapies associated with: 1) drug - drug interactions; 2) serious side effects; 3) narrow therapeutic indices; and/or 4) unusual pharmacokinetics (PK). I created a list of 15 drug therapies based on literature reviews and clinical expertise. I developed an online survey to assess students' perceptions regarding their clinical knowledge of the therapies. I will create a pre/post -test to assess students' actual clinical knowledge concerning common \"problem drug\" therapies. My \"problem drug\" list will be emphasized if the drug therapies have been incorporated into cases previously developed or inserted into modular cases with an emphasis on the problematic char acteristics. An educational program will be recommended to cover gaps in the curriculum based on the data from the students' evaluation. Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations will be used to analyze survey and pre/post -test results. All analyse s will be performed using SPSS 22.0. An alpha level of 0.05 will be used to assess statistical significance. Evaluation Plan/Results: Evaluation will be done based on students survey and knowledge evaluation by conducting pre- and post -test. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Data from my study will help us improving pharmacology teaching at CMED and preparing our students for the clerkship and residency training.

Need/Rationale: An aging population with ever increasing musculoskeletal complaints creates further demand on an already overburdened healthcare system. The primary care physician should therefore be trained to accurately code these complaints to enhance the efficiency of the syst em and the efficacy of treatment. By utilizing more specific coding practices, treatment can be streamlined and resources dedicated to provide better care, along with lowered costs. Imprecise coding practices are likely due to either inexperience w ith coding itself or misdiagnosis by the healthcare provider. By addressing the issue of imprecise coding, the physician learns the subtleties of coding, which, in turn, reflects the subtleties of diagnosis. Methods: The proposed study will be implemented at Citrus Valley Family Medicine Residency Program. Family medicine residents will present 10 one -hour lectures during their didactic lecture period. Residents will select MSK cases throughout the academic year from their continuity clinic to e xplore concepts of identification, differential diagnoses, and coding. Case presentations will be prepared in conjunction with consultation from sports medicine faculty. As part of the resident -led presentations, specific time will be slotted to discuss di agnostic skills as well as ICD -10 coding. Residents will be asked to attach the appropriate ICD -10 codes associated with each differential diagnosis. Prior to each session, residents will be provided with an article that covers pertinent MSK coding princip les. The se ssions will include pre - and post -assessment. This assessment will include the selected case diagnosis and appropriate ICD -10 codes. Evaluation Plan/Results: Evaluation of the study will have two components. The first component will be a pre- and post -lecture assessment. Assessments will measure diagnostic skills and residents' ICD -10 coding knowledge. Results will be trended over a six month period and feedback will be provided to each resident on a monthly basis. The second component wil l consist of comp iling MSK related ICD -10 codes from the continuity clinics for three months prior to the commencement of the lecture series and for 6 months following the commencement. The goal would be to identify actual changes in the practice and skills of residents' c oding with particular attention toward diversity in ICD -10 coding, changes in coding patterns, and coding specificity, as well as coding accuracy. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: More accurate diagnosis may lead to a pathology -directed treatment, produc ing better clinical outcomes. Additionally, if advanced coding practices are implemented, the affiliated institutions will likely generate greater revenues that can be later reinvested in resident education.

Need/Rationale: In Graduate Medical Education, trainees are taught to analy ze, interpret and integra te evidence in order to synthesize a clinical plan. In 2015, we designed a modular academic program which allows perennial adaptations according to subjective and objective outcomes. Our goal was to prospectively follow performance outcomes utilizing a cur riculum that can learn and adapt based on objective data. Methods: The American Urologic Association In -Service Examination (AUA ISE) is an annual exam taken by all ACGME urology residents in the US. The test is designed to provid e a performance metric regarding academic progress of individual residents as well as program wide academic performance. AUA ISE performance is correlated with pass rates on the written portion of the American Board of Urology examination. The AUA ISE prov ides 12 educational domai ns and reports program performance against national averages. This provides an assessment of individual and program -wide strengths and weaknesses. In 2015, we utilized the AUA ISE educational domains to design a 12 -month curriculum . We utilized the AUA Uni versity Core Curriculum as our foundational resource with cross -referenced, multimodal supplemental material corresponding AUA ISE educational domains. Over the ensuing 3 years, we assessed outcomes prospectively and longitudinally through ISE results and surveys. Evaluation Plan/Results: Each AUA ISE domain was assigned to monthly units and the 12 -month academic calendar was arranged in a prioritized order focusing on lowest performance topics in closest proximity to the AUA ISE. Grand rounds presentation topics and journal club discussions were focused in each monthly unit on their corresponding educational domain. Peer adjusted performance metrics were utilized to provide anonymity with regards to performance, and control fo r variance in specific domains across serial examinations. In the first year of programming (2015/2016), standardized testing improvement was demonstrated primarily in the area of prioritized units (Sexual Dysfunction, Endocrinopathy, Fertility Problems: + 17%; Trauma & Fistulae: Obstructive Uropathy, Laparoscopy, Robotic Surgery: + 9%). Decreased standardized testing performance was demonstrated in the least prioritized units (Calculous DIsease: - 16%; Urinary Diversion: - 7%). academ ic year (2016/2017), areas of prioritization did not predict performance improvements and areas of prior lower performance persisted. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The hypothesis was that modular programming that is adaptable and targets program -wide needs annually would improve I SE performance. Our study suggests that evidence based academic programming is a useful adjunct in developing curriculum, however thorough curricular review remains a cornerstone.

Need/Rationale : Proper use of developmental screening instru ments is crucial to detect developmental disorders in children, yet there is a gap between preparedness from training in Canada and the importance of child development to clinical practice (1 -3). Our needs asse ssment interviews, prior to the new curriculum , indicated that preceptors in our program did not use screens and residents often indicated identification of red flags and referral resources as the most important development personal learning objectives. Th e purpose of the novel, longitudinal, curriculum was to allow GenPeds residents to make experience -based decisions regarding screening in their future independent practice. We evaluated the curriculum's effectiveness for learning screening knowledge and skills; future evaluation will survey graduates regarding screen use compared to graduates prior to curriculum implementation. Methods: All 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year residents in the University of Alberta (GenPeds) residency program participated in the curricu lum (2016 -18, n=44). Curriculum interventions included a high volume screening practice day in 1st and 3rd year Developmental (DevPeds) rotations and interactive, case - based teaching sessions on scoring PEDS (Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status) + PEDS:DM (Developmental Milestones), managing r esults of positive developmental screens, and giving anticipatory guidance on development and behavior concerns. Teaching was given at the start of the GenPeds program and on both DevPeds rotations. Five Short Answer Question (SAQ) exams on screening and anticipatory guidance, followed by feedback, were given for formative assessment; one SAQ exam was given at 4 timepoints (at the start of 1st year immediately following teaching and again at each end -year); 4 other SAQ exams were given at start and end of D evPeds rotations (4 timepoints), for a total of 8 exam timepoints during the GenPeds program. A survey to assess resident attitude regarding screen use was given at end- year. Evaluation Plan/Results: Evaluatio n objective was to compare knowledge and skill s between curriculum residents and a control group (medical students and GenPeds residents from a different program, n=14). We used t -tests comparing resident to control mean total scores and Pearson's chi - squared test comparing percentage of passing score s. Results showed that intervention residents consistently outperformed controls. Specifically, resident scores were significantly greater than controls' in both screen scoring and managing results of positive screens, at 7 timepoints (for 1st year startin g DevPeds, there was no difference in management). Survey results revealed that the curriculum fostered resident proficiency and plan to screen in future practice. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This curric ulum package effectively increased knowledge a nd skills in GenPeds residents and could serve as a model for programs wishing to develop a screening curriculum.

Need/Rationale: Quality improvement and patient safety (QIPS) is an important component of the healthcare system and there is an increasing demand to incorporate these topics and meth ods into residency training. Furthermore, residents are vital to healthcare delivery. As frontline workers, their opinions are valuable in helping to improve clinical outcomes. The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) only requires r esidents be involved in QIPS activities, but to what extent remains elusive . Gathering the outlook of residents as to how essential they find certain QIPS activities would be a worthwhile endeavor for academic programs. Based on these viewpoints, residency programs can begin to understand how residents find quality improvement an d patient safety activities to be beneficial to their training. Methods: The Resident Perception of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (RP -QIPS) survey was developed to gather a resident's perception on how necessary certain QIPS activities were to re sidency training. The specific statement that medical residents were instructed to reflect on before responding was, \"please consider how you feel these topics are essential to your training during residency\". The survey instrument comprised of 15 question s, which were devised from the current quality improvement and patient safety curriculum delivered to internal medicine residents over the past two academic years. Moreover, the bod y of questions best exemplifies the Internal Medicine Residency Program's interpretation of the ACGME's core competencies of practice -based learning and improvement and systems -based practice. The rating scale used in the survey was a 4 -point Likert -type scale consisting of mostly not essential; somewhat not essential; somewhat e ssential; and mostly essential. The survey data was analyzed through creation of a Rasch model, which uses both mathematics and theory to measure a single latent trait. Moreover, th e hallmark of Rasch modeling is in constant evaluation of the probability of the respondent to answer a question correctly and the difficulty of the survey item. Evaluation Plan/Results: The survey was electronically distributed to 37 medical residents vi a Survey Monkey. 22 medical residents completed the survey online, translat ing to a 59.5% response rate. Using conventional Rasch modeling procedures, the item and respondent reliability indices, rating scale, and dimensionality were evaluated and readjust ed throughout the analysis. All surveyed residents found activities involvi ng practical application and/or experiential learning as being essential. These activities included understanding how to report patient safety events, participating in project -based teams, serving on hospital committees, providing solutions to patient safe ty problems, mortality review, and conducting a root cause analysis. Furthermore, as the tasks become more technical in nature, medical residents are less likely to perceive these a s essential to their training. For example, certain activities such as lear ning about the nuances of different quality methodologies would be more essential than learning how to read advanced quality tools, such as value stream maps, control charts, or Par eto charts. Most residents found constructing both a fishbone diagram and f lowchart to be more relevant to their training than the aforementioned technical tools. Overall, 35% of residents agreed that all 15 items were essential to their residency training . Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: While this pilot study represents an e arly exploration into determining essential QIPS topics and activities, subsequent surveys should be conducted to develop a standardized resource to ease medical residency programs in creating their own curriculum.

Need/Rationale: 2017 marked the first year that more women enrolled in medical school than men (1). Yet, while female representation in medical cla sses has been on the rise, women continue to be underrepresented in positions of leadership in medicine (2). We created WE WILL to provide a platform for women to support women. Through workshops and networking events we help our students cultivate skills in professionalism and connect female -identifying medical students at the University of Utah to female phys icians at our institution, providing them with invaluable mentorship and support to become the leaders of tomorrow. Methods: WE WILL was created to support female -identifying medical students. Our programs are as follows: 1) Roundtable Luncheon. During th is one -hour session students are provided with the names and specialties of physicians in attendance and can choose two with whom they wish to speak. Together with a small group of five students they can then spend twenty minutes interacting with each phys ician; 2) Mentorship Workshop. This is a hands- on one- hour session where first - and second- year students learn the 'Do's and Don'ts' of being a good mentee and work together with workshop leaders to draft and send out a letter to faculty from whom they wis h to receive mentorship. Prior to the workshop students can state what areas they wish to receive guidance in (i.e., specialties, academic medicine, research, etc.) Upon attendance they will be provided with the names of faculty who have shown interest in mentoring students in those fields; 3) Women in Medicine Workshop. This is a half -day event where female- identifying students (MSI - MSIV) can rotate through four twenty -minute stations designed to foster discussion around the unique challenges of entering medicine as a woman. The station topics are: Mentorship; Navigating Your Career; Work -Life Balance; and Self -Advocacy. Each station is run by a group of two to three female attendings or residents and thus provides students with the opportunity to network with strong female role models. Evaluation Plan/Results: Each event held by WE WILL will be evaluated by careful counting of attendance. Comments a nd recommendations for improvement will be gathered via electronic survey forms that are sent to all attend ees. Efficacy of WE WILL events will be assessed by surveying attendees to see whether or not they have developed a mentee -mentor relationship with t he residents and attendings present at WE WILL events. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Through mentorshi p, implementation of these workshops will help female- identifying medical students develop the skills and confidence needed to navigate medicine as a woman and seek roles in medical leadership.

Frush, Benjamin W., MD, MA; Aliaga, Sofia, MD, MPH; Ferris, Maria, MD, MPH, PhD; Hobbs, Richard, MD University of North Carolina School of Medicine Idea/Problem Statement : A brief, integrated assignment to promo te curricular integration, facilitate medical student reflection, and encourage professional development. Need/Rationale: In 2010, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching called for medical students to connect formal knowledge of the basic , clinical, and social sciences with experiential learning, and to \"understand patients, their experiences, and their care more holistically\".1 Thus, in additional to transmitting formal knowledge, clinical learning should expose learners to the patient perspective and experience in order to have a lasting impact on the student's professional identity. This goal can be difficult to achieve, however, especially in a busy clinical setting where opportunities for explic it student reflection and growth may be l imited. In this work, we assessed a novel assignment intended to augment a new maternal -child health integrated curriculum. The aim of the intervention was to introduce students to the neonatal intensive care unit w hile providing opportunity for explicit r eflection and facilitating the development of the student's professional identity. Methods: During a session in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), students completed a brief, two - part assignment. The first co mponent consisted of a short worksheet in core neonatal topics where students considered aspects of neonatal critical care including respiratory support and resuscitation, access and nutrition, surgical issues, and genetic syndromes. Students completed this aspect of the assignment independently and then reviewed their answers with an available resident. For the second component of the assignment, students were paired by NICU staff with a primary caregiver (usually the mother) to discuss their experience wi th pregnancy, delivery, and newborn care. We used qualitative methods to analyze a convenience sample of 166 narratives completed between fall 2016 and summer 2017. We examined Depth of Reflection using a previously -validated modified Bloom's Taxonomy, scoring reflections on a three tier scale: \" Knowledge and Comprehension\" (Level I), \"Analysis\" (Level II), and \"Synthesis and evaluation\" (Level III).2 Further, we used a constant comparison method based on grounded theory to assess the scope of prenatal and postnatal topics students elicited by the reflective writing piece. This mixed -methods approach allowed us to evaluate both quality and content of student reflection to determine how our intervention functioned. Evaluation Plan/Results: We found that 30% of student reflections achieved Level I D epth of Reflection (\"Knowledge and Comprehension\"), 35% achieved Level II (\"Analysis\"), and an additional 35% achieved Level III (\"Synthesis and Evaluation\"). Despite our students' brief experience, this level of re flection was comparable with previously r eported data for students participating in a longitudinal reflective writing experience.2 Thematic coding revealed six major themes: (1) Conception, Pregnancy, and Delivery Experiences, (2) Positive Support Structur es, (3) Barriers and Stressors to Care, ( 4) Future Plans, (5) Unexpected Complications, and (6) Student Career and Professional Considerations. The impressive diversity of themes on maternal- child considerations suggests that students were exposed to a wid e range of patient perspectives, experien ces, and values. Our analysis demonstrates that a novel, integrated, maternal- child health reflective writing assignment was successful in eliciting high quality reflection while also exposing students to core theme s of the pregnancy and peripartum experie nce. Further, our findings suggest that a reflective writing experience can be utilized as an educational tool to promote curricular integration, individualize students' learning experience, and facilitate professional identity formation. Potential Impact /Lessons Learned: With regards to medical school curriculum design, results from this study suggest that short, student -driven assignments, when strategically placed in an integrated environment, may provide enough structure to accomplish both knowledge ac quisition and meaningful reflection. 98 References: 1) Irby DM, Cooke M, O'Brien B.

Davila -Cervantes, Andrea; Fernandez, Deanna; Hodgson, Carol S.; Smyth, Penelope IDEAS Office, Faculty of Medicine a nd Dentistry, University of Alberta; Undergraduate Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, IDEAS office, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta; Division of Neurolog Idea/Problem Statement: To improve continuity across the educational continuum there has been a movement to include CanMEDS professional role in the medical school curricula Need/Rationale: The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada describes key concepts of the \"professional \" physician us ing the CanMEDS framework. The main purpose of the CanMEDS framework is to define the necessary competencies for all areas of medical practice and provide a comprehensive foundation for medical education and practice in Canada (1). To promote adequate progression across the continuing education, there has been a movement to include the CanMEDS roles in medical school curricula and to be part of re -certification and evaluation of practicing physicians. To assess this process within a medical sc hool, we exami ned one specific CanMEDS role, the \"professional,\" to determine if more than medical expert was included within the required curriculum. Our study question was when, how, and what key concepts of the \"professional\" CanMEDS role are taught to medical studen ts at the University of Alberta? Methods: A literature search was performed using keywords of professional, curriculum, teaching, CanMEDS, medical student, and medical school. No studies linked CanMEDS \"professional\" concepts to an undergraduate medical school curriculum, or explored when and how concepts were taught. We searched the medical school curriculum learning management system database for key concept keywords, reviewed objectives, teaching method, and teaching content. Two research team members (ADC and PS) individually categorized teaching content into CanMEDS \"professional\" key concepts; final categorization decisions were decided by consensus. Evaluation Plan/Results: Every key concept of the CanMEDS \"professional\" was taught in the undergraduate medical curriculum, most often during the first two pre -clerkship years; concepts were more sporadic in the final two clerkship years of the four -year program. Only 15/28 of the key concepts were taught in each of the four years. Of these , altruism was taught the least often; it was only included in the first year. Medico legal frameworks governing practice, bioethical principles and theories and social accountability were the most frequent key concepts taught in the curriculum. Key concep ts of the CanM EDS \"professional\" role are included in a medical school curriculum; however, they are most often found during the pre -clerkship years. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Review of where and when to teach CanMEDS key concepts may aid in build ing longitudin al medical student professionalism curricula, aid in professional identity formation, and frame the concept of the CanMEDS \"professional\" within the medical student before the start of residency.

Need/Rationale: Varied responsibilities are assumed during graduate medical education. A vital role is being a teacher. As residents progres s in their training, they become responsible in educating the new class of interns, medical students, patients, and patient families. Prior studies have demonstrated that residents receive little or no formal training on how to effecti vely teach. At this t ime, we have subjectively noticed that the residents generally do not provide significant teaching to medical students. Currently, the ACGME residency review committee mandates only psychiatry residents to obtain training in teaching skills; however, the L iaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) states that residents should; \"participate in teaching students\" and \"be prepared for their roles as teachers and evaluators.\" However, minimal guidance is provided on how to implement or es tablish a curriculum to train residents, providing residency programs the opportunity to be innovative. The BEST (Bringing Education and Service Together) is an interdisciplinary \"service learning\" project for resident physicians with an underlying concept to cultivate residen ts into better physicians by learning through service - to their multicultural patient populations through better communication skills, and to their learners through better teaching skills. Most important, participating residents will serve their own educa tional needs through self - description of their training, proficiency, and comfort as teachers. Methods: The BEST curriculum consists of program leadership with assistance from faculty who participate in didactics and leading workshops that are delivered t o all post -graduate levels of internal medicine residents. This longitudinal curriculum is delivered on a quarterly basis, with two -to-three hour sessions that cover a variety of themes covering the concept of the teachable moment, rol e as team leader and manager, giving constructive feedback and interactive lectures. Through a balance of didactics and workshops, these sessions provide instruction on the development of skills required of a medical educator including the five -step micros kills model of clinic al teaching; mini -interactive small group workshops were also conducted to reiterate and enhance recently acquired skills. To date, the three sessions delivered have included providing constructive feedback, teaching to different level s of learners, concep t of the teachable moment, interactive mini -lectures, and running inpatient work rounds as team leader and manager. Evaluation Plan/Results: The sessions are integrated into the residency conference curriculum as didactic workshops, given quarterly. Educa tional materials are available through the RAT skills website created by the BEST project team and paper handouts are also distributed prior to the session. Pre - and post-surveys will be conducted to provide qualitative and quantitativ e data to assess the efficacy of these sessions. In addition, program leadership intends to use the residents' training through these sessions in creating a resident -led lecture series to improve presentation and teaching skills. We also intend to anonymously survey the medica l students on their experience in addition to their evaluation of the residents. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Improving student clinical education will help students in their future roles as residents and eventually attending phy sicians. Strong teach ing will help establish our new Internal Medicine program as a desired training institution. Potential application to new residencies at a Community Hospital. 101 References: 1) Wachtel JK, Greenberg MR, Smith AB, Weaver KR, Kane BG.

Need/Rationale: As interns at a busy institution, we felt unprepared to incorporate medical student teaching into our workflow. We performed a needs assessment at our institution, and found that many interns felt similarly, with bar riers to teaching including time restraints, low confidence in teaching skills, and a limited repertoire of teaching topics when time became available to teach. In our needs assessment we surveyed interns to ask w hat topics they would like formal education on and they selected one -liners, presentations and creating a differential diagnosis. By providing an organized and practical curriculum on teaching, which incorporates specific teaching tools that can be integra ted into the busy workflow of inpatient war d rotations; we hope to increase intern confidence and satisfaction in teaching medical students. Secondarily, we hope to increase the length and frequency of medical student teaching experiences. Methods: Two interventions were incorporated into pediatri c residency scheduled noon conference lectures at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). The first intervention, which occurred in January, focused on teaching interns how to break down the components of a one -liner for medical students and how to explain the premise and components of a SOAP presentation. This primary intervention was an hour in length and included both lecture -based didactics as well as breakout sessions to reinforce learning points through role playing. The second intervention taught int erns how to provide medical students with a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis. This session occurred in April and was 30 minutes in length. Interns were surveyed in November, prior to the start of the study, in March, in between the two int erventions, and in July at the completion of the study. Data was collected on intern confidence and satisfaction in their teaching using Likert scale questions ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\" as well as additional questions focused on time spent teaching. Data was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) when comparing the sum of multiple survey questions and unpaired t-test when comparing mean of individual survey questions. P -values <0.05 were considered significant. If a significant difference was found, further analysis was done with Games -Howell test to determine where differences lied. Evaluation Plan/Results: A total of 22 pediatric interns were surveyed prior to the intervention, 19 were surveyed after the first intervention and 18 were surveyed after the final intervention. A total of 6 questions in the survey focused on intern confidence and satisfaction in their teaching. The mean of the sum of these questions was 3.37 prior to any intervention, 3.88 after the first interve ntion and 3.65 at the end of the study. Using ANOVA, we found a significant difference between the groups (p=0.012). On further analysis, the significant difference was present between the pre -intervention and pos t first intervention surveys (p= 0.008). There was no statistically significant difference present between any group and post final intervention surveys. When looking at time spent teaching, there was a statistically significant increase in the amount of t ime interns reported teaching medical stude nts (p=0.041). Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Overall, our curriculum increased intern confidence, satisfaction and time spent teaching after our primary intervention; however, the impact waned over time, indi cating there might be benefit in reinforcin g principles. To prevent this, we have developed a guidebook for interns to reference.

Need/Rationale: There has been an increase in new residency programs as a strategy to address the national and/or local physi cian shortage. This increase has been primarily at community hospital settings. Most medical faculty receives little -to-no training about how to be effective teachers, even when they assume educational leadership roles. Due to the challenge of recruiting experienced residency faculty to a community hospital, providing faculty development for basic teaching and learning skills to existing community physicians will aid in filling this deficiency. Teaching as a competency concept model using ACGME identified p hysician competencies to define critical skills for medical educators will help promote a culture of effective teaching and learning. In addition, improving the quality of relationships between faculty and residents will directly increase the efficacy of f aculty teaching and mentoring efforts. To cultivate this relationship, resident input and participation will be required. Methods: We plan to set up a dedicated faculty development series to supplement the community -based physician's knowledge, skills and attitudes toward teaching in order to guide them into incorporating teaching a nd learning strategies with residents. Conducting these sessions in an inter -specialty group setting will allow enhancement of clinical collaboration among faculty and residents . As most of the residents undergo clinical rotations on wards, the primary foc us is to ensure the hospitalist group and residents will be subjected to the faculty development sessions. Evaluation Plan/Results: The participating faculty and residents will complete a before and after session survey created utilizing the competencies framework established based on the ACGME competencies for medical educators. In addition, the residents will evaluate the faculty and the interns will evaluate the senior residents using the same survey. This will allow comparison between an individuals pe rception of their competency versus the learners perception. This will hopefully promote dialogue about improving medical educator training, development, and outco mes. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The goal is to develop exemplary faculty -resident rel ationships to promote a culture of effective teaching and learning. It will also increase attention to the quality of medical training and physician evaluation. Ma y provide faculty development framework for other new community hospital residencies.

Microaggressions are categorized into: microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations. A microass ault is usually a conscious, deliberate and explicit derogation that is meant to hurt the intended victim through name -calling, avoidant behavior, or purposeful discriminatory actions. Some examples include using racial epithets, discouraging inter -group i nteractions, being purposefully ignored by a sales clerk, and displaying symbols of hate, such as a swastika. Microinsults are subtle snubs with a hidden insulting message to the recipient that is rude, insensitive or demeaning to a person's heritage or id entity. Microinvalidations are communications that exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person from a minority group. Methods: A systemic review using PubMed, EMBase and Google Scholar on microaggr essions in the learning environment was performed utilizing a modified PRISMA outline. Evaluation Plan/Results: Of 145 microaggressions articles analyzed, 10 articles from 1998 -2015 related to the learning environment were used for this review. Topic cate gories were: minority microaggressions experience in the classroom N= 5, coping mechanisms for microaggressions N=2, difficult racial di alogues in the classroom N=3. Study designs were: focus group N=4, surveys/interviews N= 4 and consensual qualitative re search N=2. Number of subjects ranged from 8 -68 in qualitative designs and from 126 to 2323 in survey study designs. Subjects were mainly college students, but also included graduate students and academic faculty, comprising mainly African -American, Non -Hispanic whites and Latina ethnicity. All studies occurred in major American colleges. The findings showed that microaggressions were prev alent and \"invisible\" in colleges; with students of color seemingly worn down by the need to engage in ongoing strategie s in order to confront the inherent associated stresses. Difficult racial dialogues were characterized by intense emotions in both profe ssors and students that interfered with a successful learning experience. Dispositional forgiveness, high ethnic social connectedness and tolerance of uncertainty were associated with decreased anxiety, stress, and depression associated with microaggressio ns Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Microaggressions are prevalent in the learning environment and are associated with ongoing major negative impact on the learning environment. Studies on microaggressions in medical education are urgently needed. References: 1) Sue, D. W., Capodilupo, C. M., Torino, G. C., Bucceri, J. M., Holder, A., Nadal, K. L., & Esquilin, M. (2007).

Dashboards can serve as test cases. Need/Rationale: Data visualizations (DVs) are ways of representing information about organizational and human performance. Their use and tr action in medical education is a recent development that requires more careful consideration. A study on the visualiz ation of curricular data in medical education, for example, noted that use of DVs allowed \"teachers and directors to easily perceive the st ructure of the medical curriculum, define how each part coexists as part of a network of different curriculum parts a nd reason for its use and importance in the curriculum.\" (1) The literature also describes ways to represent big data in medical education (2). Consistently absent from the knowledge -base, however, were discussions of design issues that informed the development of DVs to begin with and how such challenges were addressed. We posit that DVs are important in supporting improved decision -making among various stakeholder groups within the medical education community writ large. However, data are not neutral. As such, it is equally important to consider ways in which analytics are created. We set out to document and describe the process of developin g DVs that support data -driven communication and collaboration. We place particular emphasis on how we have applied p rinciples from Cognitive Psychology, Management, and Program Evaluation throughout this venture and the ways in which this interdisciplinar y perspective supports information use and dialogue. Methods: The process of visualizing student and faculty reports involved cleaning raw data, and developing appealing visualizations of it. To prepare the data for visualization, we manipulated it with a cleaning tool named Alteryx. This program allows users to make workflows that quickly manipulate large excel files so that they may be uploaded to visualization software. The visualizations were created with the software, Tableau. This process was largely iterative and required a collaborative effort with faculty and administrative stakeholders. There was a period of trial and error that involved rounds of prototype development, testing, and collection of feedback to achieve a satisfying product. It follow ed an emergent strategy where the final outcome and goal was realized after multiple ideas and visual representations of data were considered. We finally represented quantitative ratings with interactive bar graphs, as they are effective yet concise ways t o convey data. We avoided pie charts, as stakeholder feedback indicated that both angle and area are visually difficult to interpret. We used a comprehensive, interactive dashboard report to portray our visuals. This reduced clutter and information overloa d while containing all relevant details accessible by clicking various parts of the visual. The dashboards are distri buted to the faculty and administrative stakeholders, and will continue to be revised based upon formal feedback. Evaluation Plan/Results: The dashboards will be updated in response to feedback obtained through focus groups with two types of stakeholders. Educator groups will be made up of faculty who will respond to questions about whether the information in the dashboards influences their instruction. Administrator groups will include faculty development staff, and the deans of curriculum. Guiding questions for this group will focus on how data is used to influence policy. In order to evaluate outcomes, we will track variables such as the n umber of times users access the dashboards from the server. To determine the effect dashboards have on policy, we wil l analyze minutes from curriculum meetings to see when, and in what context the dashboards are discussed; and if action items result from t heir discussion. Lastly, the support of dialogue and collaboration will be analyzed via a survey gathering reports of the frequency of communication facilitated by the dashboards across the spectrum of educators and administrators. Potential Impact/Lesson s Learned: Literature on DV indicates it leads to better data understanding and use. Broad swaths of stakeholders can benefit from and leverage carefully designed DVs to affect change. Sharing the process of developing a useful DV may open dialogue for fur ther expansion of this strategy in medical education. 106 References: 1) Vaitsis, C., Nilsson, G., & Zary, N. (2015).

Need/Rationale: Studies on post -partum care have demonstrated a gap in knowledg e on the postpartum health experience in women after the 6 or 8 week medical visit (1). Research has further indicated that weight gain during pregnancy in Latina/Latin -x women has shown to be correlated with weight gained during gestation, ethnicity, depression, anxiety, poor education on nutrition, and prenatal physical activity (2,3). Studies further state that excess weight gain during pregnancy and the failure to lose weight after giving birth is a predictor of long term weight change and increased BMI in women up to 10 years postpartum (3). Research strongly supports an integrative appro ach to postpartum healthcare that addresses wellness, well -being, nutrition, and maternal mental health at 6 -8 weeks postpartum, when maternal identity is being informe d by the adjustment experience to motherhood either as a first time mother or mother to multiple children. The psychological effects of this transition can sometimes lead to increased weight gain, depression, anxiety, decreased activity, and poor nutrition al choices (1,2,3). To address the need of more education in Latinx postpartum women, we will implement an educational and physically interactive program titled Stroll n' Roll for women who are 6 weeks postpartum. Our goal is to increase understanding, eng agement, and implementation of physical, social, and mental health wellness, as well as create supportive environments that will empower women in the community to create similar grassroot support activities. Methods: Women from the Family Care Specialists clinic ages 18 -40 will attend a 90 min group session in Fall 2018. The biopsychosocial and physically active experience will be facilitated by behavioral science faculty, a women's health coordinator, medical residents, a nutritionist, and a kinesthetic t rainer. The women will participate in on -site educational and physically active exercise s and activities. The topics will include: Physical health, nutrition, psychosocial function, family planning, physical activity, mindful parenting, and navigating comm unity resources. Session activities will include: videos, music, art, processing discuss ions, group/pair activities, mindfulness (meditation and parenting), walking with strollers. By the end of the eight week program, the participants should be able to: 1 ) Develop a plan on how to achieve mental and physical well -being and promote it in othe rs; 2) Explain how their well -being influences their approach to health; 3) Identify ways in which they can continue to create or participate in activities that nurture physical and mental well -being in their communities. Evaluation Plan/Results: Participants will complete a pre- and post -intervention self -report to assess for depression, anxiety, the relevance of the activities, and the quality of instruction. The self -report measures to be utilized are the Beck Depression Scale -II, the Beck Anxiety Scale , and the Edinburgh. BMI will also be measured at the beginning and end of the program. Participants' learning and behavior will be assessed through discussion of a sel f-developed plan pre- and post -intervention. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Recogniz ing the need for postpartum care in Latinx women, we need to create comprehensive experiences in integrative healthcare systems that educate and empower women. If succe ssful, our Stroll n' Roll program could be a comprehensive model generalizable to all patient centered medical homes. References: 1) Cheng, C., Gowles, E., Walker, L.

Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University Idea/Problem Statement: Despite the need for a representative health workforce, medical student demographics and corresponding pipeline training programs remain unchanged. Need/Rationale: A handful of previous studies examined the success of programs in attracting underrepresented college students to the health professions, yet few researchers have focused on curricular pedagogy to cultivate interest among such students during their high school years (1,2). Health Career Opportunities Reimagined (HealthCORE) offers enriched activities, clinical exposure, and longitudinal advising in a comprehensive health professional pipeline model for rising sophomores to seniors in high school. An initial two -week summer intensive program inspires students using several health disciplines, including many not covered in traditional pipeline programs such as global health, research, medical design, healthcare policy, clinic al practice, and narrative medicine. Students then transform their interests into practice through a yearlong longitudinal experience in the community, from volunteering to shadowin g physicians to research internships. Methods: All students enrolled in the first cohort of HealthCORE students (n=23) were asked via email to complete course surveys via a password -protected online form both immediately prior to and at the conclusion of the course in 2017. Both these pre -course and post -course surveys included Likert -scaled questions pertaining to: personal comprehension of the health professions, understanding of the various career paths a health professional can take, interest in pursui ng a health profession, capability of pursuing a health profe ssion, and the quality of advising system to which they felt connected. These questions were scaled from 1 (least) to 5 (most). Questions specific to the post -course survey included whether they would recommend the course to a friend (\"yes\" or \"no\") and a ranking of the students' most and least favorite health disciplines covered. Evaluation Plan/Results: Of the 23 students requested to complete both surveys, 22 students completed both surveys fo r a total of 44 survey completions (22 pre -course surveys and 22 post -course surveys). Mean trends from pre -course to post -course included an increased personal comprehension of the health professions (3.45 to 4.59), an increased understanding of the vario us career paths a health professional can take (3.18 to 4.45) , an increased interest in pursuing a health profession (4.36 to 4.59), an increased capability of pursuing a health profession (4.00 to 4.23), and an increase in the quality of advising system t o which they felt connected (3.50 to 4.14). Narrative medicin e, public and global health, and individual mentoring sessions were the most popular course days, while health policy and health administration were those days students felt needed the greatest i mprovement. 95.5% of students would recommend the course to a friend. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Following the first course iteration, underrepresented students graduated with more interest and a greater sense of capability in pursuing a health car eer serving others. The course continues to use a longitudina l, multi- disciplinary approach as it's refined with its second cohort of students. References: 1) Smith, S. G., Nsiah -Kumi, P. A., Jones, P.

Need/Rationale: MedAchieve's high school students are selected from several public schools in Manhattan, New York City with highest enrollment from the Harlem community. The students typically come from medically underserved areas and are selected based on a good standing in their educational institutions and an interest in the medical field. At the start of the 2018 -2019 program, 78% of participants reported strong interest in pursuing a career in the me dical field, but only 28% indicated that they knew how to become competitive applicants for medical school. In accordance with the Mission Statement of TouroCOM Harlem, the goals of this program are to educate these students about the various career paths in the medical field and to encourage an increase in t he number of underrepresented minorities in medicine. In addition to inspiring these students to pursue careers in the medical field, this program aims to spread real world medical knowledge that extend s beyond the high school students in order to impact their family and friends in the Harlem community. It has been shown that the rate of obesity and diabetes in this community, especially East Harlem, is much higher than other parts of Manhattan (King et al., 2015). To address these concerning health problem s, the MedAchieve curriculum is tailored to raise awareness amongst the high school students in hopes to benefit the overall community. Methods: MedAchieve is an after -school mentorship program that pa rtners high school students with first and second year medical school students from Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine -Harlem. Much like the first two years of medical education, MedAchieve is divided into two year -long sessions composed of 16 lessons e ach. For the first year, \"MedStart\" students learn fro m a curriculum that introduces the subjects in basic medical science and illustrates their relevance to clinical medicine. For the second year, \"MedExcel\" students participate in lessons reviewing organ systems and the common diseases that affects them. Fo r each session, the high school students are paired with a medical student in a one -on-one model that allows for personal guidance and instruction. In addition, mentor -mentee pairs are organized into sm all groups allowing for the sharing of even more persp ectives. Each week, the classes are broken up into an hour long interactive \"lecture\", complete with worksheets allowing for students to follow along, followed by an hour \"lab\" component which involves a hands on demonstration of the lesson. With obesity a nd diabetes as two major concerning health problems for this specific population, especially East Harlem, this program focuses part of its curriculum around teaching the detrimental effects of a poor qu ality diet and lack of exercise (King et al., 2015). E ducating the youth of the community spreads awareness of these problems to the community at large. Evaluation Plan/Results: The students' ability to understand medical and basic science concepts, and their retention of that knowledge will be assessed directly using monthly quizzes and surveys. The quizzes will be directly based on high -yield concepts taught in our classrooms following specific learning objectives. In addition to measuring their aptitude in the basic sciences/medical concepts, we are also gauging their change in interest and attitudes towards the pursuit of a career in medicine. By interpreting the results from before and after specific milestones in the program, such as the beginning and end of a semester, we can evaluate the p rogress of both academic and professional goals. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: High school students enrolled in MedAchieve are encouraged in their studies and provided with the guidance to pursue a career in th e medical field. These students contribute to their community by spreading knowledge about disease prevention and illnesses that impact daily life in these populations. 111 References: 1) King L, Hinterland K, Dragan KL, Barbot O, Bassett MT. 2015, Manhattan Community District 11: East Harlem; 2015; 11(59):1 -16. 2) Rabinowitz, Howard K. \"Recruitment, Retention, and Follow -up of Graduates of a Program to Increase the Number of Family Physicians in R ural and Underserved Areas.\" New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 328, no. 13, 1993, pp. 934 -939., doi:10.1056/nejm1993 3) Atance, Joel, et al. \"Educational Intervention in a Medically Underserved Area.\" The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, v ol. 118, no. 4, 2018, p. 219., doi:10.7556/jaoa.2018.047. 112 Friday, 2/22/2019 , 4:30 - 6:00 PM Large Friday Poster Session, Poster #041 Pre(a)ttending: Pediatric Senior Residents as the Attending in an Outpatient Teaching Clinic Gordon, Bahareh; McCoy -Wilso n, Kelsi UCLA Olive View, Department of Pediatrics Idea/Problem Statement: R3s work as pre -attendings in an outpatient clinic focusing on autonomous clinical management, teaching, and leading interdisciplinary clinic team Need/Rationale: Pediatric senio r residents have amp le opportunity to act in a supervisory role on the inpatient wards - allowing for structured skill development in autonomous decision making and team leadership with direct faculty mentorship. Few programs mirror this same development h owever in the primar y or urgent care setting despite on average at least 50% of pediatric graduating residents moving into outpatient based careers. We query that the outcome of this is likely increased anxiety of senior residents in their initial years as outpatient attendin gs as compared to their inpatient counterparts. Our aim is to improve resident comfort, confidence, and proficiency in the attending role as an outpatient provider. Our proposed curriculum will facilitate resident transition to attendin g practice by providing a novel structured supervisory role for senior pediatric residents. Methods: We conducted a needs assessment to identify the curricular gap by evaluating transition to practice literature in PubMed, APPD Shareware House, MedEd Port al as well as other education databases. This demonstrated a paucity of published literature regarding best practices for facilitating resident transition to attending. Despite little information regarding best practices, the studies published reported tha t residents both des ire and benefit from structured roles and curricula to assist in the transitional phase of training. With this knowledge, we plan to implement a structured role for R3s in our urgent care to act as \"pre\" -attendings to junior trainees wi th the support of a faculty attending. In this role R3s will monitor clinic flow, precept multiple levels of learners, interact with clinic staff, and focus on independent clinical management as well as billing. At the end of each session paired faculty wi ll provide objective feedback modeled after validated peer observation tools. Subsequently, plans for improvement will be made using the ADAPT model for feedback. Evaluation Plan/Results: We will assess learner comfort and self perceived skill level in multiple domains derived from the ACGME pediatric milestones with an anonymous pre- implementation survey. Six months following implementation we will send post -intervention surveys and assess change in response. Additionally, we plan to collect and assess de -identi fied evaluations tools over time during our structured role implementation and ascertain if residents' objectively measured skills as determined by faculty change over time. In the future we will also use our programs annual alumni survey to assess perceived strength of training in graduates who underwent the intervention and those that graduated prior to implementation. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Primary impact will be in improved ability to independently operate as an outpatient clinician and decr eased anxiety as senior residents transition to outpatient attending roles. The secondary impact will be increased direct observation, real time feedback, and mentoring from faculty attendings. References: 1) Tews , Ellin as 2) Harrell H, Wipf J, as teacher curriculum.

Senior Wellness Program at White Memorial Medical Center Millan, Carlos White Memorial Medical Center Family Medicine Residency Program Idea/Problem Statement: To explor e \u00a1Vive Bien! Senior Wellness Program impact on Latino senior's health through educational and activity driven interventions. Need/Rationale: Latino populations suffer higher rates of diabetes, obesity, undertreated and poor hypertensi on control, increased rates of activity limitation and disability (1). Participation in senior wellness programs are well known to aid in reducing health care costs and improve health outcomes of participants in these programs (2,3). However, there is very little research foc used on the impact of senior wellness programs targeted to Latino populations. The \u00a1Vive Bien! Senior Wellness Program is a free service offered to communities surrounding White Memorial Medical Center (WMMC). Participants are offered d aily courses consist ing of educational and activity centered components. Topics covered in the educational components included: Disease management and prevention, diabetes education, nutritional classes, cooking demonstrations, access to health coverage an d aid in enrollment. Activities available to participants included: knitting club, Zumba classes, whole body strengthening classes, and dance. Methods: 200 enrollees in the \u00a1Vive Bien! Senior Wellness Program will be tracked from July 2018 - Jan 2019. Part icipants will have a Pre- Health screening done at time of starting program. Post health screening will be done after 6 months of participation in the program. The health screening will be conducted by WMMC Family Medicine Residents; at the end of the scre ening participants w ill meet with a physician, walk through their results and receive recommendations. The health screening includes the following measures: Health Screening Survey; Vitals Signs (Temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate an d Pulse Oximetry); F asting Lipid Panel/Glucose level using a rapid Cholestech analysis; Body composition metrics using Omron HBF -514C (including: Weight, Body fat percentage, BMI -Skeletal muscle percentage, Resting metabolism, Viral fat and body age). Evaluation Plan/Results: Pre- and Post -health screen measures will be assessed and compared using paired sample t test analysis. Specifically, we are looking at significant changes in the patient's body composition and Fasting lipid panel. Currently we h ave recruited approx imately 60 new members and are continuing to conduct health screenings with the goal to reach 200 screenings by January 2019. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Senior wellness programs such as \u00a1Vive Bien! can be a great resource for senior community membe rs and physicians alike to help improve the health of seniors.

Need/Rationale: Tattoo removal services have an especially profound impact on certain patient population s, including former gang members, for whom tattoo removal has the potential to improve safety and increase employment opportunities (1). However, due to a paucity of literature outlining a standardize d regimen of laser tattoo removal that comprehensively c onsiders various tattoo and dermatological characteristics, such a procedure is not being optimized (2). Our project, in collaboration with the Homeboy Industries Tattoo Removal Clinic, aims to make t his procedure more accessible and effective for a vulnerable population. We will incorporate findings from an expansive literature review and data analysis to inform physicians working in the tattoo removal clinic, which will better allow them to provide evidence based and culturally competent tattoo removal ca re. Methods: A comprehensive literature review on laser tattoo removal and a retrospective study will be conducted. The literature review will look at existing pre - and post -laser tattoo removal prot ocols, factors that influence outcomes such as skin colo r; tattoo composition; comorbidities; laser types and wavelengths; and social outcomes. For this retrospective study, data from 800 Homeboy's Tattoo Removal patient charts from approximately January 2 016 through December 2017, including patient medical his tory and demographic background will be recorded using a Survey Monkey form. Subsequently, medians, modes, and t -tests will be run to compare the different demographic, medical and social factors involved in the tattoo removal process. Evaluation Plan/Res ults: Results from the retrospective study will be combined with findings from the literature review and shared with healthcare providers performing laser tattoo removal at Homeboy Industries. Variabl es such as additions and changes to pre - and post -treatm ent protocol and laser settings set according to skin color will be implemented at the Homeboy Industries tattoo removal clinic. Patient outcomes defined by scarring; hypo and hyperpigmentation; pain; discomfort; and social outcomes during and upon completion of tattoo removal will be tracked for one year following implementation of new protocols. Results will be compared with the data from January 2016 to December 2017 using means, medians, and t -tests. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Optimizing the tat too removal process can improve the physical, mental, and social outcomes of the vulnerable population included in our study.

Need/Rationale: There are clear and doc umented disparities in the screening and diagnosis of autism spectrum di sorders (ASDs) amongst children of Hispanic descent when compared to their peers of other ethnicities. Zuckerman et al. State that \"Latino children are diagnosed at a later age with AS Ds 2.5yrs later than white children and have more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis\" (1). Furthermore, only 23% of primary care clinicians reported that they routinely used a validated tool when screening for autism (2). This delay is unfortunate be cause earlier diagnosis and earlier interventions lead to improved outcomes over a broad variety of domains. Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism with an ASD specific instrument at well child visits at 18 and 24 months along with routine developmental screening. This provides us with an opportunity to improve our clinical practice and better serve our patients. The providers at our clinic, which serves a predominately Hispanic patient population, likely fall into the majority of primary care clinicians who do not adequately screen for ASDs as defined by the AAP. One well validated example of an ASD specific screening instrument is the MCHAT -RF. This is available in Spanish and is designed as a parent completed surv ey. Ideally, 100% of children aged 18 and 24 months would be screened fo r ASDs at these respective well child checks. Methods: Residents of the Family Medicine Residency Program at all levels of post -graduate training and the clinic support staff whom the y work with at the Family Health Center at Suite #230 at The White Memor ial Medical Plaza II will be the focus of my intervention. My planned intervention includes several arms: 1) Multiple didactic sessions to educate the above cohorts about the importanc e of autism screening, the impacts of early diagnosis and intervention, and the recommendations of the AAP; 2) Front office staff will be educated to include MCHAT -RF surveys in the bundle of intake paperwork given to parents of children at 18 month and 24 month well child checks during November and December. These parent comp leted surveys will be scored and uploaded onto our EMR for future reference; 3) Ideally, our EMR will be amended so that a new checkbox or field can be created to track screening in our easy to access \"Side bar\". This will facilitate clear documentation of screening status and help to identify those patients with incomplete screening statuses. Positive and negative screens will also be categorized and documented here; 4) Positive screen s will be further evaluated by the follow up portion of the MCHAT- RF. Th is is performed by a provider and will ideally take place over the phone in a conversation with the parent. A follow up appointment will be scheduled for the child if the parent has an y questions or desires additional education or counseling. Evaluation P lan/Results: The results of the intervention would be evaluated by a chart review. All well child checks during the time frame specified above will be personally reviewed by the lead i nvestigator for documentation of screening. The subjects' reaction and l earning points will be evaluated by an anonymous online survey. The effectiveness of the intervention will be judged by comparing the rate of screening in the target population during the 2 months following the intervention to the rate of screening during the two month before the intervention. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Hopefully this project will improve the early identification of children at our clinic and improve our ability to refer them quickly to specialty care to give them the best chance at improved outcomes.

Bahrainwala, Lulua; Sh alikar, Hamed Citrus Valley Health Partners Family Medicine Residency Idea/Problem Statement: POCUS use by Family Medicine residents in sport training rooms and during event coverage can decrease imaging request and improve resident confidence. Need/Rationale: Sports Ultrasound (US) has been a growing field due to increasing portability, decreasing cost, improving image quali ty, and a heightened concern for radiation risk. This, combined with the ability to rapidly help make a diagnosis, makes US ideal f or use in sports locker rooms and during sporting event coverage. Suspected injuries involving bones, joints, tendons, ligaments and nerves can all have initial scans performed within minutes. Of particular note, US is increasingly being utilized in evalua ting fractures and blunt trauma. Most sporting events are three hours in duration and obtaining any other form of imaging wou ld entail transport away from the event. Imaging methods such as an X -ray would require missing the remainder of the game, being ex posed to radiation, and long wait times in ED or Urgent Care including time to read the image. Family Medicine residents' tra ining include sports medicine and they are involved in coverage of many sports and events. Exposure to US at the sidelines, in esse nce at the point of care, in residency can promote confidence to accurately diagnose injuries, cover more events, be more def initive in return to play decisions and encourage US skills. Studies show resident confidence to identify musculoskeletal (MSK) pat hology improves with exposure to diagnoses and availability of event coverage. This can help address the recurring question r egarding the adequacy of MSK education by combining it with the growing field of POCUS. Methods: The training room ultrasound prog ram would be implemented at Citrus Valley Family Medicine Residency Program in West Covina for the period of one year. 20 Fam ily medicine residents would be involved as well as sports medicine faculty. Residents will be introduced to POCUS via online tutor ials, with access to US in the continuity clinic. Two portable US will be carried to all sporting events and training rooms i nvolving the two colleges covered by the residency program. Training room visits will be once a week and will be open to athletes f rom all sports at the college campuses. Event coverage will mainly include two contact sports: football and lacrosse. All pat ients with injuries will be evaluated without US and if imaging is needed, a POCUS scan will be performed at bedside. If this rende rs a diagnosis, a treatment plan will be put into motion, without further imaging. If not, imaging will be obtained prior to treatment. The residents' comfort with the US, event coverage, and return to play decisions will be evaluated with a questionnaire and a qualitative analysis will be completed to assess physician confidence. Evaluation Plan/Results: The study will be of o ne year duration. All injuries will be catalogued. The evaluation will consist of athletes being their own control and treatment group. For the control portion, a history and physical will be completed in standard fashion and a plan will be created which may or may not include imaging. The treatment group will consist of the athletes who have been examined and are in need of further i maging. The group will then have an US scan completed. At the end of the US scan, it will be determined whether to still proc eed with requesting further imaging or not. The number of athletes being considered for further imaging will be compared prior to U S use and after US use. Statistical analysis will be performed to elucidate differences between the groups. Other outcomes me asured will be how often US is employed and number of resident scans. Resident confidence with US and event coverage will be measur ed using a Likert scale from 1 -5 before and after the program. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The authors envision incorp oration of POCUS on the sidelines and at events among residents which may lead to greater interest and confidence in sports medicin e. Also, the study aims to improve athletes' care with more rapid diagnoses and decrease healthcare cost by limiting imaging and ED visits. 118 References: 1) Finnoff JT, Hall MM, Adams E, et al.

Need/Rationale: Despite optimization within high volume outpatient clinics, the wait between the time a patient is roomed and when the doctor arrives is, at times, unintentionally lengthy. Both wa it times and idle-anxiety can then lead to patient dissatisfaction and compromise th e physician -patient relationship. In an effort to improve the quality of clinical encounters, there is a need to examine the unnecessary stress and anxiety of potentially l ong clinic wait times. Zakay et al. (1989) suggested that music can psychologically change the internal clock of time as it relates waiting and attention span. A study by Cook et al. (2005) deemed music as simple and cost effective interventions to reduce anxiety levels of short waiting periods in outpatient clinical settings. Similar fin dings were concluded in hospitalized patients Evans et al. (2002). While the actual roomed -wait time is multifactorial (physician workflow vs patient problem list/complexit y factors), we hypothesize that the subjective perception of how long a patient waits and levels of anxiety can be reduced through non -vocal classical -genre music therapy. Methods: Study design: initial -survey then intervention (music). The study focuses on roomed patients in an outpatient clinic that is associated with a large integrate d health delivery system - Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center. Over the course of two weeks, one family medicine attending physician will have patients surveyed about their clinic experience. The first part of the survey being the STAI -6 (Modifie d Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory); the second being questions related to perceived wait times. Objective patient wait times will also be obtained; defined as the duration of time between when the nurse exits from a roomed patient and when the ph ysician enters. On a sticky note outside the patient's doorway, the current time will be recorded twice: first by the nurse upon exit (TIME ROOMED) and second by the physician upon entrance (TIME ENTERED). At the conclusion of the encounter and before exiting the room, the physician then offers the survey to be filled out by the patient. Finally the nurse returns into the room with any follow up patient instructions and mean while attaches the doorway sticky note (with the two times) to the completed survey. Over the next two weeks, the intervention will now feature rooms with the classical radio station (91.5 kUSC) at a volume of 40 decibels that is phone app checked (normal conversation ~60dB). Accordingly, the protocol of obtained wait times via sticky note and physician's survey offer will remain the same. Evaluation Plan/Results: The first part of the survey is the STAI -6 (Marteau et al. 1992) of six items, each ranked from 1- 4. Indicate how you feel now, at this moment: 1. I feel calm 2. I feel tense 3. I feel upset 4. I am relaxed 5. I am content 6. I am worried. Evaluation of scores: reverse the score of the positive items (calm, relaxed, content), then sum up scores an d multiply by (20/6). A \"normal\" score is less than 36. The second part of the surve y regards time perception. 1. How long (in minutes) do you think you waited between: after the nurse left the room and when the doctor entered? 2. To what extent did you enjoy waiting for the doctor to arrive? (Scale of 1 -10) 3. How annoyed were you by bei ng kept waiting? (Scale of 1 -10). Subjective survey data will reveal patient idle anxiety and perceived wait times in comparison to intervention (music). Objective wait tim es are calculated by: TIME ENTERED -TIME ROOMED=actual wait time duration. All data w ill be analyzed via ANOVA for statistical differences. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: To safeguard physician -patient relationship via the improved patient satisfaction of clinic wait times and idle anxiety levels through music therapy.

White Memorial Medical Center Family Medicine Residency Program Idea/Problem Statement: Reduce 30 -day hospital readmission rate among patients admitted to the family medicine service at Adventist He alth White Memorial. Need/Rationale: According to research conducted by Dexur.com in 2017, 25% of Los Angeles County hospital patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge. The 25% readmission rate surpasses the average 20% readmission rate in the state of California. I saw this discrepancy in readm ission rates play out during my family medicine residency in an LA County hospital. Patients are frequently readmitted to the hospital even after receiving instruction and medical advice at the ti me of discharge. I conducted a scholarly project in to stand ardize and improve the discharge process using a teach back method. Methods: Over a three -month period, Adventist Health White Memorial Family Medicine residents conducted a teach back process wi th patients discharged from the family medicine service to r educe 30- day hospital readmission rates. The teach back process involved having residents explain a patient's primary diagnosis, medication adjustments, and hospital follow- up plans with their pri mary care physician and specialists. The patient or primary caretaker would then be asked to teach back the information they heard from the resident to evaluate their understanding of discharge information. If the patient or primary caretaker was unable to provide satisfactory answers during the teach back process, the patient or their primary caretaker would receive further clarifications about discharge instructions. Patients or their primary caretakers would also receive a phone call after their visit to reiterate the elements of the discharge plan. The phone cal ls also served to assess how patients were feeling post -discharge and evaluated medication adherence. This process attempted to help patients better understand follow -up plans with their primary care physician or specialists. Three attempts were made to co ntact patients by telephone after they were discharged. The first attempt was made within 24 -48hrs, the 2nd attempt was made within 72 hours and the final attempt took place 96 hours after dischar ge. Evaluation Plan/Results: Preliminary analysis shows tha t over a three -month period a total of 309 patients were discharged from the family medicine service at Adventist Health White Memorial. Out of the 309 patients, 43 were readmitted within 30 -days resulting in an average 30 -day readmission rate of 14%. Duri ng month one, 14% (15/108) of patients were readmitted. In month two, 9% (10/109) of patients were readmitted. On the third month, 19% (18/92) of patients were readmitted. The teach back process w as successfully completed in 72% (224/309) of patients disch arged. Of the 224 patients who underwent the teach back process, 60% (135/224) of patients or their primary caregivers were not able to satisfactorily complete the teach back process at discharge. Of the 135 patients who met the criteria to receive a phone call after discharge, 74% (100/135) were successfully contacted by phone. Of the 43 patients who were readmitted, 80% (34/43) underwent the teach back process. 69% (23/34) of patients who were re admitted and underwent the teach back process did not satisf actorily complete the teach back process during their hospital discharge. 90% (20/23) of patients who did not satisfactorily complete the teach back process and were readmitted within 30 -days were successfully reached by phone after they were discharged. C ontinued analysis of patient characteristics is currently underway to analyze patient demographics to assess risk factors for increased readmission rates over the three - month period. Potential I mpact/Lessons Learned: Addressing and reducing hospital read missions has the potential of reducing morbidity, mortality and health care expenses.

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago Idea/Problem Statement: We postulated that online pre - and post -rotation tests will improve the learning experience for pathology residents rotating in pediatric pathology. Need/Rationale: ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) has provided guidance for residency and fellowship programs by defining 6 core competencies that must be met in order to successfully complete a particular rotation: Patient Care (PC), Medical Knowledge (MK), Practice -Based Learning and Improvement (PBLI), Interpersonal and Communication Skills (ICS), Professionalism (PROF) and Systems -Based Practice (SBP). In 2015, outcomes -based milestones were introduced as a framework for determining resident and fe llow performance within the six ACGME core competencies. In pathology, one proposed milestone within the MK core competency is \"diagnostic knowledge\", which refers to the trainee's capability to assimilate medical information related to macroscopic and mic roscopic appearance of diverse disease entities, leading to the ability to establish a correct diagnosis. For this particular milestone, one suggested evaluation method is represented by examinations/quizzes. Methods: All pathologist s in our department cr eated a 300 multiple- choice question bank, covering diseases of ten organ systems (bone, CNS, endocrine glands, gastro -intestinal system (GI), genito - urinary system (GU), heart, liver, lung, skin and soft tissue). Five quizzes were th en created randomly: two used as pre -rotation tests and three as post - rotation tests. 38 residents (PGY II and PGY III, rotating for either 1 or 2 months) participated in the study; the tests were paper -based for the first 32 residents (group 1) and were administered using an online platform for the last 6 (group 2). The web -based testing platform provides instant results and is able to calculate the percentage of questions answered correctly overall, as well as for individual organ -system. Based on pre -test results, areas of w eakness (organ- systems with scores lower than the overall score) were identified for each of group 2 residents and targeted interventions (unknown slide conferences or didactic lectures covering the recognized weak areas) were introdu ced during their rotat ion. The improvement between the post - and pre- rotation scores (overall and also for individual organ -systems, particularly those acted upon) were compared for group 2 trainees. Evaluation Plan/Results: All residents (both group 1 an d group 2) showed improvement in their medical knowledge as highlighted by the increase in the average score from 58% (ranging from 38% to 82%) on the pre- rotation test to 74% (ranging from 50% to 91.7%) on the post -rotation test (p=0.02). No significant d ifference in the overa ll knowledge gain was found between group 1 and group 2 residents (17% vs. 15%, p=0.5). For the same resident, we observed uneven levels of improvement in different organ- systems. However, a constant trend was noted for group 2 reside nts: each of the 6 tra inee in this cohort answered correctly a significantly higher percentage of questions within the organ -systems acted upon, compared with their overall score (34% vs. 15%, p=0.05). The most common targeted organ systems were bone, GI, soft tissue and cardia c. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The online testing platform allows us to identify domains in which the trainee still needs improvement and thus to provide targeted feedback to strengthen his/her knowledge in those specific areas . It also helps us rec ognize subjects where we can enhance our teaching activities.

Need/Rationale: Although we promote medication safety for pain and substance use disorders (SUD), we struggle to implement the CDC guidelines for use of opioids in chronic nonmali gnant pain. Unfortunately, overdose deaths involving prescription opioids were fiv e times higher in 2016 than in 1999 (1) and about 50% of people with severe mental health disorder also have a SUD (2). Given the multiple demands and serious social determinants of health for patients in a safety net family medicine residency clinic such as ours, it is difficult to adequately assess, diagnosis, and treat patients with concomitant chronic nonmalignant pain and SUD. We aim to help increase the medical knowledge and comfort of family medicine residency faculty and residents in assessment and treatment of patients with chronic nonmalignant pain. Our clinic now has a SUD team that includes a licensed clinical social worker, medical case worker and substance abuse c ounselor on site. By helping providers identify at risk as well as those with SUD, we can increase our department's Screening, Behavioral Intervention, and Referral to Therapy (SBIRT) skills and referral to this valuable resource. Methods: From October 2018 to October 2019 we will conduct pre and post survey of patients, faculty, and r esidents. The faculty and resident survey will consist of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) attitudinal survey (3). After performing the patient and provider pre -surve y, we will present the revised chronic nonmalignant pain treatment algorithm that includes the new onsite SUD services at our residency in addition to the new Department of Health Services clinical guidelines in November 2018. Additional faculty training a nd reminders to use the revised pain algorithm and SUD resources when precepting w ill occur throughout the year. Electronic and pockets versions of the algorithm will be available to all providers. During this time we plan on creating a registry consisting of patients age 18 years of age and older that have received opiates for greater than 90 days in the past year. By creating the chronic nonmalignant pain patient registry, we'll better identify patients that maybe at risk of opioid use disorder and/or ove rdose. With a revised provider evaluation of undifferentiated pain, we'll use char t review to evaluate if there is an increased use of mental health and/or SUD resources. Evaluation Plan/Results: All providers (faculty and residents) will complete the Know Pain 50 survey. The new VHA survey will be sent to faculty and residents until 1 00% completion is reached. After the didactic for the revised chronic nonmalignant pain treatment algorithm we will monitor the number of referral to mental health and/or SUD services via chart review. We will re -administer the VHA attitudinal survey in Ju ne 2019 to graduating residents and all other providers in October 2019. Identified patients will be survey pre and post intervention. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: By providing additional tools, structure and resources to the diagnosis, evaluation, a nd treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain, our physicians will have increased comfort in treating and referring identified patients with chronic nonmalignant pain and ulti mately less opioid related deaths.

Design Thinking provides a solution. Need/Rationale: Burnout is a significant concern in medicine and medical education. UME and GME programs must contend with burnout in increasing numbers and research has shown that burnout rates are significant ly higher in medical education than in the general population. Various approaches to address burnout have evolved but UME and GME programs continue to grapple with how to provide consistent and effective support while students and residents continue to str uggle. Practical and effective approaches to address burnout are needed in medical education. This need is impacted by a culture of silence that often exists within medicine that makes it difficult to openly discuss personal struggles and feelings about bu rnout or other mental health conditions. Silence may cause those in difficulty to feel more alone and more isolated, leading to a fa\u00e7ade of positivity. This fa\u00e7ade can further isolate those most in need and heighten feelings of failure and doubt. Medicine often contends with failure in the abstract but remains uncomfortable with discussions about actual failures. Reducing stigma around personal struggle requires conversations and listening. When students, residents, faculty, and staff are able to openly discuss and hear stories about these and other struggles an environment of support develops in which to address burnout and wellbeing. Methods: Addressing burnout req uires a shared understanding of the problem, from multiple perspectives, engaging key stakeholders, building consensus, and designing and implementing a plan. This plan must give voice to the people who contend with burnout and understand the potential for stereotype threats. Design Thinking provides such an approach using a solution -based perspective and methodology to solve complex problems by understanding the human needs that are involved, reframing the problem in human -centric ways, ideating in brainst orming sessions, and adopting a hands- on approach in prototyping and testing. This \"Cool Ide a\" features ideation and collaboration within a brainstorming session to clarify the culture, needs, and experiences within medical school and GME programs. Ideatio n begins with a review of selected narratives from students and residents contending with burnout to seek new angles in addressing burnout in UME and GME programs. Evaluation Plan/Results: Design Thinking has five stages, though they are not always sequen tial. These stages include empathy, defining the problem, ideation, prototyping, and testing . Stage 1: To gain an empathic understanding of the problem among key stakeholders (across multiple systems) such as students/residents, faculty and staff Stage 2: To collaboratively define burnout Stage 3: To ideate within a dedicated environment in order to seek every angle (possible examples include brainstorming, challenging assumptions, and inverted brainstorming the worst possible idea Stage 4: To design a few inexpensive interventions (prototypes) for burnout within an experimental phase Stage 5: To use the best solutions identified during prototyping to test the intervention Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Medical Education must contend with burnout in incr easing numbers and research shows that burnout rates are higher in medical education than in the general population. Design Thinking provides a framework to design effective interventions for burnout across UME campuses and GME programs.

Need/Rationale: As the United States healthcare system continues to change, leaders in medical education have identified new skills physicians must demonstrate to successfully practice. Among these skills are interdisciplinary teamwork, financial knowledge, quality improve ment, an understanding of information technology, and a systems -based approach. While the healt hcare system expects new skills from physicians, undergraduate medical curriculums are just beginning to modify formal educational offerings to address these are as. As the medical education system is slow to adapt, only 40 -50% of medical students report \"a ppropriate\" training in the practice of medicine upon graduation. In response to these perceived gaps in medical education, students at Sidney Kimmel Medical Col lege (SKMC) founded Physician Executive Leadership (PEL). PEL is a student -run extracurricular program that provides medical students with a platform to build healthcare knowledge and cultivate leadership skills. Methods: The PEL curriculum is centered ar ound six pillars: Health Finance, Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Law & Ethics, Applied Leadersh ip, Care Quality & Experience, and Health Policy. Throughout the year, students earn credit towards the curriculum by attending lectures on topics related to the se pillars given by leaders and innovators who are invited by PEL's Executive Team. Students al so earn credit by taking an active role in their education by writing about a topic of their interest for the PEL student- run journal, The Diagnostic, leading a small -group session about an area of their own expertise, or completing a summer internship in healthcare innovation. A key component of the PEL organization is the use of feedback forms following every lecture and small group. The forms assess the impact of programing by surveying participants on their satisfaction with the activity and their persp ective on the importance of PEL's pillars. Additionally, a multiple -choice assessment is administered to provide an objective measure of what students learned. U sing the results, the PEL Executive Team is able to dynamically adjust programming to meet the interest of students participating in the PEL curriculum. Subjective questions on feedback forms were assessed by the percent of participants indicating they were \"satisfied\" or \"strongly satisfied\" (Likert scores of 4 and 5) or percent who \"agreed\" or \"st rongly agreed\" (A or SA) with statements regarding aspects of PEL (Likert scores of 4 and 5). Evaluation Plan/Results: During the 2017 -2018 academic year, 176 s tudents attended at least one activity organized by PEL. Overall, 11 events were hosted: one Health Finance, two Entrepreneurship & Innovation, two Law & Ethics, two Applied Leadership, two Care Quality & Experience, and two Health Policy. The majority of students (81%) were either \"satisfied\" or \"strongly satisfied\" with the curriculum. By the end of the year, students A or SA that their understanding of Entrepreneurship & Leadership (76%), Care Quality & Experience (71%), and Health Finance (70%) increase d the most as a result of participation in PEL. Of the six pillars, students A or SA that their interest increased the most in Entrepreneurship & Leadership (65%), Care Quality & Experience (61%), and Health Finance (59%). An overwhelming majority of students A or SA that exposure to all six pillars of PEL will benefit them in the future as a physic ian. Specifically, Entrepreneurship & Leadership (93%), Health Finance (91%), Applied Leadership (90%), and Care Quality & Experience (90%), Health Policy (89%), and Law & Ethics (86%). Furthermore, the majority of PEL students A or SA that each of the six pillars should be integrated into medical education for all students: Care Quality & Experience (86%), Law & Ethics (85%), Health Finance (85%), Health Policy ( 84%), Applied Leadership (75%), Entrepreneurship & Leadership (74%). Of the students not gradua ting, 99% indicated they planned to continue attending PEL events the following year. 128 Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: As a student -run, student -driven curriculum, PEL delivers programming that meets the interests of participants. Feedback forms provide the PEL Executive Team with prompt data regarding understanding of topics. Student -run programming can be used as a tool to address gaps in medical education.

[1]; Neuroscience and Human Behavior; [2] WLA VA Center of Excellence in Primary Care Education; [3] UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Idea/Problem Statement: Healthcare trainees caring for vulnerable patients are at risk for burnout; it can be difficult to retain these trainees in such clinical settings. Need/Rationale: Veterans who are experiencing homelessness have complex needs that can drain the emotional resources of clinicians. For instance, these patients suffer from disproportionately high rates of medical and psychiatric illness, and they may lack the infrastructure necessary to follow through with clinical recommendations and arrive on time to app ointments. Clinicians caring for vulnerable patients are at risk for burnout. To address this, we developed a longitudinal intervention to reduce burnout and improve well -being among healthcare trainees. Methods: We first administered a needs assessment t o the clinic's 14 trainees from nursing, psychology, pharmacy, psychiatry, and internal medicine. We measured baseline resilience, stress, burnout, and mindfulness. We held a kick -off interactive workshop in stress and coping with a national well -being expert. Next, we created a toolkit consisting of fourteen tools - half focused on personal well -being, and half focused on team well -being. We developed graphics illustrating these tools and displayed them in the clinic. We also created a \"well -being room\" as a space for trainee reflection. Evaluation Plan/Resu lts: Our needs assessment found areas for improvement across all domains measured. The mean trainee score on the Connor -Davidson Resilience Scale was 29.4 out of 40, which is lower than community sample of US adults. The mean score on the Cohen Perceived S tress Scale was 14.4 out of 40, which is higher than community sample of US adults. The mean depersonalization score on the Maslach Burnout Inventory was 3.7 out of 15 points. We measured two components of mindfulness: the mean score for \"observing\" was 26 .6 out of 40, and the mean score for \"non -reactivity to inner experience\" was 24 out of 35. We measured these domains again in trainees one year after the start of the well -being program. This data is pending. Trainees at our center also ranked the tools b ased on three scales: importance (how important is the tool to maintain well -being?); readiness (how ready am I to use the tool to maintain well -being?); and confidence (how confident am I in my ability to use the tool to maintain well -being?). Mean \"Importance\" rankings at our clinic ranged from 7.83 for a \"mindfulness\" tool to 9.82 for a \"patient -centered goal\" tool. Mean \"Readiness\" rankings ranged from 6.6 for a \"ladder of inference\" tool to 8.73 for the \"patient tool. \"Confidence\" r ankings ranged from 6.42 for the \"mindfulness\" tool to 8.36 for the \"patient -centered goal\" tool. We found that overall, trainees felt that team- based tools are more important than individual tools. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The results of our nee ds assessment demonstrated an opportunity to improve trainee well -being, especially levels of stress and resilience. We also found that trainees feel that well -being tools are important, particularly te am-based well -being tools. We hope that this program can improve retention.

Self -forgiveness is more challenging because forgiving the self involves acknowledging oneself as the offender. People feel guilt and shame when assessing their transgressions, causing more stress. This negative self -evaluation is strongly supported by the 'inner critic' or judge. Self -condemnation impairs wellness; physicians' inability to forgive errors indicate need for self -forgiveness skills to improve well -being. High levels of self -compassion and self -esteem have been shown to correlate with suppressed inflammatory activation in response to psychosocial stress. Research has shown that forgiving others and events improves relationships and self -esteem, reduces anxiety/depression and stress, lowers blood pressure, and improves cardiovascular health and immune function Methods: A one- hour self -forgiveness workshop was developed. The 18 -item Heartland Forgiveness (HFS) which measures forgiveness for others, self an d situation was completed pre - and post - intervention. The workshop timeline included: 1) HFS completion (7.5 minutes); 2) Lecture on self - forgiveness based on the Internal Family Systems (IFS) and inner critic model (10 minutes); 3) group discussions on se lf-forgiveness concepts (10 minutes); 4) guided audio meditation on self -forgiveness (15 minutes); 5) group discussions on utility of IFS meditation (10 minutes); 6) HFS completion (7.5 minutes). Evaluation Plan/Results: Eighteen OBGYN residents attended the workshop a s part of a residents' wellness program. The pre -intervention discussions revealed that OBGYN residents carried guilt from 1) The Shame Blame culture (Residents feel that they are blamed for many things and feel helpless in defending themselves); 2) Competing events for time; 3) Professional -personal life balance; 4) Individual professional responsibility (anxiety about graduating and having individual final responsibility for patients since as a resident, responsibility is shared with attendi ng); 5)Silence ( difficult to talk about issues). Interventions currently in -use include mindfulness and headspace. After the audio meditation, reflections on the utility of IFS meditation included 1) finding time (we cannot find time because we have not g iven priority to our feelings, our wellness and our mind); 2) Developing competence; 3) Focused events (Better if one has a specific event in mind, better to use after \"bad\" occurrence, Could help after sentinel events or medical errors); 4) Protected time to acknowledg e and become aware of their own emotions and communicate with oneself; 5) Challenging to focus since mind wanders during meditation. Training was discussed. The residents all concluded that faculty, trainees and patients could benefit from th e brief audio self-forgiveness meditation. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: A brief guided audio meditation intervention with focused discussions can improve awareness about self -forgiveness and tendency to forgive. This can be incorporated in wellness p rograms and ha s implications for both short term and long -term health outcomes. References: 1) Toussaint, L. L., Owen, A. D., & Cheadle, A. (2012).

While changes have been implemented, the work environment during residency is still extremely challenging as physicians work long hours, care for critically ill patients, and make substantial personal sacrifices. Multiple national studies have highlighted these challenges, with physician burnout remaining higher than other professionals in the United States. Recently, the focus has shifted from burnout prevention to physician wellness and resilience; this has been recognized by the ACGME with the inclusion of resident wellness in the most recent c ommon program requirements. The goal of the Grand Strand Transitional Year Residency leadership is to create a happier and satisfied trainee cohort that will cultivate strong mental and physical skills which will help throughout the challenges of residency and future practice. Methods: After a background literature review, the program coordinator and program director developed a dedicated session during resident orientation focused on the concept of Ikigai. Each resident was provided with a worksheet that asked them to assess four key questions about particular domains of their life which guide their everyday activities: 1) What do I love?; 2) What am I good at?; 3) What can I be paid for?; 4) What does the world need? After a dedicated time for introspecti on, a didactic session on \"Ikigai\" - the Japanese philosophy on \"reason for being\" - was reviewed and the residents were asked to identify how this concept could be used to shape their vision and goals for the upcoming year of the transitional year residency program. A reading with additional information on Ikigai was also provided. A formal anonymous survey of resident responses and attitudes using a Likert scale was completed by each participant to gauge their experience with the session. D ata were compil ed and basic statistical analysis was performed. Evaluation Plan/Results: All 12 Transitional Year Residents who participated in this exercise have provided formal feedback. 83% (10/12) of residents were unfamiliar with the concept of ikiga i prior to the orientation session. The residents overwhelmingly agreed that the \"Ikigai\" exercise provided a skill -set that was important to the personal and professional development. The residents agreed that by participating in this workshop, their skil ls in resilienc y and self- reflection increased and they would be able to respond accordingly the next time they experience burnout. 100% of residents agreed that the \"Ikigai\" exercise conveyed the program places a high value on self -reflection. 91% (11/12) of residents stated that the \"Ikigai\" exercise was an activity that they planned to voluntarily return to over time. The residents agreed that by participating the worksheet provided, they were able to identify the relevant parameters (passion, mission, p rofession, and vocation) that are ultimately required to identify the state of \"Ikigai\" found at the confluence of these domains. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: While further exposure and implementation will be needed, we believe that education with tr ainees regarding \"Ikigai\" leads to the development of strong mental and physical skills that will help trainees throughout residency and into clinical practice.

Keck School of Medicine of USC, Department of Medical Education Idea/Problem Statement: Transition to residency is a challenge. A flexible elective was dev eloped to help 4th- year medical students make a positive transition. Need/Rationale: All health professionals must transition from being a student to the next phase of provider or advanced trainee. These transitions are stressful as the new professional m ust navigate a \"discontinuity\" or a \"dynamic process in which the individual moves from one set of circumstances to another\" (1). Successful navigation into res idency training can result in satisfaction and successful socialization into the new setting, wh ereas a poor transition can contribute to burnout (2). Colbert -Getz (2016) identified three main factors that affect this navigation: 1) personal characteristic s; 2) task readiness; and 3) contextual factors. One way to tackle this issue is through better preparation for the transition to residency, the focus of this project. A flexible elective (2 or 4 weeks) was piloted to help leaners develop skills needed to flourish in residency through work on the \"personal characteristics\" element of successful trans itions. Methods: Learners in this pilot were 43 4th -year medical students. Learner objectives were to be better able to: 1) Assess own character strengths, min dset, grit, and self- compassion, and utilize these tools in residency; 2) Apply key learning pri nciples in teaching self and others; 3) Apply core habits/skills of effective professionals (e.g., be proactive; seek first to understand, then be understood) i n leading self and others; 4) Develop a plan to enhance effectiveness as a resident through appl ication of course concepts. Weekly activities included: a) reading an assigned book (3); b) writing a 2 -page reflection to include interaction with the content and a SMART plan for utilizing new knowledge; c) attending a 90 - minute online synchronous semina r to discuss the book and engage in application activities. Learner assessments were based upon book reflections, and on students' completion of their Journey T oward Self-Discovery Logs, which consisted of reflections on: 1) results of self -assessment tool s; 2) a curated set of TED Hour podcasts/talks on character strength topics; 3) stories of how they applied these concepts in their work or life; 4) their plan for future use of these concepts in residency. Diverse in -class teaching/learning techniques wer e used, including a jigsaw exercise, peer feedback using a rubric; learner presentations, and small group exercises. Make -up assignments were completed for all missed sessions. The course was credit/no -credit. Evaluation Plan/Results: The course was evalu ated using a standard course evaluation. Impact is assessed in two ways: 1) a review of the 49 application stories submitted as a course assignment and 2) a follow up survey to be administered in October 2018 to gather data on perceived usefulness of cours e concepts, ways learners have utilized the concepts, and barriers faced in applying the concepts within their new settings. Overall, students gave the cours e a 4.82 out of 5 rating (SD = .47). The instructor rated each story as part of student feedback us ing a rubric. Collation of results indicated that most student were able to immediately apply the concepts: 17/49 (34.7%) were great stories (written about self, how used a course concept when things were not easy, shared an insight about self) and 27/49 (55.1%) were very good stories (written about self, intentional use of a course concept during that week ); while only 5/49 (10.3%) were not yet a story (othe r discussion of key concepts). Most frequently cited for application were concepts from Steven Cove y's Seven Habits, growth mindset, self -compassion, resilience, grit, vulnerability and mindfulness. We also intend to conduct descriptive analyses of data being collected from a follow up survey to better understand the relative utility of each concept onc e students have begun residency training. Results of this mixed methods follow -up study will be integrated into the conference presentation or poster. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This pilot addresses \"personal characteristics,\" a key element to success during transition while also providing flexible training during residency interview months. Study 134 results offer indication of the course's potential to f acilitate the transition out of \"school\" to the next career phase. References: 1) Teunissen PW, Weste rman M.

However, few resources exist to structure continuous learning in clinical contexts. This workshop will provide participants with an opportunity to practice an evidence- based, metacognitive approach to learning that will enable their students to continue learning across the care er-span. Rationale: While medical students, residents, and physicians have access to substantial informational resources, these lear ners often lack structured processes for making sense of this information and integrating it into their practice. This work shop will provide a simple, interactive, and engaging approach that can be propagated in multiple learning environments. Learner Out come Objectives: By the end of this session, participants will be able to: 1. Articulate the features of adaptive expertise an d metacognition, such that they can explain and teach these features to their learners 2. Structure learning experiences in ways that promote adaptive expertise, such that their learners are able to continue developing their own cognitive, metacognitive, and social competencies 3. Teach their learners to use the challenge -based learning cycle to help structure their ongoing self- direct ed learning activities, such that learners are able to use CBLCs to guide their own learning Intended Participants: This session is intended for participants who routinely work with medical students and residents in clinical contexts. Instructional Met hods: Introduction (10 mins) Modeling the Challenge (20 mins) DIY Challenge Cycle (15 mins) Small Group Discussion (15 mins) Share out and Discussions (30 mins) Take home tools: Challenge- Based Learning Cycle Template 136 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 8:00 - 9:30 AM Conference Workshop Gaming for the Win in Medical Education Dakroub, of Internal Medicine/Pediatrics; [2] Wayne State University Department of Internal Medicine Workshop Description: Our workshop focuses on the concept of gaming as a novel approach in medical education (for me dical students and residents). We will introduce the concept of gaming (what makes a successful learning game, how to im plement one, and how to facilitate an effective gaming learning climate) and discuss assessments. We will spend the bulk of our workshop in small groups developing learning games with respect to participants' unique home learning environments. We will end with a group debriefing. Rationale: Gaming in medical education is being recognized as an increasingly powerful tool for curriculum delivery as it provides a fun, competitive, active method of delivering curriculum to medical students and residents. When designed and implemented effectively, gaming can improve resident/student morale, foster healthy teamwork and competition, and provide a fun and engaging venue to promote scholarship. We developed and have successfully implemented a year -long competitive g aming curriculum in Internal Medicine for medical residents, the \"Cohort Cup.\" This has become a mainstay in education at our institutio n and we have seen the amazing effect gaming, when designed and implemented appropriately, has on education, morale, and engagement in both the graduate and undergraduate medical domains. We will briefly share our results and provide an opportunity for edu cators to come together and develop their own learning games. Learner Outcome Objectives: 1. To recognize the benefits and limitations of gaming as a curriculum delivery tool; 2. To understand important components when creating a learning game and to plan at least 1 learning game to be implemented in the learner's home environment; 3. To understand ba rriers to implementation of learning games, and successfully navigate them. Intended Participants: Any educator who is responsible for curricular delivery and wou ld like to learn skills to facilitate active, engaging, and positively competitive gaming learning environments , including program directors and chief residents. Clerkship directors may also w ish to attend. Methods: Large group presentation (Method: digi tal slides); small group); Group debrief (Method: large group discussion, digital real- time display) Activity Timeline: Introduction [15 minutes] Presentation discussing current liter ature on gaming and adult learning theory highlighting known benefits of active learning and gaming. Brief presentation of our gaming intervention which comprises over 10 different learning ga mes and over 30 gaming sessions among third and fourth year medical students and medical residents. Our results demonstrate significantly improved attendance at conferences, improved resident and student satisfaction, and higher perceptions of educational value of education sessions after implementation of regular gaming. Break- out Groups [60 minutes] Small groups will discuss their learning environments and each member will create the learning game of their choice. Templates for game development will be p rovided and creativity encouraged). We will circulate the room a nd provide guidance/feedback and suggestions to help new gamers navigate barriers. Debrief [15 minutes] We will share experiences developing games and facilitate a large group discussion and discuss the future of gaming in Med Ed. 137 Take home Tools: A guide for developing a game that can be implemented at the learner's home institution; Templates for different game development; Gaming in medical education rule list and specific techniques /approaches that can be used to facilitate a fun, safe, and effe ctive gaming learning climate; Gaming in Medical Education reference list. 138 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 8:00 - 9:30 AM Curricular Exemplars It Takes a Village: Empowering Parents, Partners and Friends to Prevent Medical for Supportive Relationships; University of Arizona, Tucson - College of Medicine; University of Nevada - Las Vegas School of Medicine; Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnip iac University; USF Health Morsani College of Medicine; USF Heal Description of Curriculum: Medical students are at high risk for burnout. Although support from family and partners is a p owerful protective factor, medical schools rarely help these support givers stay connected to students. We report initial results from 5 schools implementing an innovative program, called \"My MD -to-Be\", which sends support givers regular updates about comm on experiences and challenges in the lives of medical students, to help strengthen their connection with support givers and reduce student burnout. Need/Rationale: Medical students are at high risk for burnout, loneliness, depression and suicide, with a 2016 JAMA meta- analysis estimating the prevalence of depression or d epressive symptoms at 27.2% and the prevalence of suicidal ideation at 11.1%. Although support from family, friends and partners is critical for the well -being of medical students, these su pport givers often feel alienated by the complex process of medical training, finding themselves unable to support students effectively. Medical training programs rarely offer resources to help support givers stay meaningfully connected to their students, despite the enormous protective value that these relationships conf er on medical students. We discuss the experience of multiple medical schools with an innovative approach to helping support givers stay connected with medical students, by understanding st udents' daily lives and activities, in order to strengthen the soci al support available to medical students and reduce rates of burnout. Methods: Five medical schools implemented an innovative program for improving student wellness, by helping families, partners and faculty advisers offer stronger support to students thr ough greater awareness of the daily realities of being a medical student. The program, called \"My MD -to-Be\", allows students to identify support givers of their choice (typically parents, partners, and friends). Support givers who join the program receive regular and timely emails with educational resources about common experiences in the lives of medical students, tailored to each individual school and class. In addition, some sc hools provide these resources to academic advising staff, to heighten staff aw areness of the student experience. Educational resources are sent every 1 -2 weeks, and include topics like Starting Anatomy Labs, Imposter Syndrome, Being Asked for Medical Advic e, Studying Biochemistry, Student Interest Groups, Studying for Step 1, Starti ng the Surgical Clerkship, Applying for Residency, and many more. Resources provide only generic information about medical curriculum and common student experiences, and do not include any information that is specific to an individual student. Each resourc e provides an overview of the experience, typical student reactions to this experience (physical, emotional, intellectual, social and/or spiritual), specific recommendations for ways to support the student with this experience, and resources for learning m ore about this experience. Evaluation Plan/Results: For program assessment, we collect survey information from all stakeholders (students, support givers, and faculty advisors) about their REACTION, LEARNING, BEHAVIOR and overall IMPACT. Assessments inclu de: REACTION: utilization rates (subscribing to the program, reading the educational resources) and ratings of program helpfulness. LEARNING: Improvement in the understanding of medical student experience. BEHAVIOR: support strategies used by support giver s and academic advisers. IMPACT: student self -reported social support, burnout, and well being. At the time of submission (fall 2018), the program is just being launched and data collection is starting. It is already clear that students are enthusiastic ab out the program: student registration rates are around 70%, with each student inviting 2- 3 support givers on average. Multiple support givers have already gone out of their way t o express their gratitude and appreciation for the program (e.g., \"These email s, with interesting and relevant info and really spot- on tips about how to engage with our daughter, are wonderful. Instead of having to labor to understand her med school experi ence, we can understand it, and in a way which respects her adulthood and prof essionalism. THANK YOU!!!!\"). By the time of presentation at IME 2019, 139 the program will have been running for more than 6 months, and we will have collected rich preliminary data, as described above. 140 Saturday, 2/23/2020 , 8:00 - 9:30 AM Curricular Exempla rs Implementing a Spiritual Care Curriculum into a Pediatric Residency Program Stevens, Paige; White, Travus Children's Hospital Los Angeles Description of Curriculum: This curriculum is designed to teach physicians how to incorporate spirituality into their assessment of a patient's biopsychosocial needs. The curriculum consists of three interactive sessions designed to teach the following: first, the import ance of spiritual care in medicine, second, the use of an evidence -based method for taking a spiritual history, and third, the utilization of interdisciplinary spiritual care resources to provide spiritual care for patients and their families. Need/Ration ale: An important aspect of caring for the biopsychosocial needs of patients is addressing their spirituality, and it has been shown that the majority of patients would welcome their physician's inquiry regarding their spiritual needs. Moreover, many physi cians feel that faith plays an important role in healing. Despite this, large review studies hav e shown that physicians infrequently address the spiritual needs of their patients. One of the largest barriers that physicians report when asked about why spirituality is infrequently addressed is lack of training as to how to approach this topic with their patients. The ACGME emphasizes training physicians to address the biopsychosocial aspects of a patient's health through competency -directed curricula that ad dress interpersonal communication skills. However, few curricula have been developed to teach ph ysicians how to incorporate spiritual care into their practice and few spiritual care curricula exist amongst residency training programs. Methods: A needs ass essment survey was sent to pediatric residents during the 2017 -2018 academic year to assess atti tudes and practices involving spiritual care in medicine. A three -part, longitudinal and iterative curriculum was designed to address these identified needs and was implemented during the 2017- 2018 academic year. Session one was a sixty -minute conference t hat provided an introduction to the importance of spiritual care in medicine and involved discussion of the basic tenets of five common world religions at a lar ge, urban, academic children's hospital. Session two was a twenty -minute case - based role- play activity that taught residents how to take a spiritual history through use of an evidence - based spiritual assessment tool \u2014the HOPE model. Session three was a sixt y-minute case -based discussion panel comprised of physicians, nurses, chaplains, and social work ers, emphasizing the interdisciplinary approach to spiritual care. A follow -up survey was distributed at the end of the curricular intervention. Surveys were anonymously coded to be able to assess changes in residents' knowledge of spiritual care, attitude s regarding its importance in medicine, and residents' ability to implement spiritual care into their clinical practice. Surveys were analyzed based on q ualitative data provided on a likert scale of 1 to 5 (strongly disagree to strongly agree) and were ass essed for statistically significant trends using the one- tailed paired- T test with a p- value of 0.05. Evaluation Plan/Results: A total of 60 needs asses sment surveys and 42 post -curriculum intervention surveys were collected. Comparing unique identifiers from pre and post surveys, a total of 23 participants were noted to have completed both surveys. Results were then analyzed using a one -tailed paired t -test with a p- value of 0.05. After the intervention, residents felt more strongly that addressing spiritual/religious beliefs with patients is a necessary component of a complete history (p=0.043) and felt more competent addressing spirituality/religion wit h patients and families (p=0.017). In addition, residents expressed increased interest in learning more about how to address spirituality/religion with their patients (p=0.029). Residents also felt that their comprehension of hospital -wide spiritual care r esources increased after the intervention (p&lt;0.001), moreover, more residents reported utilization of institutional spiritual care resources (43.5% vs 73.9%, p=0.008). Residents continued to report that lack of time was the most significant barrier to t heir incorporation of spiritual care in their practice (95.6% post - intervention); however, fewer residents felt that little understanding of how spiritual care affects patients was a barrier to their practice of spiritual care (34.8% vs 8.7%, p=0.011 via t wo-tailed paired t -test). Of all residents who completed the post -intervention survey, 92.9% either agreed or strongly agreed that this intervention added value to their residency education. 141 Saturday, 2/23/2021 , 8:00 - 9:30 AM Curricular Exemplars Inno vations Beyond the Competencies: Career Planning, University Health System; [2] University of California Riverside Description of Curriculum: We will share our successes and lessons learned as we implemented an Inter-professional Career -Finance -Leadership course. The program was developed in collaboration with a local business school and trained a cohort of resident physicians and pharmacists. It covers career management skills, basic financial literacy, and leadership c oncepts. This session will provide an overview of our curriculum and framework of the Career -Finance -Leadership course. Need/Ratio nale: An effective physician leader must possess a wide range of competencies beyond the clinical skills taught in medical sc hool and residency training. Often essential, non -clinical career skills are overlooked and not incorporated into the traditional e ducational curricula. Neglected areas frequently include career strategy, financial literacy, and leadership skills. A multif aceted Career -Finance - Leadership course was developed to address these deficiencies in the curriculum. Methods: The program was in itially developed nine years ago in our Anesthesiology Department. In 2017, in conjunction with a local business school, we e xpanded the program to include residents from other specialties including Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Neur osurgery, and Pharmacy. The course consisted of four two -hour sessions which included topics related to business management, leadership, and career planning. The four sessions were presented by faculty members and invited guest speakers. Throughout the cou rse, residents were given assignments related to curriculum vitae development, networking strategies, and interview skills. I n addition, participating programs were encouraged to hold specialty specific sessions for additional support. Residents who attended 75% of the sessions received a certificate of completion issued jointly by the business school and our institution. Evalu ation Plan/Results: At the conclusion of the 2017 -18 program, we had six training programs participate in the course and issued 17 certificates to those who met the attendance requirement. A survey was completed at the conclusion of the course and included a variation on the net promoter score and 90% of participants said they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \"I would reco mmend this course to my peers\". Other deliverables included each participant adding a minimum of five new things to their CV, with one resident adding 25 new items to their CV. Based on the feedback and perceived needs by the different programs, the institution approved a budget for the following academic year to support the program. 142 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 9:45 - 11:15 AM Oral P resentations of Innovations, Instructional Methods Barts X Medicine: Educating and Empowering Medical Students by Introducing Them to Digital Health Earl, Thomas; Ahmed, Shafi; Kreindler, Jack; Virani, Vishaal. Barts and The London School of Medicine, Queen Mary, University of London Idea/Problem Statement: Global Medical School syllabi have not reflected the import ance of introducing future generations to digital health and exponential technologies. Need/Rationale: Advances in Digital Health are al lowing for continuous changes in the landscape of clinical practice and medical education: 1) Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Apps, VR/AR, wearable technologies are all integrated across the scope of healthcare; allowing healthcare systems to function more efficiently, patients to become more informed consumers and undergraduate/postgraduate trainees to have more effect ive training; 2) It is necessary for all medical school syllabi to match this ongoing paradigm shift. A clear understanding of the scope of digital health and healthcare entrepreneurship is a skillset that will benefit all healthcare professionals and stud ents. Barts X Medicine is the first digital health course embedded into a medical school curriculum. The course aims to introduce medical students to advances in digital health, allow them to reflect on the benefits and limitations of current advances, and kindle an entrepreneurial spirit as they develop as clinicians. Methods: The 2018 Barts X Medicine course was given to 3rd year medical students at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. The course extended over 12 weeks, broken into thre e phases. Phase 1: Introduction to Digital Health and entrepreneurship, 1.5 days of lectures given by leaders in Digital Health from the NHS and private sector including Prof Shafi Ahmed (CMO Medical Realities), Dr. Daniel Kraft (Founder Exponential Medici ne) and Dr. Jack Kreindler (CHHP); Phase 2: Mentorship and Development of a novel idea, student selected groups are given 12 weeks and a mentor to research and develop a novel idea to improve clinical practice or education. The students were asked to devel op a presentation for their proposal with assistance from Maxine Birmingham (CEO Thinkingaroundcorners); Phase 3: Group presentations, st udent groups were asked to present their idea to a Dragon's Den panel including Prof Shafi Ahmed, Dr Jack Kreindler, Dr Asif Qasim (Founder MedShr), Esther O'Sullivan (BMJ technology). The winning idea was given a 3 month sponsorship by BMJ to develop thei r idea. Qualitative data was taken by questionnaire and student interview. A pre - course questionnaire was taken assessi ng whether students had attended courses in healthcare innovation and their previous experience developing and presenting business plans. Post- course questionnaire assessed whether digital health and entrepreneurship was considered an important addition to the undergraduate curriculum. Evaluation Plan/Results: Group demographics as follows: (n.11) students had previously attended courses in innovation and t echnology in the UK: - Doctorpreuners - Attended 2 events focusing on AI in medicine. - Royal Society of Medicine Inn ovation Day 2018. AI in Healthcare. 71.4% (n.40) strongly agreed whilst 28.6% (n.16) agreed that the Barts X medicine course improved their understanding of role of Digital Health in modern clinical practice and medical education. 71.4% (n.40) strongly agr eed whilst 14.3% (n.8) agreed that Barts X Medicine is an important addition to the 3rd year curriculum at Barts and The London Medical Sch ool. 14.3% (n.8) disagreed that Barts X Medicine is an important addition to the 3rd year curriculum. The following statements were made: \"very engaging lectures and inspiring speakers,\" \"helpful advice future careers,\" \"very informative and motivat ional,\" \"I like the broad overview. Really good to have many perspectives of innovation and tech in healthcare,\" \"I f eel like this program should be introduced in the 1st/2nd year. Start making students aware of technology in healthcare,\" \"I feel like many of the students still think quite traditionally and this sort of thinking should start early on to stimulate out tho ughts.\" 143 Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Barts X Medicine is the first digital health course to be embedded into a medical school curricu lum. Proliferation of similar courses will create a new wave of clinicians with a clear understanding of the role of Digital Health and entrepreneurship in clinical practice and medical education.

Brigham and Women's Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Idea/Problem Statement: The op timal model for curricula that foster interactive learning and applied clinical reasoning in graduate medical education (GME) is not known. Need/Rationale: The \"flipped classroom\" is a pedagogical model in which classroom and self -study time are reversed, such that students prepare for class by reading and/or watching pre -recorded content, and class time is devoted to applying the new knowledge. Proposed b enefits of this model include improved self-directed learning skills, more efficient use of student- teacher interactions, and increased learner engagement and retention (1). Only a few small studies exist regarding implementing flipped classroom curricula in the graduate medical education (GME) context and there is a paucity of data regarding flipped class room feasibility in GME and its impact on resident clinical practice (2,3). We conducted a study to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectivene ss of a flipped classroom strategy in teaching outpatient diabetes management to internal medicine res idents, focusing on pharmacotherapy of type 2 diabetes. Methods: Our flipped classroom intervention consisted of five concept videos on several classes o f diabetes medications followed by class -time used for small -group case- based discussions. The interve ntion was delivered to second- year residents during the 2017 -2018 academic year. Residents took an online knowledge test and survey assessing comfort leve l with management of type 2 diabetes prior to the flipped classroom intervention and repeated this sur vey immediately after and 6 month after the intervention. On the immediate post -intervention survey they were also asked about their opinion of the flipped classroom and on the 6 -month post -test if they had considered or actually prescribed any new diabetes medications for their patients. The internal medicine residency's PGY3 cohort of residents served as the control group. They received a 60 -minute tradit ional didactic lecture on type 2 diabetes pharmacotherapy in the 2016 -2017 academic year. We used a mi xed effect model with a random intercept for comparison of knowledge test scores in the intervention group over time and to examine changes in self- report ed comfort with medication selection and prescribing over time. We used a two - sided t- test to compare scores on the delayed recall post -test between the intervention and control groups. We also conducted a semi -structured group interview to better understa nd resident experiences with the intervention and used an inductive thematic analysis using emergent c oding to identify themes. Evaluation Plan/Results: Most (89.7%) residents preferred this format to a traditional lecture. Twenty - four residents completed the pre- test and at least one post -test (response rate 55.8%). Participants' rated comfort in prescribing the newer antidiabetic agents increased from a mean of 2.29 on a 5 -point scale before the intervention, to 4.04 immediately after the intervention (m ean increase 1.7, 95% CI 0.44 - 1.40, p<0.001) and remained higher at 3.1 six months after the in tervention (mean increase 0.91 from baseline, 95% CI 1.97- 2.61, p=0.001). In the intervention group, the mean score on the pretest was 5.25 out of 10 (95% CI 4.6 8-5.81), 8.00 (95% CI 7.45 -8.55) on the immediate post- test, and 7.10 (95% CI 6.54- 7.65) on the 6-month post -test. There was no significant difference between mean scores of the intervention group on the 6 -month post -test compared to the control group who had mean scores of 7.10 (95% CI 6.54 -7.65) and 7.4 (95% CI 6.69 -7.57) out of 10, respectively ( p=0.19). At 6 months after the intervention, 11 of the 14 respondents (78.6%) had considered prescribing a medication from the drug classes discussed at this ses sion and 8/14 (57%) had started one of these medications. Three key themes emerged from the sem i-structured interview: preference for interactive, case -based learning over traditional lecture- based didactics; concerns regarding motivation and time for watc hing online videos outside of scheduled sessions; and interest in involving real, resident -generated cases. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Residents expressed satisfaction with the flipped classroom curricular model, and showed changes in learning and reported behavior. However, its feasibility may be 145 limited by the preparatory time required given the unique time constraints in GME and merits further study. References: 1) Chen F, Lui AM, Martinelli SM.

Need/Rationale: The goal of the Keck Online Learning Initiative (KOLI) is to supplement the learning of first- and second- year medical students through memorization aid programs (MAPs). MAPs are study tools which utilize pri nciples of spaced repetition and active retrieval practice to enhance learning and retention. MAPs, created by second -year medical students in KOLI, are based on lectures and laboratories from the first -year curriculum. Recent literature suggests that acti ve retrieval practice (e.g. flashcards) improves examination performance (1). In 2015 , Deng et al. demonstrated an association between completing 1700 unique flashcards and gaining an additional point on Step 1 (2). Research on institutional MAP developmen t is minimal, with the exception of a study from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine on a flashcard database (3). Now in our third year, KOLI aims to evaluate the satisfaction and efficacy of yearly revisions of MAPs, explore lessons learned, a nd chart future directions. Methods: Descriptive and exploratory analyses were condu cted on data collected from KSOM administration, Memorang, post- exam surveys, and focus groups. KSOM's class of 2020 and 2021's de - identified class administrative data pro vided gender, undergraduate GPA, MCAT score, and FMS1, FMS2, FMS3, GI/Liver, Neurosciences, and Reproduction block exam scores. Memorang user data included number of facts studied, accuracy, and daily usage. Power users were defined as students who completed over 2,000 facts, while control users were those who completed 0 facts. Power and control users were matched using the 'LizzyM' score, defined as [uGPA*10 + old MCAT], and associated with exam scores using non- parametric testing. Post- exam survey data c ollected information regarding study methods and MAPs usage within and across blocks. Students reported usage rates and exam satisfaction via a 5 -point Likert scale. Focus group data was obtained from a total of eight students who participated in one of th ree focus groups. The participants included those who used KOLI frequently, chose to use other MAPs rather than KOLI, or never used MAPs. Each focus group lasted about one hour, during which time students were asked to offer responses to 12 questions. The questions targeted the subjects of how they studied as undergraduates, how their stud y habits changed to adapt to medical school, what study methods they used, and what were the strengths and weaknesses of KOLI as a study resource. Evaluation Plan/Results : There was a positive correlation between LizzyM score and FMS2, FMS3, and 0.340, respectively; p<0.01 for all exams) for the class of 2020. When comparing exam scores between power users and control users with a matching variable of a LizzyM score of \u00b1 1, average FMS2 (86.6% vs. 84.3%) exam scores were not significantly different. Preliminary survey results showed that the class of 2020 consistently used the same study method across different curriculum blocks. The primary study methods acros s blocks were as follows: attending live p < 0.01). In regards to KOLI specifically, results showed a positive correlation of KOLI usage across the different blocks (r[FMS2xFMS3]=0.597, p<0.01; r[FMS3xGI]=0.595, p< 0.01). Consistency of KOLI use as a study resource was assessed with the number of Me morang facts studied (r[FMS2xFMS3]=0.766, p<0.01; r[FMS3xGI]=0.665, p< 0.01). Use of other MAPs was also consistent across blocks (r[FMS2xFMS3]=0.817, p<0.01; r[FMS3xGI]=0 .667, p<0.01). Analysis of the class of 2021's Memorang, 147 survey, and focus group data is in progress. Cumulative analysis across multiple classes and the effects of yearly improvements of KOLI is also in progress. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: First y ear medical students maintain consistent study methods across blocks. Early introduction of curriculum -based, student- generated study sets allows students to build better and long- lasting study habits. Finally, incorporating student feedback enables the ev olution of KOLI as a learning tool. References: R, Ebersbach R, Schiller M, Hege I, Holzer M, Fischer MR.

Need/Rationale: The interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms is an essential skill for adult primary care physicians. A study in 2009 of internal medicine residents at the beginning of their training demonstrated low overall proficiency and little confidence in in terpreting ECGs (1). In our progra m, residents have difficulties with the ECG interpretation. A previous study used Educational Technology to improve the ECG interpretation of Acute MI (2). We believe that using the Gerlach Ely model of instructional desig n to develop specific goals and objectives, multimedia constructed to achieve the objectives, and a flipped classroom will produce improvement in resident ECG interpretation confidence and performance. Methods: The ECG curriculum will focus on the 40 inte rnal medicine and 18 family medici ne residents at our program. The course will consist of an initial and final survey, pretest, eight multimedia presentations, eight classroom sessions and a post -test. The multimedia module presentations that outline the s teps necessary to interpret a 12 l ead ECG will be viewed before the noon conference each week over the 8- week course. These modules will be constructed using the Gerlach and Ely model of instructional design with attention to specific step -wise objectives and careful selection of media. The residents will view the modules before the classroom activity. The classroom activity will consist of interpreting actual 12 lead ECGs. A quiz will start the session to review the declarative knowledge covered in the mod ule. The resident will independent ly interpret ECGs chosen to illustrate the concepts in the module. The residents will then discuss their findings in a group. This format of the flipped classroom will provide the time needed for the residents to have supe rvised practice and feedback using actual ECGs. Evaluation Plan/Results: The confidence and proficiency of each resident will occur before and after the ECG curriculum. A survey will be used to record the confidence level of each resident. A test of 25 ECGs will determine the proficiency of the resident's ECG interpretation skills. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The demonstration of the effectiveness of using an Educational Technology model, objective driven multimedia presentations, and a flipped clas sroom applied to resident training in complex skills such as ECG interpretation can inform instructional design for other graduate medical training needs.

Need/Rationale: ECG interpretation is fundamental to the ACGME internal medicine and cardiology curriculum. This creates a need for a dynamic, digitally delivered ECG curriculum that can associate ECG proficiency with level of training. Spaced -education is a system of repeated and interactive educational encounters used for quality improvement and clinical teaching. We have utilized a mobile device application to deliver ECG curriculum in an adaptive fashion with dynamic user feedback uti lizing spaced- education theory Methods: Mobile device interface which delivers ECG content in an adaptive spaced -education format was created. Enrolled trainees participate via mobile device app and/or email. ECG content is focused on arrhythmia interpretation and management. Baseline ECG interpretation competency is performed utilizing an assessment tool. Users receive real -time feedback regarding correct or inc orrect answers with an explanation. Subsequent content delivered to the user is based upon the learner's prior correct/incorrect answers. Content is adaptive such that incorrectly answered questions are driven to the learner in a spaced -educational format. Concepts in ECG interpretation that pose difficulty to the learner are identified and appropriate content designed to improve knowledge gaps is delivered to the learner. ECG tracings have been tagged with identifiers reflecting level of difficulty. This d ata set allows for ECG interpretation ability to be correlated with level of medical training. Evaluation Plan/Results: Total sample was 348 participants with assessed learners including: medical students (n = 92, 26%), medical residents/fellows (n = 190, 55%), and attending physicians (n = 66, 19%). Medical students were correct on first attempt 2 3%, correct on second attempt 53%, and failed third attempt 24% of the time. Medical residents/fellows were correct on first attempt 47%, correct on second attem pt 36%, and failed third attempt 17% of the time. Attending physicians were correct on first attempt 74%, correct on second attempt 18%, and failed third attempt 8% of the time. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The following generalizations could be made from our data: 1) All participants improved ECG proficiency by 30% using spaced -based mobile digital platform; 2) Greatest improvement in proficiency was inversely related to level of training; 3) Initial proficiency was indep endent of level of training.

In this hands -on workshop, faculty with experience incorporating GBL into Academic Half -Days will lead participants through a variety of games designed to transform their classrooms. Examples will include Food Wars to teach healthy nutrition, Minute to Win It and Family Feud as tools to build differential diagnoses, and Escape Room to enhance procedural simulation. Rationale: Game -based learning (GBL) has been successfully utilized in health professions education to promote knowledge acquisition and retention (Nevin, Boeker), im prove surgical simulation (Kerfoot), and reduce central line assoc iated bloodstream infections (Orwoll). GBL is widely accepted by millennial learners who favor GBL over traditional lectures (Nevin, Boeker). Additionally, GBL promotes teamwork and can be an effective way to teach difficult concepts such as health care sy stems (Vithanage) and quality improvement methodologies (Orwoll). Learner O utcome Objectives: Faculty presenters will share their 3 -year experiences incorporating GBL into Academic Half -Day teaching sessions. Audience members will leave this workshop with a Game - Based Learning toolkit which they can take back to their home institutions and impleme nt rapidly into their curricula. Small -group activities have been designed to promote the use o f widely available and free resources to facilitate incorporation. Specific objectives for participants include: 1. to learn the benefits and pitfalls of GBL in me dical education; 2. to understand how GBL fits into the larger curriculum; 3. to gain knowledge of commonly used games in order to select the game best suited to teach the desired material; 4. to learn how to run an effective GBL session. Intended P articipants: This workshop is targeted at medical educators of all levels. While the faculty presenters' backgrounds are in Internal Medicine, the interactive gaming activities have been designed to be applied broadly to learners of varying levels (medical students, residents, other health professionals) and specialties. Methods and Activity timeline: The 90 -minute workshop will consist of a brief introduction and overview of GBL in medical education employing Kahoot!(5 minutes), followed by a series of four intera ctive game -based activities in which participants will be divided into small groups. Each game will take approximately 15 minutes to perform, and will include instructions, demonstration in the small groups, and large group debrief to review evidence, application, and pitfalls of the game. The 4 activities will consist of: (1) Food Wars to demonstra te nutrition education; (2) Family Feud to teach clinical reasoning; (3) Escape Room to instill best practices for invasive procedures; (4) Headbanz to enhance clinical examination. Other games will be introduced into these scenarios. The session will e nd with a 5- minute wrap -up session highlighting Poll Everywhere. Take H ome Tools: Participants will leave with a resource booklet outlining the steps necessar y to implement each of the demonstrated games into their curricula. For each game, there will b e suggested learner pre -work, materials for faculty to prepare in advance or to bring to the session, best practices and pitfalls to avoid, and links to the gaming tools utilized in the workshop. 152 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 9:45 - 11:15 AM Conference Workshop Battling Bias: Understand How Implicit Bias Affects Us and How You Can Combat It Collins, Jolene; Koehn, Kristin Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of Missouri Workshop Description : Through the use of fast paced activities this session will tea ch participants the science behind implicit bias and the role it plays in current society, the medical decision making process, and patient health outcomes. We will explore our own bias and how it affects our work everyday. At the end the session, you will learn techniques to teach and combat bias. Rationale: As we live and work in an increasingly diverse world , we face new challenges to the practice of medicine and to ensuring our patients have full and healthy lives. Studies have identified the biologic causes of health disparities between patients, as well as how socioeconomic status and social determinants of health affect patients. In 2003 the Institute of Medicine noted that \"bias, stereotyping, prejudice, and clinical uncertainty on the part of health care providers may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health care.\" Since then research has d emonstrated that despite their training and explicit beliefs, healthcare providers possess the same level of unconscious bias as the general population. The unconscious bias affects both actual and hypothetical patient care. There have been published studies that link poor health outcomes including mortality rates and patient adherence to stigmatized groups based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientatio n, age, English proficiency, and BMI. Fortunately , implicit bias can be mitigated. Various institutions hav e demonstrated that through awareness strategies, control strategies and/or perspective taking strategies individuals may be able to reframe their internal heuristics to provide more equitable care. Learner Outcome Objectives: By the end if this session, participants will be able to 1. Discuss implicit bias and the role it plays in healthcare. 2. Assess how implicit bias impact their own practice 3. Utilize techniques to help themselves and others combat implicit bias Intended Participants: All audiences, esp ecially medical professionals and educators.

Need/Rationale: A cricothyroidotomy is an emergent procedure done to establish an airway in a patient who would otherwise be unable to breathe (1). It is a procedure that requires precision and appropriate training as it is only done in emergent situations. However, residents are often unable to receive en ough training on live patients in these situations as more senior physicians take priority in performing the procedure (2). Nearly half of all Emergency Medicine residents will never see a cricothyrotomy during training, and less than one quarter will perf orm one (1). Th erefore, residents must resort to using simulation models to receive the appropriate training. These simulation models, however, can often be unrealistic or too expensive (2). Therefore, it is imperative to look for new models that can provi de a more reali stic experience simulation experience and decrease the cost of medical education. A new model, the Bleeding Cric has been developed by Dr. Alisa Wray and is relatively inexpensive and simple to produce. This study explores this new cricothyr oidotomy traini ng model to determine if it improves the user's comfort and success in performing cricothyroidotomies. Methods: This study was a randomized control study with participants randomized to one of two cricothyroidotomy teaching models, either B leeding Cric or the current standard, SIM man. At each station, participants were taught how to perform a cricothyroidotomy on their respective model by the same instructor. Participants were then tested by performing a cricothyroidotomy on a pig trachea, the gold standard for teaching cricothyroidotomies. Pre - and post -surveys were administered to each participant. The study endpoints were the completion of the final cricothyroidotomy by all participants on the pig model. The primary outcomes were particip ants' comfort levels as measured by the visual analog scale and participants success in performing the cricothyroidotomy on the pig model as measured by the objective structured assessment of technical skills for cricothyroidotomy. Comfort levels were asse ssed by pre- and post -intervention surveys which asked about comfort levels in performing a cricothyroidotomy via visual analog scales. Pre -surveys also included questions regarding the number of cricothyroidotomy simulations performed as well as the numbe r of real cricothyroidotomies performed. Post- surveys also asked participants to rate via visual analog scale the realism of the pig trachea, bleeding Cric, and SIM man. Outcomes were assessed prior to teaching, during the pig trachea test, and after study completion. Evaluation Plan/Results: This study will use previously validated tools to measure comfort (visual analog scale) and performance (objective structured assessment of technical skills for cricothyroidotomy). Individual scores were assigned usin g the validated Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) checklist (3). The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) is made up of a series of elements scoring a participant's level of operative performance and the vis ual analog scal e is a 100mm line with two endpoints ranging from 'not at all' to 'extremely'. Data were collected, tabulated, and coded by a research assistant not involved in any teaching aspects of the study. Means and standard deviations were calculated for OSATS scor es and visual analog scores. Mean OSATS and visual analog scores were compared between groups using a t - test. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: If this study shows that the Bleeding Cric is equal to the current gold standard, it can potentially replace the current model, reducing costs of medical training while providing valuable experience to medical students and residents in performing these difficult procedures. 154 References: 1) Makowski AL.

JC 2013 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. 155 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM Large Saturday Poster Session, Poster #061 Improving Simulation Learning for First Year Medical Students Utilizing Focused Feedback Patel, Palak , MD University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix Idea/Problem Statement: A revised simulation teaching model will enhance medical students' skill sets by utilizing focused and individualized feedback sessions. Need/Rationale: Effective simulation training can r esult in better patient outcomes including better care, fewer complications, and improved safety margins (1, 2). Most simulation curricula have students participate in a scenario followed by a general de- briefing of the overall exp erience. These simulation ciricula do not include the opportunity to repeat the scenario and improve on their skills (1). When incorporated with individualized feedback simulation, however, participant learning is significantly enhanced (1). Focused indivi dualized feedback helps s tudents develop and refine skill sets, practice integrating them and apply them appropriately in future settings (Ambrose et al, 2011). Feedback can further enhance student learning by assessing the individual students' knowledge, skills, and comfort level, allowing the faculty to provide the feedback the particular student needs. The proposed intervention intends to improve simulation training to help first -year medical students build confidence and skills that can later be applied in direct patient care. Methods: The enhanced simulation sessions utilizing focused feedback will occur in the University of Arizona Simulation Center approximately once per month over the first year of the medical school curriculum (n=80). Students will be randomly assigned to the current simulation curriculum (n=40) or to the revised simulation session (n=40). The current simulation curriculum has scenarios corresponding with the didactic blocks (e.g., cardiovascular, neurology, immunology). Students pa rticipate in one (or more ) case scenario with general feedback after completion of all scenarios. The enhanced process will insert a focused feedback session after the initial scenario. Based on direct observation, this debriefing will focus very specifica lly on each team's (n=3 -4) performance, with ideas for enhancing it. This will be immediately followed by the opportunity to repeat the simulation scenario. Faculty development will occur to train assigned faculty to provide a de -brief/feedback session in between simulation scenar ios. The goal for learners is that they will more quickly build the capacity to learn from the scenarios and thus perform better in their first quarterly evaluation session. Evaluation Plan/Results: The evaluation will include tra cking, assessment of lear ner reaction, and assessment of learner performance. We will document completion of the faculty development and both versions of the simulations. Following each simulation session medical students will be asked to fill out feedback survey assessing their c omfort level and confidence after the simulation session. Once per quarter the simulation directors will be observing the simulation/debriefing and rating each student's performance. Comparisons will be made between each of the two groups of students (cont rol vs intervention) to assess the success of a focused feedback session in relation to self -reported confidence, learner reaction to the sessions and observed performance. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Focused individualized feedback with an opportun ity to practice skills is an approach that can be easily transferred to other universities with a simulation curriculum. This will result in enhanced medical student skills and application of this knowledge improving future patient care and safety. References: 1) Motola, Ivette; Devine, Luke; Chung, Issenberg, Barry.

Need/Rationale: Since the late 1990s there has been a five -fold increase in the number of overdoses and deaths from prescription opioids. From 1999- 2016, there have been more than 350,000 deaths from opioid overdoses. An average of 115 people die of opioid overdose in America and it has been declared a national epidemic. Among the highest risk patients for overdose are ones diagnosed w ith Opiate Use Disorder (OUD) as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. There is an estimated prevalence of 3 -26% of OUD in primary care settings among patients with chro nic pain on opioid therapy. Resident physi cians are likely to encounter patients with addictions but many feel unprepared to diagnose and treat these patients. Despite caring for these high risk patients, residents have demonstrated lack of knowledge in answering questions about treatment strategi es for patients with substance abuse and 72% of residents rated the quality of addictions training as poor or fair. Additionally, although the majority of Primary Care physician's acknowledge that OUD is an extremely serious problem, there is a high prevalence of negative attitude towards those patients. Among physicians surveyed, 89% felt that the patient was solely responsible for their addiction. Physicians need additional training that not only gives them the to ols to successfully treat OUD, but also he lps them build empathy and communication skills for these often difficult interventions. Methods: We will involve all of our residents in the simulation training event but will have different learning objectives f or each class. Our third -year residents w ill be expected to manage a patient encounter in which the patient demonstrates characteristics of an OUD. They will be expected to demonstrate active listening skills, empathic communication, accurately identify O UD, and partner with the patient to develo p next steps in their care with a focus on safety. Our second -year residents will play the role of the patient who has an OUD. We will prep them with readings, the patient's background that lead to OUD, and how to play the role. Our goal is to help build e mpathy for this condition by having the residents identify with patients. Finally, our first -year residents will serve in an observation role along with a faculty member. They will observe the interaction through v ideo and then participate in the debrief, as well as deliver feedback to the participants along with faculty members. After each simulation interaction, all of the residents involved will meet with a faculty member to debrief the scenario, discuss what wen t well and what needed to improve. The deb rief will serve as the main opportunity for learning from the simulated interaction. Evaluation Plan/Results: Third- year residents will be video observed during the standardized patient encounter. There will be set goals and a checklist for the visit whic h will include items such as the resident's ability to recognize the high risk patient with opioid use disorder, navigating a difficult patient interaction, motivational interviewing, and ability to guide the patie nt to the proper resources. In addition, there will be a group debriefing session where residents will be encouraged to discuss the encounter and difficulties they had or may have in the future dealing with this patient population. Second -year residents will be given a pre and post -encounter surve y measuring their perceptions and beliefs about patients with Opioid Use Disorder. There will also be a separate debriefing session to discuss how they felt during the encounter and how that may or may not change t heir own practices in the future with the patient population. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We will utilize simulation training to help give physicians tools to successfully diagnose and manage high risk patients with Opioid Use Disorder. Additionally , we are hoping to impact physicians' inhe rent biases by building empathy. Our ultimate goal is to decrease deaths from opioid overdose. 158 References: 1) Dowell D, Haegerich TM, Chou R. CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain \u2014 United States, 2016.

Need/Rationale: Over the past 65 years, since preventive medicine has been recognized as a specialty in the US, it has continued to experienc e shortages in funding and teaching resources, instability and deficiency in social recognition of workforce, as well as the lack of clarity and consistency in content, duration, training strategies and outcomes across medical school curricula. While sever al aspects of allocations to and management of preventive services were, to some extent, investigated from system dynamics perspectives, the status of teaching preventive medicine in medical schools was not, to our knowledge, part of these considerations. Our goal is to conceptualize the major factors (variables) and their interactions that play into preventive medicine and medical education, generate a dynamic model of these interactions, an d formulate a dynamic hypothesis that would reflect on the existin g system's behavior over time. Methods: A broad literature search on preventive medicine with association to medical education was performed to identify the key variables. Using Vensim software, a causal loop diagram (CLD) was designed to visualize the relationships between the identified variables and analyze the feedback structure of the system as the causes of its behavior. Then the dominant variables, the major influences and the delays in the system were identified. Finally, analysis of the types (patterns) of behaviors over time exhibited by the different parts of the system, as well as, the system as a whole was performed. Evaluation Plan/Results: The developed model (CLD) allows visu alizing preventive medicine and medical education as a complex sys tem of interacting variables with a distinct internal system structure being a source of patterns of problematic system behavior - the existing challenges in preventive medicine. The model u ncovered nonlinear relationships between content and quality of medical education in preventive medicine, the diversity of employment opportunities in the field, and social recognition of preventive medicine physicians. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: CLD modeling facilitates understanding and interpretation of the interactions and feedback loops that cause and/or contribute to the existing challenges in preventive medicine. This allows for developing and testing policies for optimization of preventive m edicine without prohibitive costs. References: 1) Peik SM, Mohan KM, Baba T, Donadel M, Labruto A, Loh LC.

Need/Rationale: Curriculum review is a type of lecture that is part of our GI training program's conference series. Usua lly it takes the format of either questions with multiple choice answers or \"Jeopardy\" style questions. Senior fellows are responsible f or the content and use question banks or other review sources to create questions. Usually these questions are chosen arbitrarily. How could we change the curriculum review lectures to be better structured, more engaging and higher yield? We propose creati ng a catalog of topics discussed for each curriculum review lecture and addressing different topics for future lecture w ould improve the structure of the lectures. Furthermore, using guidelines to illustrate a few topics to focus on for each curriculum rev iew lecture and delving into specific the recommendation with evidence for each question discussed would make the lectur es more engaging. Identifying and focusing on topics that the fellows have a difficulty understanding would make lectures higher yield. Methods: The GI training exam (GTE) taken by the majority of GI fellows in training is meant to be \"formative...to provid e feedback to the trainee and program director which can inform future teaching and learning opportunities\" (1). We plan to use the results of the GTE to identify knowledge deficits among fellows in the program and choose a few of these topics to focus on during the curriculum review lectures. Questions on selected topics will be discussed in the context of the GI society guidelines (from the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterology Association, American Society for Gastrointestinal E ndoscopy, and American Association for the Study of Liver Disease) with discussion about specific recommendations and evidence during each curriculum review lecture. We hope to cover different topics at each curriculum review lecture so that over the cours e of the year trainees' knowledge base will grow, specifically in the areas in which they are weak. Other programs have also used GTE results to guide curriculum and have noted improvement in GTE scores (2). Evaluation Plan/Results: One curriculum review was implemented with these changes in place and overall written feedback was positive. 11 out of 12 fellows (includes two of the authors ) found incorporation of guidelines into the curriculum review lecture beneficial, and 5 out of 8 of the senior fellows noted that this new format was more engaging. Two -thirds of the fellows did want the GTE results to guide the topics discussed. Of note, almost all of the fellows (11 out of 12 fellows) currently use the GI society guidelines and 6 of the 8 senior fellows currently use the GTE results to guide self -study. We have only had one curriculum review thus far in the year, but plan to implement th e proposed changes in upcoming curriculum review lectures during this academic year. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: By using GTE results to guide topics or questions chosen for curriculum review lectures and incorporating guidelines with questions we h ope to improve the knowledge base of fellows. We plan to compare this year's GTE results with prior year's score to see if there is a measurable improvement.

Need/Rationale: Clinical Anatomy, in the fir st year at Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine - New York (Harlem Campus), or TouroCOM -NY (Harlem), was offered as didactic lectures and laboratory sessions with both written and practical examinations with guidelines provided for students in the syllabus with course expectations, topics, class schedule, and learning objectives beginning in Fa ll 2008. Content was delivered in class via PowerPoint presentations for 50 minute sessions. Attendance varied between twenty and sixty percent. As reported by NBOME , TouroCOM -NY (Harlem) COMLEX- USA Level 1 discipline mean scores in anatomy ranged from 450 .73 in 2010 (in correlation with when the students of the Fall 2008 class took the COMLEX) to 507.33 in 2013. The national mean during this period ranged from 484.48 in 2010 to 521.35 in 2013. The first pass rate during this time period averaged 82.82% aga inst the national first pass rate average of 89.69%. Methods: In Fall 2012, Clinical Anatomy course content delivery and access changed to pre -recorded video lectures by faculty. Students were able to access course content via a server which housed a vide o library of course topics in accordance with the syllabus. No classroom lectures were offered; however, students were invited to participate in quiz and discussion sessions in the classroom, 50 minutes per week per course. Evaluation Plan/Results: Classroom time was decreased to one -third. Students have the ability to watch lecture videos without the requirement of being present in class, with the additional benefit of standard video options, such as pause, rewind, and increased or decreased speed. Discussion of topics in the classroom setting is encouraged and is often animated and dynamic. Students are better able to manage their time and come to class prepared for quizzes and discussion. Students receive minor credit for the quiz and leave session s aligned in their understanding of topics. Class attendance is typically 85% and may reach 100%. The faculty at TouroCOM -NY (Harlem) are able to provide consistent and regularly improved content presentations via video lectures, while freeing time for sch olarly activities. Students manage their study efficiently during time which is free of scheduled lectures. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: TouroCOM -NY (Harlem) COMLEX- USA Level 1 mean discipline scores in anatomy improved from 522.26 in 2014 to 575.68 in 2017 compared to the national mean of 531.13 in 2014 and 557.25 in 2017. The first pass rate increased from 87.29% in 2013 to 97.74% in 2018 (mean national first pass rate: 92.91%). References: 1) McCullough, M. J., & McCullough, M. G. (2016).

Need/Rationale: Traditionally, the discipline -based curriculum has been the mainstay offered by med ical schools worldwide. However, the realization that there are numerous shortcomings with this curriculum has stimulated many schools, in the last 50 years, to experiment with various curricular reforms in an attempt to improve medical education. The Lanc et Commission shed light on the deficits of existing educat ion systems and the urgent need to produce health professionals who can mobilize knowledge, engage in critical thinking and participate in patient -centered care. The Commission called for instructional reforms including system -based, integrated curricula w ith individualized learning curves and a range of learning activities resulting in transformative learning. Methods: CALMED- SoM has been established with the intent of being an innovative, sociall y accountable medical school producing graduates optimally prepared for the evolving practice of medicine. CALMED -SoM has designed an innovative student - and patient -centered curriculum that includes successful pedagogies collated from the most advanced ed ucational institutions around the world. This competency -based curriculum, referred to as the Global Active -Learning Curriculum, incorporates adult learning strategies and various techniques for active learning such as the flipped classroom (basic science lectures are all pre -recorded), team -based learning and classroom activities such as debates and role plays. The curriculum is taught in system -based modules and driven by clinical -presentations emphasizing an early focus on developing clinical reasoning s kills. The curriculum requires students from the very first module to integrate the basic sciences, clinical application, as well as environmental and social determinants of health. Evaluation Plan/Results: The evaluation of the curriculum will include st udent assessments of medical knowledge, critical thinking a s well as inductive and deductive reasoning skills. To gauge the extent to which this curriculum is truly transformative, the evaluation tools also gauge the students' ability to search, analyze an d present information; The ability of students to work in t eams; The ability of students to identify and leverage resources to address health priorities. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This curriculum, thoughtfully designed to produce change agents for the health system, has the potential to be replicated glob ally. Many schools are currently responding to the Lancet Commission by revising curricula and would benefit from the blueprint and resources of the CalMed model.

Need/Rationale: In 1985, The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) introduced a stipulation for all medical schools to include material on \"medical ethics and human values,\" yet there is a lack of consensus on the best pedagogical approach to implementing this education (1). The authors propose \"The Differential\" as one method to facilitate measured, thoughtful communication presenting at least two points of view on controversial issues i n medicine while promoting skills in interprofessionalism. At the authors' institution, medical ethics is taught didactically and discussed in small groups, resulting in many students being unconvinced that they had be en academically instructed on multiple sides of an issue. By participating as a debater or observer, students will have the opportunity to see measured, careful, and professional discussion of sensitive or ethical issues while they develop an understanding of the appropriate language that shou ld be used to discuss these topics in an interprofessional setting. Methods: \"The Differential\" has two target learner groups: the first, medical and law students who will act as debaters, the second, medical and law students who attend the debates to obs erve. We are planning to host two debates during the upcoming academic year (October 2018 and January 2019), both designed to fit in a one -hour lunch session. Each debate will be moderated by an Executive Board. In preparation for the debate, the Executive Board selects a \"topic advisor\" from the faculty to provide guidance to both teams. The debate begins with an introduction to the topic, and a statement of the motion to be debated. Next, the audience votes in an anon ymous poll asking their position on th e motion. The affirmative and negative team then receive 5 minutes each for their opening arguments. The next 10 minutes are dedicated to audience questions, submitted electronically, vetted by the Executive Board for scope, and read aloud to the debaters by the moderator. Five minutes are then provided to each team to argue secondary statements on their position. After these statements, teams are allowed 3 minutes to rebut, affirmative team leading. The moderator close s the debate following the negative te am's rebuttal. A second poll of the audience is taken at this time. Finally, the Executive Board reveals the results of both polls side by side, and declares the winner of the debate. Evaluation Plan/Results: Our two debates (conducted in October 2018 and January 2019) will be evaluated via careful account of audience attendance. Comments and recommendations will be gathered via evaluation forms that will be sent to all debate participants and interested attendees. Dev elopment of skills in interprofessiona l communication and comfort in discussing sensitive ethical issues will be additionally addressed in the evaluation form sent to debaters. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The authors hope to see this method implemen ted as a curricular modality to achiev e professionalism and communication goals in undergraduate medical education.

Need/Rationale: Interprofessional teams caring for complex and marginalized populations with mental illness, substance misuse, and social determinants of health issues require intricate IP collaboration to deliver patient centered care. It is imperative t hat team members have efficient discussions of patient needs, urgent problem solving, and coordination of communication between all team members. These meaningful interactions can quickly get lost in the clinic flow or may not h appen at all. As such, our IP team augmented an existing pre -clinic huddle format for primary care teams to enhance IP collaboration and teamwork, primary care mental health integration, work satisfaction and practice climate, and most importantly, patient care (Rodriguez, Meredith, Hamilton, Yano, & Rubenstein, 2014). Here, we describe the Super Huddle (SH), preliminary findings from our evaluation of its role and impact, and lessons learned from its ongoing development. Methods: The SH emphasizes IP coll aboration in a structured br ief pre -clinic huddle designed to coordinate care for complex patients. These daily huddles include faculty and trainees from primary care, mental health, pharmacy, social work, and nursing. First, primary care teamlets huddle t o review the roster of patie nts scheduled to be seen for that day, coordinate patient care, and identify patients needing further IP consultation. To discuss patients needing further IP collaboration, immediately following the teamlet huddle, mental health providers, social workers, pharmacists, and RN care managers join for a 10 -minute SH. During the SH, critical updates for scheduled patients are shared with the team, pertinent information is offered by other providers, emergent problems are deliberated, and collaborating team membe rs coordinate more comprehensive and appropriate care. Our evaluation revolved around two phases of evaluation during the year - one more descriptive (occurring over the course of one week each month), and another more longitudi nal and impact -focused. The regular evaluation included developed measures that captured frequency and variation in interprofessional interaction and the perceived benefit of the SH on each provider's care plan for that given day. The mid - and endpoint captures focused on the trainee s, were also developed in -house, and examined changes in attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge related to interprofessional collaboration and coordination of care. Evaluation Plan/Results: Given our periodic data collection metho d (one week/month), the desc riptive SH evaluation yielded over 400 SH evaluation questionnaires from both faculty and trainees. These non - unique questionnaires represented the activity of 37 super huddles and over 30% of the submitted evaluations came from trainees representing inter nal medicine, pharmacy, psychology, advanced practice nursing, and psychiatry. Over the course of these 37 SHs, trainees were involved in 216 interactions with other trainees and faculty, regardless of discipline. However, of those 216 interactions, 161 (74.5%) were interprofessional, or with a trainee or faculty from another discipline. These interprofessional interactions also seemed to benefit trainees in various ways. In particular, trainees indicated that SHs were most helpf ul in coordinating care with other professions critical for their patient's care, better understanding the history behind their Veteran patient, and increasing their confidence in providing care to their patients. The impact- focused surveys were completed by 20 interprofessional trainees. Although mostly positive, upward trends were observed in all measures, the SH did contribute to an increase in knowledge of how the roles and responsibilities of primary care and mental health disciplines integrated (p<0.01). We believe further inves tigation is necessary to examine if the SH impacted specialties or level of learner differently. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The SH can offer a streamlined yet comprehensive model to promote IP collaboration and coordinate complex patient care in a time and space restricted environment. However, as new trainees come onboard and staff turnover, challenges revolving around maintaining efficacy and efficiency have arisen. 165 References: 1) Rodriguez, H. P., Meredith, L.

Health care management review, 40(4), 286 -299. 166 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM Large Saturday Poster Session, Poster #069 Use of a Quick Multimedia Learning Module Facilitates Knowledge Acquisition of Cardiac Physiology Moser, Joe -Ann; Zhong, Amy; Justin, Gale; Soriano, Rainier Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Idea/Problem Statement: Due to the fast-paced nature of preclinical courses, there are few opportunities for students to review previously covered topics. Need/Rationale: As activation of prior knowledge is a critical step in learning, review becomes an integral part in understanding and retention. Due to the comprehensive quality and fast- paced nature of the medical school curriculum, there are limited opportunities within the course structure for students to review previously covered topics. This in turn increases the challenge me dical st udents face when learning subsequent material. Current learners often utilize short, commercially available media -based learning objects for the purpose of review. Although adoption of these technologies has been increasing among students, traction among faculty educators has been slow because such review materials are not tailored to specific curricula being taught. This project aims to leverage popular emerging technologies to explain challenging topics in first -year physiology, in such a way that they ar e tailored to the ISMMS curriculum and can be useful for subsequent learning. Methods: Topics for inclusion were solicited from the Year 1 physiology and Year 2 cardiology course directors and selected through an analysis of the content matter of USMLE St ep 1 question banks. The multimedia was then created by the research team, with help from our instructional designers and medical illustrators. Iterative content revisions were made through educator and course director feedback. The modules were th en made available to the medical students as an optional cardiology resource through the Blackboard LMS. Subjective and objective measures were collected with an anonymous pre- and post -intervention survey. Recall and knowledge application were tested usin g questi ons adapted from a Step 1 question bank. Student attitudes regarding the intervention were also assessed on a 5- point Likert scale. Evaluation Plan/Results: Preliminary results show that 45 (32%) of 141 total students accessed the optional nine -minute cardiac cycle video. Twenty -one (47%) completed the pre - and post -surveys in their entirety, with the rest answering at least one of the questions. The mean percent correct on the knowledge questions increased from 40% pre - to 93% post -intervention. A majorit y of respondents strongly agreed/agreed with statements assessing enjoyment (82%), understandability (90%), and usefulness (86%) of the review module. Furthermore, 76% would recommend it to other medical students, and 79% strongly agreed/agreed tha t use of similar online modules should be encouraged in other medical school courses. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Initial data suggest that use of quick, independent multimedia learning modules to review concepts can facilitate recall, which aids th e application of previously learned knowledge to more challenging topics. Due to these results, we are expanding this form of learning to other second- year courses. References: 167 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM Large Saturday Poster Session, Poster #071 A Pilot Study of Peer to Peer (PTP) Ultrasound Training for Undergraduate Medical the efficacy of peer- to-peer (PTP) ultrasound training for medical students utilizing a unique, student -driven training model. Need/Rationale: As the use of point -of-care ultrasound (POCUS) rises in both primary care and specialties (2), there is an increasi ng need to incorporate POCUS training in undergraduate medical curriculum (1,3). However, one major barrier to increased POCUS training is the faculty investment needed to effectively train students. One proposed solution is to utilize senior m edical students, residents, or fellows to provide adjunct instruction, known as peer -to-peer training (PTP). Although PTP has been shown as a viable way to deliver clinical skills training in the medical school curriculum (1), the optimum way to incorporate PTP into u ndergraduate medical training has not yet been established. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of a unique PTP model, examining POCUS knowledge and confidence across two successive generations of student trainers. Methods: This is a retrospective study. 2nd -year medical students (MS2) (n=4) previously trained by peers taught ten different ultrasound examinations to 1st -year medical students (MS1) (n=10). Total PTP training time was ten hours over ten sessions. Students with prior ultrasound experi ence were excluded from the study. Theoretical knowledge and practical skills were measured at the end of the training period using a multiple- choice questionnaire (MCQ) and an objective structured clinical evaluation (OSCE). For purposes of analysis, the MCQ and OSCE were divided into material covered during PTP training and faculty -led + PTP training. Three groups of students were evaluated: MS2, MS1, and a control group of 1st year medical students who had not received PTP training (n=5) . MS1 and contro l groups wer e also given surveys to measure their confidence regarding their ultrasound skills and comfort with a student trainer. A student T test analysis was done to compare the MCQ and OSCE scores of MS1 and control. The students' level of confidence a nd comfort in their training was measured using a Likert scale. Evaluation Plan/Results: The MS1 group performed better than the control in MCQ and OSCE (p=0.046 and p=0.0001, respectively). There was no difference found between the MS1and MS2 groups (p=0.37 and p=0. 061 for the MCQ and OSCE, respectively). In the faculty led + PTP training portion of the OSCE, MS1 performed better than the MS1 who had not received PTP training group (p=0.048). Sixty percent of students in the MS1 group stated th ey felt more comfortabl e learning ultrasound from a student than a professor. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: PTP training can adequately improve confidence in ultrasound and improve ultrasound skills. Further studies are necessary to conclusively evalu ate the efficacy of PTP training as an effective way to train future student trainers of ultrasound in undergraduate medical education.

Need/Rationale: Up until now the course, Biological and Behavioral Basis of Diseas e, was conceptualized to fulfi ll the lowest levels of Bloom's taxonomy of the cognitive domain. Moreover, the course did not bring behavioral concepts into the discussion beyond the oversimplification of physical activity/inactivity as a \"behavioral\" basis of disease. In the revision o f the course, the instructors want to align new course objectives with core competencies of the AAMC in the domains of living systems, human behavior, and interpersonal skills. The authors are seeking guidance from others who have experience working with l earners at the early end of the medical education continuum. How can this curriculum be structured to have outcome measures? Methods: Given the interprofessional nature of the collaboration, both authors have made efforts to straddle both biology and psyc hology in introducing chronic disease models. Moreover, they have strived to share their forum with other health professionals representing different facets of medicine in order to illustrate the importance of interpersonal sk ills. Assessments include mult iple choice tests, in -class activities where students are asked to demonstrate critical thinking about a controversial health topic or arena such as defining a disease or attempting to counsel a person with a genetic condition . Evaluation Plan/Results: Three tiers of evaluation are currently built into the course. Students complete multiple choice exams based on required reading material. They submit work in class which queries how they are synthesizing the presentation given to them. How do they define th e clinical dilemma? What are plausible treatment approaches? The third tier of student assessment is an essay on an individual with a chronic disease using the biopsychosocial model as a framework. A rubric has been created to identify how well they synthe size all the elements of this model to pain a complete picture of a person's disease. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We want our students to understand AAMC core competencies better after they complete this course. We also want to change learners' attitudes to embrace this model in the hopes that they can define health better for their patients. Lastly we want this course to spark more cross -campus collaborations.

Need/Rationale: The CanMEDs Physici an Competency Framework was introduced by the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada as a requirement for all residency programs. It was officially released in October 2015, eventually being endorsed by 12 Canadian medical organizations. The CanMEDs includes competencies and skills that are required for all physicians, regardless of medical or surgical residency program. These same competencies were also adopted by some undergraduate programs. These competencies include being a collaborator; communicator; heal th advocate; professional; scholar; and leader - all building toward becoming a medical expert. Parallel to this, Quality Improvement [QI] of the health care system is becoming increasingly of demand to be introduced to residents. Different versions and co urses are available. We have designed a student's version of it, aiming at introducing the idea to multi- disciplinary students that may be exposed to the health care system in different angles. Our idea is to capture a qualitative snapshot from multi -disciplinary students' response after 6 -8 weeks of QI course electives. We plan to achieve this through understanding what students have learned about the CanMEDs from these QI electives. Methods: We plan to study the effect of teaching quality improvement in the health care system for summer elective stu dents in two medical schools; University of Calgary and University of Alberta. The study will measure students' perception of the CanMEDS and if quality improvement protocols and study of the health care system will help them cover all the seven roles whic h need to be fulfilled in a practicing physician. Semi -structured interviews are used to measure students' perception. The QI course that was designed for the students is a flipped course that was introduced se parately both at the University of Alberta & U niversity of Calgary as a pilot study with the mandate of making the students in different health- related disciplines aware of the presence of tools to study the health care system, how to prioritize the proble ms and design a plan for intervention. Qualita tively, the students started to identify some or all the CanMeds core competencies and highlight them. They could sometimes trace back where they could see a certain competency being developed through the cours e. We will capture their responses using a semi-structured approach, allowing us to interact with participants in a manner that is less rigid in tone and creates a balance in terms of the interviewer -interviewee relationship. Questions will be presented in a non- leading and non -biased manner to ensure authenticity and impartiality of the information being collected. Interviews will last 45 minutes Evaluation Plan/Results: In qualitative research, the data analysis and data collection occur together as the study proceeds from beginning to end. Study da ta will be digitally recorded to facilitate data analysis. Data will be transcribed by the Comma Police (www.commapolice.com) and subsequently entered as verbatim transcripts (interviews) translated transcripts (field text) into N- VIVO, a qualitative softw are program for data management and analysis. We will use the analytic framework outlined by Crabtree and Miller (1999) who suggest five phases of data interpretation: The five phases are: 1) describing; 2) organizing, 3) connecting, 4) corroborating/legitimating; and 5) representing the account. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: In the case of success to find the link between quality improvement and CanMEDs competencies, we can include the QI course, with the CanMEDs competencies being the actual outcome of the course.

An identified barrier to residents valuin g or effectively receiving feedback is the culture in which feedback is rendered (1,2). A proposed solution to overcoming this barrier is for faculty to work on an educational alliance where the learner's perspective informs the quality of the relationship (3). This includes making the provision of feedback a normal part of the program, creating longitudinal relationships and working together to support the learner (1,2,3). Bas ed on the learning principles that learners' motivation directs retention, and th at their development interacts with the climate of the program, focus will be directed on changing the faculty member's provision of feedback to create a safe environment for residents to receive and utilize feedback for professional growth. Feedback will be structured to include growth promoting words with the goal of affirming desired observed resident behaviors. Methods: This intervention will take place over one year on th e 21 residents in a single community- based family medicine residency program. In this program, the setting with the most opportunity for longitudinal faculty interaction with residents is while precepting the resident outpatient continuity clinic. Interven tion will be feedback given by a single full -time core faculty member via email a fter each outpatient clinical half -day precepting session with the resident(s). The goal will be to give this feedback within 24 hours after the session. The feedback given to resident(s) will be specific to the six ACGME core competencies and will be form ulated using a model focusing on three types of feedback: appreciation, affirmation and coaching. The learner outcome objectives for this intervention include that learners will be better able to: 1) acknowledge receipt of ongoing feedback; 2) articulate their own strengths in caring for patients in the outpatient setting; 3) demonstrate improving competence in 80% of the ACGME milestones relevant to the outpatient setting. Evaluation Plan/Results: The evaluation will include tracking, assessment of reside nt learning and assessment of resident reaction, views and self- reported behavior change. A faculty feedback portfolio will be used for tracking and will include: 1) feedback emails sent to residents; 2) resident email responses to the feedback; 3) unsolic ited feedback from residents to the faculty member. The semi - annual ACGME milestones assessment will be used to assess resident learning as reflected in ratings on the outpati ent relevant milestones. Resident reaction, views on the feedback and self- report ed change will be gathered using a survey administered at 6 months and 1 year after implementation to gain information about 1) resident perceptions of the feedback provided b y the faculty member; 2) how residents report using the feedback in their own dev elopment as family physicians. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: It is our hope that this intervention will show that changing the way one faculty member delivers feedback ca n impact resident perceptions and utilization of feedback. This individual improv ement model could then be used in any specialty to enhance the impact of feedback References: 1) Watling, C. J., & Ginsburg, S. (2018).

Medical students rely on self -reflection and receiving feedback from their preceptors to learn in the clinical en vironment, but most trainees feel that the quantity and quality of feedback they receive about their clinical performance is inadequate. Alth ough characteristics of effective feedback is well documented, research on medical education has focused on improvi ng the quality of feedback through faculty development tools, strategies for providing effective feedback, and assessment methods that integr ate feedback. Currently, narrative prompts are often unstructured and generic; preceptors complete a free -text prompt they deem relevant to the student. To improve the overall quality of feedback, our study will investigate whether task -specificity and dir ectness of feedback can be improved through adapting the narrative prompt based on student's performance in the ass essment. Methods: Through adopting the principles of adaptive testing and automatic item generation, the purpose of our study is to develop and demonstrate an Adaptive Narrative Feedback Prompt (ANFP), where the feedback prompt presented to preceptors wil l be customized based on student performance. The ANFP framework consists of three components: 1) an item -level blueprint of relevant skills scored in the clinical assessment; 2) an adaptive algorithm that determines what information should be prompted about the student according to their performance; 3) a model -based text generator that adapts the feedback prompt based on the requirements of t he adaptive algorithm. The adaptive algorithm converts student performance in each domain collected from rating sca le responses into scoring scales in various time period. Then, the algorithm evaluates each performance pattern and determines priority for w hich domain and what type of deficits and praises the evaluator should address. Finally, a text -model that contains all permutation on areas of feedback is then used to generate each customized prompt. To demonstrate the ANFP framework, an application of the method was piloted by 160 medical students throughout their clinical rotations in one academic year. Descriptive analysis was devised to compare results before using ANFP. Evaluation Plan/Results: A total of 8,342 formative comments and 3,964 comments were provided by preceptors using ANFP. This is compared to a total of 674 formative comments and 1,265 summative comments provided in the previous years (an increase of 563%). On average, each student received 75 comments across one year compared to 12 in the previous years. Length of the comments were reduced (an average of 151 characters) compared to previous year ( 465 characters). A selection of the differences between prompts and other analytic techniques on the differences of the comments will be presented. In sum, our initial results have suggested that ANFP was effective in increasing the number of comments, in corresponding categories, provided to students for feedback. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: In line with the literature for encouraging f eedback in the development of learner feedback systems, development of student driven feedback approaches, and faculty development approaches to improve feedback, our project builds on improving feedback prompt as an approach to improve student feedback.

Need/Rationale: Night time education can noto riously be challenging for two reasons: 1) variable workflows for both the residents and attending hospitalists; 2) no formal rounding or teaching opportunities with the residents. The goal of Red Eye Rounds is to create a nighttime education curriculum th at is sustainable, efficient to implement and increases communication between faculty and residents during the night sh ift. With the development of the Red Eye Rounds curriculum, we aim to capture lost resident -attending communication and education during the night shift. The challenge, however, is to create a type of nighttime curriculum that adds the desired value, but f its logistically with both parties' workflow. Methods: Red Eye Rounds occur at midnight every night and last approximately 15 -20 minutes. This curriculum offers a structured and predictable way to troubleshoot complex medical and patient flow issues encou ntered at night. Residents also receive teaching pearls from an attending and get to discuss complicated patient cases. To help our hospi talist attendings facilitate Red Eye Rounds, we created an easy- to-use curriculum of teaching resources. This consists of: 1) our own question bank using MKSAP and other resources; 2) a collection of key practice -changing evidence -based articles; 3) a coll ection of pearls about the common cross cover issues encountered overnight. The hospitalist attendings can quickly acce ss and utilize these resources at night without having to spend too much time preparing to teach during an already busy shift. The develo pment of Red Eye Rounds took 6 months, from concept to launch. During the initial 2 months, we gathered feedback from t he residents about their perception of nighttime teaching using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire allowed us to identify a serious need for improved resident -hospitalist communication at night. In the following two months, we developed the RER curr iculum. Then spent another 2 months pilot testing the Red Eye Rounds. It was officially integrated into hospitalist and resident workflow in August 2017. Evaluation Plan/Results: Thus far, we have found that meeting with the residents at midnight improves resident -attending communication, identifies potentially sick or complicated patients earlier, alerts hospitalist attendings to when resident teams may approach caps, and makes the night shift experience more predictable for both parties. Red Eye Rounds h as received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the residents and the hospitalist group. Some input from our hospitalist colleagues inc ludes: \"I'm finishing up nights tonight.\"; \"The Red Eye Rounds is REALLY a good thing.\"; \"It's changing the dynamic bet ween us and the residents literally overnight!\"; \"Almost every night they are calling us asking a question about management or something else.\"; \"Such a good thing!!!\"; \"It's even making us look at system stuff. Such as last night a question about co -signature of a DNR came up, and the resident asked why we have a paper DNR form when no other hospital in the system does that. The EPIC order is enough at the University. I'm emailing folks now to ask that very question. Why do we do that???\"; \"When we've call ed the residents every night regarding admissions, they seem interested and engaged.... seem excited to have a good case. There also seems to be more of a sense that they should feel free to call us anytime they have questions or concerns. For example, they had been unaware they could call us if they felt a patient didn't need to be admitted.\" Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Attendance at Red Eye Rounds, ensuring that rounds happen consistently, tracking attendance; allowing for a 5min check in or phone call check -in on busy nights.

Need/Rationale: At Loyola Stritch School of Medicine (SSOM), and at many medical schools nationwide, pre- clinical medical student patient encou nters are largely observational and do not prepare students for the rigor of clinical rotations , both surrounding electronic medical record (EMR) documentation and self -confidence in medical decision -making. This program proposes training M2 students as me dical scribes who will participate in real -time EMR documentation of clinical encounters on behalf of a supervising physician. The student's note can subsequently be reviewed with the physician for purposes of instruction, highlighting vital aspects of the patient visit while providing close supervision and training in the technical and medicolegal aspects of EMR documentation. This allows students to actively participate in clinical encounters prior to clinical duties M3 and M4 year. In addition to potenti al student benefits of this intervention, scribing has been identified as a mechanism to improv e patient -clinician interactions, bolster clinician satisfaction, and increase both the number of patients seen as well as time spent with patients. This program is supported by Loyola Stritch School of Medicine and the Loyola University Health System. It received the $1,000 2017 Curricular Innovation and Technology in Education (CITE) Award from Loyola and, most recently, a $10,000 2018 AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education Innovation Grant. Methods: Participants will be placed into one of two coho rts: a control group in which students will shadow their resident/attending physician after completing an initial history and physical exam, and an experimental group where students will serve as a \"scribe\" for their resident/attending after completing the history and physical. Throughout this project, we will utilize specific surveys to capture key data from various stakeholders including our student participants , resident physicians, attending physicians, and the patients themselves. Consent will be colle cted from physicians, participants, and patients prior survey distributions. Surveys will capture information related to medical students' self confidence in cli nical skills and EMR documentation as well as interest in pursuit of primary care residency pre /post intervention, physician assessment on medical students' clinical performance, self -reported documentation time spent per patient, and finally patient satis faction. The research team has developed these surveys by drawing from existing, validated surv eys and survey scales where applicable, acknowledging that medical students have not ever been studied as scribes. Evaluation Plan/Results: A generalized linear mixed effects model will investigate the spread in confidence ratings and documentation time b etween control and experimental groups. In these models, a multinomial distribution will be specified for each confidence construct. A cumulative logit link will estimate the odds ratio. Weighted kappa analysis will estimate the agreement between preceptor s' ratings on students' clinical confidence and the student's own perception among both experimental and control groups. A kappa value exceeding 0.8 will be cons idered acceptable agreement between preceptor and student confidence ratings. Finally, an ordin al logistic regression model will compare the distribution of patient satisfaction between the two cohorts. In this model, the proportional odds assumption will be assessed using a score statistic. If the assumption is violated, a non -parametric Wilcoxon r ank-sum test will compare the distribution of patient satisfaction between the cohorts. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We believe this represents a viable st rategy for EMR -based clinical documentation training for pre -clinical medical students in an ef fort to improve documentation and comprehensive clinical skills.

Need/Rationale: Patient- tailored transitions of care (TOC) from hospital to hom e are associated with improved health outcomes in adults: reduced hospital readmission rates, fewer medication errors, and improved patient satisfaction (1). Children tend to have care coordination ne eds that differ from those of adults. However, there is little research in the pediatric literature on this topic. There are no curricula for medical students in the pediatric setting that focus on safe transitions, medication safety and the role of discha rge education (2). With the \"millennial generation\" favo ring social media platforms and other technology, educators must consider using interactive teaching strategies that are more time -efficient and readily available than traditional approaches (3). We w ill compare knowledge and self -efficacy outcomes from a technology -based curriculum to a traditional format. I hypothesize that a curriculum of either modality will benefit the participants, but the technology -based modality will enhance learning and provi de additional benefits in terms of logistics, reproducib ility, and student and instructor time commitment. We will also assess for change in behavior using a direct observation tool while conducting discharge counseling. Lastly, we will use a \"discharge ch ecklist\" assessment tool to evaluate their exposure to d ischarge -related proficiencies. This project idea was awarded an institutional $10,000 grant for innovative research in medical education and under IRB review. Methods: This is a prospective pilot an d feasibility study to evaluate a TOC curriculum focused on a patient and family- centered approach to hospital discharge. We plan to recruit 135 third -year medical students over 6 months during five 6 -week clerkship blocks, with 27 students each. A power a nalysis showed for an 80% chance of detecting a moderate effect size (f=.25), a total sample of 128 would be required. At week 1 of each clerkship, all students will attend a workshop -style format consisting of a brief overview on the topic of TOC/safe tra nsitions (40 minutes). Those who agree to participate wi ll be consented, and asked to complete a brief, 10 -question knowledge/attitude pre- test. Study participants will be randomized within each block (to minimize maturation bias) into a control group (no online modules; discharge checklist) and an intervention group (two 20 -minute online modules using articulate storyline interactive e -learning software; discharge checklist). A post -test will be given at the end of inpatient portion of their rotation (week 3). Direct observation of a student conducting discharg e education on a hospitalized patient will be done by trained hospitalists using a brief, validated assessment tool (only with participants at CHLA due to logistics). Weekly emails will be sent to rem ind the intervention group to complete modules by the en d of their inpatient experience. Direct observations will occur during the last week of the inpatient block. Evaluation Plan/Results: The primary outcome is to assess for change in knowledge in all s ubjects who agreed to participate in the study. Our seco ndary outcomes include: 1) assessing for change in comfort/self -efficacy; 2) technology -based modalities will be a more favored, viable alternative to conventional strategies and; 3) assessing for cha nge in behavior via direct observation. We hope to also show correlations in knowledge with completion of a discharge checklist which includes elements that must be checked off after the task is complete. Outcomes will be measured by a pre - and post -test knowledge and self -efficacy survey and a direct observation assessment tool. We will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine differences in improvement over time by experimental group. A post -test question will ask about feasibility of overall curriculu m and markers of curriculum implementation will be tracked which includes number of participants who accessed the modules and duration of time spent in each e- module Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This curriculum will offer many benefits to student lea rning and may show a feasible way to implement content u sing interactive teaching strategies that are more time - 178 efficient and readily available than traditional approaches. Next steps include studying efficacy and sharing at other institutions. References : 1) Boysen, D. G. (2010). Changing the Culture In Medical Education To Teach Patient Safety.

Need/Rationale: All health professions' students must develop the skills needed to conduct patient centered interviews: 1) Despite this being a core entrustable professional activity for medical students, many get limited t eaching and minimal individual feedback on this critical skill; 2) Increasingly, program directors in graduate medical education (GME) have noted significant variability in medical school graduates' readiness to perform routine clinical activities; 3) More over, at its July 2017 meeting, the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Management Committee voted to increase the required minimum passing level for all three Step 2 CS (Clinical Skills) subcomponents: Communication and Interpersonal Skill s (CIS), Spoken English Proficiency (SEP), and Integrated Clinical Encounter (ICE). Our institution has seen an increase in failure of Step 2 CS after the increased minimum passing level, compared to previous years. To address this chall enge, we are propos ing to incorporate elements of the 21st Century mindset (growth mindset and self -compassion) with one -to-one coaching using standardized patients (Dweck, 2006 and Neff, 2011). Methods: This intervention will focus on third -year medical students (n~25) who are identified by Objective Structure Clinical Examinations (OSCE) score, as needing early assistance in developing patient centered communications. All clerkship OSCE scores contain a Physician -Patient Interaction (PPI) section that fo cuses on patient ce ntered interviewing. Learners who score below 60% on the PPI section will be offered coaching. The intervention for each student will include: 1) the opportunity to take the Mindset self -assessment tool and the Self -Compassion Scale (fre e online tools); 2) coaching by a faculty member on their mindset/self -compassion; 3) one -to-one session with a standardized patient (two separate cases) with direct faculty observation; 4) feedback specific to the behaviors utilized both in our OSCEs and the Step 2 CS. Lear ners may request a second one -to-one session. After successful participation, learners will be better able to conduct a patient centered interview (e.g., open -ended questions, body language, listening, avoiding medical jargon, and respon ding to patient's verbal and nonverbal cues and emotions). It is our goals to help students improve their overall Year III OCSE performance through this early intervention process. Evaluation Plan/Results: The evaluation will include tracking of feasibili ty and participatio n. We will track: 1) faculty and standardized patient hours committed to the intervention; 2) the percent of eligible students to accept coaching, percent that complete the online instruments, and percent that select one versus two coach ing sessions. Effec tiveness of the intervention will also be examined using student reaction data as well as performance data. Reaction to the intervention by learners will be gathered through a post -participation survey examining quality of the coaching, usefulness of the 2 1st century mindset tools, and confidence in patient centered communication skills. Since the PPI section is standardized among all clerkship OSCSs, we can track student performance throughout the third year as part of assessing the effe ctiveness of interv ention. Ultimately, student performance can be tracked using USMLE Step 2CS exam results. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: If our model is effective and feasible, it could be used by programs in any health profession to help them with struggling learners .

Need/Rationale: Shooting s at healthcare institutions are becoming more and more common. FBI and JCCI have emphasized the importance of training staff to better deal with such situations. The ER, followed by parking and patient rooms are the most common are as of such incidents. Mo tives for such incidents are typically: grudge (27%); suicide (21%); \"euthanizing\" an ill relative (14%); and prisoner escape (11%). Hospital staff comprised 20% of victims; out of which physicians accounted for 3%. In any setting, a potentially unstable patient in possession of a firearm represents a psychiatric emergency for which few clinicians are prepared. This scenario, specifically, has been minimally addressed in the professional literature. We propose training physicians usi ng \"Simulated patients\" to better handle and understand the meaning of \"gun in the room\". This training would help physicians acquire the skills necessary to evaluate such patients. We would also like to integrate firearm history and review of systems into a comprehensive biopsyc hosocial formulation. Methods: We use simulated patient encounters \"SIMS\" to educate residents about less common patient experiences. This exercise is offered longitudinally throughout the length of the residency. It is based on interviewing skills and pa tient non- disclosure. This year \"Gary\", a simulated patient was a part of our SIMS. In this scenario, Gary is a retired corrections officer suffering from PTSD, who was arrested and brought to the ER for worsening agitation under th e influence of alcohol. During the encounter, resident physicians found out that Gary was carrying a gun. A preliminary review of 31 interviews showed the following: The presence of even a simulated firearm resulted in significant anxiety and psychological withdrawal on the part of clinicians. 30% of interviewers left the interview room immediately, with minimal or no explanation to the patient. Only 28% of residents asked Gary to surrender or secure his weapon and continued the psychiatric interview after he had done so. Only 18% of interviewers made more than a cursory attempt to establish Gary's motivation for bringing a firearm to the session. The videos are used for discussion and educational purposes. We aim to use the same, to identify the spectrum of possible responses and other factors involved e.g., resident anxiety; countertransference; patient alliance; psychiatric diagnoses; etc. These resources can further be clubbed with \"Preventing and Managing Crisis Situation training \"to train physicians an d further build protocols. Evaluation Plan/Results: Evaluation is based on self report of residents using surveys. In addition, these videos are scored by independent raters for different interviewing skills - e.g., getting different aspects of history; e stablishing rapport; und erstanding of non verbal cues; empathy, etc. We intend to compare the self report with the independent scores to understand what dictated an optimal performance. Also we intend to continue having similar but not identical simulated encounters to monitor resident growth and confidence in handling such situations. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We contend that this exercise would help health care providers at all levels understand the different layers of the situation of \"gun in th e room\", and hence bette r handle it. A better response would not only save lives, but also would be beneficial for patient care. References: 1) Ann Emerg Med. 2012 Dec;60(6):790 -798.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2012.08.012.

Need/Rationale: Many students may not be aware of their individual learning methods at the start of medical school and thus may not study as effectively until much later. It may be of value for students in a medical school -based curriculum program to be aware of various learning theories and identify effective learning strategies before coursework begins. This study aims to educate students about learning theory and styles and create individualized approaches to the medical school curriculum. Methods: Participants were given a presentation outlining the basic characteristics of different learning styles and corresponding study/learning habits that are most effective. Participants wer e administered the modality (learning channel preference) questionnaire by O'Brien (1985) to determine their personal learning style. A pre -presentation and a post-presentation survey gathered information on the different types of learning styles, and awar eness of personal learning styles. Evaluation Plan/Results: Overall, 94.12% (n=256) were interested in learning study skills for medical school and an overwhelming majority at 92.65% (n=252) were interested in a personalized study approach catered to their learning style. Participants were surveyed on which of three learning styles (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) applied the most to them. Results wer e grouped to track trends among students. Future studies can analyze success in the DO program when stud ents utilize the correct learning style from the start. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Students aware of the theories of cognition can create a bett er approach to their learning starting in their first semester of undergraduate medical education to bui ld a stronger foundation, develop a more rehearsed working memory, and eventually incorporate more knowledge into long -term memory.

Need/Rationale: Pathology remains one of the major components of medical school foundatio nal biomedical science curriculum. Due to advances in educational technology, there has been a recent surge of resourc es available to medical students both to supplement what is taught in the classroom and to provide high -yield review for licensure examina tions. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine - New York (Harlem) students who recently took COMLEX Level 1 to gather information on demographics and responses towards different pathology board prepara tory resources. All participants were given access to the survey via email. The survey was distributed and completed b y participants electronically using the online service SurveyMonkey. Participants were provided with a brief explanation prior to the surv ey, via SurveyMonkey, with the option to decline. Subject responses were recorded on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 corresponding to \"strongly disagree\" and 5 corresponding to \"strongly agree\". Evaluation Plan/Results: Participants were survey ed on which resource was crucial in preparation for COMLEX Level 1 Pathology, their most preferred preparatory resourc e for the exam, whether or not the school's curriculum was sufficient for the exam, and an open comment section about additional insight regarding their preferred pathology resources. Results were grouped based on class year and age at time of COMLEX level 1 preparation (ranged: 20 -29, 30- 39, 40- 49, 50+ years old). Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Identifying characteristics of recently re leased resources that appeal to the current generation of medical students can help medical educators improve their cu rriculum and become more effective in preparing their students for COMLEX Level 1.

Need/Rationale: Pain is the most common presenting complaint to the Emergency Department (ED) so ED providers should be experts in pain manage ment. However, providers frequently fall short in this category and often attempts at pain control are inadequate or delayed. Even in instances where pain is adequately treated, it may be done in a manner which can lead to detrimental downstream affects including the potential for dependence. A potential solution to the problem of improper pain manageme nt in the ED is resident education. There have previously been efforts to implement some educational component of pain management that have resulted in impro ved analgesia and patient satisfaction (1). One study from the surgical literature also demonstrate d decreased opioid prescriptions after an educational intervention about pain control. There is a plethora of research and expert consensus to guide the phar macologic management of pain in a number of common painful syndromes without the use of opioids (2). Additionally, the American College of Emergency Physicians has released a policy statement on pain management in the ED which urges providers to reduce the amount of prescribed opioids from the ED in light of evidence that adequate analgesia can be attained with less risky medications (3). Despite this evidence and consensus, there still seems to be variability in the pharmacologic treatment of acute pain. Methods: This will be a prospective before -and-after study evaluating the pain management practices and prescriptive patterns of individual residents. We will examine these behaviors in the two weeks before and after a 30 -minute online lecture teaching a g eneral approach to opioid sparing pain management as well as the recommended analgesic approaches t o headache, back pain, and extremity pain. To create this lecture, we have extensively searched the literature for consensus opinion and high - quality evidenc e regarding analgesia for the mentioned complaints and summarized the key points in a short online video. We have also drawn from ACEP policy statements and expert opinion around pain control in the ED. Our instruction here stresses use of non -opioids as a first line analgesic when appropriate, early treatment of a patient's pain, and the importance of a thoughtful analgesic approach to each patient. Evaluation Plan/Results: The statistical analysis will aim to detect differences in oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per patient given in the ED and prescribed from the ED by each individual resident before and after the educational intervention. Secondarily, we aim to breakdown the MME by complaint as our educational intervention will discuss data spe cific to the listed complaints above. Additionally, we will evaluate pain scores and time to analge sia to measure whether the intervention has led to changes in patient outcomes. To do this, we will draw this data for each individual resident and patient from the electronic medical record. The statistical analysis would involve a paired t -test to compare MME before and after the intervention. We would do the same analysis by complaint for our secondary outcomes. Additionally, we will compare time to analges ia and pain control (as measured by the verbal pain scale) in the pre - and post -intervention period s. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Results will inform the design of instructional methods that may lead to a reduction in use and prescription of unneces sary opioids as well as more effective analgesia in the ED. Given the opioid epidemic, any decrease in inappropriate opioid use may have a dramatic impact on patient outcomes. References: 1) Jones JB.

Need/Rationale: What makes a doctor special? With information so readily available at everyone's fingertips, I believe that knowledge is no longer a physician's greatest tool. Medical education ha s continued to place a premium on knowledge -acquisition using the same algorithmic didactic styles, but we have still not operationalized the teaching of critical thinking as a d iscrete skill. Using the popular RIME framework, we must develop methods to he lp medical students move from Reporter to Interpreter and beyond. This session aims to do just that. As a former classroom teacher, I have developed several quick teaching module s to help build critical thinking as a discrete skill on the wards. In this se ssion, geared towards residents and attendings who want to build their teaching skills, attendees will walk walk away with a few simple lesson plans that can be used with medical students and early -career residents. Methods: Keep it Simple: This teaching tool helps learners transition from reporters to interpreters, as they begin to distinguish pertinent history from extra information that points to an example of a zebra. Could this patient have bird- watcher's lung? Maybe, but it's more likely to be pneumo nia. Learning Objectives: Distinguish between pertinent history and low yield information; Critically evaluate the patient's history for important details for a clinical presenta tion. Differentiating Differential Diagnoses: This teaching tool helps learner s with basic history -taking and physical exam skills to modify a differential diagnosis for a chief complaint as they progress through their exam. I aim to help learners direct t heir questions and physical exam maneuvers based upon their differential diagnosis. Learning Objectives create a differential diagnosis based on epidemiology, history, and physical exam. Evaluate a differential diagnosis based on each phase of the exam. Le arner- Led Learning Objectives: This is a technique that will allow learners to make complex topics more accessible by controlling the organization, depth, and speed of learning. They not only access existing knowledge, but also create the framework under w hich the topic will be learned to best understand the material and provide opt imal scaffolding. Learning Objectives develop the ability to create their own scaffolding for learning complex concepts to help self - directed learning of complex topics, and esta blish level -appropriate goals to optimize learning. Evaluation Plan/Results: Attendees will walk away with 3 lesson plan ideas that can be customized to fit their areas of specialty and learners' needs. Learning Objectives employ systematic teaching modul es for medical students; Foster critical thinking in learners with a reproduci ble approach; and Appreciate the efficacy of formalized lesson plans for medical students. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: I hope this presentation builds a culture of creatin g lesson plans to teach discrete skills in medical education. By using systema tic lesson plans for clinical thinking, we can better prepare students for residency, residents for practice, & teachers to help learners reach those goals.

Need/Rationale: Studies have shown that even though the digital models (web -based) are gaining popularity to teach different tec hniques and interventions for health care, putting one's ha nd on an object helps to achieve better performance (Pawiluna & Drake, 2013). There is clearly a lack of realistic models for realistic training in dentistry, as the available standardized anatomic al models do not provide the characteristics required for s pecific training needs. The use of customized training models will provide the students and faculties the opportunity to learn skills in a realistic environment, that otherwise could be only learned through clinical experience, where the educational experi ence is limited to the incidence of specific cases. With more realistic training the students will be better prepared to successfully manage any conditions he/she may encounter in their practice. Methods: The design of the models will be carried out by ad ding a new module to the software used in the CADCAM center at Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC. Models will print and process using the 3D printers of the CADCAM center. The design and pri nting of the models will be completed from January 2019 thr ough July 2019. The customized training modules implementing the use 3D printed models will take place from July 2019 to November 2019 at the Orofacial pain and oral Medicine center at Herman Ostro w School of Dentistry of USC. Five training interventions h ave been identified: 1) temporal tendon injection; 2) lateral pterygoid identification; 3) location and removal of salivary gland stones; 4) removal of bone sequestrum from the mandible; and 5) int raoral splint delivery. A session with students and profess ionals will be conducted prior to the first training module to validate the usefulness of the models and to do any required adjustments. Evaluation Plan/Results: Since this project is in the \"idea \" stage it has not been tested yet; however, a comparison o f the level of satisfaction, before and after the educational experience (using the 3D printed models) can be carried out using a satisfaction survey. Also, we plan to evaluate the performance of t he participants with a rubric with performance criteria. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: With the use of customized training kits, we are assuring to provide more realistic educational experience for the students and the professional who wants to obtain additional training.

Need/Rationale: The integration of 3D printing into medical education mirrors the expansion of technology into healthcare. By enabling students and residents to uti lize means to create novel simulation models, we hope to unlock untapped means of tactile learning. 3D printing allows us to create models of any pathology present in the human body - in doing so, we are creating the opportunity for students to be able to practice procedures previously not a ccessible. Not only have we already created multiple simulation models that will be on display at this conference, but we hope to organize a community of interested physicians and educators across the world to create an open dialogue about other potential uses that we foresee 3D printing having in positively impacting healthcare and medical education. Ultimately, we hope to create a forum that allows for communication across medical specialty and healthcare provider field to ensure that we are created tools aimed at the betterment of patient outcomes. Methods: After creating novel medical simulation models including an emergency department thoracotomy; lumbar puncture; chest tube; subclavian line; burr hole; s, we will be holding dedicated conf erence days in which resident physicians and medical students will practice these procedures. By utilizing the 3D printed materials, we are able to create these models for a fraction of the cost as otherwise available mo dels (example: typical thoracotomy s imulation mannequin cost $15,000; our 3D printed simulation mannequin $60), allowing clinicians to perform an increased number of repetitions on each model. We are hoping these data sets can be further extrapolated into finding a 'number needed to be compe tent' for young physicians performing rarely seen procedures. We will then be utilizing several objective measurement surveys including anxiety, stress, and competency in performing these procedures to determine if the i ncreased exposure to said procedures and clinical scenarios helps decrease anxiety and increase competence. Over time, we would like to track this data longitudinally to correlate increased exposure and practice to clinical outcomes. Evaluation Plan/Results: We will be evaluating medical st udents and resident physicians by using a series of surveys assessing a multitude of variables including confidence and anxiety. Ultimately, we will be implementing these 3D printing models into the curriculum of clinici ans and tracking procedure logs throughout their training. In doing so we will be able to assess number of attempts it takes to successfully perform a procedure, stress and anxiety, and eventually how this translates to overall increases in healthcare qual ity. As of now, the single largest a rea it has been seen in published research has been surgical planning; this leaves an untapped potential for the expansion of its utility in various fields including patient and medical education. In focusing on the latt er, we hope to increase not only the frequency in which clinicians are able to see and practice certain procedures, but vastly expand the catalogue of currently available pathologies. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: 3D printing has just begun being integrated into medicine- we aim to harness its potential and combine it with our creative drive to further medical education. These simulations are the first step in utilizing a new form of technology to ultimately develop more competent and experienced clini cians.

Need/Rationale: With the growing epidemic of cardiovascular disease, there has been an increased interest for research in age- related loss of cardiomyocytes. Over the past five years, our lab has addressed this concern and simultaneously produced a powerful teaching model, CTE3D, which exposes students to graduate -level res earch, regenerative medicine, and practical surgical skills. Our project aims to model a clinical scenario wherein cardiac tissue derived from the patient is grown in laboratory tissue culture, modified genetically, and return ed to the patient as a therape utic living surgical suture. This model promotes hypothesis -based inquiry, employing the process of scientific modeling, and the use of advanced laboratory techniques that many medical students seek. With the rapidly accumulat ing research data supporting c ell therapies, there has been increasing consumer attention to stem cell treatments that graduates of this program will have knowledge and experience in. Methods: Our teaching curriculum, CTE3D: A Cardiac Tissue Engineering o n 3D CAD Printed Substrates, s pans 4 modules: Module 1: Personalized medicine, tissue regeneration, and advanced cell culture sterile techniques are discussed. P19CL6 stem cells are used to grow myocardial tissue on fibrin matrices. Cells are monitored usi ng inverted microscopes, digit al cameras, HD monitors and imaging software. Module 2: Instruction in sterile laboratory techniques is initiated by peer mentors. Cell -signaling pathways (wnt/- catenin) are discussed and basic controls for cardiac differenti ation are established using di methyl sulfoxide (DMSO); at 14 days, contractile behavior (\"beating\") predictably appears. Module 3: Trends in manipulating electrically responsive tissues, novel biomaterials and cell delivery form the basis of a literature s earch. Students are given acce ss to CAD software and a 3D printer, various suture materials, fibrin components and differentiation factors and are encouraged to engineer novel ways to enhance contractile behavior. Module 4: Students design projects incorporating techniques and cell mat erials learned and utilized over the course. One project is elected by lab participants and principal investigator to be carried out. The most recent summer 2018 project elected to be carried out built upon previous summer innovations by utilizing \"seeded\" sutures to repair pig heart tissue, mimicking difficulties encountered during heart valve surgery. Evaluation Plan/Results: CTE3D will be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. First, students will be surveyed prior to entering the educational course (CTE3D) and again at the end of the module or semester on the content, level of difficulty, and their perceived level of mastery of the concepts. Second, faculty members teaching the course using CTE3D will be asked to j udge its effectiv eness in monitoring student achievement throughout the semester. Third, faculty members who have been teaching CTE3D courses for several years will be asked to compare students' abilities after using CTE3D with those in previous years who have not used CTE3D. Fourth, the final grades of students using CTE3D will be compared with those from previous years who have not yet engaged with these technologies. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Students who complete the CTE3D curriculum demonstrat e interest in pursuing stem cell research, potentially fulfilling major unmet needs, including cell therapy for treating heart failure. Medical students seeking a surgery residency will receive early experience in surgical repairs and grafts.

Need/Rationale: Health care students learn to document their cases using different templates for health care records, such as electronic systems. These methods have become popular considering the possibility of making this process very efficient. In recent years, we have seen the widespread implementation of electronic health record sys tems and th e challenges related to recording the information accurately and in a time sensitive manner. If the information is collected in a more efficient way, the provider can spend more time analyzing the data and making decisions (Bauman et al., 2018; Newgart, 20 12). Furthermore, the use of additional features, such as smart questionnaires and symptom checkers might contribute to the training process in collecting information and making decisions. Methods: The first step will be creating a template of the clinical records needed in the center, which will include the data recorded in every appointment. This template will have all the information needed to determine the correct diagnosis. After, a complete system of smart questionnaires and diagnostic algorithms wil l review and create a database of the records that already exist in the clinic. A revision of the diagnostics already in the clinic's database will provide data for the algorithms. These algorithms will be reviewed by experts and treatment plans . They will also be involved in every diagnosis, allowing clinicians, students, residents and faculty to faster reach a diagnosis and treatment plan. The system will have different stages of tests to satisfy the HIPAA and professional requirements. Evaluation Plan/R esults: The delivery of this idea has five components: 1) Design the electronical medical record; 2) Development; 3) Test and comparison with the current system; 4) Implementation in the clinic; 5) Time efficiency measurement and focus group wit h the users . Since this project is in the \"idea\" stage, we have not tested yet; however, we plan to collect the data with focus groups of the users to evaluate the time efficiency, treatment and diagnostic accuracy. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: With a customized electronic medical record specific for the clinical of orofacial and oral medicine, we can obtain a more accurate diagnosis for the patient in less time.

Need/Rationale: This project began as part of a recently qualified doctor's coursework to improve professional practice whilst studying at Swansea University in Wales, United Kingdom. The aim was to create a te aching project that would have an impact upon a department in a hospital and an interest in Paediatrics steered the project to the speciality. A Paediatrician at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) in the Swansea area was co nsulted for ideas that would benefit his department. A variety of ideas were discussed, but the concept of creating a learning resource to help improve the knowledge of nurses and medical students in Paediatric vital signs, stood out from the rest. Learning vital si gns in children is a more difficult proposition to the adult equivalent for medical and nursing students due to the different values for different ages and sizes. It became apparent that there is a demand for an interactive electronic learning re source cou ld be created, since there was nothing in existence like it. It was important that the project be innovative and that it addressed a current need in the clinical setting. Furthermore, it was an attractive concept as it created an educational link between nurses, doctors and medical students, fostering a multi -disciplinary approach to medical education. As the project developed, it was seen that it could be wide reaching and be used throughout the world to improve healthcare in children. Methods: It was dec ided at the outset that this learning resource would be self -directed and computer based for ease of distribution. Research was carried out into Computer Based Teaching Methods (CBTM). Several randomised controlled trials have been carried out on CBTM, showing it to be an improvement or comparable to traditional methods in teaching efcacy (Lau, 2014). Students learn at their own pace, in a convenient place and time, whilst concentrating on personal weaknesses. This is done at low cost and can be disseminat ed easily. Education techniques such as Bloom's Taxonomy and Cognitive Load Theory were considered as the resource has different learning levels and interactive quizzes for personal evaluation. It was created on PowerPoint for ease of distributio n locally but has been controlled to work like a computer programme. It is planned to create a smart phone app for distribution further afield. It was essential that the information provided be reliable and figures came from sources such as the Advance Pae diatric Li fe Support data (Samuels & Wieteska, 2011) and NICE guidelines (NICE, 2013). The resource is supported by electronic links to these well trusted sources. It was necessary to ensure that the learning resource succeeds in its aims to improve knowle dge and th is was found out by gathering feedback from trial users. This was carried out with medical students from the Swansea and Cardiff Universities in Wales with a Likert scale questionnaire. Evaluation Plan/Results: The resource was initially circula ted amongs t Paediatricians in Swansea for informal feedback who were impressed by it and said that there was nothing similar available. The formal feedback from students was also very positive with users commenting on ease of use and their surprise that PowerPoint c ould be used to create something like it. They found it easy to navigate and understand, with the information given in bitesize chunks, in a step by step fashion for ease of learning. The learners also appreciated how interactive quizzing progres sed to a s ummary quiz that tied in all the learning points. The respondents could rate their knowledge before and after using the resource on a scale that included: Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good and Excellent. 100% of those asked climbed up the scale after u sing the r esource with the majority moving one or two groups. The respondents also provided good feedback on how the resource could be improved and problems were rectified. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: More trials are planned to refine the resource a nd work is starting to convert the resource into an App for smart phones to broaden its reach. Extra features will include the ability to enter a patient's age and vital signs, with the app informing if the values are within normal range. 192 References : 1) Lau, K. H. (201 4).

Need/Rationale: Self-directed learning is an important part of the growth of medical students. It allows the student to take initiative and ident ify their own learning needs. As part of a pilot project at our institution, we developed and implemented a program for senior medical students rotating at our university based emergency department to self- identify and ac complish an educational goal by the time they completed their 4 week required EM clerkship. The students were free to develop an educational goal based on their own learning needs. It was suggested that the students consider focusing on a goal that could b e applied directly to patient care such as improving or the application of medical knowledge or developing a clinical or procedural skill. Methods: Guidelines to develop a self -identified educational goal and learning plan were distributed to the students prior to the start of their 4 week EM clerkship. The guidelines included the objective of the pilot project, a detailed step -by-step process to develop an educational goal and an independent learning plan. The guidelines included examples of an educationa l goal along with a self -identified goal worksheet. Each student was assigned a resident or faculty mentor to assist them in refining and accomplishing their goal. Mentor guidelines were also developed to guide and standardize the process. The students use d a \"SMART\" acronym approach to develop their educational goal, which describes that a goal that should be: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time -bound. In addition, the students reviewed the revised Bloom's Taxonomy listing of action verbs t o help them categorize the goal they set out to accomplish. The students were also provided with clinical release time during their EM clerkship (up to two, four hour blocks of time) to accomplish their goal. Evaluation Plan/Results: In the first 4 months of the 2018 -2019 academic year, al l 39 students participated in the pilot program. Thirty three (85%) students completed a post -clerkship questionnaire. Twenty eight (85%) reported that they were able to accomplish their educational goal by the end of the rotation. Nineteen (58%) of the ed ucational goals were categorized as procedural skills, 7 (21%) were clinical skills and 7 (21%) were knowledge base goals. The single most common (7, 21%) goal was learning how to perform an ultrasound guided peripheral i ntravenous line. Few students (3, 9 %), used their clinical release time to accomplish their goal. All students felt it was helpful to use the SMART approach to develop their goal, 30 (91%), felt it was helpful to incorporate the revised Bloom's taxonomy to categorize their goal. Thirty two (97%) reported that it was worthwhile to develop a goal and try to accomplish it. Most (30, 91%), felt that they were given enough time develop a goal and design a plan to accomplish it. All students felt it was helpful t o be assigned a mentor and all stud ents communicated with their mentors by email, 14 (42%) met face to face with their mentors during their rotation. Twenty nine (89%) students noted that they were likely to incorporate this type of activity into a future clinical rotation. All students rep orted that accomplishing their goal (or attempting to) provided them with new knowledge, a new clinical or procedural skill. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Empowering students to self -identify and accomplish an educat ional goal is possible and achievab le within a 4 week clerkship. Universally, the pilot program was viewed as a worthwhile experience and most students were able to accomplish their goal during the clerkship. References: 194 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM Large Saturday Poster Session, Poster #091 Using Text Messaging to Infuse Primary Care Education into a Packed Residency Program Curriculum Stuart, Elizabeth Stanford School of Medicine Idea/Problem Statement: Case- based curriculum delivered via weekly text messaging to boost pri mary care education in a pediatrics residency program. Need/Rationale: As residency training requirements expand, space in the formal curriculum becomes constrained. In large academic medical centers, clinic al service demands have a significant impact on how residents spend their time. Hospital -based medicine and subspecialty care often dominate residents' educational awareness and experience. During pediatrics residency program reviews at Stanford in recent years, residents have identified training in pri mary care as an area needing more attention. Given limited time and resources, efforts to expand the formal curriculum in general outpatient pediatrics have had limited success. As part of a broader effort to address the perceived need for more training in primary care, we launched a case -based curriculum, delivered via weekly text messaging to residents' mobile phones. Our goal was to weave a recognizable, enjoyable, yet unobtrusive educational thread through residents' weekly routines, so that primary car e might take on a greater presence as part of the culture of the program. Methods: The Primary Care Quick Text Curriculum was launched in 2015. Core learning objectives align with the formal, written curricu la for continuity clinic and block rotations in primary care. Broad content areas include Prevention; Safety; Parenting; Common Physical Problems and Concerns; and Development and Behavior. Most texts are created by the program's faculty director. Resident s and other faculty have contributed questions f rom time to time. Residents subscribe to the program by providing their cell phone numbers and mobile carriers to the curriculum director. Subscribers receive a Quick Text roughly once per week. Text messages consist of links to brief, case -based questions and answers - built using online survey software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Messages include 1- 3 questions on a single topic and are designed to be informative and entertaining. Residents are not required to su bmit answers to questions in order to see associated teaching points. Participation is voluntary and entirely formative. Evaluation Plan/Results: To date, we have not developed a plan to formally evaluate the program. Anecdotally, residents enjoy receivin g texts. Some read them immediately on receipt; others save them for later review. We have the opportunity to analyze data on utilization and perceived value of the Quick Text program in promoting learning. The survey software used to build curriculum ques tions analysis descriptive analysis of which que stions have been started and completed, how often residents answer questions vs. scrolling directly to responses, and other logistical aspects of resident participation. Our greatest interest is in learning w hether and how to modify the curriculum - where to take it next - and whether it is helping us meet the goal of shining more light on education in primary care. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Our work has the potential to add to the emerging literature on text messaging in medical education - particularly as a strategy to address unmet needs when curriculum time and resources are constrained.

Need/Rationale: Global Health jobs require applicants to have a baseline level of \"hard skills\" - for instance, the fundamental knowledge of biolo gy, statistics, and access/barriers to health, We believe that an additional set of skills - deemed \"emotional skills\" and \"soft skills\" - are also necessary, both in finding a job in global health and prospering in it. Soft/Emotional skills can be summed up as \"personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with other people.\" While hard skills are routinely taught at universities, emotional skills and soft skills are rarely introduced. It is our goal to search online job listings in the Global Health field to identify the most sought after traits from applicants. If our numerical data shows a high demand for certain emotional/soft skills, it will provide us the rat ionale to integrate the teaching of soft/emotional skills into our Global Health curriculum, thus leading to more well -rounded and sought after applicants. Methods: Data Collection: We created a custom \"data crawler\" to scan various leading job portals (i .e. indeed.com, Glassdoor, LinkedIn), flagging any job list ings, within the greater Los Angeles area, that fall within the \"global health\" field. The data crawler separated out \"global health\" jobs based on our selection algorithm, flagging job openings that contained some keywords, including but not limited to: c linical, hospital, nutrition, biostatistics, and therapy. From there, each job listing flagged by the crawler is manually verified for authenticity. With a verified list of global health job openin gs in Los Angeles, we used an Information Extractor to scan each job description, identifying the most important skills in each description. We tried two separate approaches. First, we provided the Information Extractor with a comprehensive list of \"emotio nal skills\" and \"soft skills\" that we previously deemed important, and used the Extractor to keep track of the number of times these skills were highlighted in job listings. Secondly, we configured the Information Extractor to use the TF -IDF (term frequenc y and inverse document frequency) technique, thus identifyi ng the most important words in the document. By filtering out \"stop words,\" our Information Extractor created its own list of high yield soft skills and emotional skills. Through these methods, we obtained a frequency chart for both soft and emotional skil ls. Evaluation Plan/Results: The following results are from scanning 3,200 Los Angeles job descriptions in the Global Health field. In our first approach, where our Information Extractor scanned j ob descriptions from our previous list of soft/emotional Sk ills, these are the top 5 mentioned skills from each category: Emotional skills are Professional (n=853, and Initiative (n=183, 5.7%). In our second approach, we let the Information Extractor identify the mos t important words in the documents. The top 5 emotional ski lls identified included 4 from the previous list (Professional, Caring, Empathy, and Sensitivity), and included the term \"Considerate\" (n=153, 4.8%) as its fifth term. The top 5 soft skills identif ied included 3 from the previous list (Innovation, Teamwork , and Cooperation), and included the terms \"Self and Judgment (n=240, 7.5%). Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We confirmed our belief that certain soft and emotional skills play a vital role in an applicant's ability to get hire d in the Global Health field. Soft and emotional skills must be emphasized by professors in our Global Health program to prepare graduates for success in the field References: 1) \"Mappin g the global health employment market: an analysis of global health jobs \" https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889 2) indeed.com, LinkedIn.com, GlassDoor.com 196 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM Large Saturday Poster S ession, Poster #093 Improving Common Curricula Deficits with Virtual Learning Videos Dopp, Austin; Klesmith, Nathan; Self, Scott Medical College of Wisconsin Idea/Problem Statement: Medical students will improve content retention, empathy, and burn- out through standardized videos which supplement curricular patient interact ions. Need/Rationale: Across the country, there is a movement among medical schools to reform their curriculums in ways that improve knowledge retention, improve empathy, and reduce learner burn -out. Studies have found that virtual technology improves kno wledge retention in contrast to traditional lectures. Despite the desire to improve, there is a decline in empathy throughout their time in school and burn- out is a common problem among learners. With these goals in mind, we plan to develop a series of educational videos that can be integrated into the first two years of medical school curricula and are designed to improve medical student retention, increase empathy , and reduce burnout. This will be achieved through greater exposure to patient experiences a nd common scenarios seen in a clinical setting. Methods: Our project will focus on improving first and second -year medical student curriculum through online video s. Over the course of eight months, we will produce ten videos at the Medical College of Wisc onsin. We will recruit community physicians and patients to participate in both one- on-one interview and demonstrative exam videos. They will be chosen through a pre - interview process to determine qualities that are beneficial to the goals of the video su ch as charisma, knowledge and medical history. Scripts for the videos will be written by the team by combining important concepts from relevant Step 1 material as well as pre -interview material. Once videos have been created, 50 first -year medical students will be recruited and randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group will be shown a set of newly created videos and lect ure content from previous years, while the control group will only be shown the previous year s' material. Both groups will take a multiple -choice exam on the content of the videos as well as subjective questions regarding empathy and burn -out as it relates to the videos. After two weeks they will be asked to take the same exam but with randomized question order. They may request correct answers post reexamination. Evaluation Plan/Results: Exam results will be used to compare immediate retention and retenti on after two weeks. Each of the 5 sets of videos will be uploaded online and viewers will be encouraged to complete an online feedback form. Questions will inquire on topics such as content quality, application, and potential impact on empathy and burn -out. Feedback will be reviewed for common themes and changes may be made to future and current v ideos to improve their quality and appeal to viewers. Feedback will also be sought one -on-one from professors as to how they might be able to implement videos into their lectures. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Integration of content nationally will im prove knowledge retention and address known deficits in current curricula subsequently producing competent and compassionate physicians with good character traits.

Need/Rationale: In an era of rapidly evolving technologies, the next generation of heal thcare professionals must become competent in delivering clinical services remotely. Nationally, however, little standardized telehealth edu cation exists in training programs. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is working to provide a formalized mo del of telehealth education for its more than 120,000 trainees from 165 allopathic and osteopathic medical schools and over 1,800 unique col leges. The VA has already delivered over 12 million telehealth encounters and has developed extensive educational materials for its clinicians. Now the VA is using its clinician telehealth curriculum and telehealth best practices to design a telehealth education infrastructure for all healthcare trainees who rotate through its more than 150 facilities (1). In the proces s VA is addressing policy issues to facilitate telehealth for trainees, including: 1) Legislation to address trainee licenses to deliver tel ehealth across state lines, and 2) Accrediting body regulations (e.g., ACGME) regarding remote care by and supervisi on of trainees. Methods: This intervention focuses on the 120,000+ healthcare professional trainees that rotate through over 150 VA healthcare facilities throughout the nation. The development of standardized national telehealth education began with an assessment of the scope of t elehealth training and found 69% of all medical centers were providing individualized telehealth training opportun ities for trainees. The intervention to provide national standardized telehealth education for trainees is: 1) Using existing VA Telehealth Tr aining Curricula for clinicians and making it available to all trainees; 2) Developing an inventory of telehealth trained clinicians and pairing them with trainees for supervised telehealth training opportunities; 3) Cataloguing best practices in telehealt h training at VA facilities throughout the country; 4) Addressing policy obstacles such as training license and ac creditation agency limitations. Graduate, undergraduate and associated health trainees are receiving telehealth didactics, participating in li ve interactive telehealth simulation sessions, and being matched with experienced telehealth supervising attendings to conduct their own telehealth services. Training will address video across healthcare facilities (e.g., from the main medical center to ou tpatient clinics) and video delivered to the patient via mobile devices (e.g., into their home on smart phones), a long with store and forward modalities (e.g., dermatology and pathology) and future web -based applications. Evaluation Plan/Results: Evaluation of the development of a national standardized telehealth education model for trainees will be measured quantita tively and qualitatively. The numbers and expansion of didactic web -based trainings completed by trainees will be tracked along with the volum e of their simulation sessions. Each facility will provide data on the numbers and types of telehealth trainee opportunities they are offering, and we are developing a coding mechanism to be able to more quickly and accurately identify and track telehealth encounters that are specifically delivered by trainees. Once in place we will be able to evaluate successful expa nsion across sites, disciplines, specialties, and telehealth modalities. Telehealth satisfaction surveys for providers and patients will be ex panded to specifically assess trainee attitudes towards the telehealth training and experience itself. We will als o be reviewing survey information collected by the academic affiliates. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The development of standardized tel ehealth education can serve as a model for providing the future generation off all healthcare trainees with compet ence in the skills necessary for them to deliver effective care in an era of innovative and evolving technologies.

Need/Rationale: Despite rigorous medical school prerequisites, encountering medical school curriculum for the first time can be overwhelming, with anatomy often acknowledged as one of the most challenging courses. Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in Harlem (TouroCOM) offers a one -year, 43 cr edit, Master of Science Program in Interdisciplinary Studies in Biological and Physical Sciences (MS) program, which features classes ta ught by medical college faculty alongside Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) candidates. Success in the program guarant ees students direct admission into the DO program at TouroCOM. TouroCOM offers a non -credit, four -week, intensive summer anatomy course, which aims to ease the transition into a medical school -level curriculum for both incoming MS and DO candidates. This s tudy aims to evaluate the effectiveness of TouroCOM's four -week Summer anatomy course in preparing its MS candidates for their 43 credit curriculum and successful promotion into the DO program. Methods: Subjects consisted of all MS candidates from the cla ss of 2016 and class of 2017 at Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in Harlem. Quantitative data was collected on written and practica l exam performance throughout the first semester anatomy course as well as final course grade. Qualitative information w as also gathered on participation in the four -week summer anatomy program and successful promotion into the DO program. Statistical sign ificance was measured by comparing percentages of grouped study participants with one sample t -testing and the resulting p-values. Results with a p- value under 0.05 were reported as statistically significant. Evaluation Plan/Results: Summer anatomy course participation was ultimately correlated with successful subsequent promotion into the DO program and final course grade for 1st semester anatomy. Of the 138 total participants included in this study, 26 students from the class of 2016 and 16 students from the class of 2017 participated in the summer anatomy program. Of the 2016 and 2017 MS candidates who were promoted into the following DO class, 69% (n=38) received a final course grade of A- or above in first semester anatomy. Only 3.6% (n=2) of 2016 and 2017 MS candidates who received a final first semester anatomy course grade of B - or below went on to promote into the D O class. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: It may be of value for medical schools to offer a similar, non - weighted introductory course to students entering their first year of medical school to ease the transition into a rigorous medical school curriculum and establish a strong foundation for future practice as a physician.

Need/Rationale: It is well established that adolescents require a certain amount of sleep to promote healthy growth, development, and performance. However teenagers continue to get sub -optimal amounts of sleep on a regular basis. Hom ework, extracurricular activities, social influences, electronics, and responsibilities at home impact adol escents' ability to get adequate sleep. Additionally, adolescents' circadian rhythms, controlled by the release of melatonin, are normally shifted la ter compared to what adults and children experience. This unique physiology makes it difficult for teens to adapt their sleep schedule to a \"normal\" school or work day and still get the recommended amount of sleep. Adolescent sleep researchers highlight th e importance of sleep education to help teens understand and develop more healthy sleep behaviors. This stu dy investigated whether an interactive after- school course and journal project would improve high school freshmen's sleep literacy and habits regardi ng sleep. Methods: A curriculum was designed to teach high school freshmen at Bravo High School about topi cs including sleep physiology, the impacts of sleep and sleep deprivation on health, and behavior changes to help improve sleep. Subjects were recrui ted with help from school administration through their required Health class. Selected students attended fo ur 1-hour long classes held at the high school after school hours. The classes were taught by the principal investigator and consisted of interactive lectures and discussion, as well as a 4 -week sleep behavior change project and journal. The lectures were supplemented by the use of Kahoot!, a popular game -based learning platform that allows students to answer instructor's questions and contribute discussion points using their smart phones or computers. Pre- and post -course surveys recorded hours of sleep, b ed times, and sleep- related knowledge. Journals created by the participants also elicited helpful information including nightly sleep hours, personal goals for sleep- related behavior changes, and challenges with sticking to these goals. PHQ -9 assessments were also utilized to measure student depression. Of the 29 students who were recruited, 18 (6 boys, 12 girls) completed all parts of the course and w ere included in statistical analysis. T- tests were used to analyze pre- to post -test change in mean test sc ores and hours of sleep, and linear regression was used to determine the trendline of sleep hours over the course of the study. Evaluation Plan/Resu lts: By the conclusion of the course, students' performance on the post -survey demonstrated an overall improvement in their sleep knowledge (p=0.003). Total number of sleep hours trended upward over the course of the 4 -week sleep behavior change project (R 2=0.0045). In 2016, this curriculum was used without the aid of Kahoot game -based learning, and changes in sleep knowledge were evaluated using the same pre - and post -survey as was used in this study to teach a different sample of 18 high school freshmen a t Bravo. In this 2018 study where Kahoot was used to supplement the curriculum, post -survey scores were inc reased compared to those in the 2016 study without Kahoot (p=0.052). Homework was the most common barrier which prevented students from getting their desired amount of sleep, cited by 83% of students as a reason for not sleeping more. The two most common ways students were successful in getting to bed earlier were (1) by being more efficient with their homework throughout the day (37% of students), and (2) by reducing the use of technology prior to going to bed (37% of students). Students reported increased use of a consistent bed time on weeknights and weekend nights as a sleep aid, which was a key teaching point. PHQ -9 scores trended downward over the course of the study, as did the number of subjects with moderate or more severe depression. Subjects repor ted improvements in mood, tiredness, and energy, and less caffeine use. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Educational intervention plus an interacti ve task may improve sleep and health in high school students, which can help students feel better and perfo rm better at 200 school. Programs such as this will also highlight the specific barriers students face which prevent them from getting adequate sleep. References: 1) Owens, J., & Weiss, M. (n.d.).

Need/Rationale: \"Burnout\" has become a hot topic in the domain of learners and clinicians, including physicians, residents, medical students, and even undergraduates considering the medical field. The concept has been linked to not only poor patient outcom es, but also individual struggles with depression, anxiety, empathy and professionalism (Dyrbye et al., 2008), both in the United States and internationally (Guruprakash et al., 2018). More concerning, burno ut has also been tied to increased suicidal ideat ion, which is an ever -expanding burden across the country. Despite a growing understanding of the risks and potential interventions for exhausted learners, students continue to experience burnout at alarming rates. This negative outcome is underpinned to s ome extent by the pressure faced by medical educators and students alike to ensure they fulfill curriculum requirements and maximize their accomplishments - including high performance on the USMLE - in order to excel in a remarkably competitive atmosphere. With the myriad studies of associations between student -resident -physician burnout and various personal, professional, and patient outcomes, to date no studies have examined how medical student burnout may predict USMLE step 1 performance. The current stu dy seeks to fill this study gap and potentially highlight the necessity of focusing on student wellness as a foundational component of medical education programs, as well as the independent study strategies taught to learners. Methods: The sample will inc lude approximately 100 second year medical students at Central Michigan University in Mt. Pleasant, MI. Students will be assessed regarding their burnout and coping mechanisms at two different time points: f irst, early in the academic year, and second, prior to taking the USMLE Step 1. Responses to questionnaires will then be correlated with USMLE Step 1 performance, once scores are released. Assessments will include the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (Masla ch and Jackson, 1981) as well as a survey of pers onal wellness techniques used and time devoted to personal wellness. The MBI is a 22 item survey of work -related feelings including subscales of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accompli shment. Surveys will take between 5 -10 minutes to complete and will be voluntary for students. Individual responses will be kept confidential, and identifying data will only be used to properly link USMLE scores to surveys. Data analysis will be performed with an entirely deidentified data set. Evaluation Plan/Results: Analysis will seek to identify trends in medical student burnout over the course of the academic year leading up to USMLE Step 1. These trends will be compared to individual wellness practic es reported by students. Finally, the relationship between wellness practices / burnout scores and USMLE Step 1 scores will be evaluated. The goal of the research design is to isolate factors associated with trends in burnout of medical students as well as predictors of USMLE Step 1 performance. Potenti al Impact/Lessons Learned: Results may encourage learners and educators to include burnout prevention and wellness practices as essential considerations while devising independent study techniques and curric ulum design. This has the potential to not only i mprove mental health of students, but also USMLE Step 1 scores. References: 1) Debyre, L., Thomas, M., Massie, S., et al. (2008).

Need/Rationale: This research will be a crucial first -step examination into the general well -being and job satisfaction of neurology and psych iatry residents. The concept of \"burnout\" has been operationally - defined as physical and emotional drain that begets a reduced ability, or inability, to perform work and care-giving tasks adequately. Literature in this field revea ls that the prevalence of burnout may peak during medical education, including medical school and further training (i.e., residency). The implications of burnout are far -reaching, having an impact on both professional care delivery and self -care. Professio nals who provide health and human services stand out as a group at a particular risk for burnout. Research has previously indicated that lower rates of burnout are an indicator of wellness, but this has not been appropriately validated empirically. The imp ortance of wellness, however, is so entrenched in the culture of clinical practice that medical education settings have introduced policies in recent years to promote well -being among learners. Longstanding theories of career development that extol the importance of strong self -concept and satisfaction as well as the simultaneous attention given to burnout and wellness in the literature suggest that their relationship is likely beyond contrived. Methods: Using a model previously employed with an internatio nal healthcare staff, residents in neurology, child neurology, and psychiatry will be administered the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI -HSS (MP)), the Patient Health Nine -Item Questionnaire (PHQ -9), and the Accreditation Council for Graduat e Medical Education (ACGME) Well -Being survey questions at 0, 6, and 9 -month time points. The anticipated N for the study is 51 residents. In addition to descriptive statistics, means- analyses will be run within and across groups, as well as examining the goodness- of-fit to the concept of the ACGME well -being questions. Evaluation Plan/Results: Participants from adult neurology, adult psychiatry, and child neurology residency programs will be provided with a link for an online sur vey, hosted by a secure se rver to facilitate anonymity and confidentiality (SurveyMonkey.com). Their participation will be non -compulsory (i.e., participation will NOT be a requirement of their training or education), and they will be compensated for their time ($5 Starbucks gift c ard). They will have the right to discontinue at any time, at no cost or penalty. Participants will complete a brief demographic survey; questions will include (but may not be limited to) residency year, residency track, age, and gender (if they choose to respond). These demographic variables will be linked to a generated, anonymous participant ID. No names or identifying information will be collected. Participants will respond to an electronic version of the MBI -HSS (MP), PHQ -9, and the ACGME Well -Being Su rvey. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: These results will guide further experimental intervention to bolster any deficits that may be identified with regard to burnout and wellness. Further, with minimal adjustments, the project should be applicable to r esidency programs in other specialties. References: 1) Eckleberry -Hunt J, Van Dyke A, Lick D, Tucciarone J.

Need/Rati onale: An important aspect of caring for the biopsychosocial needs of patients is addressing their spirituality, and it has been shown that the majority of patients would welcome their physician's inquiry regarding their spiritual needs. Moreover, many ph ysicians feel that faith plays an important role in healing. Despite this, large review studies have shown that physicians infrequently address the spiritual needs of their patients. One of the largest barriers that physicians report when asked about why spirituality is infrequently addressed is lack of training as to how to approach this topic with their patients. The ACGME emphasizes training physicians to address the biopsychosocial aspects of a patient's health through competency -directed curricula that address interpersonal communication skills. However, few curricula have been developed to teach physicians how to incorporate spiritual care into their practice and few spiritual care curricula exist amongst residency training programs. Methods: A needs assessment survey was sent to pediatric residents during the 2017 -2018 academic year to assess attitudes and practices involving spiritual care in medicine. A three -part, longitudinal and iterative curriculum was designed to address these identified needs and was implemented during the 2017- 2018 academic year. Session one was a sixty -minute conference that provided an introduction to the importance of spiritual care in medicine and involved discussion of the basic tenets of five common world religions at a large, urban, academic children's hospital. Session two was a twenty -minute case - based role- play activity that taught residents how to take a spiritual history through use of an evidence - based spiritual assessment tool \u2014the HOPE model. Session three was a s ixty-minute case -based discussion panel comprised of physicians, nurses, chaplains and social workers, emphasizing the interdisciplinary approach to spiritual care. A follow -up survey was distributed at the end of the curricular intervention. Surveys were anonymously coded to be able to assess changes in residents' knowledge of spiritual care, attitudes regarding its importance in medicine, and residents' ability to implement spiritual care into their clinical practice. Surveys were analyzed based on qualit ative data provided on a likert scale of 1 to 5 (strongly disagree to strongly agree) and were assessed for statistically significant trends using the one- tailed paired- T test with a p- value of 0.05. Evaluation Plan/Results: A total of 60 needs assessment surveys and 42 post -curriculum intervention surveys were collected. Comparing unique identifiers from pre - and post -surveys, a total of 23 participants were noted to have completed both surveys. Results were then analyzed using a one -tailed paired t -test with a p -value of 0.05. After the intervention, residents felt more strongly that addressing spiritual/religious beliefs with patients is a necessary component of a complete history (p=0.043) and felt more competent addressing spirituality/religion with pa tients and families (p=0.017). In addition, residents expressed increased interest in learning more about how to address spirituality/religion with their patients (p=0.029). Residents also felt that their comprehension of hospital -wide spiritual care resou rces increased after the intervention (p<0.001), moreover, more residents reported utilization of institutional spiritual care resources (43.5% vs 73.9%, p=0.008). Residents continued to report that lack of time was the most significant barrier to their in corporation of spiritual care in their practice (95.6% post - intervention); however, fewer residents felt that little understanding of how spiritual care affects patients was a barrier to their practice of spiritual care (34.8% vs 8.7%, p=0.011 via two -tailed paired t- test). Of all residents who completed the post -intervention survey, 92.9% either agreed or strongly agreed that this intervention added value to their residency education. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Implementing this spiritual care curriculum increased residents' awareness of their patients' spiritual needs and competence in addressing those needs. This spiritual care curriculum is easily reproducible and could be utilized by other institutions to achieve similar results. 205 References : 1) Barnes LL, Plotnikoff GA, Fox K, Pendleton S.

Need/Rationale: Physician burnout and suicide continue to be a major challenge for the medical profession. P hysician burnout is associate d with negative consequences on patient care, healthcare system costs, and physicians' own care and safety (11). An estimated lost productivity annually is equivalent to the loss of seven medical school graduating classes (13). Estimated costs to replace o ne physician range from hundreds of thousands to well over one million U.S. dollars, depending on specialty, practice location, and the duration of the unfilled vacancy (12). Burnout is an effective state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion cause d by excessive and prolonged stress. Although burnout can be prevented with professional help, previous work has demonstrated that over 60% of physicians report a concern over the stigma associated with mental healthcare preven ting them from seeking professional help (4). Therefore, there should be a tool that provides individuals with the skills they need to overcome the symptoms of burnout and achieve the joy and fulfillment that a career in medicine once promised. In the past few decades, in searching fo r an answer to battle physician burnout, the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) emerged and seemed to have a strong inverse relationship to burnout. Unfortunately, few, if any, programs are focused on improving EI to provid e physicians with the skills they need in a setting that would allow them to circumvent the stigma associated with seeking mental health care. Methods: Step 1: In August 2018, a 30 -min presentation on the project's objectives and methods was conducted. Re sidents of all years (CA1, 2 and 3) took an online pre -test using the code in the book, \"Emotional Intelligence 2.0\" by Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves. Maslach burnout inventory and a short demographic data were collected pre -training. Each resident was assigned a unique ID that was used to record all collected data and tests. Step 2: In the upcoming four months, four skills (self - awareness, self -management, social awareness, and relationship management) of emotional intelligence will be discussed during a 30- min interactive present ation. The concept of each skill as well as the strategies to improve individual's competency will be discussed. Dedicating one month to learning one skill will allow each individual time to incorporate the newly learned skill into their daily work/activity, with the hope of improving their emotional intelligence. Additionally, residents will be encouraged to take note of what change that they may observe to share with the group in subsequent presentations. Step 3: At the end of the four months, all residen ts will use the same code that they were provided in Step 1 to take an online post -test and a short post -training survey to objectively and subjectively evaluate their experience with the training. The results from the post -test and survey will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training on individual perceptions of wellness pre- and post -training. Evaluation Plan/Results: This project is intended to be an observational study only. Therefore, no hypothesis or predicted outcomes have been made. In addition, the small sample size (N=15) will not allow drawing any meaningful statistic conclusion. This project intends to provide residents with a tool to improve their EI with hope that these skills will help improve their w ellness and prevent burnout throughout their residency training and career in medicine. The objective measurements using the pre/post- test score from the book will provide some insight on the benefit and effectiveness of the training. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The project has a potential for future training and studies with increased sample sizes in subsequent years. If found to be beneficial and effective, the training may be replicated by other residency programs within or beyond our institution. 207 References: 1) Cherry MG, Fl etcher I, O'Sullivan H, Dornan T.

Need/Rationale: Medical errors are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitals throughout the US today. A strong focus on the reporting of unexpected clinical ev ents and \"near misses\", and the development o f a strong patient safety focused culture, are critical to achieving the goal of safer patient care. Developing a culture that recognizes human errors and behavioral choices as possible system failures that requ ire investigation and evaluation is essential . Just Culture is a methodology that has been studied in multiple settings and effectively uses algorithms to address what are referred to as breeches and duties. While typically applied to patient care settings we have adapted the curriculum to address ch allenges and difficult decisions within the residency program. Some of these relate to patient care, while others relate to organizational processes. Just Culture provides tools to help improve the process of ed ucation and making of decisions with a purpose to change systems rather than punish. Acceptance of the concepts of human fallibility within a residency program creates a new mindset to promote professionalism as a value. Residents participate in a curricul um that teaches focusing on accountability am ongst all health care team members for behavioral choices. Just Culture gives us a curriculum to teach residents that our limited resources can be applied to minimize risk of harm in multiple settings. The purpo se is to change processes, not punish! Methods: Residents are given expanded training in the Just Culture (JC) model from the Chief Patient Safety Officer and DIO. A \"Just Culture Committee\" of residents from all levels of training was created to apply the JC model to resident related issues, identify root causes and propose solutions. All team members are encouraged to bring forward topics for discussion during monthly meetings. JC champion is identified annually and leads process for group. JC methodolog y is used to address 5 fundamental questions: What happened? What normally happens? What does procedure require? Why did it happen? How are we managing it? Each case then is moved through a series of JC algorithms, which guide the conversation toward a roo t cause. A determination is made as to whethe r the event in question was a failure at an organization level, if it represents human error, or if the individual's behavior was at risk or reckless. Action plans include proposed changes to policies and proced ures, individual coaching, remediation, or ot her appropriate disciplinary actions. Punishment is reserved for reckless behavior and/or repetitive errors or repetitive at risk behaviors that cannot be controlled or managed by other means. These plans are th en sent to the Program Director, who consider s the committee's recommendations in final decision making on situations affecting residents and residency program concerns. Evaluation Plan/Results: The ultimate goal of our implementation of Just Culture and the Just Culture Committee is to improve pati ent safety and build team cohesiveness by empowering all team members to voice their concerns in real time. We are able to track the number of instances of events submitted to our hospital's Event Reporting Syst em. Within the residency program, we continue to monitor the effectiveness of the JC Committee through informal conversations held during resident meetings, as well as annual surveys assessing the residents' awareness of and attitudes regarding the committ ee. In examining process and procedural improvements through the application of this model, we can gather data to compare previous rates of preventable adverse events. Thus, we can understand if the changes made by the team improve patient outcomes or incr ease patient safety. We also aim to evaluate the effect the process has on resident's feeling of wellness related to patient safety and challenging decisions. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We ultimately seek to empower our residents to champion cultur es of safety in their future positions. Direc tly applying the Just Culture model as part of their training 209 provides a framework for doing so. Ultimately, this model can lead to enhanced patient outcomes, and improved physician wellbeing. References: 1) Donaldson MS.

Foster School of Medicine Idea/Problem Statement: Using dance to increase intrinsic motivation in health care providers, potentially promoting long- term adherence to exercise and associated benefits. Need/Rationale: Burnout is not only an under recogniz ed crisis but also an increasing problem among Health C are Providers (HCP). However, an increase in exercise has been strongly correlated with reduced overall perceived stress and symptoms of burnout and depression (9). Though, the various physical, mental , and emotional benefits of aerobic exercise are well k nown, many HCPs like physicians and nurses still do not engage in recommended hours of aerobic exercise. This study seeks to find an effective and potentially long- term exercise option for health care professionals in order to promote self - care and holisti c wellbeing among a mentally and emotionally overwhelmed people group. Methods: We will be using a pre - and post -survey to evaluate changes in motivation amongst health care professionals. The pre -survey will be given before participation in any dance cla ss and the post survey will be given to every individual after their completion of five dance classes. The pre - and postsurvey is the same survey allowing us to measure change in motivation. Participants will be given a unique identifier to keep survey information confidential and participants pre - and post -surveys correctly matched up. The dance classes will be taught by four medical students and all classes will be focused on increasing intrinsic moti vation through being fun, engaging, at an appropriate d ifficulty level. The dance classes will only be 30 -40 minutes long and will occur at various times during the week giving many opportunities to participants to attend their five classes. Once we have c ollected all the surveys, Cronbach's alpha will be used to analyze data. Evaluation Plan/Results: We expect to recruit at least 40 Health Care Providers from the medical school, Texas Tech clinics, and nearby hospitals via flyers, word of mouth, and email . The study will end when 40 participants complete thei r pre- and post surveys. If we are unable to recruit the desired amount of people within a three- month period, we will attempt to recruit from other health care centers other than those initially targeted. Throughout the study, if we notice that participan ts have not returned for dance classes in more than two weeks, we will follow up with them via the participant's preferred method of communication. Since every participant will likely be at a different level of dance ability, we will make sure to teach cla sses that cater to our diverse participants in order to maximize their experience. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: If dance successfully increases intrinsic motivation among HCP's, dance could potentially be an effective long -term aerobic exercise alter native to HCP's promoting physical, mental, and emotional wellness in a population of need.

Need/Rationale: Vaccination rates have declined over the past decade due to erroneous clai ms on the association between vaccines and autism (1). A third of California schools with low vaccination rates cluster in Los Angeles County, resulting in outbreaks of vaccine- preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles and pertussis (2). Unfortunately, p ediatric resident physicians often lack the confidence to effectively address parental vaccine hesitancy (3). Such trepidation is likely due to residents' minimal first-hand experiences with VPDs, resulting in misinformation and under -appreciation for vaccination benefits. Increasing popularity and accessibility of anti -vaccination social media platforms further challenge residents' conviction in counseling vaccine hes itancy. Past curriculums utilized mainly lectures and role- playing to improve resident knowledge and counseling techniques. This project aims to expand upon traditional learning modalities to create a tailored curriculum for residents in the modern post - vaccination era. Methods: A multimodality curriculum will be implemented during the 2018 -2019 academic year. Workshop series will take place during resident educational hours, such as noon conferences and clinic lectures for maximal attendance. The workshop s will introduce residents to VPDs and their sequelae, common vaccination misconceptions, vaccine hesitancy counseling strategies, and popular anti - vaccination social media platforms. Vaccine advocacy experts and VPD survivors will be invited to share personal stories to bridge residents' gaps in first- hand knowledge and experiences with VPDs. Residents will participate in role -playing simulations and receive real -time feedback from faculty physicians and peers on their counseling techniques. Social media workshops will train residents to not only critically evaluate and discuss anti -vaccination sentiments with caregivers, but also to utilize online platforms for vaccine advocacy. Residents will also receive training on documenting immunization acceptance ve rsus refusal in AltaMed's electronic medical record system. Evaluation Plan/Results: The project will evaluate 1) changes in resident physicians' knowledge and confidence in vaccine hesitancy counseling and, 2) changes in influenza vaccine acceptance rate at the CHLA's primary care clinic, AltaMed. Learners will complete anonymous pre - and post -curriculum surveys on attitudes on vaccine hesitancy and experiences with VPDs. Collective and individual de - identified responses will be compared to assess for int erval changes. Influenza vaccine administration rate during the 2018 -2019 academic year wi ll be collected from AltaMed and be compared to the administration rate from the previous academic year. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: By improving pediatric res idents' communication skills and providing frameworks for difficult discussions, this multimodality curriculum strengthens pediatricians in their efforts to protect and promote children's health in the modern post -vaccination era.

Need/Rationale: The negative eff ects of childhood poverty on health and psychosocial outcomes are increasingly incorporated into the core competencies of pediatric residency training. As most pediatric trainees lack a personal history of poverty, they may have difficulty connecting with the experiences of low-income patients, resulting in a higher likelihood of unmet needs. Although the Academic Pediatric Association (APA) has developed a comprehensive curriculum on child poverty in the United States, it is inconsistently instituted in pe diatric residency programs due to its length and complexity. Digital storytelling has emerged as a powerful educational platform that can prov ide an engaging introduction to new content, promoting social connection and personal reflection, while helping residents better connect with the needs of their patients. Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) is a safety net hospital that serves a large p opulation of children living in poverty or near -poverty; however, residents are only offered a 2-week introduction to advocacy during their intern year, and three additional advocacy lectures throughout each year. Content of these lectures focus on communi ty resources and legislative advocacy. As there is no formal advocacy education in the inpatient setting, the prop osed curriculum will offer first year pediatric residents on an inpatient rotation the opportunity to improve knowledge and enhance engagement in the topic of child poverty. Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled trial of a novel digital storytelli ng curriculum addressing selected goals and objectives of the APA curriculum will be implemented. Content includes current levels of child and family poverty, the impact of social determinants on health, culturally sensitive screening for indicators of pov erty, and introduction of government assistance programs. Prior to initiation of the study, participants will complete a survey investigating demographic information, previous advocacy experiences, personal history of hardship, screening behaviors, attitud e and comfort with the topic of child poverty, and a 10 -item knowledge test. Face validity of the knowledge test was assessed by pediatricians with expertise in child poverty, and questions were piloted with hospitalists and residents to determine item qua lity and difficulty. The control curriculum includes 10 impersonal, direct prose text messages. The experimental curriculum includes ten 2 -5 minute videos delivered via text message, in which digital storytelling introduces the same content through a progr essive disclosure narrative following a child and his family. After each message, participants are offered a link to \"dig deeper\" and can revi ew relevant videos, resources, and APA content. After completion of the curriculum and at 3 -month follow - up, repea t knowledge tests will be administered, and participants will again be surveyed about their attitudes and practice behaviors around child poverty. Evaluation Plan/Results: The primary outcome is change in resident knowledge at 3 -month follow -up, measured using a 10- point knowledge test. Secondary outcomes include resident engagement with educational content, assessed through frequency of access ing \"dig deeper\" links, self -reported resident practice change, assessed through self- reported frequency of screen ing for indicators of poverty at 3- month follow -up, and attitude changes toward the topic of child poverty, as evidence by self -reported interest and comfort with this topic. The primary outcome will be measured by a pre - study, post -study, and 3- month fol low-up knowledge test. We will use a repeated measures ANOVA to examine change over time and differences in groups simultaneously. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Successful implementation of this pilot curriculum may lead to routine incorporation into resident education and expansion to all levels of learner. It may also facilitate ongoing research of digital storytelling with broadening of content to include other important concepts in medical education. 213 References: 1) Chamberlain LJ, Hanson ER, Klass P , Schickedanz A, Ambica, Barnes MM, Berger S, et al.

Need/Rationale: Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans eat the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables (1). Families in low -income neighborhoods are faced with an additional barrier to eating healthy, as they have access to ample fast food sites but few options for purchasing healthier food. Children in food deserts may develop a lifetime preference for cheap, processed, high -calorie foods, and are often paradoxically overweight despite being hungry. Low intake of vegetables and whole grains has been linked to th e considerable rise in metabolic diseases in recent times (2). During our 2017 pilot study with 60 food insecure families, we determined that even a fter eliminating the barrier of access to healthy food by providing home food deliveries, there was only a m oderate increase in consumption of vegetables and whole grains. Previous studies have cited key barriers to increased vegetable and whole grain inta ke as unfamiliarity with cooking these foods, often due to a cultural disconnect, and a perceived lack of ti me to prepare them (3). Our current intervention aims to address these barriers by familiarizing families with these foods and demonstrating easy wa ys to prepare them. By creating an online video library, nutrition education becomes more accessible to pati ents and may help form long -lasting healthy eating habits. Methods: The study subjects are 150 food insecure families seen at UCSF Benioff Children 's Hospital Oakland clinic with children ages 8 -17 years old who have been identified as pre- diabetic (HbA1 c between 5.7- 6.5% or a fasting glucose & gt; 99 mg/dL). Enrollment will begin November 1 and the study will be 12 weeks. The families will receive a weekly delivery box of fresh produce and whole grains from Phat Beets Produce, a CSA -delivery program based in Oakland. The intervention will include weekly text messages to families with links to \"how -to\" cooking videos corresponding to the ingredients of their CSA delivery box that week. Some of these videos will be specific to the current week's delivery, w hile others will be introductory culinary skills videos. Topics will include: \"how to cook brown rice and store it for the week\"; \"which vegetables can be eaten raw vs. which should be cooked\"; and \"how to determine vegetable servings based on your family size\". These videos will feature minority chefs that work in the local community to more closely match our patient population. They are filmed by th e UCSF video production department. By eliminating the discomfort and unfamiliarity of cooking whole gains a nd vegetables, we hope to make healthy habits feel more accessible to low -income children and their families. Evaluation Plan/Results: At the end o f each week, participants will receive a short survey assessing the helpfulness of the previous week's video s. Participants will be able to provide feedback about the efficacy of the videos in helping them feel more confident in cooking with these ingredie nts. To date we have recorded seven of the eight anticipated videos to be used. Upon completion of the inter vention, participants will also complete a more thorough survey regarding their experience with the videos. The study will evaluate two aspects: the feasibility and utility of the videos, and the changes in anthropometric and lab data and eating behaviors among the participants. Evaluation of this intervention will allow us to deploy an effective nutrition education library for food insecure families to address some of the keys barriers to healthy eating and increase their cooking confidence. Potential Imp act/Lessons Learned: Increasing the availability of nutrition education to food insecure families through digital technology helps to address key ba rriers to healthy eating, and thus has the potential to significantly reduce the prevalence of metabolic diseases and improve health outcomes. 215 References: 1) Moore LV, Thompson FE, Demissie Z.

Need/Rationale: Journal rejection rates are very high (often 8 0-90%) (1). One of our authors (CH) is associate editor for the Canadian Medical Education Journal, and has observed that in addition to reasons such as inadequate study design or inappropriate fit for the journal, poor quality of writing is often cited as a reason for rejection. Faculty in health professions education are often required by their institutions to take part in research projects, and to publish the results of their work. Anecdotally, we have heard from numerous faculty members that they lack c onfidence in their scholarly writing ability, and experience a great deal of stress wh en required to write/publish, commonly citing challenges such as writer's block, lack of time to write, and fear of rejection. Having a class that provides supportive feedback, interim tasks/deadlines, and the promise of a completed draft manuscript should help a great deal in addressing these roadblocks to writing. Within the University of Alberta, writing support resources exist; however, they are mainly offered by the F aculty of Arts (i.e., not oriented towards science -based articles), and include inform al drop- in sessions, or classes designed for students who speak English as a second language. Therefore, we created this class designed to support faculty in the health s ciences in their scholarly writing. There are writing courses and workshops available, but most require travel and cost, which may be a deterrent. Methods: We piloted a two -hour workshop on scholarly writing with junior faculty in pediatrics, then with health professions students participating in a summer research program. The workshop was well- received by attendees (per class evaluations). Seeing the need for more such workshops, we developed a longer scholarly writing course, within the Teaching Scholars Program (a faculty development program in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry). A lit erature search revealed that one -time intensive workshops show little long -term improvement in writing skills (2), so we designed the course to take place over six weeks (six two -hour sessions). Participants will be required to have completed a research project, with data to report, before taking the course, and submit an abstract and updated literature review prior to the first session. Each session of the class will incl ude about 30 minutes of didactic instruction, with the remainder of the session as an interactive workshop with feedback from instructors and peers to refine and improve upon participants' writing. Each session will focus on a section of a typical IMRaD- formatted article: 1) introduction and literature review; 2) research question and metho ds section; 3) results section; 4) discussion section; 5) presentations and review of draft manuscripts; 6) final review of manuscripts and discuss possibility of publica tion. A maximum of six participants will be enrolled, to allow time for discussion and constructive feedback. Evaluation Plan/Results: We will conduct a course evaluation upon the completion of the course, including evaluation of the instructors/course fa cilitators. We will analyze initial submission (pre - class) for each assigned manuscri pt section against the final version (post- class) of each section submitted. In addition, we will determine the number of draft manuscripts completed during the course. L astly, after ethics approval, we will use the checklists included during the course to evaluate the manuscripts to determine how well each the study participants' manuscripts comply with the writing rules that the faculty were taught. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This class is designed to help scholars write and refine a completed res earch study. Our belief is that faculty at other institutions would also find value in a practical course designed to help them prepare an article to submit for publicati on. 217 References: 1) https://www.library.ualberta.ca/catalog/11710808 2) Feldon, D.F., et al.

Need/Rationale: According to the m ost recent US Census, by 2035 older adults (people 65 and over) will outnumber children for the first time in US History. More physicians, whether they specialize in gerontology or not, will need to be trained in how to care for and address the needs of ou r aging population. A recent intervention studied the use of medical student simulation training to explore barriers to recognition of elder abuse (Fisher et al. J Am Geriatr Soc, 2016). Health care providers must develop strategies for addressing the need s of elder patients who are vulnerable to various forms of exploitation and neglect. Our intervention uses art, specifically an academy award nominated short documentary film; Edith and Eddie, to introduce Year II medical students to the ethical and legal issues that impact elder health and safety. The goal is to help them develop strategies for grappling with the uncertainty and discomfort that arises when a physician has limited information about a given situation and must navigate multiple perspectives - combative family members, legal guardians, lawyers, and cognitively impaired elder adults. Methods: This 2- hour workshop organized by the HEAL (Humanities, Ethics/Economics, Arts, and the Law) committee and Introduction to Clinical Medicine (ICM) course provided a forum for 186 medical students to discuss key issues that may arise in the care of elderly patients. The workshop, which draws together the five tenets of HEAL, uses cinematic arts to introduce students to the role of legal guardianship, the eth ics of determining capacity and autonomy, and the role that economics plays in shaping relationships among families and the healthcare system. Students were introduced to the film by an expert in gerontology who identified key issues addressed by the film, especially the tension between elder safety and autonomy. After watching the 29 -minute film, students were asked to jot down questions they had and then discuss with a partner. Students were then invited to pose their questions to a panel of experts in law and elder health care. A follow -up email was sent to students addressing the unresolved issues about the film's focus on a particular version of the story. Purpose: To provide a forum for medical students to: 1) Discuss ethical issues raised by the case of Edith and Eddie; autonomy/self - determination, beneficence, non -maleficence, fidelity, justice, conflict of interest; 2) Define legal terms: ward, capacity, guardianship vs. conservatorship; 3) Identify warning signs re: potential threats; 4) List resour ces to support at -risk elders. Evaluation Plan/Results: 118 students submitted evaluations. They were asked about the value of the workshop content and the degree to which the objectives were met. 78% of students agreed/strongly agreed that the workshop w as valuable. 80% agreed/strongly agreed that it met the objectives. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: Strong evaluations and the students' emotional investment in the film demonstrate its impact. The lively discussion during and after the workshop leads u s to believe that other medical schools will benefit from using film to engage students in the controversy surrounding elder safety.

Activities will be integrated throughout the session to build participants' analytic tool kit. Practice data will be provided. Participants should be prepared to leverage their design thinkin g skills and engage their imagination during this gamified experience. Rationale: The emergence of inexpensive enterprise data visualization tools has created new opportunities for medical educators to track, analyze, evaluate, and improve the quality of their institutions' work with data dashboards. While it is easier than ever to create data visualizations, educators must develop their ability to design dashboards that support their users' data -driven decision making (DDDM) in order to make the best use of these new technologies. This workshop will help participants to develop these skills and produce better data dashboards through engagement with best practices from cognitive science, program evaluation, and educational technology. Learn er Outcome Objectives: At the end of the session, learners will be able to: 1. Articulate basic data visualization principles; 2. Match visualization types to particular types of data; 3. Create clusters of visualizations appropriate for various data use scenari os; 4. Organize d ata visualizations in ways that support users' thinking about the data. Intended Participants: This session is intended for participants with beginner -level experience analyzing quantitative data in medical education research. Individuals who hold leadership and support positions within their environments (e.g., program directors, coordinators, assistants, analysts) will benefit from this session. Instructional Methods: A number of different pedagogical approaches will be used throughout t he workshop to help participants attain the learning objectives outlined above. Examples include lecture, demonstration, large group discussion, and hands -on activities. Part 1: Warm -up (5- 10 mins); Part 2: Lecture and Demonstration (20 mins) -Why data visualization? -Kinds of data visualizations and what -Basic principles of visualization from cognitive science; -Case Study: Applying visualization principles using the heuristic approach; Part 3: Small -group, Hands- on Activities (40 mins); Part 4: Conclu sion - Large Group Discussion (20 mins; 4- 5 mins/group) 220 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 1:15 - 2:45 PM Conference Workshop Present Like a Boss: How to Deliver Better Didactics Kim, Albert; Noelker, Joan Washington University Workshop Description : This workshop is designed to help educators develop an approach to technology integration in the classroom. Presenters will share lessons and project ideas used in curricula. From sage on the stag e to guide on the side, participants will engage in hands- on activities, gain exposure to a set of cross -platform tools that will cater to the diversity and inclusion of all learning styles. To maximize their experience, it is highly recommended to bring m obile devices that participants use regularly Need/Rationale: This workshop is designed to help educators develop an approach to technology integration in the classroom. Digital devices have changed the dynamics of the classroom and are redefining what teaching and learning look like. Millennials are known for having short attent ion spans, desiring immediate feedback, loving multimedia, and having a strong desire to be entertained by lectures. These are not negatives nor can they be chang ed. The workshop is designed to help educators develop a thoughtful and intentional approach to technology integration in the classroom. The workshop will focus on technology integration in three key areas - content delivery, reflection, and assessment. Presenters will share lessons and project ideas used both in the didactic and clinical curricula .

Conclusion/End 222 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 1:15 - 2:45 PM Conference Workshop Developing Transparent Thinking Approach (TTA) - Based Medical Enhanced Ebooks (MEEB's) Aliedeh, Mohammad; Aliedeh, Hashem Mutah University, Karak, Jordan Workshop Description : Transparent Thinking Approach (TTA) is a newly developed value -engrained and thinking- based educational reform approach. It is generic and unique features enable it to easily diffuse in all domains. In this TTA workshop session, the real \"fruits\" of this new approach will be \"tasted\" by \"feeling\" the innovative TTA created harmony between depth, meaningfulness, connectedness and simplicity which is reflected in the practical application of TTA concepts, tools, perspectives. Need/Rationale : The health care system in the United States faces tremendous problems that are increasingly becoming more urgent, and if not addressed soon, w ill lead to further degradation of the health care system. Problems like increasing costs of healthcare, high drug costs, increasing uninsured Americans. America has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, paying approximately 20% of its GDP on healthcare, and yet not meeting the highest standers nor insuring its population. These problems can all be trac ed down to the quality of medical education and the way we teach our future doctors. The current model of education is not producing professiona ls equipped to take on the challenges that we face. If we wish to solve our problems , we must attack the issue f orm the roots. There is an increasing awareness that the traditional route taken in education is killing the creativity and the problem -solving ability of students. Intended Participants: Medical professors, instructors, lecturers, teachers and students in medical institutions. Workshop Methods: In this Medical Enhanced Ebook (MEEB) Workshop, TTA generic and micro level solution will be introdu ced with the following interactive features: 1. Creating a Living Example of TTA instructional Material: Implement ing Seeds -Roots- Branches -Fruits (SRBF) Instructional Design Framework in designing the \"growth\" of the enhanced TTA workshop activities; 2. Specifying the starting and end points: Declaring the main theme of the enhanced workshop as the conversion of a tradi tional Instructional material (Starting Point) to TTA -Based Form (End Point); 3. \"Connecting the Dots\" between the start and the end by devising a Highly Structured and Graphically Visible Agenda that forms a complete \"jig saw puzzle\" picture of the whole wo rkshop (Pieces serving whole). The connection between the dots will be accomplished through the four SRBF framework stages: a. Seeds Activities: \" Minds -on\" Activities that help the participant to \"taste\" the TTA way of thinking (New perspective on Thinking); b. Roots Activities: \"Hands -on\" Activities that bridge the gap between the physical and the abstract through TTA Maneuvering Tools; c. Branches Act ivities: Implementing an extended TTA Modeling Tools (Graphics, Animation, Analogy, Humor, Comics, Concepts Maps , Drama, ...etc.) in remodeling the instructional material concepts; d. Fruits Activities: Assembling the remodeled activities into a coherent whole of the new TTA- Based Instructional Material. Take Home T ools: The method of delivery of the basic skills in t his TTA workshop will be the hand -on and mind- on activity that is structured in an innovated sequence to create a coherent and integrated whole. These activities will be designed to be completed in 90 minutes session. The participant at the end of the work shop will carry with them a real sample of a TTA -based medical instructional material.

Need/Rationale: The podcast \u2014episodic audio content synchronized to digital devices \u2014is a rapidly - growing academic medium. Podcasts combine the written information of a peer- reviewed journal with the intimacy of a human voice, adapting easily to various learning styles, as listeners can learn at their own paces and content is available longitudinally. The term \"podcast\" was first coined by a British news paper in 2004, but the concept was present years prior under the term \"audioblogging.\" Since then, podcasts have been developed for attendings, residents, medical students, and nursing students. They have both successfully improved examination scores and generated interest in medical literature. Podcasts are most valuable when freely available, relatively brief, and complement traditional teaching. Straight from the Cutter's Mouth: A Retina Podcast (SFTCM) was created by the authors with the hopes of filling an educational need. SFTCM, provides education catering specifically to vitreoretinal specialists. Since releasing its first episode on November 2, 2016 at http://www.retinapodcast.com, the podcast has gained subscribers worldwide. Approximately one or t wo episodes are released each week, for a current total of 119 episodes as of July 2018. The present work was designed to analyze the educational impact of the STFCM podcast and to investigate the demographics and preferences of its listeners. Methods: The podcast, website, and blog were hosted at http://www.retinapodcast.com by Squarespace, Inc (New York, NY) which provided analytics on website traffic. Direct podcast listener analytics were taken from the Podtrac (Podtrac, Inc.; Washington, DC) platform. An online survey was created using the Google Forms (Google LLC; Menlo Park, CA) platform. Questions assessed listener demographics, podcast listening habits, blog post viewings, and ideas for future improvement (Appendix 1). Participants were recruited v ia advertisements in podcast episodes, the SFTCM website, social media outlets, online forum, and direct communication; participation was voluntary and no compensation was given. The survey remained open between November 1, 2017 and December 1, 2017. Statisti cal analysis included the Kruskal -Wallis H test and Mann - Whitney U test, performed using SPSS software (version 24; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) with P<.05 considered statistically significant. IRB approval was not required for this survey -based study. Podcast episodes were designed with four basic formats: interview with an established leader in the field with discussion of their research, journal club style analysis of recently published peer -reviewed articles, round -table discussions of medical or surgic al topics using a non-peer reviewed review as the subject of discussion, or coverage of advancement topics such as the residency and fellowship application process. Evaluation Plan/Results: An analytics review and survey of listeners was undertaken to ass ess the educational impact of the podcast. As of June 2018, listeners made 18,596 unique visits to the website. There were 41,831 unique episode downloads since March 2017 and quarterly downloads increased from 684 in 1Q17 to 11,488 in 2Q18. 102 participan ts completed the survey, including 82 (80%) men, with 67 (66%) aged between 25 -34 years. On a scale of 1 (Disagree) to 5 (Agree), the median (range) agreement was 5 (1 -5) for the statement \"Podcasts are a useful part of medical education for eye providers\" and 4 (1 -5) for \"Listening to Retina Podcast results in changes in my clinical practice\". There were no significant differences in usefulness ratings between podcasts and peer -reviewed journals (P = .06), national conferences (P = .22), textbooks (P = .52 ), or CME lectures (P = .16); podcasts were rating as significantly more useful than CME online courses (P <.001) and CME mailed articles/courses (P <.001). Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: The results highlight the rapid growth in listenership and the effectiveness of the podcast in improving education and impacting clinical care. Survey results suggest 225 that podcasting is a valuable form of education, with perceived usefulness comparable to that of traditional media.

Need/Rationale: The typical goals of journal clubs are disseminating knowledge, especially new research, and teaching trainees how to critically analyze articles. Twitter has become an increasingly popular platform for journa l clubs to engage a diverse audience, including physicians, nurses, students, and even patients, who would not be able to easily participate in a traditional in- person format. Several Twitter journal clubs are currently active, including a hospital medicine journal club that includes both internal medicine and pediatrics (#JHMChat), but none specifically target the PHM community. As PHM evolves into a distinct specialty with a broad range of clinical practice models, it is an opportune time to build a socia l media presence to foster inter -institutional exchange of ideas and collaboration through discussion of current literature. Thus, our focus is on key \"take -home\" points and current variations at our respec tive institutions, with the potential for integrat ing the evidence into practice (e.g., through quality improvement projects). In addition, all Twitter journal clubs so far have generally been founded and managed by attending -level physicians, with only sp oradic input from trainees. By taking the initiative to start and run the journal club as current fellows, we hope this will be less intimidating and more encouraging for other trainees to participate. Methods: #PHMFellowJC was launched in September 2018 as a monthly journal club in the format of a Twitt er chat. Each 1 -hour chat features a specific article chosen by the moderator, with a focus on articles applicable to PHM. Other criteria for topics include potential interest and engagement from other specialties (e.g., pediatric emergency medicine). The moderator develops objectives and 3 -4 discussion questions in advance, which are released along with the article to be discussed at least 1 week prior to the journal club date via Twitter. During the chat, questions are released at set intervals to facilitate discussion flow. Chats are held at 9 PM EST to allow for convenient participation across all US time zones. After the initial hour, the chat remains \"open\" for participation through the following mornin g, at which point a transcript is generated and po sted to Twitter for future reference. Evaluation Plan/Results: After each session, Twitter -based engagement metrics are obtained using the Symplur\u00a9 Healthcare Hashtag project, including total number of participants and tweets, average tweets/participant, and total number of impressions (i.e., number of times tweets were viewed). Our first #PHMFellowJC garnered over 39,000 impressions, 129 tweets and 15 participants, including several national experts in the field participating in the discussion. In additio n to measurement of engagement on a monthly basis, other future evaluations may include a survey of participants to assess their experience. Some journal clubs may also be coordinated with the AAP Sectio n on Hospital Medicine journal club (www.sohmlibrary. org), so it may be possible to assess increased pageviews or other measurements of engagement through their website tracking. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: We hope #PHMFellowJC will become a model for promoting inter- institutional discussions in PHM a s well as between pediatric subspecialties. For example, @PedsICU_JC sought tips and ideas from us before successfully launching their journal club one week after #PHMFellowJC.

An Intervention to Increase Fellows' Ability to Treat Rare Events Idea/Problem Statement: Improving pediatric anesthesia fellow's abili ty to manage rare critical events during interactive case conferences that utilize the PediCrisis app. Need/Rationale: Pediatric anesthesiologists must recognize and treat rare events (2). Cognitive aids (CAs) are regularly used for routine processes and may be more important during critical events (1). They improve the performance of complex tasks during time sensitive situations where the cognitive load is high (2, 3). Unfortunately, fellows in pediatric anesthesiology rarely get training in the use of Cognitive Aids. To address this issue, a multi -site curricular i ntervention has been developed. This project will combine the use of a checklist of rare critical events that was developed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia's Quality and Safety Committe e (SPA- Q&SC) with use of the updated Pedicrisis App, a free cognitive aid developed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. In developing the intervention, we have also aligned it with adult learning theory (i.e. to develop mastery students must acquire s kills, practice integrating them, and know when to use them (Am brose, 2011). Our goals include familiarizing participants with the use of cognitive aids (CAs) and the benefits of their use, increasing knowledge about critical events in anesthesia, and incr easing their usage of CAs in the perioperative environment. Methods: The intervention will target a total of 24 pediatric anesthesia fellows and will be delivered in bi - weekly sessions over four months utilizing an interactive case conference format. All site facilitators will be provided with faculty development to ensure site- to-site consistency in course administration. A systematic framework for each conference will include the following components: 1) MCQ pretest covering core content from the session; 2) Brief didactic introduction to content; 3) Paired particip ants will then be guided through four progressive reveal cases highlighting rare critical events; 4) Half of the participants will be instructed to work through cases in the usual w ay (memory & phone with no app) the other half will be instructed to utilize the Pedicrisis app; 5) A concluding debrief after each case will compare results of memory vs. cognitive aid group emphasizing items overlooked without the aid; 6) To simulate a s tressful environment loud distracting music will be played in the backgroun d; 7) Overall debrief to reveal and discuss attitudes around the use of cognitive aids as well as relevant systems based practice and interpersonal communication issues; 8) Each session will conclude with an MCQ post-test covering core content from the ses sion. Evaluation Plan/Results: The evaluation will include tracking of the intervention, assessment of quality of the sessions and usefulness of the app, assessment of resident kno wledge and confidence, as well as assessment of fellow usage of cognitive aids in their daily practice. Participant learning will be assessed by analysis of the comparison of pre -intervention and post -intervention MCQ exams. A survey assessing participant' s confidence managing these events will precede curriculum implementation. Follow up surveys immediately after the completion of the curriculum and six months after completion will assess perceptions about the utility of the program, attitudes about cognit ive aids, and how participants have utilized the app in daily practice and during actual crisis events. Individual sessions will be evaluated by review of follow up surveys for each session. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: If successful this could provi de a model for other specialties thinking about integrating usage of apps i nto training, as well as those tasked with recognizing and treating rare, potentially catastrophic, events (ED, ICU, EMT, military).

Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine Idea/Problem Statement: Third year emergency medicine residents will become more e ffective clinical instructors using interactive teaching and residents -as-preceptors shifts Need/Rationale: Resident physicians are often responsible for the inst ruction of junior learners and teaching is an evaluated competency at the GME level. Despite this anticipated role, residents get inconsistent, if any, teaching on clinical instruction with limited assessment for those that do (1). When compared to model r esidents as teachers (RAT) curricula (2- 3), many programs inconsistently incorporate \"key\" to pics. An informal survey completed by leadership revealed that our education rotation lacks instruction on teaching methods as well as any assessment of clinical s upervision. We propose revamping the current 3 -week education rotation to increase the focus on the resident in their role as clinical preceptor. We will add a guided introduction to teaching skills followed by multiple mentored precepting sessions. These on-the-job sessions will allow targeted and timely feedback to promote behavioral change. Unl ike many curricula, these shifts will also allow residents to practice balancing clinical responsibilities and teaching. Methods: This curricular element will be piloted with the 13 PGY3 emergency medicine residents during their 3- week education rotation, with one resident participating each month. During the first week of the rotation residents will independently review selected readings and practice with the thre e roles of precepting (role model, teacher and supervisor) in the classroom, sim center and e mergency room. They will practice watching other preceptor -resident pairs with the rating form that will be used to provide the PGY3s with feedback and assess thei r teaching. During the subsequent weeks residents will: 1) complete 4 teaching shifts in whic h they precept two junior learners, either residents or medical students, and are expected to advise on management of patients and provide clinical teaching; 2) be observed directly by education faculty during these shifts; 3) participate in 30 -minute post -shift feedback sessions; 4) continue with their guided independent readings and reflection. Junior learners and faculty will be asked to fill out a rating form fo r the resident after each shift. As a part of their reflections, residents will be asked to record self -assessments and a commitment to act for future precepting during the block and/or in their 4th year. The design is guided by the learning principle that practice paired with targeted feedback leads to significant learning (Ambrose et.al. How Lea rning Works: Seven Research -Based Principles for Smart Teaching, 2011). Evaluation Plan/Results: The project evaluation includes: 1) tracking; 2) gathering of learner reaction; 3) rating of learner on -the-job performance; 4) review of completion of commit ments to act. 1) Material review and shift completion will be tracked by educational faculty. 2) Ongoing feedback sessions and formal completion of a standard end of rotation evaluation will serve to assess learner reaction. 3) Resident learning in clinica l instruction will be monitored by observations during the four precepting shifts and completion of a rating form modified from the ALIEM \"Teaching Resident Educational Activity Evaluation Form\". Common teaching themes will be extracted from the opened end ed portions of the assessment. Behavior changes will be assessed shift to shift. 4) Prior to starting their 4th year, residents will review teachin g topics and can modify their commitments to act. Continued evaluation will occur throughout their 4th year p receptor shifts using standard evaluation forms. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned: This curricular element provides a model for incorporating prac tice and evaluation of resident teaching skills within the clinical setting. If it is effective, it could be utilized to enhance teaching programs at other institutions References: 1) Kaji A, Moorhead JC. Residents as teachers in the emergency department.

Need/Rationale: In an era of online information overload it is imperative that health professionals develop tools and strategies to thoughtfully seek out, ap praise and incorporate online education resources (OERs) as part of their tools for lifelong learning and just -in-time care [1]. Emergency Medicine (EM) residents in the US & Canada already utilize OERs extensively [2]. The ACGME through their core compete ncies emphasize the importance of effective use of information technology as part of practice - based learning & improvem ent. To that end, there have been national efforts to provide high -quality OERs to residents as well as to develop methods and tools to e valuate the quality of OERs [3]. However, our literature search did not locate any comprehensive example curricula to g uide residents in gaining these skills, and thus there is a need nationally for model curricula to be developed. We also have a local need since at our institution learners do not yet receive any formal instruction in usage of OERs. Our proposed project is intended to fill this gap. Methods: The intervention will focus on the 18 incoming emergency medicine residents at LAC+USC and will tak e place over four sessions spread across the first two months of residency. The course is a combination of didactic tea ching and real- world applications designed to take learners through Bloom's cognitive and affective domains. The first session will focus on the different modalities (e.g. mobile applications, blogs, VR) of OERs and their applicability to the individual le arners style. Through self- reflection learners will analyze their current practices around OERs and biases they may already hold. The sec ond session will focus on forming clinical queries to generate online searches using cases that learners have faced ear ly in residency. This session also covers the role of social media in OER discovery and tools to collect, curate and maintain a steady st ream of content. The third session will cover characteristics of high -quality OERs and give learners practice employing validated analytic tools that have been developed to critically evaluate OERs. The final session is a team -based exercise where students are given various clinical scenarios and use skills they have gained to guide their problem- solving. After completing the course, residents will have accrued a set of high -quality resources and practical skills around online learning and they will also be better equipped to make credibility decisions about OERs and incorporate them into learning and clinical practice. Evaluation Plan/Results: The evaluation includes four levels: accountability, learner reaction, learning and behavior. To assess accountability, attendance at the course sessions will be mandated as part of new resident curriculum. This will be tracked along with session timing and any changes in how the plan is implemented. Learner reaction will be measured using a standard course evaluation form. Learning will be evaluated based on participation in session activities and out -of-class assignments as well as the final session team -based exercise. Behavior and impact will be assessed in a follow -up survey later in the learners' first year of residency and compared to a control group of residents who did not complete the course. Potential Impact/Lessons Learned : If successful this could provide a model for programs across the country to teach incoming residents and medical students abo ut using OERs for self -directed learning and as part of clinical practice in order to better meet the ACGME core competencies und er practice - based learning & improvement.

Learn how to identify and develop opportunities for bedside teaching that allow you to assess and coach your learners, while optimizing the care for your patients. Need/Rationale: Latest advances in technology as well chan ges to the trainee's learning environments continue to shift the attention of 21st century clinical teacher s and learners further away from the bedside. This interactive workshop explores some of the commonly encountered barriers to bedside teaching as wel l as practical solutions to enhance its quantity and quality. Intended Workshop Participants: This session is intended for medical students, residents, fellows, and faculty, who currently work in the clinical setting. Learner outcome objectives: By the end of this session, participants will be able to: 1. Discuss challenges and opportunities for high quality bedside teaching. 2. Develop plans to promote high quality bedside teaching to try at their home institutions. Instructional Methods/ content, activitie s, schedule: Introduction to different approaches to bedside teaching (Large group activity - 10 mi nutes) Personal experiences with bedside teaching (Small group activity - 15 minutes) Discussion of institutional, 21st century learners, and faculty challenge s and opportunities for high quality bedside teaching (Large- group discussion - 20 minutes) Develo pment and feedback on plans to address 1 -2, 21st- century challenges to bedside teaching to be implemented at participants' home institutions (Individual and s mall group activities - 30 minutes) Wrap up/discussion (Large group activity - 15 minutes) 235 Saturday, 2/23/2019 , 3:00 - 4:30 PM Conference Workshop Innovations in Teaching and Learning with Technology Maldonado, Maria; Ramos, Jennifer; Vallejo, Alberto Keck School of Medicine of USC Primary Care Physician Assistant Program Workshop Descriptio n: Anxious about presentations? Searching for ways to improve your lecture? The formal lecture is a teachable skill. This workshop will cover mistakes and pitfalls co mmonly found in didactic presentations while providing strategies to avoid them. Learn how to effectively present your message and actively engage your learner through preparation, storytelling, and slide design. Bring your own computers and presentations to receive feedback from the group. Rationale: The formal lecture is equipped to provide a substantial amount of information to a passive learner. This time -honored technique has withstood much ridicule, famously in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" or in the no torious phrase, \"Death -by-Powerpoint.\" Despite its disadvantages, it is still uti lized heavily in many teaching environments and conference settings. This workshop will provide learners the tools to leverage the advantages of this teaching method, actively engage lecture participants, and utilize technology in content delivery. The wor kshop will focus primarily on powerpoint and keynote presentation formats, but the teaching points could be comparable with other presentation formats/tools as well. Learner Outcome Objectives: By the end of this workshop participants will be able to : 1. Describe how to plan a didactic lecture through storytelling and proper planning 2. Recognize common pitfalls in slide design and devise solutions to avoid them 3. Describe common p itfalls in lecture delivery and devise solutions to excel as a speaker. Intended Participants: IME participants of any training level. Appropriate for novice speakers or those with some speaking/lecturing experience who would like to improve their skills . Participants should bring their own laptops along with one of their pers onal presentations (may be one they have already delivered, or one that they are currently developing.) Activity Timeline: 0-10: Intro/Examples - Two exemplar presentations on d esign and storytelling 10-30: Story Arcs - How to plan a lecture, create a story arc, and develop a unifying theme 30-50: Slide Design - Common mistakes made in slide design and how to avoid them. How to leverage technology and multimedia to your advantag e 50-60: Delivery - Common mistakes in lecture delivery and how to avoid them. 60-75: Small Group 1 - Divide into small pairs, learners will present 5 minutes of their own lecture, 5 -10 minutes to receive feedback from their partner utilizing tools just provided. 75-90: Small Group 2 - Same session as above after trading pair s, using a different presentation from another group member. Take Home Tools: No specific tools. Group will be given presenters' contact information if specific questions arise aft er the workshop. 236 Presenters' Bios Adeel, Firas, MD Firas Adeel is a third year resident in Internal Medicine.
