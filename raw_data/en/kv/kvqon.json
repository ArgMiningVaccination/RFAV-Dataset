Getting vaccinated for [COVID-19](https://www.medicinenet.com/wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak_2019-ncov/article.htm) is both safe and recommended for cardiac patients, since they are more likely to develop complications from the infection. People with [hypertension](https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm), [coronary artery disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm), or cardiac failure are at higher risk of developing severe illness from [COVID-19](https://www.medicinenet.com/wuhan_coronavirus_2019-ncov_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm), leading to a higher rate of hospitalization and deaths. This is linked to the fact that people with underlying [heart](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_how_the_heart_works/article.htm) conditions have abnormally high amounts of a receptor that helps bind the virus to the outer cell surfaces of the [lungs](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm) and heart. COVID-19 [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) do not contain a complete virus. Instead, they contain viral proteins that teach the immune system to recognize COVID-19 and fight it off. The body recognizes the virus and initiates an immune response against it, meaning that it can fight the virus faster and more effectively if exposed to it in the future. Are cardiac patients at higher risk for vaccine side effects? Cardiac patients may develop side effects from COVID-19 [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm). However, they are not at risk for developing side effects than other people. The most common vaccine side effects include: [Pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm)and swelling at the site of the injection [Fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm) [Headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm) - Muscle aches [Nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm) - Symptoms generally do not last more than 2 days and are signs that the body is building immunity, although they may not appear in everyone. [Allergic](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm) reactions to COVID-19 [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm) are rare but easy to treat. These are seen in response to some components of the vaccine and have nothing to do with the viral proteins themselves. Can I still get COVID-19 even after getting the vaccine? While some people have gotten COVID-19 even after being vaccinated (also known as breakthrough infection), this is very rare. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are 90% effective at preventing COVID-19 infection after two doses, whereas they are only 80% effective after the first dose. The single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine is approximately 67% effective at preventing illness. People vaccinated according to the recommended schedule with the authorized COVID-19 vaccines must wait for 2 more weeks to have a full immune response and be considered fully vaccinated. The number of breakthrough cases was higher among people who: - Received only 1 dose out of the 2 scheduled doses - Got exposed to the virus within 2 weeks of their last dose - Have underlying immunodeficiency conditions ( [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm), chemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications, etc.) As COVID-19 infections are still rampant, wearing masks is recommended even for fully vaccinated people to prevent the virus from spreading. Can I develop any heart problems after a COVID-19 vaccine shot? Inflammation of heart muscle ( [myocarditis](https://www.medicinenet.com/myocarditis/article.htm)) and inflammation of the surrounding sac ( [pericarditis](https://www.medicinenet.com/pericarditis/article.htm)) can occur after a vaccination, which can be attributed to the immune response generated by the vaccine. Data has shown a small increase in cases of myocarditis and [pericarditis](https://www.medicinenet.com/pericarditis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) after receiving the Pfizer and Moderna two-dose COVID-19 vaccination, especially in young adults. In the great majority of cases, symptoms were mild and resolved on their own, with a very low risk of complications. The dangers of COVID-19 infection outweigh the side effects of the vaccine. However, if you develop the following symptoms in the days following COVID-19 vaccination, seek medical help as soon as possible: [Chest pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm)or discomfort [Shortness of breath](https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm) [Nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm) [Vomiting](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Should wear a mask or not? Take this quiz to find out! Coronavirus: How COVID-19 Affects Your BodyBy now, everyone knows about COVID-19. But do you know how it can affect your body? COVID-19 (Coronavirus): Mask Mistakes You're Making NowYou're wearing your mask every time you leave home. But could you be making simple mistakes that make your mask less effective? Find out the most common errors that can leave you unprotected and simple ways to fix them. How Long Does Immunity Last After You Get Moderna, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccines?People's bodies all respond differently to the vaccines so to understand how long immunity lasts, it comes down to your body's antibody production. COVID-19 Vaccine Myths and Facts QuizThe FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines that have been shown to be safe and effective as established by data from large clinical trials. COVID-19 vs. Flu vs. ColdWhen you're feeling sick, it can be difficult to distinguish the symptoms of a COVID-19 infection from the symptoms of the common cold or the flu (influenza). While fever is common with the flu and COVID-19, sneezing is typically only associated with colds. Though sore throats are typical with colds, they are uncommon with COVID-19 infections and the flu. What Are the Differences Between Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines?Despite being made using the same technology and sharing similar effects on the body, here are the differences between the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. How Do mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Work?Vaccines train a person's immune system to recognize and fight specific germs that can cause illness. COVID-19 vaccines work with the immune system to help develop defenses against the disease so that the body will be ready to fight coronavirus if exposed to it in the future. If a vaccinated person gets exposed to coronavirus in the future, the antibodies will fight the virus and work to prevent severe COVID-19 illness. How Do the COVID-19 Coronavirus Tests Work?Tests used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) may use two methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cause of COVID-19 disease, a debilitating and potentially deadly viral pneumonia. Genomic or molecular detection confirms the presence of viral DNA. The immunoglobulin or serology tests can tell whether or not you have been exposed to coronavirus, but not whether you are currently infected. Both tests administered in tandem can give you your complete COVID-19 infection status. How Does the Flu Affect the Immunocompromised?Influenza, or the flu, is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. It is generally a mild illness that can be treated at home with over-the-counter medications and rest. However, for people with compromised immune systems, the flu can be much more serious. This includes the increased risk of complications, prolonged illness, weakened immune system, and increased risk of death. How Long Does Headache Last With COVID-19?Headache is a potential symptom of COVID-19 and can also occur after getting vaccinated. COVID-19 headaches typically last for a few days, although the duration depends on your age, immune system, and overall health condition. In mild cases of COVID-19, headaches will usually resolve within a few days. However, in more severe cases, mild or moderate headaches may come and go for up to 90 days. How to Differentiate Between the Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19, Allergies, Cold, and Flu?Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without the need for intensive or special treatment. Serious illness is more likely in elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer. Tests Available for COVID-19Getting tested for COVID-19 can identify you as a positive or negative patient of the disease. Remember no test is 100% accurate. Different methods of testing have been launched to trace COVID-19 infection. What Drugs May Fight COVID-19? Drug Trials, Treatments, VaccinesWhat drugs could help fight coronavirus COVID-19? Clinical studies are ongoing for antiviral drugs like hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine remdesivir, lopinavir and favipiravir, as well as COVID-19 vaccines.
