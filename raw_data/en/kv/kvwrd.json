The words are interchangeable and they both describe a way of diagnosing an illness and individualizing the treatment for every person. The goal of all naturopathic medicine is to find and treat the underlying cause of any illness. This is done through understanding that all body systems are interconnected and that each plays a vital role in the function of every other. We believe that it is essential that the least harmful means necessary is used in treating a person and that the body has an innate power to heal itself if the obstacles to healing are removed. We use a number of treatments including homeopathy, herbal medicine, natural hormones, nutrition and focused pharmaceuticals to help the body to heal itself. Hormonal Health Bioidentical hormone therapy is used to treat both men and women when their hormone levels drop or become unbalanced. We have a diverse range of treatment options for each patient depending on the symptoms. Naturopathic Medicine We combine nature's healing gifts and the latest scientific advances to bring you the best possible health care. The goal of all naturopathic medicine is to promote health and prevent illness by addressing the underlying causes of disease.

Ready to explore the root causes of your health concerns, find effective solutions and give you tools for a lifetime solution? Naturopathic Doctors, or NDs, are required to complete a four year medical program and are trained as Primary Care Physicians. Currently, they can choose to receive training at one of seven accredited Naturopathic Medical Schools. The curriculum is diverse and covers everything from the basic sciences to the in depth study of herbal medicine, homeopathy as well as extensive training in pharmaceutical medicine and even minor surgery. NDs are trained to diagnose using many of the same tests and labs that conventional medical doctors use, but treat using a holistic medical view. Initial Naturopathic Intake: Your first visit will typically last 60-90 minutes, depending on complexity. You are encouraged to print and fill out your forms before the visit. Your doctor will review your health history, perform necessary physical exams (such as heart & lung exam), labs will be ordered as indicated (please bring in any labwork you have received in the past 6 months), and a treatment plan will be discussed. Return Naturopathic Appointment: Follow-up appointments typically last 45-60 minutes, depending on complexity. These appointments are usually scheduled 2-4 weeks following your initial visit.

The six principles of naturopathic medicine unite NDs across the world. All doctors seek to care for and improve the human condition. Naturopathic doctors approach this goal by using therapies that are as natural, least toxic, and least invasive as possible. If a patient's condition is beyond the scope of their practice, naturopathic doctors will refer them to another physician. Natural substances found in the natural world can be used to heal people. Naturopaths rely on such medicinal plants, among other things, while diagnosing and treating their patients. Naturopathic doctors believe that the human body possesses an innate ability to heal itself, if given a chance. They also value nature as essential to good health. Naturopathic doctors focus on the underlying causes of illness, rather than just treating symptoms. Most patients benefit from identifying obstacles to healing and removing them rather than suppressing their symptoms. Naturopathic doctors have a primary goal of educating their patients. Through building trust, NDs help their patients learn what it takes to be healthy and stay well and how they can take steps in that direction on their own. Naturopathic doctors understand that your mind, body and spirit are intrinsically connected. They also know that factors such as diet, lifestyle habits and environment can affect a person's health and so they treat patients holistically to restore balance in their lives. Naturopathic doctors take a more preventive approach to health care. By identifying imbalances in the body early and addressing them before they manifest as disease, NDs work to keep their patients healthy for longer periods of time. Naturopathic medicine is a distinct discipline of health care that emphasizes prevention and utilizes natural healing methods to treat each person holistically, improving outcomes while lowering costs. Naturopathic doctors are educated and trained in accredited naturopathic medical colleges. They diagnose, prevent and treat acute illnesses by supporting the person's inherent self-healing process; they also restore and establish optimal health in chronic illness sufferers Instead of just treating symptoms, naturopathic doctors identify the underlying causes of illnesses and develop personalized treatment plans that address them. 1. You want a doctor who will treat all of you, not just your illness. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are trained to treat the whole person. This requires taking the time to listen and understand the genetic, environmental, and behavioral/lifestyle factors that can affect your health. 2. You want personalized treatment. NDs understand there is no one-size-fits-all treatment that works for everybody. After your visit with an ND, you'll leave the doctor's office with a treatment plan uniquely tailored to you, your health status, your health goals, and your lifestyle. 3. You want to treat the root cause of an illness, not just the symptoms. Sometimes having trouble sleeping, aches and pains, strange or hard to treat skin rashes, and indigestion or stomach discomfort are symptoms of an underlying illness. While these symptoms can be managed, it's more important to understand and treat the root cause which is the focus of naturopathic medicine. 4. You want to actively participate in managing your own health. An ND will help you learn what your body needs to get well and stay healthy. Patients have the opportunity to feel empowered and hopeful when they understand and are actively engaged in managing their own health. 5. You have chronic pain and don't want to use pharmaceutical drugs such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or highly addictive opioids to manage it forever. Pain that lasts six months or more is more complex than acute pain and requires a holistic, long-term approach to manage. NDs are trained to work with you to determine which combination of therapies will work best for you to heal or manage your pain safely so that you can resume daily activities. 6. You have tried all conventional medical options for diagnosing and treating a health condition. Certain chronic health conditions that have symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, or gastrointestinal distress can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and can benefit from a holistic approach. NDs use diagnostic tools common in conventional medicine, such as detailed health, disease, and prescription drug histories, physical exams, and targeted laboratory testing and imaging. NDs also consider detailed diet history, lifestyle habits and choices, exercise history, and social/emotional factors to assess patients' needs. These approaches can open doors to new treatment pathways and options. We treat the whole person, not just symptoms of disease, we consider more than a patient's isolated symptoms when making treatment decisions. Naturopathic Doctor's treat individuals for illnesses rather than prescribing medicines based on symptoms. Many patients have benefited from our approach to herbal medicine, and many conditions that may not respond well to conventional treatments show improvement in people who work with us. This is where consulting with a Naturopathic Doctor can help. We don't need to diagnose the problem before offering help - we simply consider your health picture as a whole instead of focusing on individual symptoms like most GP's do. The first consultation is often described by my patients as the first time they have felt listened to. The first appointment gives us plenty of time to get to know each other and for me decide on the very best ingredients for your medicine. You can find more details of the consultation process here. Since the beginning of time herbs have been used as medicine. Herbs our part of our collective ancestry and are part of the reason that both human and animal species have weathered disease epidemics. In India and China medicinal classification systems developed hundreds of years ago are still used today. Many of the herbs used a thousand years ago are still used today in both holistic and conventional medicine. Often, with the help of technology, specific components are extracted or synthesized and made into commonly used drugs. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 80% of the world uses traditional and herbal medicines as part of their healthcare and that these medicines can be effective against various infective and chronic conditions. These forms of medicine have become such important parts of our healthcare that the National Institute of Health now has a branch (National Center for Contemporary and Alternative Medicine) dedicated to researching different forms of herbal medicine. Herbs in most cases are safer than medications like pharmaceuticals (drugs), but they too can have side effects. Some herbs can also be very dangerous in their medicinal effects. In most cases though, herbs have less side effects and are milder in their action than their drug counterparts. Like drugs though, all herbal supplements and treatment should be managed and supervised by a physician.
