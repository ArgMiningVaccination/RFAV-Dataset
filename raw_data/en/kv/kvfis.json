A person owning or keeping a dog shall, within 30 days after the dog attains the age of 6 months, cause the dog to be vaccinated against rabies and shall have booster vaccinations administered periodically in accorda nce with rules adopted by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services under section 922, subsection 3. A wolf hybrid is required to be vaccinated in accordance with this subsection. ... Current proposal : 1-A. Required for dogs. Except as provided in su bsection 4, an owner or keeper of a dog over 3 months of age shall have that dog vaccinated against rabies. The rabies vaccine must be administered by a licensed veterinarian or under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian. Upon receiving an initial va ccination, a dog is considered protected for one year and an owner or keeper of that dog shall get a booster vaccination for that dog one year after the initial vaccination and subsequent booster vaccinations at intervals that do not exceed the intervals r ecommended by a national association of state public health veterinarians for the type of vaccine administered. I'm not sure why you believe that the age at which a dog should be vaccinated for rabies from current law to 12 weeks except that perhaps current law requires that cats at 12 weeks be vaccinated for rabies and someone thought it was a good idea to require the same of puppies. The core vaccination schedule for puppies ( from responsible breeders) is as follows normally: As you can see, these puppies are receiving a lot of vaccines at a very early age. In small dogs under 20 lbs., it is recommended that their vaccination schedule be spread out to avoid serious 2 reactions . Most vaccinations (including rabies) were created for the medium sized dogs , so those dogs that are small, toy breeds, suffer from serious reactions due to the amount of vaccine injected into them. The fear of one's puppy suffering a serious reaction to the rabies vaccine on top of having received numerous other vaccines at 12 weeks of age is a reason for maintaining the 6 -month age at which a dog requires the rabies vaccination. According to Dr. Jean Dodds, a nationally known and well -respected veterinarian, at 12 weeks puppies are at a critical age for socialization and it's also the time they are receiving distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, Para influenza, and Parvovirus - core vaccines. Their immune systems are just beginning to m ature and some puppies have adverse reactions from these vaccinations. As Dr Dodds reports: 'Puppies carry maternal antibodies for these diseases from their mother. So, if the puppy with any residual antibodies from its mother receives a vaccination, t he vaccine neutralizes the existing immunity leaving the animal vulnerable until the new antibodies take over.' So it's possible that a puppy with residual immunity from its mother for rabies will find those immunities neutralized and leave the puppy at r isk. According to Dr. Dodds, vaccines are not \"sterile water\". They're full of adjuvants and other substances that simulate the immune system. They contain activators. The purpose of vaccines is to simulate the immune system in a very powerful wa y so it will produce antibodies. The rabies vaccine is aimed at the medium -sized dog . That means that toy breeds are receiving the same amount of rabies vaccine as a medium sized dog. This sets up the scenario of small breed dogs encountering severe side effect s. Administering rabies vaccine at the same time as the pups are undergoing core vaccines can produce severe reactions including death. Below I have listed the adverse reactions specific to having received the rabies vaccine. Young pups are going through all kinds of life changes, both physical and psychological, with their immune systems will be suppressed to some degree. Therefore, it's possible that a young pup with residual immunity against rabies who receives a rabies vaccination too early may wind up unprotected against the disease. Some animals do not mount a very good rabies response which is why two initial vaccinations are given within 12 months to ensure immunization. Another concern is that these vaccines contain thimerosal which is mercury and not something we want to give our animals. Administering the rabies vaccine too early can cause some awful adverse reactions such as seizures, severe, adverse temperament changes such as irritability, snapping or looking dazed. Seizures are worrisom e as people then think the dog has epilepsy (thus not properly treated) . Vaccine reactions can destroy joints, cause high fevers and even cause the animal to scream out in pain if touched. They can destroy red blood cells and platelets. The y can destroy the dog's liver. But much worse, is that they can cause neurological behavioral changes. Some of the adverse reactions from the rabies vaccine include: Swelling or firmness of the skin at the vaccination site Mild allergic reaction Low-grade fever 3 Decreased appetite Lethargy Sneezing Coughing Runny nose Delayed side effects of the rabies vaccine may include: Autoimmune diseases Various skin conditions Heart problems Chronic loss of appetite Vision problems Inflammatory bowel disease Lipomas ( fatty tumors ) Periodontitis (gum disease) Hair loss Ongoing seizures Thyroid issues Aggression Separation anxiety Confusion Destructive behavior Adding another vaccine to a 12 -week -old pup makes no sense as it could be the cause of some very serious and permanent adverse reactions. Let's look at the statistical data compiled by the Maine CDC regarding rabies outbreaks among species (source Maine CDC website ). From 2010 - 2020, tests on dogs = 423 with only 1 stray dog testing positive for rabies . From 2010 - 2020, tests on cats = 728 with 8 testing positive for rabies . Not surprising the number is higher than for dogs given the number of feral cats in Maine. According to the national C DC, rabies virus is adapted to its reservoir host and differen t variants exist in the US, such as ra ccoon variant, bat variant, fox variant, and skunk variant. Although cross -species transmission of rabies virus variants does occur (for example, infection of dogs with raccoon rabies variant), rabies virus variants are primarily transmitted within the species they are adapted to, such as the ra ccoon variant primarily being transmitted between rac coons. Rabies virus variants associated with the major mesocarnivore species (such as ra ccoons, skunks, foxes, and mongooses) are distributed in to distinct geographic regions . As you can see by th e map on the following page, the greatest number of rabid animals in Maine are the fox, raccoon and skunk. 4 Above was obtained from the National CDC. The Maine CDC is working with the U.S. Wildlife Services to distribute bait of oral vaccines for raccoons to stop the spread of rabies in our state. I would hope that more money would be provided to expand on this program in an effort to eradicate rabies among the various wildlife species. In conclusion, there doesn't appear to be a risk of rabid dogs in the State of Maine. If a dog is exposed, the rec ommendation is to obtain a booster, but looking at the data covering 10 years, only one stray dog tested positive for rabies. However, there is a greater risk of creating adverse reactions in dogs if the requirement for rabies vaccinations is lowered to 1 2 weeks. For all of these reasons I am pleading that the Committee votes that LD 103, An Act to Improve the Animal Welfare Laws \"ought not to pass\". Respectfully submitted, Claudia J.
