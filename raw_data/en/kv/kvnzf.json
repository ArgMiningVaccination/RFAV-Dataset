DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, A~ W~~FARE Office of Human Development Services . Office for Handicapped Individuals Directory of National Information Sources on Handicapping Conditions and Related Services May 1980 DHEW Publication No. (OHOS) 80-22007 .. - .{ POI' snle h~' the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Ofllc,e Washington, D.C. 20402 PREFACE This is the 2nd edition of what has become a standard reference work for information provide:rs in the handicapped field. The first volume, published in 1976, was an inventory of the then scarcely explored resources at the national level which had information and direct services pertinent to the handicapped. Work has progressed since that time in the Clearinghouse on the Handicapped to further mfme and explore this large segment of information sources. Our goal, as before, is to document at thf~ national level information resources existing for handicapped persons and those working on their behalf. This Directory is a major effort to inventory these resources. Other projer~ts now being undertaken in the Clearinghouse will document other levels of infmmation sources-state, regional, and local. Together, these references will provide information people with a comprehensive overview of organizations, specific and general, which can fill information needs and direct dil\\abled persons to much needed service providers. iii Wallace: K. Babington, Director Office for Handicapped Individuals ------------------.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------I THE DIRECTORY: WHAT IT IS, HOW TO USE IT PURPOSE OF THE DIRECTORY The Directory was compiled as the major reference tool of the Clearinghouse, to help it to make meaningful referrals. Sinr.e such a tool is of potential value to other information providers, it is made available to them as well. The first edition was a catalyst for better communication and understanding within the handicapped information field, and a tool useful in the early stages of forming a network of these information providers. As a burgeoning network, we each need to be aware of what other information providers are doing and we need to give feedback to others' efforts, in order to improve them. For this reason, we welcome comments on the Directory-its contents and its usefulness to the other providers of information in the handicapped field. On page 182 we have included a partial list of other important directories which our readers may also fmd helpful. ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDED IN THE DIRECTORY For the Directory, the Clearinghouse attempted to identify and collect information on national level organizations which respond to inquiries from the public and professionals on a variety of topics. The organizational units listed in the Directory are information and direct service providers. Because our focus is on information sources, we emphasize the information components of various kinds of organizations and have added material on data base vendors (the commercial companies which offer information seekers access to many large data bases). A few organizations listed are purely direct service providers operating without geographic limitations on clientele. We understand that in many instances, a national-level organization dispenses its information and services through local outlets. We have listed only the national address, after determining that an inquirer would be referred by the national office to its appropriate counterparts on the local level. The inquiries we have received from handicapped people and from users of the first Directory over the years have been overwhelmingly weigllted toward physical handicaps. Even so, in preparing this volume we have included major resources on mental health, alcoholism, and drug abuse, which will be able to funnel requests to other important resources known better to them than to us. The number of inquiries we have received over the years in the areas of sports and religion has been very small. F or this reason, we have listed these sources only briefly. (See Appendix, pages 177 to 181.) HOW THE DIRECTORY IS ORGANIZED To provide the user of the Directory with an understanding of the basic purpose of the organizations and agencies listed, we have grouped them into various categories. The labels are self explanatory, except for the fact that many of the voluntary health organizations are also service organizations; some of the organizations in the information section would also fit into other sections. The National Institutes of Health are placed in. the section on information providers, not because their basic purpose is providing information but because they have substantial information operations which are the most direct points of access to the Institutes. v The alphabetical list of all organizations and agencies found on page 186 will help you fmd what you are looking for irrespective of our attempt to categorize the organizations. Federal agencies have been identified by an asterisk. In the section on information there are a number of programs which are funded by Federal agencies but operated by contractors. These have not been marked as Federal; only those operated by Federal personnel are identified as Federal agencies. HOW THE DATA WERE GATHERED Much new information has come to the Clearinghouse in our natural process of acquisition and communication with organizations over the past three years. When we decided to update the Directory abstracts and to alter their format, we reviewed the old abstracts and talked with people in each organization. We then prepared new abstracts and sent them to each organization for verification. In the process, we also collected a great deal of new material produced by the organization. The Directory contains abstracts on 285 organizations. Eliminations were made when organizations could not be reached by phone or mail or were obviously beyond our focus. Any other omissions were inadvertent. THE INDEX In a Directory of this size and scope, the index will be an important guide to your searches. Be sure to consult the section, \"HOW TO USE THE INDEX,\" on page 195,::. vi ~--------------------------------------------------------------1 I TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Preface ................................................................ iii How to Use the Directory ...................................................

PBS has played a major role in developing the caption system. NCI was established with funding from HEW's Bureau of Educaton for the Handicapped. The Institute's primary goal is to make captioned tehvision available to every deaf and hearing\u00b7impaired person who wants it. Closed captioning is a system that converts the TV program sound track into words or captions that are shown on the viewer's television screen. The captions are coded and transmitted by the broadcaster on a portion of the television frame that does not ordinarily carry picture information. Unlike open captions which are seen by all viewers, closed captions are seen only on television sets equipped with a special device. The equipment needed to receive closed captions is manufactured and marketed by Se~\\l's, Roebuck & Co. By the end of 1980, a substantial number of captzoned programs-predominantly prinle time-will be broadcast each week. An increase in the number of captioned programs broadcast by the networks and local TV stations will depend largely on the demand by television viewers for the special equipment.

It will put the user on the track of the national-level organizations that may be able to respond to his/her need. However, it cannot substitute for careful reading and screening of the abstracts in the directory for pertinence to one's query. Every attempt was made to be brief and practical. The aim was to create useful entries, via index terms, to the organizations that could be helpful. For some organizations and some topics, this required indexing in more detail than others. Index terms are primarily of two kinds: disorder terms (e.g., EPILEPSY) and non-disorder terms (e.g., EDUCATION, VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION, FUNDING, PROSTHETICS, VETERANS, and so on). Disorder Tenus Approximately 102 terms have been used to describe specific disorders or general categories of disorders. If an organization covers most neurological disorders, it will appear under NEUROLOGICAL DIS\u00ad ORDERS but not under the many specific terms such as EPILEPSY, PARKINSON'S DISEASE, and the like. If you are looking for all organizations with information on epilepsy, you must look under EPILEPSY and also under the broader categories into which epilepsy would fit: NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS and DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. Information operations covering all or many aspects of a broad field like MEDICINE have been indexed only to tillS broad term, and no attempt has been made to index them to specific disorder or non-disorder terms. Non-Disorder Terms Organizations whose information covers subjects pertinent to all handicaps or to all physical handicaps are indexed by non-disorder terms such as EDUCATION, RECREATION, CAREERS, etc., but not by the 100 or more disorders which could conceivably be covered by that agency. Our inability to defme every term precisely and uniformly is handled by SEE ALSO references, which will alert you to related terms. When you seek informatica on a very precise and narrow subject, you . will have to contact the organizations themselves to fmd out whether they cover your specific interest; the index will only have given you a solid lead, through the use of selected broad and specific terms. Be sure to read the scope notes which accompany many of the terms. These notes give valuable infonuation on areas covered 01' ontitted by the terms. 195 Preceding page blank INDEX All Federal Agencies are asterisked for easy identification.
