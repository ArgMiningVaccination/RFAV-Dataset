For a period of eleven years the author of this work has not only regarded it as the foundation-stone of all Anthroposophical endeavour, but has also striven to articulate it in the spoken and written word as the foundation-stone of all his own work. Whatever the task he had to carry out, he took his orientation from the Foundation Stone Meditation. This proved to be immensely helpful. And the present publication is meant to be an expression of gratitude for that help. It is intended to be an expression of gratitude to Rudolf Steiner.\" \"The practical exercise of the Foundation Stone Mediation represents, therefore, an exercise in journeying through the twelve points of view' of the circle. It engenders that inner mobility of the human 'I'-being, through which the force of rigidity is overcome first in man's inner nature, so that it can then - by way of karma - also be overcome in the natural world: that is to say; we bring about the redemption of the mineral kingdom that is to take place in the future Jupiter existence.\" \"This is the task of meditation: through the medium of a thought to arrive at a living experience of the forces of which that thought is an inner reflection.\" by Valentin Tomberg (Author) Paperback: + Shipping (outside of Europe) Price: \u20ac 15.50 + Shipping (for Europe) "}
