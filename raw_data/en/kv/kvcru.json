Our Integrative Holistic Approach to Healing What Our Patients Say - From disease to wellbeing. \"Words will never be able to fully express the gratitude I feel towards the staff at Holistic Healing Arts. Their approach to root cause healing has taken me from a state of disease to a state of wellbeing. Their unwavering support and personal guidance are unparalleled. I believe the modalities they use are at the forefront of medicine today. I'll now be forever blessed with the opportunity to live a healthy life. Thank you to all the Holistic Healing Arts staff for your support!\" K.M. - These doctors saved my life. \"I was a Lyme patient from New York seeking to get well when New York Lyme doctors had little to offer. The first day I was treated at HHA, I felt 50% better. Neural therapy and ozone were my major treatments, but IVs, supplements, and detox therapies were also extremely important. HHA doctors dig deep into the causes of Lyme and co-infections, treating these infections in literally hundreds of different ways. These doctors literally saved my life. I trust them unconditionally.\" M.P. - I love Holistic Healing Arts! \"I have been receiving medical guidance and support from Dr. Derksen and HHA for the past 14 years. During this time, I have received excellence and caring. The scope of her knowledge is very wide and she is just brilliant! Dr. Amy and her team are rare finds. Both she and the clinic are exceptionally empathetic and willing to help. I LOVE Holistic Healing Arts and would suggest its care and services to anyone.\" N.M. If you have persistent symptoms but haven't gotten answers, you're in the right place. How We Help You - Lyme & Chronic Infection Recovery from Lyme is possible. We use a variety of tools to determine the right treatments for you, in the right order. There are often co-infections or detox barriers that have limited your ability to tolerate or find the best treatments. - Mold-Related Illness We determine if mold is affecting your health based on your symptoms, history of exposure, and objective tests. Our goal is to help you identify your triggers and become able to tolerate the world around you more efficiently. - Digestive Issues A healthy gut is the cornerstone of good health. If you struggle with digestive issues such as IBS, celiac, diarrhea, or constipation we help you uncover the root cause and find relief so you can embrace your life again. - Hormonal Health Your hormones help you thrive, not just survive. They modulate your immune system and improve your resilience to stress. We optimize your hormones for your unique life stage so you can feel your best. - Autism & Sensory Issues We've worked with families touched by autism for more than 15 years. Our goal is to find the best ways to decrease neurologic and immune stress and help your child return to optimal function. - Neurological & Memory Support Your sharp mind and quick wit is not a relic of the past. We dig deep to discover the cause of puzzling neurological symptoms so your brain can function at its best. - Autoimmune Disease Live with less pain, inflammation and brain fog by correcting your misdirected immune response. We look beyond your diagnosis to see what other factors might be at play, including toxins and infections. By identifying the underlying triggers, we help minimize the immune impacts as well as your symptoms. - Pain Management Pain shouldn't stand in the way of living the life you want. We get to the root of your pain, which might be an injury, inflammation, or even nervous system dysfunction, and help you live pain-free again. - Sports & Recovery Medicine Healthy aging means staying strong and injury-free. If you're an athlete or just someone looking to become active again after fighting a long battle with illness, we help you incorporate exercise safely so you can remain active for years to come. - Allergies & Mast Cell Disorders Calm these histamine and inflammatory reactions and regain control of your life. Allergies are simply a misdirected immune response. We treat the underlying cause, calming the symptoms that make you feel miserable. - Environmental Medicine The environment is a key factor in health and disease, but is often overlooked. We care for those exposed to toxins in their homes, water, air, and soil, and treat them with proper detoxification and support. - Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders Optimize your health and live longer by treating the cause of these increasingly common conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, adrenal stress, high cholesterol, weight issues, and thyroid dysfunction.
