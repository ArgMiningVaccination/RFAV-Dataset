It's not right. You'd think by now we would be aware enough about \"cold and flu season\" to start acting well in advance to stay on our game -- our health game, that is. Vaccines have somehow become the prevention method of choice. It seems easier to get a shot than to take the necessary steps to work towards truly preventing getting sick by supporting our natural defences. Year after year, there are studies that demonstrate the lack of efficacy of the flu shot. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm#howeffective): \"How well the flu vaccine works (or its ability to prevent flu illness) can range widely from season to season. The vaccine's effectiveness also can vary depending on who is being vaccinated. At least two factors play an important role in determining the likelihood that flu vaccine will protect a person from flu illness: 1) characteristics of the person being vaccinated (such as their age and health), and 2) the similarity or \"match\" between the flu viruses the flu vaccine is designed to protect against and the flu viruses spreading in the community. During years when the flu vaccine is not well matched to circulating viruses, it's possible that no benefit from flu vaccination may be observed.\" In the last few years alone, studies have shown that [the flu vaccine had no impact on healthcare workers ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23881655)(working with people 60+ years of age). The question really is, how often do the dudes in lab coats make the match between strain of the flu and the vaccine? That is a bit of a political question and I was unable to find the answer. Whether you get the vaccine or not is your choice, but real prevention will always be your best defence.
