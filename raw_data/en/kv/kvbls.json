National Research Centers Contractors 102 Director's Statement About 100 years ago, Henry Le Chatelier studied the thermodynamic behavior of disturbed systems. He noted that a stable system which has one of its conditions changed will adjust other conditions in the system so as to accommodate the change. Social systems tend to behave similarly. The National Science Foundation, as any other social system, also adapts in the face of change to reach a preferred state of equilibrium. In a way, the Foundation's record of the past year may be thought of as a search for new and better balances. Balance may be static, but the search for it is dynamic, and we engage in a continuous process of maintaining or adjusting ongoing programs, eliminating programs which have served their purpose, and initiating new programs to meet changing priorities. We start from the proposition that the principal and unique mission of the NSF is to foster the health of science in the United States. To fulfill that policy, we help scientists search for answers to unresolved questions about nature and its laws and we support disciplinary research needed for future research appli\u00ad cations and technology. We seek to maintain a base of scientific competence in all fields of science and to improve our national research capabilities by help\u00ad ing to modernize instrumentation and other facilities. During fiscal year 1972, obligations for scientific research projects, National and Special Research Pro\u00ad grams, and National Research Centers amounted to more than $374.2 million, or 60 percent of the total funds obligated by NSF. This represented an increase of $106.8 million over the previous fiscal year. A scientist engaged in scientific research does so primarily to gain a fuller understanding of the subject studied. His interest may stem from a great variety of reasons. To cite a specific example, one such reason might be the observation of some pattern of periodicity which attracts his attention and curiosity. Some highlights from this year's Annual Report of the NSF will illustrate this particular stimulus to scientific research. I; Sp-DADV vi DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT For many years we have known that a variety of changes in the terrestrial upper atmosphere, particu\u00ad larly magnetism, recur regularly. Many such changes come about every 27 days\u2014the solar period of rotation\u2014and are believed to be due to particle beams coming from little-known sources on the sun known as \"M-regions.\" Efforts to trace the particle beams to their solar origin had'been unsuccessfur until now because of the magnetic fields of the sun's corona and the spiral paths followed by the particles in interplanetary space. From studies completed this year, it now appears that \"\"M-regions\" are not cor\u00ad related with solar activity per se, but are related instead to local changes in the coronal plasma. Above magnetically complex active regions, the lines of magnetic force are closed, while above simple \"\"quiet\" regions, the lines of force are more open and allow an outward flow of gas. Periods of pulsation have also been used to tell us something about distances in space and the problem of galaxy development. Since the early 1900's, astronomers have used pulsating stars to serve as brightness standards of space distance. These stars expand and contract with a rhythmic regularity, and as the dimensions of the star change there are corre\u00ad sponding periodic changes of color and luminosity. In short, the brighter the star, the longer the pulsation period. From this relationship, it is possible to more accurately calculate the distance between the star and the earth. Pulsating stars which have a period of less than a day, called RR Lyrae stars, have been investigated at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, and two discoveries have been made. First, thanks to better access to the southern heavens at the Cerro Tololo observatory where the large Magellanic Cloud can be observed, we have been able to correct previous determinations of RR Lyrae periodicity and improve our estimates of galactic distances. Second, astronomers have found some RR Lyrae stars outside our galaxy with a much smaller spread in their period-luminosity relation than the same types of stars in the Milky Way system where we are located. Since the spread in RR Lyrae stars of our galaxy is attributed to varia\u00ad tions in the abundance of elements heavier than helium\u2014an indication of enrichment through suc\u00ad cessive generations\u2014 the smaller spread in the RR Lyrae stars observed outside our galaxy is interpreted to indicate a narrow range of age, i.e., a single generation. When we turn to periodic motions on earth, we find that notable progress was made last year toward deciphering the complex motions of the sea, particu\u00ad larly the familiar oscillation of the tides. It has now beeiT concluded^hatThe North Atlantic Ocean has a natural vibration period of 14.8 hours. In addition, tidal dissipation rates have been shown to be ex\u00ad tremely high, particularly along the continental margin. Knowledge of resonance periods and dissipa\u00ad tion rates are vital for oceanographic studies and at the same time are potentially useful for predicting storm tides. The study of periodicity^ in space, the upper atmos\u00ad phere, and oceans described above are all motivated by the desire to understand natural phenomena. But sometimes investigations of periodicity seek more than understanding. They deliberately seek utility, in contrast to the work on tides mentioned before which has a potential practical value only incidental to the main thrust of the research. A good example of utility-oriented research is to be found in NSF- supported investigations of chemical process dynamics which are typical of the petroleum and chemical industries. In this case, the object is not so much to explain regularly recurring phenomena, but to put them to use. By deliberate pulsing and cycling of operating conditions, using specialized computa\u00ad tional equipment for modeling and simulation, dramatic improvements in plant performance and efficiency may be possible. Research, whether basic or applied, is not limited to studies of periodic phenomena, of course. For example, it may be focused on specific areas of societal concern as in the case of the Research Applied to National Needs (RANN) Program. In this pro\u00ad gram, more direct and explicit consideration than in our programs of scientific research is placed on improving our ability to deal effectively with social and environmental problems and on exploration of technological opportunities that can lead to improve\u00ad ments in economic growth and productivity and to new products and services. In fiscal year 1972, the RANN Program reached a budget level of $53.8 million\u2014more than 50 DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT vii percent higher than the previous year when it was established. During this period, the RANN Program represented 9 percent of the total funds obligated by NSF. With these augmented resources, research is being focused across a broad range of projects with principal emphasis on three problem areas. The first is energy, because of its importance to national pro\u00ad ductivity and economic growth, environmental con\u00ad cerns, and the decline in reserves of preferred fossil fuels. Energy studies supported by RANN have: Provided a start toward a complete picture of the present and prospective U.S. energy prob\u00ad lem; and Identified energy research completed, under way, or still to be done in order to cope with this problem. Regional environmental systems are a second major focus of RANN because of their importance for the maintenance of life in terms of available natural resources. Although the studies of environ\u00ad mental systems in coastal areas, river basins, urban- rural and semiprimitive areas are aimed at the problems of specific regions, it is expected that the results can also be transferred to similar regions and problems elsewhere. The third major thrust within the RANN Pro\u00ad gram relates to municipal systems and services. The population movement from farm to city has been called the silent revolution. As city and suburban populations grow and as people relate to one another through a network of increasing complexity, it be\u00ad comes ever more urgent to analyze municipal prob\u00ad lems systematically. Among these problems are delivery of municipal and social services in communi\u00ad ties of varying sizes and in rural as well as tirban settings. Here, as in the case of environmental systems, we expect that useful results from one city can be used by other cities faced with similar problems. RANN is in a youthful phase of development as a program. Synthesis of available information takes time, and the determination of present day concen\u00ad trations of pollutants and trace compounds in the environment requires patient and careful effort. Predictive models have to be debugged and tested, and policy alternatives assessed. We have some useful results, but much remains to be done. From the point of view of science education, critical changes have taken place in the social en\u00ad vironment. These changes include the movement toward a service-oriented society, the increased desire by greater numbers of students to broaden their edu\u00ad cational experiences and career options, and the need to enhance the versatility of our scientific and tech\u00ad nological manpower. To cope with these problems, a significant restructuring and revitalization is under way in the Foundation's science education program, with particular emphasis on research and develop\u00ad ment in science education. Support for NSF educa\u00ad tion programs, excluding graduate student support, remained fairly steady, amounting to $65.0 million in fiscal year 1972\u2014about 10 percent of the total NSF obligation. We will continue our long-practiced efforts to improve course content, curricula, and instructional methods. These efforts will concentrate, however, on projects which are problem rather than discipline oriented, and which place special weight on what the student rather than the teacher does. We seek flexibility by giving priority to course and curriculum projects which can be fitted, unit by unit as conditions permit, into existing educational niches. Similarly, we are most interested in the development of new training alternatives at the graduate level, particu\u00ad larly where practical experience can be built into the educational program. Obviously, benefits can only flow from these efforts if professional educators are informed about them and can choose educational options wisely. Institutes of various kinds are maintained for this purpose, as is the NSF support for improving the initial training for those preparing to become teach\u00ad ers. In order to extend the benefits of new develop\u00ad ments as widely as possible, we are also engaged in experimental pilot programs for the improvement of science education on a statewide or school system basis. Educational experiments are also beginning in a variety of large-scale projects which could result in major changes in the way undergraduate science is taught. With Foundation support, the Illinois Insti\u00ad tute of Technology is replacing traditional class\u00ad room lectures by a program of project-oriented studies; and at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, viii DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT traditional course and degree requirements for an entire college have been eliminated and students are required instead to show competence in a field by completing study projects and undergoing a compre\u00ad hensive evaluation. Computer-assisted instruction in the classroom advanced under a vigorous program of development and testing. Such instruction oifers~promise of bdST higher quality and less expensive education for many sectors of our society. As indicated before, our search for an effective balance sometimes requires that programs be elimi\u00ad nated which have served their purpose. Back in 1964, NSF began a program of graduate traineeships to add to the flow of highly talented individuals seeking science degrees. This program\u2014now being phased out\u2014has provided support for more than 35,000 man-years of graduate study. Two new programs not described in the body of the NSF Annual Report because only preliminary planning and discussion took place during fiscal year 1972 deserve mention. I refer to the programs of Experimental R&D Incentives and National R&D Assessment. Through the Experimental R&D Incen\u00ad tives Program we hope to learn how to help create an environment in which invention and innovation can flourish. To do this we anticipate experimenting \u2014on a small scale\u2014with actual modifications of the institutional or incentive structure involved in tech\u00ad nological innovation. Participants in this program will be expected to identify known or suspeaed blockages of the overall innovation process and to propose experimental changes by which the impor\u00ad tance of the blockages can be ascertained and methods of alleviating them tested. The companion National R&D Assessment Pro\u00ad gram represents a new effort to meet the needs of policy-makers concerned with how science and tech\u00ad nology contribute to the achievement of national goals and well-being in the broadest sense. In this program, national R&D patterns, incentive structures, and decision points will be analyzed and the implica\u00ad tions of alternatives will be assessed. The exchange and accessibility of scientific knowl\u00ad edge is an essential element of the total scientific enterprise, and the Foundation has become a focal point in the Federal Government for science com\u00admunications activities on both a national and global basis. To meet these new responsibilities\u2014under\u00ad taken at the request of the President's Office of Science and Technology\u2014the science information activities of the Foundation have been reoriented to concentrate more closely on the needs of the users. Leadership responsibilities for NSF take on a variety of'forms. The Federal Council for Science and Technology has assigned to the Foundation the responsibility to coordinate, nationally and inter\u00ad nationally, the U.S. effort related to the 1973 solar eclipse. This eclipse will be the most favorable for scientific research for the remainder of this century. The most suitable viewing sites are located in north\u00ad western and eastern Africa, and contacts have been made with representatives of foreign countries and international scientific union representatives regard\u00ad ing U.S. needs for studying the eclipse. Through these and other coordinating efforts with interested Federal agencies and private groups, scientists will be able to take full advantage of the approximately 7 minutes of total eclipse in order to observe solar features otherwise masked during full daylight. In still another remote area, the polar regions, NSF fulfills significant management and coordination responsibilities. Beginning in fiscal year 1972, the NSF has been funding the entire U.S. program in Antarctica, except for icebreaker support. In the Arctic region, where many Federal agencies conduct research programs, NSF chairs an interagency coordi\u00ad nating committee and in different ways coordinates and extends U.S. research efforts in the Arctic. Sometimes the solution to scientific problems re\u00ad quires concerted efforts on a broad front, as was recognized in the establishment of some of our national and special research programs. An example is the International Decade of Ocean Exploration (IDOE), in which scientists from many universities, often in cooperation with colleagues from other nations, joined forces in an unprecedented long-term study of the forces, the contents, and the influences of the ocean realm. Preliminary results from IDOE studies of the continental margin off the west coast of Africa have identified several large geologic struc\u00ad tures with great potential for future petroleum ex\u00ad ploitation. In the Ocean Sediment Coring Program, the drilling ship Glomar Challenger continued its DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT ix eminently successful probing of the ocean floor. Among the recent highlights of this operation is the delineation of the complex movements of continents and sea floors in the Indian Ocean area. Responsibility is not always the result of a formal designation or agreement. Sometimes, as in the case of the establishment of the Materials Research Divi\u00ad sion, it is the consequence of a series of actions designed to strengthen all parts of an endeavor. As a result of assuming sponsorship of a dozen materials research laboratories (founded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense) and the National Magnet Laboratory (founded by the Air Force) and grouping several research support programs from elsewhere in the Foundation, the new division will be responsible for more than 50 percent of the Federal support for materials and solid state research at U.S. educational institutions. The circumstances under which NSF is called upon and responds to the demands made upon it reveal much about the character and goals of the agency. As mentioned before, the NSF is the sole agency of the Federal Government for which the support of basic research is the principal and most important mission. As such, it has a flexibility which allows it to range broadly, free of the operational limitations which are imposed on other agencies by statute. In carrying out its functions, the NSF emphasizes the concepts of coordination and support. The Foundation gets things done through and with others rather than attempting to do a job by itself. In other words, we try to provide the means whereby something important can be done; and we try to keep people from duplicating the work of others by helping them act together in a concerted way and keeping the channels of scientific communication open. This statement highlights the cumulative impact of the many changes and activities which have taken place at NSF during the previous year. To sum\u00ad marize these, the NSF has: \u2014Strengthened fundamental research to broaden the base of understanding in all scientific fields and disciplines and provided support for impor\u00ad tant research no longer within the program priorities of other agencies. Particular emphasis has been given to the biological sciences, engi\u00ad neering, chemistry, oceanography, and the social sciences. \u2014Expanded research focused on economic, en\u00ad vironmental, and social problems. Results of such research will be useful in efforts to improve economic growth and productivity, enhance environmental quality, and improve U.S. capa\u00ad bility to deal with social issues. \u2014Redirected its science education programs to broaden the spectrum of students benefiting from NSF programs and increase the career options of science graduates. \u2014Increased and improved the exchange of scien\u00ad tific knowledge nationally and internationally for the benefit of the United States. Having done all this and more, we are still con\u00ad fronted with the question of whether a new and better balance has indeed been reached at the end of the year. Obviously, much analysis, careful assess\u00ad ment and judgment, by many people, especially the National Science Board, are involved in the decisions which led to where we are now. But no matter how carefully reasoned, well-intentioned, and sound the decisions might have been, no course of action appears \"balanced\" to everyone. How then to judge? It is my view that any time we are not investing in a reasonable proportion of basic science, we are neglect\u00ad ing the long-term interests of science and the nation. Any time we are not using to the maximum the scientific knowledge we have already uncovered, we are neglecting the short term. In science education we need to invest a reasonable proportion in curricula, in teaching methods, and in the upgrading of people throughout the education chain. At the same time, we have to prepare for a future with different kinds of students who have a wide range of needs in science education. We have to find ways of providing con\u00ad tinuing educational opportunities outside the formal educational system for this country's technologically based society. Obviously, the application of such criteria does not yield an incontestable, single answer. Those to whom we are accountable will make the necessary judgment. They can do so with the knowledge that X DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT we do not stand rigidly on a previously accepted doctrine, nor are we locked into positions that prevent us from adjusting our current state of balance. On the contrary, as this statement has highlighted, we are sensitive to the prospect for change where needed and alert for communications which tell us what the American people want and expect from the scientific community. So, too, are-we reeeptive-to-judgments from the scientific community as to emerging research areas of great yield. We receive this information from many different sources, and it must be assessed and reconciled. For these and other reasons, it is necessary that many of our changes be incremental and tailored closely to circumstances. Concurrently, we remain alert for the chance to apply useful leverage through new initiatives which may be useful in the solution of current societal problems. In this way, we can sustain the movement and momentum of the agency roward-iB-sta\"tUTOry~gOall7'and a new balance\" which is in equilibrium with its changing environment. This, I believe we have done as the record of the Annual Report indicates. This, we will continue to try to do in the future. Research Project Support Activities One of the major responsibilities of the National Science Foundation is to support and strengthen fundamental research in all fields of science. The Foundation has provided and will con\u00ad tinue to provide strong support for fundamental research in the biological, physical, mathematical, environmental, social, and materials sciences, and in engineering. The Foundation fulfills this responsibility by supporting efforts of individual scientists and engineers in their search to resolve scientific questions concerning basic life pro\u00ad cesses; natural laws and phenomena; complex factors influencing man's en\u00ad vironment; and the physical, psycho\u00ad logical, and other forces determining the individual behavior of man as well as the collective behavior of his soci\u00ad eties. Within NSF, the Research Direc\u00ad torate has the principal role in provid\u00ad ing the dynainics and organization of this support. There are two principal mechanisms by which it does this: Grants to academic institutions In support of individuals or small groups of scientists doing re\u00ad search considered to have out\u00ad standing potential for the develop\u00ad ment of new scientific knowledge. Grants in support of programs such as the International Biologi\u00ad cal Program and the Global Atmospheric Research Program. (These programs are described with other national programs on pages 36- 39). Support is also provided to assist in: Obtaining specialized research equipment, instrumentation, and research facilities. Defraying the costs of travel for individual scientists attending se\u00ad lected scientific conferences. Convening conferences and sym\u00ad posia. Supporting dissertation research in the social sciences and certain other sciences involving exten\u00ad sive field work. RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT The support of basic research in the United States has gone through sig\u00ad nificant adjustments in the past few years as a consequence of changing national priorities. During fiscal year 1972, by virtue of a special increase in its appropriation, the NSF was able to respond to this problem by increas\u00ad ing its support of research by an ap\u00ad preciable fraction of the amount cut back by other agencies. By this action, the executive branch and the Congress moved in concert to minimize the adverse impact upon the nation's strength in the basic sciences of a number of program changes by agen\u00ad cies whose supjport of basic research must, of necessity, be kept rather closely attuned to shifting mission re\u00ad quirements. This adjustment was made in all affected science disciphnes. In fiscal year 1972, the Foundation awarded 5,658 grants amounting to $242.5 million for the support of individual research projects. Compar\u00ad able figures for fiscal year 1971 were 4,495 grants for a total of $180.3 million. The distribution, number, and amount of grants according to field of science for fiscal years 1970, 1971, and 1972 are shown in table 1. Grants were awarded to 4 71 institutions, including 326 colleges and univer\u00ad sities, in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; 9 4 per\u00ad cent of the funds went to academic institutions. Of these, 23 2 received two or more research grants, and 130 received $200,000 or more. Table 2 shows the average distribution in fiscal year 1972 for approved cost items on the 5,65 8 research grants. SPECIALIZED RESEARCH FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT In fiscal year 1972, the Foundation awarded $6.0 million to institu\u00ad tions to assist in the purchase of specialized facilities and equipment in biology, astronomy, earth and atmo\u00ad spheric sciences, physics, chemistry, engineering, materials sciences, and the social sciences. (Computing and oceanographic facihties are discussed in the chapter on National and Inter\u00ad national Programs.) Table 3 shows the distribution of funds over a 3-year period. The nature of this support for specialized equipment and facilities is illustrated by the following examples.

These facilities provide a unique source of intense and continu\u00ad um X-rays which are of significant value to solid-state physicists, ekem^ ists, and atmospheric scientists, and which promise in the near future to be of use to biologists and radiolo\u00ad gists as well. At this type of special\u00ad ized facility, such varied projects are carried out as the study of photoemis- sion spectra of metals with chemi- sorbed molecules (important in under\u00ad standing the mechanism of chemical action on surfaces of all types), exciton fluorescence measurements on aromatic compounds, and photoabsorp- tion cross section measurements for important atmospheric gases. Another area where equipment and facilities were improved is in the field of noise research. NSF grants will make possible continued and expand\u00ad ed investigations in acoustical attenu\u00ad ation, the effect of transient noise on the auditory system, and research on environmental noise created by vari\u00ad ous sources such as residential air conditioners, diesel engines, jet en\u00ad gines, turbines, fans, air-moving de\u00ad vices, compressors, and traffic noise. This area of research has been increas\u00ad ing in importance as population den\u00ad sity and societal stresses increase and environmental issues gain priority in public attention. A low temperature hydraulic flow facility at the University of Iowa, constructed 2 years ago, has been continuously used with outstanding results on a number of basic and ap\u00ad plied studies involving various hy\u00ad draulic engineering characteristics of ice and ice formation. One study probed the stability of turbulent flows past freezing and melting ice bound\u00ad aries and the attendant formation of ice ripples and their effects on flows in ice-covered rivers. A part of this research won the international 1971 Straub prize for the year's outstand\u00ading hydraulics Ph.D. thesis. Another study investigated the mechanics of ice jams and the conditions under which fragmented ice accumulations become unstable, giving rise to chan\u00ad nel, blockage and flooding. A project of environmental interest is a study of the effects on river ice of the thermal ^ffluent_fronx_a__miclear-power-plant. The length of the Mississippi River that will be kept ice-free by this effluent is being investigated analyti\u00ad cally. MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES Vigorous and exciting progress characterize the four areas\u2014physics, chemistry, astronomy, and mathemat\u00ad ics\u2014that comprise the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Division. These traditional disciplines are highly de\u00ad veloped in technique, theory, and pat\u00ad terns of thought. They continuously exchange new knowledge, techniques, ideas, and problems among them\u00ad selves and also enlarge, enrich, and systematize their interactions with other areas of science and technolo\u00ad gy. The support patterns in these fields have been strongly perturbed, however, during recent years by the withdrawal of many other Federal agencies from the support of such research. The physics research program spans natural phenomena from subatomic particles to the forces that shape the universe. Continuous ad\u00ad vances in understanding these phenom\u00ad ena result in a steady transfer of knowledge to chemistry, the environ\u00ad mental sciences, engineering, the life sciences, and other areas directly con\u00ad cerned with finding ways to improve man's ability to live with and manage his surroundings. A reflection of this transfer was the assignment in 1972 of the Physics Program's work in sol\u00ad id state and low temperature physics and corresponding components of theoretical physics to the new Divi\u00ad sion of Materials Research, thereby relating knowledge from the forefront of physics research to development of new materials and materials process\u00ad ing techniques. Basic physics research is a source of long-range technological progress. For example, research into properties of the atomic nucleus has led to the -formatioH-of- an-entire new technolo\u00ad gy\u2014nuclear power\u2014which is already a billion-dollar industry and may, within a few decades, alter our entire approach to energy requirements. The modern electronics, communication, and computer industries are grounded in basic physics. Physics contributes to improved cancer radiation therapy through the use of new types of radi\u00ad ation, contributes to developing new sources of power to meet growing demands for energy, and contributes to improved technologies in such areas as lasers, magnetic materials, and spec\u00ad trometry. The technological payoff from basic physics research will continue. The chemistry research program increases our knowledge of the com\u00ad position, structure, and mutual inter- conversion of substances. It seeks ways of predicting, in general, which atomic or molecular arrangement will pro\u00ad duce a desired property, predicting the optimum sequence of reactions to pro\u00ad duce a desired molecule, and under\u00ad standing the rates of chemical re\u00ad actions. The areas of modern chemical re\u00ad search are interactive: Advances in one area are closely tied to advances in the others. For example, methods of chemical analysis and quantitative measurements, usually accomplished with modern sophisticated instru\u00ad ments, are indispensable to the solu\u00ad tion of nearly any chemical problem. Much of the progress made in under\u00ad standing molecular processes rests on the availability of instrumentation that permits the separation and analy\u00ad sis of complicated mixtures or that measures the effects of subtle changes in molecular properties. Another area of major importance is the development of an understand- RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 3 ing of the mechanisms by which cata\u00ad lysts influence the rates of chemical reactions without permanent change to the catalysts. NSF not only sup\u00ad ports ongoing research, but also re\u00ad search that probes new areas of op\u00ad portunity that may lead to commercial application. Research in astronomy deals with methods and equipment to increase our understanding of the objects and phenomena in the universe, the laws that govern them, and the relation\u00ad ships among matter, time, and space. Some of these objects are so remote that they can be studied only by means of electromagnetic radiation and cosmic particles coming from them and caught with instruments on the earth. These instruments, in short supply and exceedingly expensive to build, have benefited in recent years by technological developments that have increased the ability of astrono\u00ad mers to record more data using new instrumentation on existing tele\u00ad scopes. The need for Federal support of astronomy is large in comparison to many other fields of science because astronomy, though crucial in eluci\u00ad dating theories concerning physical laws, is not usually directly applicable to problems that would merit indus\u00ad trial or non-Federal support. NSF supports about 90 percent of the total U.S. effort in ground-based astrono\u00ad my, the balance coming from private and State sources. The program in mathematical sciences supports the creation of new techniques, understanding of mathe\u00ad matical structures already extant and the relations between them, and the construction of mathematical models of physical, biological, or social phenomena and their application to the world in which we live. As we develop more complex technologies in which elements of the social and bio\u00ad logical sciences are intermingled with those of the physical and engineering sciences, mathematics will play an in\u00ad creasing role. The applications of math\u00ad ematical research are generally not immediate and, when they are made, are apt to be widely diffused first into other sciences and then into technol\u00ad ogy- The recent past in mathematics has been characterized by increasing ab\u00ad straction and generalization, with the effect of revealing unsuspected kin\u00ad ships and confluence among tradition\u00ad al mathematical disciphnes. The result has been the creation of tools of un\u00ad precedented power for attacking problems of great difficulty. For ex\u00ad ample, the mathematical tools for a sophisticated theory of guidance of many kinds of vehicles, machines, and industrial processes have been made available through research in analysis and topology, and have resulted in a burgeoning of research in nonlinear ordinary differential equations. This research has also been responsible for the development of those parts of applied mathematics known as con\u00ad trol theory, optimization theory, and differential \"games.\" Examples of a few important re\u00ad search projects in the mathematical and physical sciences are described on the following pages. PHYSICS Scaling and Partons\u2014A Substructure for the Proton? One of the most important and stimulating findings in particle physics in recent years is the discovery of scale invariance\u2014or \"scaling.\" Briefly, the scaling property implies that certain phenomena involved in reactions of elementary particles have a very sim\u00ad ple mathematical representation, de\u00ad pending only on ratios of a few measured quantities. These ratios, which have no dimensions (like miles per hour), are, in a sense, analogous to the more familiar dimensionless numbers, such as the Reynolds num\u00ad ber in hydrodynamics which relates turbulent to laminar flows, or the Mach number in aerodynamics, which characterizes the kinds of shock waves that occur in supersonic flow. Initially suggested theoretically, scaling was first observed in the deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons (in which the proton is bro\u00ad ken apart by the deep-probing elec\u00ad tron) at the Stanford Linear Acceler\u00ad ator Center (SLAC), and subse\u00ad quently confirmed in more detailed measurements at the Cornell Electron Synchrotron. In these experiments, some of the kinetic energy of the incident electrons is converted to mass, which is ejected in the form of one or more elementary particles in addition to the struck proton. A large number of physical variables are necessary to describe the resulting complex multi-particle final states in such reactions. The first scaling exper\u00ad iments measured a quantity called the \"inclusive cross section,\" which is the probability of the electron scattering through a given angle. To determine it, only the incident and outgoing electron need be dealt with, and all of the additional particles can be ig\u00ad nored. This cross section is computed with the use of two so-called \"struc\u00ad ture\" functions which depend on the energy lost by the incident electron and the momentum transferred by that electron to the target proton. But when the structure functions are cal\u00ad culated for grossly different values of both energy loss and momentum transfer, their results fall along a smooth curve indicating that, over a wide range of energy and momentum transfers, these structure functions de\u00ad pend only on a dimensionless ratio of the two variables. The remarkable simplicity of this behavior may have profound implica\u00ad tions for understanding the structure of the proton itself, and a number of models have been adduced to explain these results. In one, the so-called \"parton model\" of R. P. Feynman at the California Institute of Technolo\u00ad gy, the nucleon (neutron or proton) is envisioned as a noninteracting gas of fundamental particles called \"par- tons.\" Deep inelastic scattering can be described as scattering of the elec\u00ad trons from these pointlike partons. This interpretation is reminiscent of 6 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT STRUCTURE FUNCTIONS FOR DEEP-INELASTIC 0.6 ELECTRON-PROTON SCATTERING Scaling Variable CD Scaling Variable (A) These experimental measurements show the \"structure\" functions that determine the inclusive cross section for deep inelastic scatter\u00ad ings. Adjacent points on these graphs are measured at grossly different values of energy and momentum transfer, but at neighboring values of their dimensionless ratio\u2014the scaling variable uj. The fact that these points define approximately smooth curves rather than scatter uniformly over the graph is a verification of the scaling hypothesis. Rutherford's work at the turn of the century, when his study of the behav\u00ad ior of the scattering of alpha particles from heavy atoms led him to con\u00ad clude that these atoms were made up of diffusely distributed clouds of elec\u00ad trons surrounding a pointlike, posi\u00ad tively charged nucleus. Determining specific details of the deep inelastic process will answer a host of ques\u00ad tions about the partons if they really do exist, and further experimental studies are going on at both SLAC and Cornell. In addition, deep inelastic scatter\u00ad ing experiments will shortly be ex\u00ad tended to a new energy domain at the National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, 111., where experiments in\u00ad volving beams of elementary particles known as muons (instead of elec\u00ad trons) will investigate scaling behav\u00ad ior in regions of energy and momen\u00ad tum transfer an order of magnitude larger than those accessible at SLAC and Cornell. One of the first such experiments, to be performed jointly by NSF-supported groups from Mich\u00ad igan State, Cornell, and the Universi\u00adty of California, San Diego, will scat\u00ad ter muons from heavy nuclei and in\u00ad vestigate a wide range of variables. A second, more elaborate experiment, by a Chicago-Harvard-Oxford collab\u00ad oration, will study a somewhat small\u00ad er kinematical range, but will use a liquid hydrogen (i.e., proton) target, and make a detailed study of all the outgoing particles as well. Gravitational Radiation Revisited Three years ago, Joseph \"Weber of the University of Maryland an\u00ad nounced the detection of events that he identified with pulses of gravita\u00ad tional radiation from some distant source. Although this interpretation of his data was greeted initially with skepticism by many members of the scientific community. Dr. Weber has continued to refine his techniques dur\u00ad ing the intervening years. The addi\u00ad tional observations that he has been able to obtain with these improve\u00ad ments are consistent with the idea that he is indeed detecting gravita\u00ad tional radiation, although they pose grave difficulties for theories of the sources of this radiation. Dr. Weber's initial experiment con\u00ad sisted of looking for anomalous exci\u00ad tations of vibrations of two 1-1/2-ton aluminum cylinders, one located at College Park, Md., and the other at the Argonne National Labo\u00ad ratory outside Chicago. A count was made of the number of times both cylinders were excited essentially si\u00ad multaneously (an event termed a \"coincidence\"), and it was found that these coincidences occurred much more frequently than could be ex\u00ad plained on the hypothesis that the bars were being excited by random thermal oscillations. Subsequent ex\u00ad periments have effectively ruled out the possibility that these signals are due to the earth's seismic activity, long wavelength electromagnetic dis\u00ad turbances, or cosmic rays\u2014the three most popular alternative explanations. In addition, the directional sensitivity of the cylinders indicated a signal source at either the galactic center or RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES a point diametrically opposed to the galactic center, not far from the Crab nebula. In the past year, Dr. Weber has instrumented a new disk-type of detector, which has a directional re\u00ad sponse different from the cylinder de\u00ad tectors. This detector, when run in coincidence with one of the old cylin\u00ad der detectors, is capable of removing the previous ambiguity of the source direction. New experiments point to a source of gravitational radiation at the center of our galaxy, rather than the anti-center. These remarkable observations have stimulated intense activity in many segments of the scientific com\u00ad munity. Theoretical physicists have pointed out that if the events are gravitational in origin, and if their source is located in the center of the galaxy and radiating energy with equal strength in all directions, then enough mass must be converted into energy in the form of gravitational waves near the galactic center to have a noticeable effect on the motions of clouds of hydrogen gas near the solar system. Radio astronomers have not detected such motions, however, and this has led one group of theorists, under the direction of Charles Misner (also at Maryland) to suggest a kind of gravitational synchrotron radiation as a possible source mechanism. In this theory, gravitational radiation from a very rapidly accelerated mas\u00ad sive object orbiting near the galactic center would beam its radiation pre\u00ad dominantly into the plane of the galaxy. Although this beaming would relieve the stringent energy loss re\u00ad quirements mentioned above, no one has yet proposed a convincing picture of how the radiating masses could get into their orbits. On the experimental side, groups are setting up apparatus to confirm Dr. Weber's results, including one in the U.S.S.R., one in Germany, two each in Italy and the United King\u00ad dom, and one in Canada. In the United States, the Foundation is sup\u00ad porting two efforts in addition to Dr. Weber's. One detector system at the University of Rochester is quite simi-.Physicist Joseph Weber is here shown with his disk detector. This detector is least sensitive the kind of gravitational radiation predicted by Einstein's theory when its flat face is perp( dicular to the direction of the radiating source. 491-718 0 - 73 -2 8 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT TIME DISTRIBUTION OF WEBER PULSES 80,- w LU o z 111 9 o z o o o 18 22 SIDEREAL TIME Original experiments to detect gravitational radiation recorded coincident \"events\" measured by cylinders at two widely separated locations. They revealed a source of radiation at either the center or anti-center of our galaxy (left). (The earth is essentially transparent to gravitational radiation, so the data are combined into half a day's time.) Recent experiments (right) using one cylinder and one disk detector (which is least sensitive to radiation when its flat face is pointed towards it) show the fewest coincidences when pointing toward the galactic center\u2014 confirmation that the center is the source of the radiation. lar to Dr. Weber's, and will be run in coincidence with a detector being constructed at the Bell Telephone Lab\u00ad oratories. Superconducting detectors to achieve maximum isolation from all sources of thermal noise will be run at Louisiana State University and Stanford University. Through collabo\u00ad rative efforts such as these, physicists in the next few years hope to gain new insights into the nature of the surprising phenomenon discovered by Dr. Weber, which, if it is not gravita\u00ad tional radiation, is likely to be even more significant. CHEMISTRY Chemistry and Combustion what happens in flames is a matter of great practical concern. From the simple hydrogen-oxygen flame, now being reexamined as a possible major source of energy, to the complex combustion of wood, chemists are de\u00ad voting increasing effort to trying to understand the details of the combus\u00ad tion process. This work is possible as a result of instruments and techniques that have become available in the past two decades for study of the extremely fast and energetic processes that occur in flames. Foundation grantees are working on many projects to understand these processes. Thomas Vickers of the University of Florida is studying the changes in light absorbed and emitted when trace amounts of heavy jnetals are present in hydrogen \"flames. At Pennsylvania State University, Howard Palmer has recently observed light from an excited form of sulfur dioxide for the first time when carbon disulfide or carbon oxysulfide is burned in oxygen. At the State Uni\u00ad versity of New York at Binghamton, Walter Kaskan may provide informa\u00ad tion useful in assessing the potential of ammonia as a fuel from his measurements of the formation and destruction of nitrogen oxide in am\u00ad monia flames. In those examples, flames are being studied directly. It is possible, howev\u00ad er, to learn a great deal about flames by generating the reactive species present in flames by processes other than combustion and studying their reactions. For example, direct studies have shown that many flames contain a number of reactive fragments, in\u00ad cluding oxygen and hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals (the product from combination of one hydrogen and one oxygen atom). These species can be produced in a number of ways. Frederick Kaufman at the Uni\u00ad versity of Pittsburgh simply heats hy\u00ad drogen gas with a tungsten filament to create hydrogen atoms; he then studies their reaction with each other in the presence of other gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, or methane. At Illinois Institute of Tech\u00ad nology, David Gutman uses mi\u00ad crowave or radiofrequency discharges to dissociate oxygen molecules into oxygen atoms. A stream of these atoms is then made to collide with a crossed beam of \"fuel,\" such as acety\u00ad lene, and the unstable products of the collisions are detected. This method has already been used to show that the inferences about these products from previous experiments in which RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 9 In this reaction of hydrogen gas containing methyl borate burning in air, the brighter low region is the flame or reaction zone, and the middle and upper region is the burned gas (the metal screen above the flame gives hydrodynamic stability). The vertical streaks on the sides are clouds of condensed boric oxide particles and mark the hot/cold boundary. A spectogram of the flame shows the light emitted by the boric oxide bands, with the brighter portion of the spectrum at the bottom in the flame zone and the darker portion above in the burned gases. (Photo by Walter Kaskan, SUNY-Binghamton) they could not be detected directly were wrong. Ultraviolet light can also cause dissociation of molecules into atoms or larger molecular fragments, both in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. In fact, the work of both Drs. Kaufman and Gutman is equally important in understanding smog and upper atmosphere chemistry as it is for explaining combustion. Another technique that produces temperatures, fragments, and hght emission very similar to flames is to pass shock waves through a mixture of gases. Dr. Gutman also used this method to study the acetylene-oxygen reaction. In the first experiment, the crossed beams, he learned what un\u00ad stable fragments are initiallv formed. He was then able to deduce some\u00ad thing about how fast they form and react from the nature of the light emitted from the shock tube. Ralph Kern at Louisiana State University is now using a modification of the shock tube technique to learn how methane decomposes y/hen it is heated. Among other things, it turns out that one of the intermediate products is acety\u00ad lene, which immediately links this study with Dr. Gutman's. The reactions discussed so far were intentionally chosen by the investiga\u00ad tors to be as simple as possible. Still, the acetylene-oxygen reaction proba\u00ad bly involves at least 20 intermediate compounds before the final stable products, water and carbon dioxide, are formed. The techniques being used in these relatively simple com\u00ad bustions would produce hopelessly complicated results if they were ap\u00ad plied to a process such as the combus\u00ad tion of the cellulose of which cotton consists. Yet, understanding this pro\u00ad cess is at least as important as know\u00ad ing how acetylene burns. The ap\u00ad proach being used by Fred Shafizadeh at the University of Montana, and at the University of California's State\u00ad wide Air Pollution Research Center in Riverside, is called pyrolysis. This involves heating cellulose below flame temperatures and/or in the absence of oxygen and collecting and identify\u00ad ing the gaseous products formed. At the California laboratories, cotton treated with sugar containing radioac\u00ad tive carbon produces cellulose con\u00ad taining radioactive \"labels.\" Pyrolysis of this material will help determine the exact source of the carbon mon\u00ad oxide and carbon dioxide produced. None of the experiments discussed here is spectacular in itself. Yet, all of them, and a much larger body of research on the chemistry of reactive fragments, are providing a base of scientific understanding which is crucial to the solution of the practical problems of fire prevention and air pollution, as well as a host of other problems of economic and environ\u00ad mental importance. Potential Surface for the F -\\- Ha Reaction Powerful theoretical techniques are now being brought to bear on reac\u00ad tions similar to those which occur in 10 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT combustion. An important goal is the prediction, from first principles, of chemical reaction rates, and a great deal of effort has been expended on this problem since the early 193O's. Basically, quantum mechanics is em\u00ad ployed in the calculation of points on a \"hill-and-valley-like\" surface rep\u00ad resenting the potential energy of a system of atoms and molecules in a particular configuration. Low regions shaped somewhat like narrow valleys, representing relatively low potential energy, correspond to compounds. The passage of a point from one valley over a saddle point (or pass) into another valley represents a chemical reaction, and the shape of the surface determines the rate of the reaction and the energy disposition among the products. The surface for the system of three hydrogen atoms (the same sys\u00ad tem being studied experimentally by Dr. Kaufman) is the simplest to treat theoretically. It has received extensive study, from which principles useful in more complex situations have emerged. Development of computa\u00ad tional techniques and the availability of high-speed computers now makes possible rehable calculations for sys\u00ad tems containing larger atoms. Henry F. Schaefer III, of the Uni\u00ad versity of California, Berkeley, with the aid of a Foundation grant and in collaboration with several other scien\u00ad tists, has recently carried out calcula\u00ad tions for the potential energy surface for the fluorine plus hydrogen mole\u00ad cule system. The chemical reaction F -f Ha FH + H has been stud\u00ad ied experimentally by a number of techniques related to those used by Drs. Kaufman and Gutman, and fairly detailed information is available about the reaction dynamics. In preliminary work, about 3 J 0 in\u00ad dividual calculations were carried out, each referring to a particular ar\u00ad rangement of the three atoms. A great deal of information was ob\u00ad tained about the potential surface and about the usefulness of various the\u00ad oretical approaches. It was found that the minimum energy path for the reaction involved an arrangement in which the F-H-H atoms lie along a straight line. Further refinements pro\u00ad duced a potential surface which is thought to correspond fairly closely to reality and is considered to be of chemical accuracy. The barrier -height (whi&h represents the energy difference between the saddle point and the separated reactants) and the exothermicity (the energy released when the reaction occurs) agree quite well with experimental quantities. It is expected that this potential surface, calculated from first principles, will be useful for dynamical studies (clas\u00ad sical trajectories, semiclassical and quantum treatments) that will allow comparison of additional theoretical results with information obtained by experiment. Dr. Schaefer is also ap\u00ad plying this kind of analysis to reac\u00ad tions involving hydrogen and oxygen species, which should provide a the\u00ad oretical base with which to compare and refine the experimental studies of simple flames. ASTRONOMY Standard Candles One of the most difficult and yet one of the most fundamental observa\u00ad tional problems which astronomers must solve is that of identifying stars of known intrinsic brightness to serve as basic indicators of distance to the systems in which they are found. Over the past half century pulsating varia\u00ad bles (e.g., Cepheids) have been these standards. Early research indicated a linear relation between intrinsic brightness and period of pulsation, though upon closer inspection the relation has required extensive modifi\u00ad cation. Each change has produced al\u00ad terations in the distance scale of our own and distant galaxies. Variable stars that pulsate in less than a day, the RR Lyrae stars, have been the subject of two observational programs at the Cerro Tololo Inter- American Observatory (CTIO). John Graham, a CTIO staff member, is now completing a study of 52 RR Lyrae stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite of our own galaxy. Dr. Graham has discovered that the RR Lyrae variables in this nearby companion form a very homo\u00ad geneous group having a much smaller spread in their period-luminosity rela\u00ad tion than iS\"found for the same- types of stars in the main Milky Way sys\u00ad tem, where we are located. The dis\u00ad persion found in our own galaxy is attributed to variations in the abun\u00ad dance of elements heavier than heli\u00ad um. Dr. Graham's observations, therefore, indicate that the RR Lyrae stars in the Large Cloud have a very small range in heavy-element abun\u00ad dance. His result is further interpreted as meaning a narrow range of age, i.e., a single generation, for stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, as op\u00ad posed to the several generations present in the Milky Way. Each suc\u00ad cessive generation is richer than the preceding one in carbon, nitrogen, ox\u00ad ygen, and heavier metals because nu\u00ad clear reactions in older stars slowly fuse these elements from hydrogen and helium, enriching the raw materi\u00ad al for new stars. A similar study of RR Lyrae stars in our own Milky Way system has been made jointly by F. D. A. Hart- wick and Graham Hill, guest investi\u00ad gators at CTIO, and James E. Hesser of the CTIO staff. Although the very central regions of our galaxy are effectively blocked from our view by heavy interstellar obscuration, there is a small, relatively clear region toward the galactic center in which Walter Baade discovered over 100 RR Lyrae stars many years ago. Using these objects as \"standard candles,\" Dr. Baade was able to make an estimate of the distance to the center of our galaxy and thus set the scale for all galactic structure studies. The region studied by Dr. Baade is in the south\u00ad ern sky and he could observe it only for a very short time, since it never rises more than about 20\u00b0 above the horizon at the Mt. Wilson Observato\u00ad ry in California. Dr. Hesser and his colleagues have demonstrated that in RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 11 The nearest neighbor of our own Millty Way galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, passes nearly overhead at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Excellent observations of its constituent stars can be made there, as the chart below, the distribution of RR Lyrae stars, shows. The narrow width of the distribution indicates that these stars formed from the inter\u00ad stellar medium at nearly the same time, as opposed to the several generations in the Milky Way. (Photo by John Graham, CTIO; chart by Kitt Peak National Observatory) 10 APPARENT BLUE MsAQNITiJOE 84 percent of the 38 variables checked by the observers in Chile, the observing conditions imposed on Dr. Baade at Mt. Wilson, coupled with the limitation that the periods of pul\u00ad sation of RR Lyraes are some frac\u00ad tion of a day, led to erroneous deter\u00ad minations of periods. New determi\u00ad nations of the characteristics of these stars\u2014their periods and metal abun\u00ad dances\u2014will lead to an improved es\u00ad timate of the size of our galaxy. Very Long Baseline Interferometry Digital Very Long Baseline (VLB) interferometry is an observing tech\u00ad nique used at the National Radio As\u00ad tronomy Observatory (NRAO) and certain other observatories. Record\u00ad ings of a celestial radio source are made simultaneously at two or more widely separated sites, using atomic clocks for synchronization. Later, in- tercomparison of the recorded data from all sites involved permits con\u00ad struction of a model of the spatial structure of the radio source with extremely high angular resolving power. One of the most exciting finds to come from the new technique is the discovery of \"super-relativistic\" ex\u00ad pansion in radio sources. During a series of transcontinental observations made from 1970 to the present, the visibility patterns of several sources were found to change with time, indi\u00ad cating that the parts of the sources were separating as seen from the earth. The sources are thought to be very distant, so the simplest interpre\u00ad tation of the effect required very high apparent expansion velocities within the sources\u2014in one source, nearly ten times the speed of light. Since the possibility that matter is really moving with velocities in excess of the speed of light is not taken seriously by the experimenters, other alternatives have been explored. Da\u00ad vid DeYoung at NRAO has proposed an explanation in terms of the dis\u00ad tribution of synchrotron radiation in a 12 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT source expanding at nearly the speed of light. (Synchrontron radiation, first discovered in the accelerators bearing the same name, is produced when a charged particle moving at a speed very close to the speed of light passes through a magnetic field.) He found that sources with apparent expansion velocities in excess of the velocity of light can result from natural geome\u00ad tries and reasonable expansion rates due to the tricks played on the ob\u00ad server by the arrival time of light traveling from the source. William Dent of the University of Massachusetts Ijas proposed a motion- free model using data on source vari\u00ad ability obtained from the Haystack Radio Telescope in Tyngsboro, Mass., supported by the Foundation's univer\u00adsity research grants program. In his explanation, the central component of an aligned triple source gradually weakens and disappears. The mean spacing within the source, as measured by the interferometer, thus appears to increase without any mass motions taking place at all. These and other models are presently being tested using further observation with new VLB systems recently completed at NRAO. If none of these \"optical illusion\" models can be confirmed, a possible alternative is that the sources are much closer than previously thought, so that the speed required for the source to move through the angle seen from the earth is less than the speed of light. In any event, it is clear that further study of this phenomenon will lead to a better understanding of the origin of radio galaxies and quasars. Quasars Quasars are one of modern astron\u00ad omy's most challenging puzzles. They appear as starhke points, rather than as extended galaxies, even in the largest optical telescopes. Their radio wavelength emission is no different from that of more normal-appearing radio galaxies. However, their light is strongly displaced toward the longer wavelengths, producing a redshift. Es\u00ad tablishing the cause of quasar red- shifts is a controversial, fundamental problem facing astronomers. RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 13 The controversy arises because all of the major theories interpreting the redshifts lead to situations beyond our current comprehension of physics. Two proposed explanations hold that motion of the quasar away from us causes the shift via the so-called Dop- pler effect. In the first case, the mo\u00ad tion is part of the overall, general expansion of the universe and the large shifts indicate that quasars are extremely distant and extraordinarily luminous. This is the cosmological in\u00ad terpretation. Since they appear as points, quasars must be relatively small compared to galaxies, even if they are far away. The problem in accepting this idea is that there is no known way to confine such strong energy sources in the small volumes apparent for quasars. The second the\u00ad ory holds that the high speeds result because the quasars were shot out of other nearby galaxies. Thus, the qua\u00ad sars themselves would not be exces\u00ad sively bright because they would be closer to us. On the other hand, there is no known way to eject anything at such high speed from a galaxy. A third suggestion is simply that the redshifts result from some unknown physical phenomenon, having little or nothing to do with motion. For several years, it has been real\u00ad ized that a crucial observational test of the cosmological interpretation would be provided if a quasar could be found in a cluster of galaxies, and if it could be demonstrated that the redshifts of the \"ordinary\" galaxies in the cluster were the same as that of the quasar. Such a finding would, first, confirm the association of the quasar with the cluster of galaxies and, second, confirm the cosmological interpretation of the quasar redshift, since the cosmological interpretation of the redshift of \"ordinary\" galaxies is widely accepted. The quasar PKS 2251 + 11, which is surrounded by a small, compact cluster of galaxies, represents such a test case. L. B. Robinson and E. J. Wampler of the Lick Observatory recently measured redshifts for the two brightest ordi\u00ad nary galaxies in this cluster of galax\u00adies and found them to be essentially equal to that of the quasar. One of the two galaxies is the faintest ordi\u00ad nary galaxy for which a redshift has ever been measured. The results of these difficult observations provide strong support for the cosmological interpretation of some quasars' red- shifts. These observations were made pos\u00ad sible by the development of an image tube spectrum scanner by Dr. Wam\u00ad pler for use on the Lick Observatory 120-inch telescope. The development and application of state-of-the-art electro-optical detectors, sponsored jointly by NSF and NASA at the Lick Observatory, represents an important and exciting trend in contemporary astronomy. This trend emphasizes de\u00ad tector efficiency rather than telescope size, and is making intermediate-sized telescopes competitive in some re\u00ad spects with the present abilities of the world's largest telescopes. MATHEMATICS Finite Group Theory One of the simplest and most use\u00ad ful of algebraic structures is the group. This concept has found appli\u00ad cations in many branches of mathe\u00ad matics, as well as physics and chemis\u00ad try. For example, the theory of finite groups has applications in crystal\u00ad lography, in the theory of inorganic complex ions, and in spectroscopy. For a typical example, consider the ordinary plane, which we may think of as the surface of a very large table. A \"move\" consists of shifting the table and also pivoting it around its center. Two such moves may be combined by carrying out one after the other. If we first perform move M and then move N, the resulting com\u00ad bined move is called the composition MN of moves M and N. Composition of moves has interesting formal prop\u00ad erties. There exists a move I, called the identity or neutral move, which consists of not displacing the table at all. For this move, I, we have MI = M = IM. For each move M there also is the inverse M* of M, which undoes what M did, that is, such that MM''\" = I. There is also the so-called associative rule for composi\u00ad tion: M(NP) = (MN)P. These formal properties of moves occur also in other situations and, by the process of abstraction from these various examples, algebraists have ar\u00ad rived at the notion of a group. A group is any set of elements with a composition law that has the formal properties described above. Thus, the moves described above form a group, but there are also many other groups which may occur under completely different circumstances. Perhaps the most famihar example of a group is the set of all integers where the oper\u00ad ation to be performed is addition. Groups are either finite or infinite, according to whether the set has a finite or infinite number of elements. A basic problem in the theory of finite groups is the determination of the structure of all finite groups. (For example, given a number n, how many groups with n elements are there?) In order to attack this prob\u00ad lem, mathematicians have introduced the notion of a group which is, in some sense, indecomposable, the sim\u00ad ple group. Simple groups are in a sense the building blocks for all groups. A classification of all finite simple groups would constitute deci\u00ad sive progress in the subject. A major breakthrough in this area occurred in 1963, when W. Feit and J. Thompson showed that essentially every simple group has an even num\u00ad ber of elements. There are now indi\u00ad cations that Dr. Thompson has taken another great step: He seems to have succeeded in classifying all simple groups such that the number of ele\u00ad ments is not divisible by three. There are some finite simple groups that may be called classical. By the early 1960's, these had been thor\u00ad oughly sorted out. Thus, the remain\u00ad ing task is to find all the nonclassical finite simple groups (called sporadic groups). As long ago as 1861, E. Mathieu discovered five such groups. 14 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT For over 100 years it was thought that these were the only ones. How\u00ad ever, in 1965, Z. Janko startled the mathematical community with the discovery of a new sporadic group and, shortly thereafter, contributed to the discovery of an additional two. At present, there are 20 known sporadic groups. One of the large groups, Coi, is, incidentally, quite remark\u00ad able in two ways. One, it arose from a study by J. Leech of close packing of spheres in 24 dimensions (a prob\u00ad lem related to the theory of error- correcting codes). Two, this group surprisingly contains copies of many others on the list. It is clear that finite simple groups exist in greater abundance than had recently been suspected. It remains to be seen whether the list of sporadic THE TWENTY KNOWN SPORADIC GROUPS GROUP DISCOVERED NUMBER OF ELEMENTS Mil 1860- 2\u00bb-3'-5'-7-13-29 145,926,144,000 groups can be shown to have only finitely many isolated members or, if there are- infinitely many new simple groups to be found, whether they will form a natural family with a sensible structure. Many mathematicians are working on these and related ques\u00ad tions in this active area of research, some of which is_being carried out by^ a skillful combination of handwork and large, high-speed electronic com\u00ad puters. BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCES Research programs continue to study complex biological systems so as to increase our understanding of the structures and functions of living things and their relationships and in\u00ad teractions with other organisms and their environment. Such research is relevant not only to our basic liveli\u00ad hood but also to major societal prob\u00ad lems such as environmental pollution, population levels, food production, physical and mental health, and effec\u00ad tive use^qf resources. Although a significant portion of the increased funds for biological re\u00ad search in fiscal year 1972 replaced support which had previously been provided by other Federal agencies, support was also increased in several areas of special need or opportu\u00ad nity. One such area is research on learn\u00ad ing and memory. A new program was established for neurobiology, which will work closely with the Psychobiol- RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 15 ogy Program. Increased support was provided for research projects ranging from those deahng with the molecular basis of sensory and neural processes to those which examine integrated cognitive processes. Steps have also been taken to support coherent ap\u00ad proaches to particular aspects of learning. Scientists at the University of Colorado are working on verbal, conceptual, and semantic factors in complex human learning, memory, thinking, and comprehension. At the University of Minnesota, the Center for Research on Human Learning has a broad program which combines ba\u00ad sic research on learning with an ap\u00ad plied approach to educational prob\u00ad lems. For the first time, the Founda\u00ad tion has also provided major support for a project to examine genetic fac\u00ad tors in human learning. This research will be conducted at the University of Hawaii with the collaboration of scientists from the University of Col\u00ad orado. A new program for Human Cell Biology was established to strengthen the application of the knowledge and methods of molecular biology and genetics to research on human cells in tissue culture. The problem of making cultured cells available in large quan\u00ad tities is critical to progress in this field, and the need for production centers has received much attention. Efforts in the coming year will be directed to stimulating collaborative efforts to make more economical and effective use of common production facilities. The Foundation has also substan\u00ad tially increased its support of the re\u00ad search collections of museums and herbaria during fiscal year 1972. Sup\u00ad port for biological research resources has been provided in many ways. Only in the case of genetic stock cen\u00ad ters, however, supported through the Genetic Biology Program, has a con\u00ad sistent effort been made to ensure the existence of resources considered es\u00ad sential for research in an area of biology. Private, State, and local funds have provided for the housing and care of the collections of plants and animals essential for research in systematic biology. These sources have become increasingly inadequate as research activities have grown, and will become increasingly so as envi\u00ad ronmental research expands. Al\u00ad though the need for building, renova\u00ad tion, and care of collections far ex\u00ad ceeds the present financial capabilities of the Foundation, a program of cu\u00ad ratorial support was initiated with 13 grants in fiscal year 1972 in order to make particularly significant collec\u00ad tions more available for research, and to maintain records of biota which are changing rapidly as the result of man's environmental interventions. The Foundation has entered this ven\u00ad ture in a limited way, anticipating that the maintenance of collections will remain a shared responsibility of local. State, and Federal Government and private philanthropy. Substantially increased support has also been provided for research on the biological regulation of pest popu\u00ad lations. Much of this research is dis\u00ad tributed among the interests of sever\u00ad al BMS programs, but a major plan for integrated research on pest man\u00ad agement was also developed within the International Biological Program. This project, titled Principles, Strate\u00ad gies and Tactics of Pest Population Regulation in Major Crop Ecosys\u00ad tems, is being jointly supported by the Foundation, the Department of Agri\u00ad culture, and the Environmental Pro\u00ad tection Agency. Research will be con\u00ad ducted on six crop and forest systems, and will involve scientists from 19 universities, as well as those from State and Federal agencies, and pri\u00ad vate sectors. In the view of those who have planned this research, the pro\u00ad gram conforms in all its essentials to a major recommendation of the Third Annual Report of the National Science Board Environmental Science\u2014Challenge for the Seventies (1971), which urged greater interde\u00ad partmental and interdisciplinary re\u00ad search and a more effective use of the talents of industry, government, and universities in new types of research organizations. Evolution of a Molecule At first glance, a clam, a worm, and a horse would seem to have little or nothing in common. Actually, their chemical machineries have important similarities at the molecular level, particularly in the way they obtain energy by combining food molecules with oxygen by use of a protein, cyto\u00ad chrome c. A variant of cytochrome c exists in each organism that uses oxygen for respiration. In higher forms of plants and animals, including man, approx\u00ad imately 104 amino acid units are hnked together and folded into a spe\u00ad cific three-dimensional structure. In primitive organisms such as yeasts and molds, the three-dimensional structure of cytochrome c is essential\u00ad ly the same as for higher organisms, but the numbers and sequence of ami\u00ad no acids are different. Fortunately, the molecule is comparatively small and readily purified so that detailed diagrams have been made of the structure and composition of cyto\u00ad chrome c in more than 40 different organisms. A molecule that is ubiquitous, vital to life, and shows variations between advanced and primitive organisms has obvious advantages for evolutionary studies. These advantages are enhanced by the fact that the degree of differ\u00ad ence between the cytochrome c mole\u00ad cules in different species correlates with the degree of difference in their evolutionary development. Considering the wide distribution of the cytochrome c molecules in all living organisms, we might ask to what extent has it remained unchanged during the course of evo\u00ad lution? Or what features of the struc\u00ad ture have remained unchanged, and are they important in preserving the functional properties of the molecule? In comparing locations of the 104 amino acid units on cytochrome c from various organisms, researchers have found 3 5 identical amino acids in identical positions. At 19 other positions the amino acids differ only in a relatively minor way. One can 16 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT CYTOCHROME C MOLECULE Within almost every living person, animal, and plant is a variant of the protein molecule cytochrome c consisting of 104 amino acid units of various types and in various locations according to the species. Scientists have found that the degree of difference between the mole\u00ad cules in different species correlates with the degree of difference in their evolutionary develop\u00ad ment. This particular diagram is of horse cytochrome c. infer that amino acids at these invari\u00ad ant or relatively invariant positions play a key role in the chemical work of the molecule. However, a direct test can only be provided by examin\u00ad ing the three-dimensional structure of cytochrome c, with particular refer\u00ad ence to the clustering of amino acid side chains around a group of carbon, nitrogen, and iron atoms called the heme group. Richard E. Dickerson and associ\u00ad ates at the Cahfornia Institute of Technology have been working on the X-ray diffraction analysis of the cyto\u00ad chrome c structure since about 1963, with grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Insti\u00ad tutes of Health. Through high resolu\u00ad tion diagrams of cytochrome c, they showed that the constant amino acids which always occupy the same posi\u00ad tion in the chain are those that allow the molecular chain to fold around the heme group and bring certain ami\u00ad no acids into the environment of the heme. They also show regions of the exterior surface with amino acids of limited variation. These regions are probably involved in reactions with- the cytochrome oxidase and cyto\u00ad chrome reductase molecules which are required for oxygen utilization. It now appears that there was some primitive ancestor of both plants and animals which derived the major portioiToTfTt's energy \"from oxygen and which had cytochrome c as a part of its metabolism. The gene for this cy\u00ad tochrome c would periodically under\u00ad go mutation due to some change in the DNA, and a different amino acid would be inserted at some point in the molecular chain. If an amino acid were introduced at a position which produced a nonfunctional cytochrome c, the mutant organism would, in effect, suffocate because it would be unable to use oxygen and, therefore, would disappear. If, however, the mu\u00ad tation produced an altered amino acid in a less critical position, the new cytochrome c might function about as well as the normal form. Such a mu\u00ad tant would live, produce progeny, and become fixed in the population. Sub\u00ad sequent mutations might occur in the gene for the original cytochrome c, or in the new form. On the basis of this hypothesis, one should be able to de\u00ad cide whether a more highly modified form of cytochrome c came from the original parent or from the first mu\u00ad tant form. Development of diverging branches in the evolution of molecules can be determined in this way, and \"phylogenetic trees\" constructed. It is possible to conclude that it has taken about 20 million years to produce a change of 1 percent in the amino acid sequence of cytochromes and that plants and animals took their separate paths in evolution some 1.2 billion years ago. An evolutionarily stable molecule like cytochrome c, serving a critical role in an essential process such as respiration, however, cannot be ex\u00ad pected to give an insight into broader aspects of molecular evolution. Other protein molecules, which have less stringent functional requirements, have evolved more rapidly, and differ- RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 17 DIFFERENCES IN AMINO ACID SEQUENCES IN THE CYTOCHROMES C FROM SELECTED SPECIES OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS Human Monkey Horse Dog Kangaroo Chicken Rattlesnake Turtle Fish Moth Yeast Human 0 Monkey 1 0 Horse 12 11 0 Dog 11 10 6 0 Kangaroo 10 11 7 7 0 Chicken 13 12 11 10 12 0 Rattlesnake 14 15 22 21 21 19 0 Turtle 15 14 11 9 11 8 22 0 Fish 21 21 19 18 18 17 26 18 0 Moth 31 30 29 25 28 28 31 28 32 0 Yeast 45 45 46 45 46 46 47 49 47 47 0 By comparing the differences of types and positions of amino acid units on the cytochrome c molecules of different species, researchers have found the number of these differences between species corresponds to evolutionary differences. For example, there is only a single difference between man and monkey, 12 between man and horse, 14-15 between man and reptile, 21 between man and fish, and 45 between man and yeast. Other differences exist between species. For example, there are 11 differences between a chicken and a horse, 26 between a fish and a rattlesnake, and 47 between yeast and a moth. ences in the structure of proteins can be found between individuals of the same species which are otherwise not notably different. These differences between and within populations are the material upon which natural se\u00ad lection operates. However, the rela\u00ad tions are so complex and the molecu\u00ad lar basis of structure and function so poorly understood that many other approaches to the study of molecular evolution are needed. Nitrogen Fixation The ability of certain plants to take their required nitrogen from the at\u00ad mosphere instead of from chemical fertilizers is vital to the present and future nutritional and ecological needs of the world's growing popula\u00ad tion. To meet these needs, enormous increases must be made in production of protein-rich crops such as wheat and grains and other food crops such as corn and rice. The major factor in increasing these crops is the presence of nitrogen, a substance essential for their life processes. At present, nitrogen is supplied to plants in two ways\u2014through the ni\u00ad trogen fixation process by which cer\u00ad tain leguminous plants as peas, beans, and soybeans \"fix\" or take into their systems nitrogen from the atmosphere by means of symbiotic soil microorga\u00ad nisms. The other method is by the application of inorganic chemical fer\u00ad tilizers. It is anticipated that increases in crop output through increased ar\u00adtificial fertilizer use will reach a plateau in about 5 years for several reasons. Costs are increasing to the point of diminishing returns and, more significantly, the availability of nitrogen in this form does not corre\u00ad spond to the varying needs of the growing plants, with the result that only about half of the nitrogen ap\u00ad plied as fertilizer is used by the plant. The excess nitrogen is dissipated as runoff and is creating one of our ma\u00ad jor and increasingly costly pollution problems. While chemical fertiUzers provide about 7 million tons of nitro\u00ad gen a year, worth $0.42 biUion, the nitrogen fixation process provides the major source of nitrogen: a minimum of 12 million tons of nitrogen a year, worth about $1.3 billion. Fundamental studies of biological nitrogen fixation supported by NSF include biochemical, physiological, and genetic aspects, all bearing on the entire area of nitrogen fixation re\u00ad search. Two projects in particular take different attacks, one having immedi\u00ad ate practical application of basic scientific discoveries and the other having future implications for solving many nutritional problems. A research group at Oregon State University has provided new informa\u00ad tion about the fungus-induced decay in the heartwood of white fir trees, estimated to be a loss of over 1.2 billion board-feet each year. Up to now, efforts to cope with the problem were not very effective. Since wood does not contain much nitrogen, it was not clear how the nitrogen- requiring fungus thrives in trees. By joint experimental efforts, an atmo\u00ad spheric nitrogen-fixing bacterium\u2014 probably a new species\u2014was found living in symbiotic relation with the fungus, providing the wood-destroying fungus with necessary nitrogen. Now the problem of controlling this decay can be based on a specific approach rather than on previous expensive and inadequate approaches. Another nitrogen fixation research is somewhat more complex, and its full implication has yet to be ex\u00ad plored. In studying the development LIBRARY E FOUMDATiOM 18 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been discovered supplying essential nitrogen to fungi that cause decay in living fir trees of the Northwest. This picture of a cross section of white pine shows the cankers and decay caused by the thriving fungus within the tree's heartwood. (Photo by Paul Aho, U.S. Forest Service) of hybrids between nitrogen-fixing plants and nitrogen-consuming plants, a research team performed an experi\u00ad ment of moving a piece of nitrogen- fixing genetic material from Klebsiella bacteria into E. coli, an intestinal organism, which then itself began to fix nitrogen. The implication of such an experiment is important, for it demonstrated the future feasibility of inserting critical genetic material into economically important plants such as corn, wheat, rice, and other food and fiber crops to enable them to fix atmospheric nitrogen on their own, hence reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. Information Systems of Cells A biological problem of major sig\u00ad nificance is intracellular ecology. The fact is that the information bits inside a cell are precisely ordered. But how did the order originate, how is it per\u00ad petuated as cells are replicated, and what is its meaning.' Classical experi\u00ad ments indicate that specific signals, originating in the cytoplasm, eventu\u00ad ally determine the course of develop\u00ad ment of a cell. The targets of such signals are the genes. Two current investigations start with existence of specific signals and aim at discovering the cytoplasmic organelles from which these originate, the nature of the signals, and the manner in which the genes receive and accurately in\u00ad terpret the information provided to them. Polar granules, found in the eggs of insects and of certain vertebrates, are organelles which send signals instruct\u00ad ing the cells in which they reside to develop into germ cells. If the gran\u00ad ules are removed or damaged\u2014by ul\u00ad traviolet radiation for example\u2014then an adult which lacks germ cells is formed. If these granules are reinject\u00aded into a previously operated orga\u00ad nism, the germ cells will be formed. What researchers are trying to find is the mechanism, at the molecular level, by which the polar granules sig\u00ad nal the genes in the cells in which they reside and thus determine their fate. The-first step towards this goal is clear. Polar granules need to be iso\u00ad lated and purified by the \"bucketfull\" and then analyzed chemically. Antho\u00ad ny P. Mahowald at Indiana Universi\u00ad ty has had continuing support from the National Science Foundation to tackle this fundamental problem. His favorite material is Drosophila be\u00ad cause of the fact that exceedingly large numbers of individuals can be raised for analysis, and also there is a wealth of background genetic and de\u00ad velopmental work on this organism. With zonal centrifugation through shallow sucrose gradients, pelleted material has been obtained, about 10 percent of which is polar granules, representing a thousandfold enrich\u00ad ment. Progress in this research has been slow, yet it has been gratifyingly steady. The same broad problem of signal\u00ad ling, from cytoplasmic organelles to the nucleus, is under investigation by Noel De Terra at the Institute of Cancer Research in Philadelphia. Her material is the ciliate, Sientor. The special advantages of this cell are its large size and its capacity for wound healing, permitting both detailed in\u00ad tracellular localization by autoradiog\u00ad raphy and microsurgery. The basic observation is that changes in the nu\u00ad cleus which prepare the cell for divi\u00ad sion by duplicating the DNA content are precisely geared to changes in the cell cortex, particularly the oral region, which is also readying the cell for division. When two cells in differ\u00ad ent stages of oral differentiation are grafted together, they very soon be\u00ad come synchronized with respect to their nuclear events. This result and others show that the nuclear cycle is initiated and controlled by a \"back\u00ad bone\" mechanism located in the or- RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 19 ganelles comprising the cell surface. Signals are transmitted from the cor\u00ad tex to the nucleus either by extremely short-range diffusion or by means of structural connections between the cell surface and the nucleus. Attempts to distinguish these two hypotheses are under way. ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES Environmental phenomena of the solid earth, the oceans, and the atmo\u00ad sphere surrounding the earth and in\u00ad cluding the energy-producing sun have substantial impact on man and other living creatures. Understanding natural forces, learning what causes them and how they affect the liveli\u00ad hood of man, and perhaps trying to forecast or even control them, are some of the objectives of environmen\u00ad tal research. Research studies concerning atmo\u00ad spheric, earth, and oceanographic science may relate to local geographic areas or may be of such broad scope that extensive international coordi\u00ad nation of planning, management, fund\u00ad ing, and logistic support are essen\u00ad tial. In some cases, large-scale field operations are undertaken requiring the use of ships, aircraft, satellites, and other facihties. This year, U.S. scientists were increasingly involved with scientists from many nations in planning international programs and carrying out research projects of mu\u00ad tual interest. Studies of environmental phenomena are primarily based at universities, oceanographic institutes, and at the National Center for Atmo\u00ad spheric Research at Boulder, Colo. Studies of weather and climate on medium and global scales continued to receive major attention in the at\u00ad mospheric sciences, as did investiga\u00ad tions in atmospheric chemistry, inad\u00ad vertent weather modification, atmo\u00ad spheric electricity, and the physics of water transformations within clouds. Many aeronomy research projects of the upper atmosphere dealt with in\u00ad teractions between ionospheric constit\u00ad uents and energetic particles and ra\u00addiation. The solar atmosphere and so\u00ad lar wind, and the reaction of the lat\u00ad ter with the earth's magnetic field and ionosphere, were subjects of numer\u00ad ous research projects. To study the total eclipse of the sun in June of 1973, research projects are being planned for Africa where the greatest part of the eclipse will take place. University research aimed at un\u00ad derstanding the dynamics of world\u00ad wide weather and its prediction is supported through the Global Atmo\u00ad spheric Research Program (GARP). One immediate objective of this inter\u00ad national program is to determine the types, frequencies, and density spac\u00ad ing of observations needed to create models of atmospheric behavior. A major international experiment, known as the GARP Atlantic Tropi\u00ad cal Experiment (GATE), is planned for the summer of 1974 in the eastern part of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, as well as in a belt across the ocean and including parts of Africa and South America. This experiment is particularly Important because the tropical oceans receive the major part of the solar energy that ultimately controls worldwide weather sys\u00ad tems. In the earth sciences, concepts of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics continue to be tested and studies made on their role in mountain build\u00ad ing, seismic activity, volcanism, sedimentation, and the postpaleozoic history of the continental plates. Research projects now exploring con\u00ad tinental drift and geologic history include studies on tology, geophysics, and the geochem\u00ad istry of igneous rocks. Also, since the damaging San Fernando earthquake of February 1971, investigators have become more interested in techniques that might lead to increased under\u00ad standing and possible prediction of earthquakes. Major support for oceanographic research continued to be in physical and chemical oceanography, geology and geophysics of the ocean basins, and biology and ecology of marine organisms. Of particular interest in geological research were the core samples produced by the Ocean Sedi\u00ad ment Coring Program. Studies of Lake Ontario by univer\u00ad sity scientists were initiated under the International Field Year for the Great Lakes. This is a cooperative program between the United States and Canada, with several agencies of both countries involved. The ultimate aim of the program is to improve the scientific basis for management of Great Lakes resources. ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES The NCAR Global Circulation Model Numerical simulation of the global atmosphere provides a framework within which the many physical pro\u00ad cesses that function as components of complex atmospheric systems can be assembled and their relative impor\u00ad tance in the large-scale behavior of the atmosphere can be tested. At the National Center for Atmospheric Re\u00ad search (NCAR), a major effort in numerical simulation is centered around the global circulation model (GCM). During fiscal year 1972, de\u00ad velopment continued on the standard version of the GCM, which has a network for the entire globe with a vertical grid spacing of six levels at 3-kilometer intervals plus the surface level, and a horizontal grid spacing of either 5\u00b0 or 2.5\u00b0 in latitude and longitude. This model allows for vari\u00ad ations in cloudiness, soil moisture, and snow cover. Recent GCM studies of the effects of mountains have indi\u00ad cated that mountain ranges are of little importance in simulating large features of the atmosphere, although they can be quite important on the regional scale. The NCAR global circulation mod\u00ad el has a unique modular design that permits its use in a variety of experi\u00ad ments by substituting different com\u00ad ponents for those used in the standard GCM. Thus, it can be made available for a number of joint studies with 20 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Other scientists at NCAR, universi\u00ad ties, and other institutions. Some re\u00ad cent joint projects have involved: Investigations of cumulus con\u00ad vection, by scientists at Florida State University, that should lead to improved studies of latent heat release in the tropics in global-scale numerical simulation. A complex photochemical treat\u00ad ment for the production of ozone, to be tested in the GCM's stratospheric version, being de\u00ad veloped by scientists from the University of Colorado and from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. A study of possible effects of thermal pollution on global cli\u00ad mate, undertaken at the request of Oak Ridge National Labora\u00ad tory. Encouraged by their success in de\u00ad veloping a tropospheric model, NCAR scientists began designing a strato\u00ad spheric global circulation model. Because the troposphere is a major source of energy for the stratospheric circulation, it was necessary to have a good tropospheric model before at\u00ad tempting to model the stratosphere. It appears that an intricate interaction between the troposphere and the stra\u00ad tosphere may play an important role in climatic fluctuations. Numerical experiments related to the design of observing systems for the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) continued at NCAR (see pages 38 to 39). Identification of Solar M-Regions The interdisciplinary field of solar- terrestrial physics deals solar, interplanetary, magnetospheric, ionospheric, and at\u00ad mospheric phenomena. In recent years, measurements made by space\u00ad craft have provided direct knowledge of the magnetosphere and interplane\u00ad tary space that offers a new and dif\u00ad ferent picture of the relationships between solar activity, the solar wind, and geomagnetic activity. The synthesis of this new material with recent theoretical advances from NCAR's High Altitude Observatory has thrown new light on the identity of so-called solar \"M-regions\" or sources emitting solar particles. For many -years, it ha\u00ab\u2014been\u2014recogni-zed- that phenomena in the terrestrial up\u00ad per atmosphere, notably changes in the magnetic field, tend to be period\u00ad ic, repeating with the solar rotation period of about 27 days. These distur\u00ad bances were widely attributed to beams of particles emitted from some long-lived solar sources. However, the location and nature of the solar \"M- regions\" producing these beams were not clear. The principal difficulties in tracing the solar-particle beams back to their origin on the sun lay in the possible deflection of the particles by coronal magnetic fields and in the spiral paths traced by the beams in interplanetary space. The latter effect, produced by solar rotation, could be understood only when direct measure\u00ad ments of the particle speeds became available. Three lines of evidence developed by NCAR scientists point toward a resolution of this problem. A detailed theoretical model treating the forma\u00ad tion of the solar wind in the presence of a coronal magnetic field indicates that the magnetic lines of force are open above magnetically simple \"qui\u00ad et\" regions on the sun, allowing an outward flow of gas. But the lines of force are closed above magnetically complex active regions, preventing any outward flow. The spiral beam configurations deduced from observed particle speeds and the magnetic characteristics of the beams also im\u00ad ply an origin in the open magnetic field lines. Finally, a strong correla\u00ad tion of open magnetic field configura\u00ad tions with geomagnetic activity has been found. These three studies argue strongly that \"M-regions\" are related to the magnetic channeling of the outward-flowing coronal plasma, and are not associated with solar activ\u00ad ity. Magnetospheric Electric Fields The magnetosphere\u2014that portion of space influenced by the earth's magnetic field\u2014contains a wide vari\u00ad ety of particles with energies ranging from thermal energy to tens of mil\u00ad lions-of-electronxolts. These particles are charged (ionized) and form a state of matter called plasma. Be\u00ad cause the plasma in the magneto\u00ad sphere is fairly accessible, undergoes a wide range of natural disturbance levels, and is not dominated by energy losses for short lengths of time, it is perhaps the best magnetized plasma in which to study little known or un\u00ad known processes in electric field gen\u00ad eration and particle acceleration. Particles in the magnetosphere are controlled by magnetic and electric fields in addition to the gravitational forces and gas pressure laws that are the dominating effects in the lower atmosphere. During the past year, a number of electric field measurements have been made on the magneto\u00ad sphere, with the majority of the data applying to its low altitude boundary, the ionosphere. Despite these addi\u00ad tional measurements, existing models of the magnetosphere have not been able to provide an accurate extrapola\u00ad tion of electric fields measured near the pole to those fields at great dis\u00ad tances several thousand kilometers from earth. Yet, by assuming that magnetic field lines are electrical equipotentials, researchers at the Uni\u00ad versity of California, Berkeley, and the University of Alaska have calcu\u00ad lated electric fields in space above the equator. The resulting estimates are reasonably compatible with values presently known from spacecraft ex\u00ad periments. One technique for deducing magne\u00ad tospheric electric fields is the observa\u00ad tion of motions of very low frequency whistler waves\u2014radio sig\u00ad nals which arch out into space along the lines of the earth's magnetic field from pole to pole some 60,000 to 80,000 kilometers toward the sun. Other techniques include the use of RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 21 Released from rockets, barium vapor moves at high speed along the earth's magnetic field, thus making the field line \"visible\" for a great distance, as shown in this series of photographs tracing the barium. Plasma instabilities cause the streak to break into multiple striations, as clearly seen at E + 13 minutes.

Some important drivin g forces are the tides, the wind, and variations in atmospheric pres- sure and in water densities. Notable progress in understanding the re\u00ad sponse of the ocean to these forces was made last year by Carl Wunsch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He studied 8 years of sea level records that were taken at the Bermuda Biological Station, in an at\u00ad tempt to resolve the various sea level oscillations into components ranging from one cycle per 8 years to one- half cycle per hour. He concludes that the North Atlan\u00ad tic Ocean has a natural vibration peri\u00ad od of 14.8 hours. He also found that the dissipation rate for the tides is so strong that if the forces affecting tides were to cease, the amplitude of the tides would decrease by one-third in 10 hours. This latter conclusion estab\u00ad lishes the need for greater under\u00ad standing of the dynamics of the ocean near the continental margins, for it is here that the energy of the tides is either being dissipated or converted to other motions. Ur. \\yurisch fiTrther TOlicludes~tKa^ excluding the lunar and solar tides, the sea level is dominated by atmo\u00ad spheric pressure variations for periods shorter than a year. At longer peri\u00ad ods, the forcing due to wind stress was dominant. The effect of atmo\u00ad spheric temperature was found to be negligible. In addition. Dr. Wunsch used data taken from the ship Panulirus, sam\u00ad pling at a regular position near Ber\u00ad muda, to interpret the consequences of internal motions on the sea level, with the conclusion that internal waves have a negligible effect on sea level. This study has several major links with other programs. First, it demon\u00ad strates that it is possible to indepen\u00addently measure high frequency inter\u00ad nal motions within the sea without having many influencing effects from variations in sea levels. Second, storm surges due to barometric pressure and winds often cause abnormally high tides along coastal areas of the United States. Adequate prediction of -sterm--t-i3es--requires-rknowl3ge-oi-the- deep sea tides and continental shelf modifications to these tides. This work has established several premises that all future studies on tides must contain. Particularly, adequate knowl\u00ad edge of the resonance period and dis\u00ad sipation rate is required in all tidal computer models. The high dissipa\u00ad tion rate found for the tides and the discovery that simplified equations can be used to describe deep sea tides will greatly improve modeling and other prediction programs. Behavior of Marine Organisms For years, biological oceanog- raphers have been constrained from observing the behavior of live marine organisms by relatively crude collec\u00ad tion techniques. Although millions of biological samples have been fished from the sea by conventional nets, traps, bottles, and trawls and placed in laboratory tanks and tubes for ob- servatiorT ^many ' fragile^ soft-bodied specimens are damaged and are unable to behave as they normally would in their natural habitats. Several NSF-sponsored investiga\u00ad tors are experimenting successfully with new techniques for observing without distorting or damaging the little known behavior patterns of zooplankton (floating or weakly swimming animals) in their natural environment. William Hamner, University of California, Davis, is using scuba div\u00ad ing techniques for direct observation of the plankton community in the deep blue waters of the Florida Cur\u00ad rent near Bimini in the Bahamas, where water clarity often exceeds 1J 0 feet. Visual observations of these ex\u00ad ceedingly transparent organisms re\u00ad quire a strong sunlight contrast, avail\u00ad able in this deep blue environment. During more than 100 hours of underwater studies, Dr. Hamner's re\u00ad search team has observed remarkable \"biolugical\u2014pbenDirrena foT the fir?r time, such as the feeding behavior of the pteropod Gleba, previously con\u00ad sidered rare. This organism secretes a free-floating mucus web as wide as 1.2 meters in diameter to collect mi- croplankton upon which it feeds. The Gleba maintains contact with this net with its extensile proboscis, while drifting plankton become enmeshed on its sticky surface, then it retrieves and ingests the entire mass of net and prey. Ten to 15 animals have been sighted simultaneously spreading their webs and fishing in this extraordinary manner. Previously, only 17 badly damaged specimens have been col\u00ad lected from the Mediterranean and Sargasso Seas. Often, a behavioral sequence must be observed many times before it can be quantified. Another new technique of studying behavior of marine orga\u00ad nisms in real life is that of using film holography. By taking a series of frames with a holographic micromov- ie. John Beers of the Institute of Tvrarine^^esources at La JoUa, and Michael Mulhn of Scripps Institution of Oceanography can observe motions such as the \"violent leap\" of the co- pepod Eucalanus in three dimensions. The rapid and unpredictable motion of this Eucalanus is difficult to ob\u00ad serve under standard microscopic conditions. With cineholography, Drs. Beers and Mullin plan to study feed\u00ad ing habits of copepods, including their selection of prey, methods of capture, and ingestion. Such information is im\u00ad portant for understanding food chain dynamics and for developing com\u00ad puter models on the subject. Cineho\u00ad lography may become important for visualizing the ecologically important environment of zooplankton interac\u00ad tions. RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 25 Observed for the first time in motion, this fragile marine organism Gleba secretes a free-floating mucous web 1.2 meters in diameter to capture microorganisms on which it feeds; it then re\u00ad trieves and ingests the entire net and prey. ENGINEERING A basic motivation of an engineer is problem-solving. In the process, the engineer translates basic knowledge into practice and develops informa\u00ad tion or methodology where needed. Automobiles, the highways they drive on, waste treatment and disposal, col\u00ad or television, nuclear power stations, and the multitude of home appliances are only a few examples of the accomplishments of engineering. Though at one end of the gamut engineering interfaces with the pure sciences, two factors distinguish engi\u00ad neering research from the basic sciences. First, the work of engineer\u00ad ing researchers is more closely tied to Government or industry programs; second, engineering projects must in\u00ad creasingly take into account a variety of pubhc needs and concerns. The Engineering Division supports research programs, primarily at uni- START W The \"violent leap\" of the living marine organism Eucalanus is observed by a new technique for studying animal behavior\u2014the holographic movie. This series of slides, shown at 20 millisecond intervals at a magnification of 1%X, focuses on the antennules of the microscopic animal. Movements of other appendages may be observed by examining the cineholograms at different depths of focus and with greater magnification. 26 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT versities, that are aimed at the gener\u00ad ation of engineering information, de\u00ad velopment of methodologies for anal\u00ad yses and design, assessment of the effects of engineering projects, and the translation of basic technology into a form which can be used in practice. Early in fiscal year 1972, the division's activities in inaterials fe^ search \u2014 including research activities in both superhard materials for metal processing and biomaterials\u2014were transferred to the newly formed Divi\u00ad sion of Materials Research (see pages 31 to 3 5 ). A special activity in the general research support effort is the Research Initiation Program, which has been conducted since 1963. This program, designed to assist young engineering faculty members in establishing a re\u00ad search career, has been of particular value in engineering, where engineer\u00ad ing faculties have undergone vast changes from the \"art of engineer- ing\"-oriented groups of 25 years ago to highly versatile and research- oriented groups today. In 1972, a new feature was introduced in the pro\u00ad gram, \"Option B,\" which made provi\u00ad sion for a faculty member to spend two summers involved with industry, engineering offices. Government labo\u00ad ratories, or with a governmental unit of some level (city, county. State, etc.) in order to relate his research activities to real-world problems. General research support covers all areas of engineering; many of those efforts are interdisciplinary. Among these organized areas of research are such diverse concerns as optical com\u00ad munications, advanced automation, chemical process dynamics, wind and natural disaster engineering, and plan\u00ad ning and design of tall buildings. Most of the research in the orga\u00ad nized areas is still fairly fundamental in nature. But some of it is coordi\u00ad nated and oriented toward a particu\u00ad lar problem area which may be of unusually important national signifi\u00ad cance; and some may be in, areas of research that have not received sufficient attention for a variety of reasons. The latter includes, in partic\u00ad ular, various problems related to the civil economy that are of importance to national productivity and competi\u00ad tive position. Another feature of the Engineering Division's programs has been the uni\u00ad versity-industry workshops, involving representatives of organizations of both to define the present state of the art and to identify important future directions for research. During fiscal year 1972, workshops were held in: New Directions in System Science and Engineering \u2014 The\u00ad ory and Practice Computers in Biomedicine Effects of Magnetic Fields on Communication Processes Industrialized Building Pro\u00ad cesses Lower Cost Housing Prob\u00ad lems Engineering Software Coordi\u00ad nation Glass Processing The reports produced by these work\u00ad shops are valuable reference documents to those interested in the area. Ship Traffic Control Each year there are about 9,000 marine accidents involving ships over 500 gross tons. Total claims arising from these accidents run at about $800 million per year. The admittedly very rough estimates include only the direct losses to the shipping industry. With the increasing size of bulk carri\u00ad ers and the rapid increase in the vol\u00ad ume of trade in dangerous cargoes, marine accidents contain an increas\u00ad ing potential for imposing costs on third parties through pollution and damage to the ecology. Moreover, a significant proportion of the accidents involve collisions in high traffic density areas\u2014primarily harbors and their approaches. For these accidents, near valuable coastal zone regions, there is a particularly high peril of third party costs. At present, most of those costs are not borne by the shipping industry, and in some situations those unreturned costs can run several times the direct vessel and cargo losses. The time now ap\u00ad pears ripe for the development of methods for preventing vessel col\u00ad lisions in harbors and their ap\u00ad proaches^ The basic idea is to adapt The\" most desifable\"\"eleriientT of the familiar air traflSc control system in developing a ship traffic control sys\u00ad tem. The initial phase of this work, which is being done by several investi\u00ad gators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is limited to harbors and their approaches, but the idea could be extended to a worldwide routing system for the optimal sched\u00ad uling of shipping. Ship control schemes, of course, have many constraints different than those of air traffic control. Most of the existing supertankers have an op\u00ad erational speed of approximately 16 knots, and it takes an hour or more to reach that speed under full power settings and with ideal currents. Re\u00ad sponses to a change of heading or an attempt to come to a full stop are sluggish. It should be no surprise, then, that vessel collisions occur when two shipmasters try to out-guess each other in a fog with tricky currents and no communication link open be\u00ad tween the vessels. J. N. Newman is concentrating his work on the effects of shallow and restricted water on ship hydrodynam\u00ad ics. A vessel with a 30-foot draft in an 80-foot harbor may be considered as being in deep water, but a 60-foot- draft ship in the same harbor is defi\u00ad nitely in shallow water. Unfortunately, most of the available hydrodynamical data are applicable for deep water, so these important effects of finite depth, as well as the restrictions of channels are not available. Dr. Newman is translating ship maneuvering charac\u00ad teristics into needed hydrodynamical coefficients related to the environ\u00ad mental conditions. In another allied project, J. Devan- ney and a Swedish visiting professor, N. Norrbin, are developing a traffic controller that can provide course and RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 27 speed information to all ships within a specified area in real time. To do this, they must study the maneuvering characteristics of vessels, develop a computer program for simulating the vessel harbor system, and analyze various harbor control systems through that program. The heart of the computer program will be a de\u00ad scription of ship maneuvering charac\u00ad teristics as a function of specified physical attributes of the vessel and of environmental conditions such as wind, current, and channel dimen\u00ad sions. This program will then take as input the description of the harbor under investigation, the physical char\u00ad acteristics and the initial conditions of the vessels in and approaching the harbor and their desired tracks, and also the characteristics of the harbor control scheme currently under analy\u00ad sis \u2014 including individual vessel-operator response. The program will be run for a number of combinations of vessel scenarios and harbor control systems, and the results analyzed to indicate for which control systems the expected reduction in coUision inci\u00ad dence outweighs the cost of the sys\u00ad tem. Plant Growth Scientists searching for a funda\u00ad mental understanding of the process of growth in plants have turned in recent years to such engineering con\u00ad cepts as stress, plastic deformation, strain rates, and the effects of irrever\u00ad sible deformation. This led to the use of concepts from continuum mechan\u00ad ics in several key areas of plant physiology. Hypotheses formulated in terms of continuum mechanical con- Based on actual maneuvering characteristics of two vessels\u2014one a large tanker and the other a fleet oiler\u2014this computer simulation shows their widely different responses to the identical command\u2014a 3 0\u00b0 steady turn. cepts are now being tested in diverse experiments. It has become clear that many con\u00ad tinuum mechanical concepts and sim\u00ad ulation techniques are applicable to behavior at different levels of plant organization\u2014single cells, cells in\u00ad teracting in tissues, growth of a vast cell complex such as a whole leaf, and even the interaction of many organs in the growth of a whole tree. At the University of Massachusetts, Robert Archer, a civil engineer, and two plant physiologists, James Lockhart and Brayton Wilson, are studying three aspects of plant growth, namely vector growth field analysis, mathe\u00ad matical-mechanical models in tree growth studies, and cell wall mechan\u00ad ics. Vector growth field analysis is a first step in studying plant growth by providing a description of the dis\u00ad tributions of growth rates in the orga\u00ad nism being studied. Knowledge of this pattern can assist in subsequent analy\u00ad sis of the controlling factors of the growth and its results. The analysis begins with experimentally measured growth rates at a number of \"mark\u00ad er\" points in the organism; from these data it attempts to determine the ve\u00ad locity field\u2014growth rates for different points on the surface being studied\u2014 and its properties as a function of space and time. To do this, Drs. Ar\u00ad cher and Wilson develop mathemati\u00ad cal mapping functions working direct\u00ad ly from marker-point data on a pho\u00ad tograph of a growing surface (such as a leaf). As a check on the method, it has been applied very successfully to analyzing the growth of specific leaves. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, considerable work was done on the influence of stress on tree form. Much of this early interest in stress de\u00ad veloped because of observations that stem form changed when trees were grown under conditions of low stress, and that stems become oval under unidirectional stress. In particular, tilting a stem results in compression wood being formed on the underside of the stem, causing the stem to bend back into a near vertical position. i 28 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Drs. Archer and Wilson have de\u00ad veloped a mechanical-mathematical model to obtain stress distributions and changes in slope during compres\u00ad sion wood formation as tilted young pine stems become righted. Using this model they hope to develop a simple \"feedback control\" model to relate gravitational stresses and\u2014wood reac\u2014^ tion. The development of the shoot and root systems of a tree depends on the interaction of the different organs within each system and also to in\u00ad teractions between the shoot and root systems themselves. Once established, the components of a tree may com\u00ad pete with each other for light and water and for internally supplied nu\u00ad trients moving from other parts of the tree. Thus, the development of the whole plant is the final integration of the mechanical and biological pro\u00ad cesses that are acting at the cell, tis\u00ad sue, and organ levels of plant growth. Drs. Archer, Lockhart, and Wilson are now constructing computer simu\u00ad lations of growing shoot and root sys\u00ad tems based these interactions. Pre\u00ad liminary simulations using only num\u00ad bers of organs (not including lengths or geometrical information) have been successful. Later, by suitable modification of variables, it should be possible to isolate the differences in growth algorithms that result in the characteristic forms of oaks, or elms, or pines. Chemical Process Dynamics The techniques of continuous pro\u00ad cessing that evolved 20 to 30 years ago in the chemical and petroleum industries were linked to relatively slow mechanical control systems. As a result, stabihty became the ideal of large-scale plant operation, and tradi\u00ad tional chemical process research has stressed steady-state analysis and op\u00ad eration of laboratory and plant equip\u00ad ment. Today, however, increasing at\u00ad tention in research is being directed at the dynamic phenomena that occur during startup, shutdown, and insta\u00ad bilities in plant operation. Theoretical studies indicate that prediction and control of these phenomena may pro\u00ad vide the key to dramatic improve\u00ad ments in plant efficiency. In some cases, optimum production may even call for deliberate pulsing and cycling of\u2014operating\u2014Gondition-ST Stimulated and aided by recent advances in ap\u00ad plied mathematics and electronic computation, analytical research in this area stresses dynamic modeling and simulation of process units and configurations. The research utilizes high-speed electronic controls and specialized computational equipment for \"real time\" acquisition and analy\u00ad sis of data. Such equipment is now available at reasonable cost. NSF supports several significant projects in this new field of chemical process dynamics. These include math\u00ad ematical analysis of coupled systems and theoretical and computational in\u00ad vestigations of chemical reactor con\u00ad trol. Especially notable is the pioneer\u00ad ing research of James Douglas at the University of Massachusetts. By ap\u00ad plying the theory of nonlinear oscilla\u00ad tions to analysis of chemical reactors, he has discovered that properly con\u00ad trolled periodic operation of chemical processes may enhance their per\u00ad formance well beyond conventional steady-state design. His current exper\u00adiments with stirred-tank reactors, crystallizers, and pipelines under oscil\u00ad lating conditions show promising re\u00ad sults. Another key project is the work of Roger Schmitz at the University of Illinois. He is coupling experimental and theoretical studies of steady-state niult-iplieity^-stabil-ttyy and control in - three types of continuous-flow chemi\u00ad cal reactors. New computing equip\u00ad ment in his laboratory will be used for direct control and real-time simu\u00ad lation of experiments. Other grantees are investigating dynamic behavior of various specific types of plant equip\u00ad ment, such as distillation towers and extraction networks. Two of these principal investigators. Dr. Schmitz and Dale Rudd at the University of Wisconsin, are recent recipients of the Allan P. Colburn Award for signifi\u00ad cant research publications by young chemical engineers. SOCIAL SCIENCES Research supported by the Division of Social Sciences has as its primary goal the advancement of scientific knowledge about the interactions of men both with one another and with the physical and biological world and the functioning of institutions which men have created. This, of course, covers a very wide range of subject The advent of better control systems and theory may make it possible to increase the produc\u00ad tivity of chemical and petroleum processing plants by deliberately pulsing or cycling the operation. RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 29 matter, from the studies of human evolution by anthropologists, which form a bridge to the biological sciences, to the advanced models of the economy by econometricians which, similarly, link with the mathematical sciences. Particular emphasis is on the construction of scientific theory and improvement of research methods. This year saw the establishment, as a separate program, of Research in Law and Social Sciences, an activity aimed at reexamining major com\u00ad ponents of the legal system in terms of social science findings. One inter\u00ad esting program now under way at Stanford University aims at determin\u00ad ing if courts perform different func\u00ad tions in society depending on where they're located: urban versus rural, and in States with varying levels of economic development. If courts are found to be functionally heterogene\u00ad ous in the sense they are optimized for different litigant classes and activi\u00ad ties, the legal community will need to reassess its expectations of courts' so\u00ad cial utility in various environmental settings. The field of social psychology has also begun to shift directions, moving away somewhat from predominantly laboratory activities into field obser\u00ad vations, and becoming involved more with allied professional disciplines. Examples of some types of field studies begun recently by social psy\u00ad chologists include the effects of crowd\u00ad ing and overuse of State and national park facilities; the effect of hope on longevity in hospital patients; responses of teachers to verbal aggression in the classroom, including its impact on grades; verbal communication pat\u00ad terns of couples seeing marriage counselors; and more effective meth\u00ad ods for maintaining medical regi\u00ad mens. The methods of research by social scientists differ from those used by casual observers and commentators on social behavior in that they seek to establish reliable and reproducible re\u00ad sults, quantified when possible. The objective is a cumulative growth of scientifically established knowledge. Of special interest to the Founda\u00ad tion is work on science as a human activity and social institution. Science and technology are being studied as an economic force, as a social system organized both formally and in\u00ad formally, and as individual intellectu\u00ad al achievements. Historians and sociol\u00ad ogists of science are trying to discern the degree to which major scientific accomphshments are dependent on personal characteristics of outstanding scientists or on the intellectual \"cli\u00ad mate\" of the time. Economic Diffusion of Science Economists have been engaged for more than two decades in an effort to expand our knowledge of how new processes and products are invented, commerciahzed, and accepted. The nature of the diffusion process in the more research-intensive \"science- based\" industries is the subject of an important ongoing study by Edwin Mansfield of the University of Penn\u00ad sylvania. Specifically, Dr. Mansfield disputes the view of some distin\u00ad guished scientists and engineers that the diffusion process goes on differ\u00ad ently in such industries than in others. To help resolve this question, he has carried out a very detailed study of the rates of diffusion of 18 important process innovations in one of the na\u00ad tion's most research-intensive indus\u00ad tries, chemicals. For each innovation, data had to be gathered concerning the rate of growth of chemical firms using the innovation, the growth of each chemical firm's output produced with the innovation, and the growth of the chemical industry's total output produced with the innovation. A number of significant conclusions emerged from this inquiry. First, it appears that the same sort of model applies very well in this science-based industry as in the less research- intensive industries. The pattern and course of growth in the number of firms using an innovation and in the increase of output produced with the innovation is much the same. And the profitability of the innovation is, as before, a key determinant of the rate of diffusion. Second, although the same kind of model seems to fit, the parameters in the chemical industry differ from those in less research- intensive industries. Thus, when the profitability of the innovation and the size of the investment are held con\u00ad stant, innovations seem to spread more rapidly in the science-based chemical industry. Third, there is evi\u00ad dence that innovations tend to spread more rapidly if the firms in the indus\u00ad try are relatively equal in size, a finding which has special interest from the point of view of industrial organization and public policy. Fourth, Dr. Mansfield investigated the determinants of various other measures of the rate of diffusion in addition to the rate of imitation. His results indicate that the same sorts of factors are operative. Fifth, he looked in detail at the characteristics of the firms that have been relatively fast\u2014 or relatively slow\u2014to adopt each of these innovations, embodying the re\u00ad sults of explanatory econometric models. Although his present models offer some basis for technological forecasting. Dr. Mansfield emphasizes that we need to know much more about the mechanisms and the costs of transferring technology from orga\u00ad nization to organization and from country to country. The Scientific Development of Albert Einstein Twenty-two years ago, Albert Ein\u00ad stein challenged historians of science to find \"a means of writing (history of science) . . . which conveys the thought processes that lead to discov\u00ad eries.\" Recent studies of Einstein's pa\u00ad pers by Gerald Holton of Harvard University have enabled that historian of physics to provide new insights into one of the great conceptual revolu\u00ad tions of all time\u2014the Albert 14, 1913. *My very dear Colleague: A simple theoretical consideration makes plausible ttie assumption that light-rays experience a deviation with\u00ad in a gravitational field Cray.

RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 31 The Einstein collection includes thousands of private papers, letters, notebook, and scientific manuscripts. While some of the letters have ap\u00ad peared in various collections, the great bulk of the material has never been published. The papers include material documenting some of the factors contributing to the develop\u00ad ment of a scientific genius. They tell of a child whose inability\u2014or un\u00ad willingness\u2014to speak until the age of three led him to develop an extraordi\u00ad nary capacity for nonverbal conceptu- ahzation. In the view of Dr. Holton, such use of abstract concepts, rather than words, persisted into Einstein's adult hfe. For the great scientist noted, \"the words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mecha\u00ad nism of thought.\" He said that he ideas in \"physical entities . . . certain signs and more or less clear images which can be \"voluntari\u00ad ly' reproduced and combined.\" The controUing factors of Einstein's development. Dr. Holton has pointed out, include early training, family in\u00ad fluences, personality, philosophical out\u00ad look, and placement among colleagues. In later years, Einstein said that two objects played a special inspira\u00ad tional role in his life. One was a geometry book that sent his mind rac\u00ad ing off in new directions as a boy. The other was a compass: The myste\u00ad rious, all-pervading \"field\" of magnet\u00ad ic force that controlled the compass needle fascinated the child. This fascination ultimately led him to challenge contemporary concepts of magnetic fields and to develop an entirely new formulation of gravita\u00ad tional fields. Dr. Holton beheves that Einstein's habit of thinking in con- This correspondence between Einstein and American astronomer George Ellery Hale dis\u00ad cusses an early (and not quite correct) result of general relativity. The letters were found by Charles Weiner (of the American Institute of Physics) at the Hale Solar Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. (Reprinted with permission of the Carnegie Institution of \"Washington and the Einstein Estate) cepts rather than words played a key role. He cites a comment by Einstein to a friend when they were discussing the genesis of his ideas. \"These thoughts,\" he said, \"did not come in any verbal formulation. I rarely think in words at all. A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words after\u00ad ward.\" This habit of conceptualization made it easier for Einstein to break free of the methods of thought that prevented his contemporaries from recognizing the limitations of the con\u00ad cepts of space, time, light, mass, and energy that are rooted in the limited capabihties of direct human experi\u00ad ence. Evaluation of Accomplishment Why do women seem to achieve less success than men? One reason commonly given is that of male prej\u00ad udice against women and subsequent devaluation of female accomplish\u00ad ments. It is also possible that women themselves, although the targets of prejudice, may share the attitudes of the dominant male group. This un- derevaluation could reduce women's efforts to try to achieve and thus fos\u00ad ter an actual lack of achievement. A recent study by Sara Kiesler at the University of Kansas has shown that under certain circumstances women value the professional work of men more highly than that of women. She asked 120 college women to evalu\u00ad ate abstract modern art paintings by unknown artists. Fictitious biographies of the artists, half portraying males and half females, accompanied the slides of eight paintings. The paintings were identified as either a contest entry or a recognized winner. Students com\u00ad mented on the technical competency, creativity, quality of painting, emo\u00ad tional impact, and the painter's prob\u00ad able artistic future. Responses to questions revealed that paintings ostensibly entered by males (but not yet evaluated by ex\u00ad perts) were judged by the subjects in the study to be better than identical ones credited to female artists. Evalu\u00ad ations of paintings which had been judged winners by the experts, howev\u00ad er, were evaluated by the subjects to be equal regardless of the painter's sex. Bias against women occurred in evaluations of technical competence and predictions of the artist's future, areas in which men are expected to excel. Evaluations of creativity, emo\u00ad tional impact, and quality revealed no discrimination against women. This finding is consistent with common sex stereotypes which hold that although women may be expected to be less competent and have fewer accom\u00ad plishments than men, they are not. expected to be less creative. Because the paintings were abstract and diffi\u00ad cult to judge on the dimensions re\u00ad quested, it is probable that evalua\u00ad tions reflect attitudes held prior to the study. These findings have far-reaching implications. Although women favor\u00ad ably evaluate females' work which has received special distinction, lack\u00ad ing such information, they judge work by women to be inferior to equivalent work of men. It would thus be diffi\u00ad cult for women to achieve recognition when placed at the competitive disad\u00ad vantage revealed by these data. To appreciate the strength of this finding fully, one must recognize that it is based on a sample of women ex\u00ad clusively, a group which might be considered more sympathetic than a mixed one or one composed of all men. MATERIALS RESEARCH The field of materials is a fas\u00ad cinating amalgam of ancient and modern. Archeological times are marked by such terms as \"Bronze Age\" and \"Stone Age,\" but the rela\u00ad tively modern systematic variation and control of properties has been studied scientifically for only a few decades. Perhaps the first great step forward in sophisticated understand- 32 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT ing of structure-sensitive properties came with the postulate of \"the dislo\u00ad cation\" independently by Orbwan, Polanyi, and Taylor in 1934. The dislocation, or misregistry in the crys\u00ad tal lattice, is only one of a number of types of defects. Other defects were soon proposed and the number grew enormously; the best experiments- varied one type of defect indepen\u00ad dently of all others to isolate the re\u00ad sulting property changes. After World War 11, the remark\u00ad able acceleration in electronic materi\u00ad als Came when zone refining made a suitably pure host lattice available for many interesting variations in com\u00ad position and resulting properties. In addition, theory was able to maintain a predictive role in these materials and, consequently, the electronics in\u00ad dustry ran away in sophistication from the traditional industries, which depended on less well understood mechanical and chemical proper\u00ad ties. About 1960, a major decision was reached to attempt to improve our knowledge of materials by providing significant research support at select\u00ad ed universities. The result was the establishment of materials science centers by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), Atomic Energy Commission, and National Aeronautics and Space Administra\u00ad tion. Throughout the i960's, much outstanding work in materials was sponsored in individual grants both from NSF and other agencies. Efforts are now being made to strengthen programs in the engineering aspects of materials while further extending the strong science base already present to include studies of nonelec\u00ad tronic properties. In 1970, NSF was asked to assume sponsorship of the 12 ARPA labora\u00ad tories, and also of the Air Force- supported National Magnet Laborato\u00ad ry (NML) at the Massachusetts Insti\u00ad tute of Technology. In 1971, NSF's Division of Materials Research was created with responsibility that in\u00ad cluded the former ARPA laboratories (now called Materials Research Lab\u00adoratories, or MRLs), the NML, and NSF's existing grants in solid-state and low-temperature physics, solid- state chemistry, and engineering ma\u00ad terials. Polymer science was added as part of the Solid State Chemistry Program. The Foundation now pro\u00ad vides over 50 percent of the Federal support for-materials re-sea-reh-at\u2014UiS- educational institutions. The National Magnet Laboratory is unique in this country. It exists to provide ultrahigh magnetic fields for all qualified users and to develop new, advanced magnets. Meanwhile, the laboratory staff conducts research in magnetic phenomena and provides a number of innovative ideas for appli\u00ad cations of very high and very low magnetic fields. Over the past year, the Solid State and Low Temperature Physics Pro\u00ad gram continued and strengthened its support in such areas as resonance physics; superconductivity; magne\u00ad tism; and electronic metals, semimetals, and in\u00ad sulators. Also, in response to a num\u00ad ber of proposals received and the rec\u00ad ommendations of reviewers, research in surface physics, liquid crystals, and the apphcation of light scattering techniques to various fields was em\u00ad phasized. Activity increased, too, in low-temperature physics; this well- established area now appears to have great relevance to sorne of the most recent and interesting aspects of sur\u00ad face physics. A broad range of topics was fund\u00ad ed in the Solid State Chemistry and Polymer Science Program, ranging from the synthesis of new polymeric and inorganic substances to the de\u00ad tailed structure determination of com\u00ad plex polymers and intermetallic com\u00ad pounds. In general, the chemical syn\u00ad thesis was directed toward novel methods to prepare polymers with improved properties. In the solid-state chemistry area, new compounds were prepared using high-pressure tech\u00ad niques. In the continuing effort to understand the structure/property relationships which are essential to the ultimate improvement of materi\u00adals' performance, new methods of polymer characterization are being investigated using laser Raman spec\u00ad troscopy, dynamic X-ray diffraction, and new theological instrumentation. Similar refinements of analytic pro\u00ad cedures for the inorganic systems are being encouraged, and careful work inwlvrng\u2014effects of impurities and \u2014 defect structures is continuing. Theo\u00ad retical work, including configuration- al statistics of polymer chains and electronic band structure of inorganic systems, is a necessary underpinning to the experimental program in solid- state chemistry and polymer science. The Engineering Materials Pro\u00ad gram supports research in the follow\u00ad ing areas: materials preparation and characterization; electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior; mechanical be\u00ad havior; extractive (chemical) metallurgy; materials pro\u00ad cessing; and biomaterials. Continued growth is expected for programs in materials processing and process characterization (which includes met\u00ad al removal through cutting and grind\u00ad ing, powder conversion, and forming and joining) as well as for non\u00ad destructive characterization and de\u00ad sign of failure-free materials. Magnetic Filter At the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory at MIT, some note\u00ad worthy advances in the art of purifi\u00ad cation and filtration using magnetic fields have emerged as a byproduct of an esoteric physics research project\u2014 a search for the magnetic monopole. The monopole is an elementary parti\u00ad cle whose existence had been sug\u00ad gested by Dirac, but which has as yet not been found. It was hypothesized that these high-energy particles might enter the environment of the earth in cosmic ray showers, be subsequently moderated by the oceans, and ulti\u00ad mately be trapped by the magnetic constituents of the ocean bottom sedi\u00ad ments. But the job of separating the magnetic components of the sedi\u00ad ments from the nonmagnetic was un- RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 33 feasible with the magnetic separators available when Henry Kolm began his research project a few years ago. To overcome that limitation, he de\u00ad veloped a new type of magnetic filter that could handle large volumes of sediments at rapid flow rates. His filter employed a matrix of steel wool magnetized in a high mag\u00ad netic field. The combination of high field gradient and high background field acts to exert strong forces on the magnetic particles of the sediments and trap them on the strands. The relatively open nature of the structure makes for low flow resistance to the background slurry and, consequently, high filtration rates. Flow rates of 30 gallons per minute per square foot are typical and are by no means an upper hmit. Although basically simple in con\u00ad cept, the new filter has found applica\u00ad tion far beyond its original purpose. It proved to be a readymade solution to the problem of removing the yel\u00ad lowish titanium dioxide impurities in kaolin, a clay product used for white paper coating, and replaced a more expensive chemical form of treatment. It was at once clear that the filter was a potentially useful tool for sepa\u00ad rating out fine weakly magnetic mat\u00ad ter. What was not immediately evi\u00ad dent, and came somewhat as a sur\u00ad prise, was the discovery that it could be applied to the filtration of non\u00ad magnetic matter, including bacterial and algal matter. This process uses a finely divided iron oxide seed material to scavenge the nonmagnetic matter, which presumably attaches itself to the seed by chemical bonding mechanisms. The combination parti\u00ad cles are then removed magnetically. In some tests conducted on water from the Charles River Basin, follow\u00ad ing a single pass through the separa\u00ad tor, the coliform bacterial count was reduced from something on the order of 10,000 to zero; biological oxygen demand, suspended solids, and turbid\u00ad ity were also greatly reduced. Signifi\u00ad cant reductions in these indicators were also obtained with some samples of primary sewage effluent, indicating that magnetic treatment can have a place in more sophisticated treatment schemes of the future. The treatment of industrial effluents appears to be one of the promising areas for imme\u00ad diate application. As an outcome of this work, a team of Magnet Labora\u00ad tory scientists, H. H. Kolm, E. Maxwell, J. A. Oberteuffer, D. R. Kelland, and C. de Latour, are inves\u00ad tigating these and further apphcations of the magnetic separation process under sponsorship of the Foundation's Research Applied to National Needs program. Preparation of Pure Compounds Faced with a reaction that refuses to yield the desired end-products, or\u00ad ganic chemists sometimes dream of holding the reacting molecules tight with microscopic tweezers and forcing them to give the right products. While such \"tweezers\" are obviously a fan\u00ad tasy for reactive molecules moving freely in fluid solutions, in solids the surrounding molecules can \"hold\" reacting molecules and control their motion so as to give products quite different from those obtained in fluids. Although instances of the use and study of such control by chemists have been rare, there are many prac\u00ad tical examples of organic reactions that occur under the influence of very viscous or rigid surroundings. These include reactions in biological mem\u00ad branes and in enzymes, reactions causing decay of frozen foods, and reactions involved in the synthesis and in the fatigue and aging of plastics and other synthetic and natural poly\u00ad mers. There are many instances in which groups that would be of identical reactivity in solution are different in the solid state. For example, acetyl benzoyl peroxide (ABP) is decom- INITIAL REACTION i \\ LIGHT -hCH3 -l-CO, SECONDARY REACTION IN LIQUID O^CH, O-CH3 SECONDARY REACTION I IN SOLID Two of the reaction products of this ABP molecule react with each other to form new com\u00ad pounds. Experiments in which one of the available oxygen atoms is distinguished from the other by a slight weight difference reveal that in liquid either of the two oxygens will react with equal probability; in solid, the reaction occurs with the oxygen that held the original ABP halves together. 34 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT posed by light into three fragments: a carbon dioxide molecule and two very reactive free radicals (A and B). In fluid ABP these two radicals undergo a bewildering variety of further reac\u00ad tions to give more than a dozen low- yield products. In solid ABP, howev\u00ad er, only two products are formed. The unique features of~the solid state reaction are most evident by comparing the product from coupling the two radicals, A and B, in the solid with that from the same reaction in solution. When the oxygen atoms of radical B are made distinguishable by incorporating a heavy oxygen isotope (O*) in the oxygen bridge of ABP, we can show that coupling in solution occurs through the two oxygens of B with equal probability, as would be expected from the symmetry of the radical. J. Michael McBride at Yale University has shown that the solid can hold radical B in a way that preserves a difference between its ox\u00ad ygens, and the great majority of the solid state coupling occurs through the oxygen which initially bridged the fragments in the ABP molecule. In this manner, products consisting es\u00ad sentially of a single species can be obtained without the additional pro\u00ad cess of purification needed when the reaction results in several species. Homogenization of Powder Compacts Powder fabrication could become a superior method of producing many metals and alloys. Some techniques have .been employed for many years, and the powder fabrication of mill shapes (sheet, forgings, bars, ex\u00ad trusions) is currently receiving con\u00ad siderable attention. The advantages of powder fabrication are: (1) a mini\u00ad mum amount of metal working and material loss in achieving a final pro\u00ad duct; and (2) a great potential for producing structures not attainable by casting techniques. The major deter\u00ad rent to the development of this pro\u00ad cess lies in the economics of produc\u00ad ing the high purity powders necessary as starting materials. Moreover, alloys are usually desired, and alloy powders produce the greatest problem. Numerous investigations have been carried out on the blending of ele\u00ad mental powders to achieve the desired alloy composition, followed by a long diffusion treatment at high tempera- Ture\" to a\"chieve\"th-e\u2014requrre^\"Trlioy~ho\"- mogeneity. But such diffusion treat\u00ad ments are economically unfeasible. Thus, the basic materials problem to be solved is to devise a means of predicting the effects of fabrication on the homogenization process. This would permit tailoring the fabrication conditions to minimize the time needed to homogenize the material. Basic research in diffusion theory in past years, coupled with more recent de\u00ad velopments in numerical methods and computer techniques, have provided a means of analyzing the homogeniza\u00ad tion and fabrication process. Both mathematical model analysis and experimental studies have been carried out under NSF support by R. W. Heckel (at Drexel University and more recently at Carnegie-Mellon University) on the homogenization behavior of compacts in two-metal alloy systems. These studies have shown the value of analyzing the ho\u00ad mogenization problem in terms of specific parameters such as diffusion coeflScients and solubilities for each phase, powder particle size, compact composition, and homogenization time. It has been shown that the ac\u00ad curacy of the model improves as the blend approaches an ideal distribution of particles. Moreover, the results to date have shown that even in poorly blended compacts, the model can be used to predict the relative effects of changes in processing parameters and conditions necessary for the most effective homogenization process. The analysis is general and can be extended to investigate the diffusion bonding of metals, the structural sta\u00ad bility of high temperature alloys, the stability of composite materials, and the formation of coatings for elevated temperature oxidation protection. Ultra-Low Temperature Nuclear Phase Transitions Individual atomic nuclei possess a spin and, consequently, a magnetic moment which enables them to orient themselves in a magnetic field. Thus, individual nuclear moments can, un\u00ad der C'ertarn\"~coHditions, give rise to magnetic effects similar to, though much weaker than, those produced by electrons in solids. The effects of this nuclear magnetism are best observed at ultra-low temperatures. The less abundant, natural isotope of helium (He^) is a good example of such a nucleus which has a rather sizable nuclear magnetic moment. In addi\u00ad tion, it is of special interest since it is a simple nonreactive system with no electronic magnetism; thus the mag\u00ad netism of the nuclei will play a domi\u00ad nant role. The magnetic properties of both liquid and solid He^ at ultra-low temperatures depend directly on the way the nuclear spins couple to each other and to the outside world through the electronic system in which they are located. Some physi\u00ad cists expected a specific arrangement of nuclear spin coupling in He^ at temperatures about 2 miUi-degrees Kelvin in the solid, even in the ab\u00ad sence of an applied magnetic field. This expected arrangement of a type known as anti-ferromagnetic would consist of alternating directions for these nuclear spins. However, no direct experimental evidence of any spontaneous regular ordering of the nuclear spins in He^ had been observed. During fiscal year 1972, a low-temperature physics group at Cornell University made im\u00ad portant new observations which en\u00ad hance our understanding of nuclear magnetic coupling in He^, by using a pressure cell proposed in 1950 by a Russian scientist, I. Pomeranchuk. He suggested that one could achieve extremely low temperatures by squeezing a mixture of solid and liq\u00ad uid He^. The observations by the Cornell group were made at ultra-low temperatures with the apparatus RESEARCH PROJECT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 35 shown. A moderate He* pressure in the upper chamber is used to sohdify the He^ in the lower chamber. The He^ melting curve can then be studied precisely down to tempera\u00ad tures as low as 2 miUi-degrees Kelvin. Any nuclear magnetic ordering would show up as a pressure anomaly at low temperatures in such a cell. Using this apparatus, D. D. Osheroff, R. C. Richardson, and D. M. Lee have re\u00ad cently discovered two heretofore unobserved phase transitions in pure He^. These transitions manifest themselves as abrupt pressure changes, producing kinks in the temperature- pressure curve, both during pressuriza- tion and subsequent depressurization of the cell. This result is the first evidence for phase transitions in a mixture of solid and liquid hehum. Further experi\u00ad ments carried out at Cornell indicate that at these pressure anomalies, the magnetic properties of the liquid part of their sample changed dramatically. Experiments do not yet confirm the existence of anti-ferromagnetism in the sohd. They do indicate the presence of some kind of spin order\u00ad ing, as yet not fully explored, which is taking place in the liquid. Related work is presently under way in sever\u00ad al laboratories to gain a fuller under\u00ad standing of these newly observed transitions, one or both of which may be the only known examples of nu\u00ad clear magnetic ordering. Using the pressure cell on the left, in which very low temperatures are attained, Cornell scientists discovered two pressure anomalies (during both pressurization and depressurization) that correspond to what may be nuclear magnetic ordering.

One of the goals is to predict the consequences of possible natural or man-induced changes brought on spe\u00ad cific ecosystems. * Although administered by the Research Directorate, IBP is included here because of its identification as one of the Foundation's National and Special Research Programs. Since these studies had to be under\u00ad taken on a large scale, it was necessary to mobilize large numbers of scientists from various fields. The research work was organized into large projects with\u00ad in five distinct kinds of life zones called biomes\u2014grassland, desert, conif\u00ad erous forest, deciduous forest, and tundra. Most of the work on these ecosys\u00ad tems accomplished to date has been involved with the production of mod\u00ad els and the development of the neces\u00ad sary basic information to verify those models. Substantial progress has been made during this past year in de\u00ad velopment of validated segments of these models concerning interrelation\u00ad ships between plants and animals, for instance. Some semblance of predicta\u00ad bility is beginning to emerge, though as yet no predictive model for an entire ecosystem exists. NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS 37 This diagram of the hydrologic and chemical cycles of a typical Eastern deciduous forest watershed shows the interactions between soil, vegetation, and water. Researchers are beginning to ob\u00ad serve similar phenomena among the various biomes. Animal populations are now being considered as control\u00ad ling agents in every type of ecosys\u00ad tem, rather than as links at the top of the energy flow. Another point was raised in grassland areas, where re\u00ad searchers observed that soil phos\u00ad phates appear to be greater in more arid regions of the biome and at cer\u00ad tain seasons. In other words, there are more stores of phosphates in areas of less precipitation and during the late fall and winter when plants are not absorbing the phosphates. This raises questions on a possible relationship throughout all biomes among soil phosphate deposits, amounts of pre- Much of the value of the modeling work to date has been heuristic, and scientists have had to synthesize meaning out of what might otherwise appear to be an assortment of nonre- lated data. For instance, scientists working on grasslands were able to predict from modeling efforts that the root biomass would diminish with moderate or heavy grazing. This sug\u00ad gested that the grazing animals, though not particularly significant in terms of flow of energy in the food chain, were very important in terms of controlling factors with possible effects on the diversity and distribu\u00ad tion of vegetation. Another example of amassing various data into signifi\u00ad cant meaning can be seen in the desert biome, where scientists ob\u00ad served a strong interaction between the production of annual seed-bearing plants and populations of birds and mammals. Since nonliving factors such as temperature, water, and min\u00ad erals affect the seed production, scien\u00ad tists drew a formerly undefined con\u00ad cept that nonliving factors ultimately may control densities of animal popu\u00ad lations. 1,000 ra a> (0 800 700 DECREASE Of=^ ROOT BIOMASS Wl^^^^^ GRAZING IN GRASSLANDS ir cow BIOMASS SEASONAL GRAZir K 1/1 >JG ROOT BIOMASS Time in years 30 20 \u00a7 Q, B E : g CO 0) 10 A 3-year computer simulation of an area below ground in the grasslands shows a decrease of root biomass from about 900 to 800 grams per square meter with moderate grazing by cattle.

The project uses an integrated approach to analyze crop ecosystems, insect pests that feed on these crops, and predators and diseases that affect the pests. GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH PROGRAM \" During the year, the greatest em\u00ad phasis, nationally and internationally, continued to be concentrated on plan\u00ad ning and designing the GARP Atlan\u00ad tic Tropical Experiment (GATE) to be conducted in the summer of 1974. The objective of GATE is to extend our knowledge of the meteorological aspects of the equatorial belt, essen\u00ad tial for a better understanding of cir\u00ad culation patterns of the entire earth's atmosphere. Work on Observing Systems Simu\u00ad lation Experiments (OSSE) has been delegated to NCAR. These experi\u00ad ments are designed to assess and im\u00ad prove individual observing systems by means of numerical simulation using global circulation models. In a set of * Although admmistered by the Research Directorate, GARP is included here because of its identification as one of the Foundation's National and Special Research Programs. numerical modeling experiments in which temperatures are updated every 12 hours, it has been shown that a wind field can be produced. The ac\u00ad curacy of this wind field is a function of the accuracy of the temperature data and the frequency with which it is updated. On the other hand, if the wind\u2014field\u2014is- periodically - updated, \u2014 then the temperature field can be pro\u00ad duced. Temperature updating is ex\u00ad tremely important in forecasting wind fields on a global scale. In the tropics, wind observations are the most im\u00ad portant variable to be measured. When tropical winds are updated at a few, but not all, levels in the model, the forecast results are observed more rapidly in the vertical than in the horizontal direction. One of GARP's objectives is to understand the factors that determine the statistical properties of the gener\u00ad al circulation of the atmosphere which would lead to better under\u00ad standing of the physical basis of cli\u00ad mate. During the year, studies were initiated to identify climatic regions and boundaries around the Northern Hemisphere by means of plant species and other biological indicators. Changes in the climate, past and pres\u00ad ent are most pronounced and most easily detected in the vicinity of climatic boundaries. Evidence of cli\u00ad matic change over periods of time can The GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment covers almost 40 percent of the global equatorial belt.

INTERNATIONAL DECADE OF OCEAN EXPLORATION The Office for the International Decade of Ocean Exploration (IDOE) entered its second year with programs continuing In environmental quality, environmental forecasting, and seabed assessment. The programs were expanded during the year, and a fourth program \u2014 living resources \u2014 was added. Concern for the environment is a major consideration in IDOE, and the staff has worked closely with the oceanographic community to develop research programs leading to the as\u00ad sessment of the quality of the marine environment, the potential utihzation of marine resources, and the predic\u00ad tion of the state of the world's oceans and their impact on global weather. In particular, the Baseline Data Ac\u00ad quisition Project completed studies on concentrations and distribution of chlorinated hydrocarbons, petroleum hydrocarbons, and heavy metals in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. Significant results included the detection of polychlorinated biphenyls in most marine animals studied and petroleum hydrocarbons in open ocean biological communities. The re\u00ad sulting data were evaluated at an in\u00ad ternational conference in May 1972, and the conference report was made available to the U.N. Conference on the Human Environment. During the evaluation conference, research prior\u00ad ities on studies of the effects of pollu\u00ad tants were recommended. They are now being used as a guide to subse\u00ad quent IDOE program development. A Pollutant Transfer Processes Project was designed to determine the pathways of pollutants to and within the ocean and the factors affecting pollutant transfer within those path\u00ad ways. Knowledge in these critical ar\u00ad eas will be essential for subsequent studies on effects and fates of pollu\u00ad tants. Preparations were completed for the Geochemical Ocean Sections Study (GEOSECS), a program of measuring oceanic constituents at all depths along sections from the Arctic to the Antarctic in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The first major cruise began in July 1972. Trace constituent and radioisotopic data are being used to establish geochemical baselines and for quantitative studies of oceanic mixing and descriptive models of ocean circulation. These studies and models are important for research in marine environmental quality and en\u00ad vironmental forecasting. The Environmental Forecasting Program consists of the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment (MODE), a study of the nature and role of medi\u00ad um-sized eddies in ocean circulation; the North Pacific Experiment (NOR\u00ad PAX), a long-term study of large- scale ocean-atmosphere interaction in the North Pacific; and the Climate: Long-Range Investigation, Mapping and Prediction (CLIMAP) program, a study of changes in current patterns and water mass properties during the Quaternary period. Research results of the programs will provide a basis for improved and extended weather forecasts and lead to a better under\u00ad standing of climate and ocean circula\u00ad tion. Important environmental fore\u00ad casting studies also are under way in the Living Resources Program (physi\u00ad cal aspects of coastal upwelling) and in the Environmental Quahty Program (water mass circulation in the deep ocean). MODE, begun in 1971, involves 12 U.S. and three foreign institutions in a complex program of theory, numer\u00ad ical modeling, and field experiments. Preliminary field work and instrument development are being carried out si\u00ad multaneously. The first full experi\u00ad ment starts in March 1973. The NORPAX staff will spend several years examining historical data, developing a numerical model, constructing buoy network hardware, and doing preliminary field work. By 1976, NORPAX will be using 18 telemetering buoys across the north Pacific Ocean. 40 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Sea Surface Temperatures (\u00b0C) 17,000 Years Ago in Summer Sea Surface Temperatures (\u00b0C) at Present in Summer W 90\u00b06D\u00b030' 0\u00b0 30\u00b0 E W 91)\u00b060\u00b030\" 0\u00b0 30\u00b0 E CLIMAP scientists are constructing maps that will indicate sea surface temperatures for' different periods thousands of years ago.

The map to the right shows present-day temperatures during the summer for the same area. MODE - I FIELD EXPEF\u00bbMENT The Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment (MODE) is a complex program of theory, numerical modeling, and field experiments to study the nature and role of medium-sized eddies in ocean circulation. The experiment is part of IDOE's Environmental Forecasting Program. CLIMAP scientists will produce sea surface temperature maps for periods 6,000, 17,000, 120,000, and 700,000 years before present (B.P.). The 17,000 years B.P. map has been completed. The Seabed Assessment Program is designed to improve knowledge of resource potentials of the world oceans in order to permit better man\u00ad agement of marine exploration and exploitation and to assist industry in planning more detailed investigations. The program includes geological and geophysical investigations of continen\u00ad tal margins, ocean mineral deposits, and mid-oceanic ridges. The Eastern Atlantic Continental Margins Study, now 50 percent complete, may out\u00ad line potentially valuable oil provinces and mineral accumulations. Mid- Atlantic Ridge studies have been the subject of workshops in the United States and abroad. A cooperative pro\u00ad gram on the mechanisms of seafloor spreading and on the generation of heavy metal deposits along the ridge crest has been proposed. When an IDOE workshop on deep ocean manganese deposits disclosed the existence of considerable unan- alyzed data in oceanographic institu\u00ad tions, IDOE supported an analysis to report on deficiencies, state of the art, and priorities in the study of such deposits. In the Living Resources Program, experimental verification of physical oceanographic hypotheses and coastal upwelling numerical models took place in mid-1972. The experiment was the first step in a comprehensive Coastal Upwelling Ecosystem Analy\u00ad sis Program designed to combine the NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS 41 physical oceanographic and numerical modeling capabilities with existing bi\u00ad ological oceanographic and ecosys\u00ad tems modeling techniques. The National Oceanic and Atmo\u00ad spheric Administration's (NOAA) Environmental Data Service (EDS) provides centers for correlation and storage of data from IDOE pro\u00ad grams. EDS staff and IDOE investi\u00ad gators agree on format and schedules for data transmission to the centers, and the data flow from ongoing pro\u00ad jects has already started. Instrumentation devices developed under IDOE projects were tested and calibrated by NOAA's National Oceanographic Instrumentation Cen\u00ad ter. In addition, laser Raman spec\u00ad troscopy is being evaluated for ocean\u00ad ographic analyses. The United States formally presented its IDOE program to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) in October 1971. The commission endorsed the pro\u00ad gram and called on member nations to present their programs to the IOC Executive Council. By the end of fiscal year 1972, the contributions of about 30 foreign countries \u2014 in the form of ships, laboratories, and per\u00ad sonnel \u2014 to NSF-initiated programs exceeded $3 million, and there was promise of even greater participa\u00ad tion. , In fiscal year 1972, $20 million in program funds were distributed in the following proportions: environmental forecasting, 45 percent; environmen\u00ad tal quality and seabed assessment, 25 percent each; general support and liv\u00ad ing resources, 5 percent. Other gov\u00ad ernment agencies continued to play an important role in the IDOE pro\u00ad gram. Within the four programs, al\u00ad most 1 5 percent of the funds went to Federal laboratories; the remainder went to academic institutions and in\u00ad dustry. POLAR PROGRAMS Research in the Arctic supported through the Office of Polar Programs centered on two large projects. A pi\u00adlot study for the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment was carried out in March and April 1972, when 80 uni\u00ad versity and government scientists from the United States, Canada, and Japan occupied three manned stations in the Arctic Ocean pack ice northeast of Barrow, Alaska. Five un\u00ad manned buoys provide supplemental data. The objective of the experiment is to improve techniques of fore\u00ad casting ice conditions and to deter\u00ad mine the influence of sea ice on the heat exchange between ocean and at\u00ad mosphere. The University of Wash\u00ad ington is coordinating the project, which is funded by NSF as well as other United States and Canadian agencies. The Tundra Biome project contin\u00ad ued in the Arctic with scientists from 40 institutions. Two successful years of research have been completed at Point Barrow, Prudhoe Bay, and Ea\u00ad gle Summit, Alaska, and comparative studies of alpine tundra are being made at Niwot Ridge, Colo. About 200 investigators have been involved in interrelated field research and ex\u00ad tensive computer modehng on terres\u00ad trial and aquatic ecosystems. The goal is to develop models that can be used to predict the effects of natural and artificial changes on the tundra ecosystems. Beginning with fiscal year 1972, the Foundation assumed responsibility for funding the entire U.S. program in Antarctica except for icebreaker sup\u00ad port. Under an interagency agree\u00ad ment, the U.S. Navy continues to provide the major portion of logistic support for the program. The loss to the program of two of the five ski- equipped aircraft used in Antarctica is putting a heavy strain on the logis\u00ad tics operations, and two of the remain\u00ad ing aircraft must be retired soon. Despite these handicaps, research in many disciplines continued year-round at four stations. In the austral summer, 142 investigators carried out 51 re\u00ad search projects at U.S. stations and in the field. Other investigators were aboard the research ships Eltanin and Hero and on two icebreakers. As in past years, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard supported the program logistically. Byrd Station, an under-snow instal\u00ad lation in Marie Byrd Land that had been occupied continuously since its The icebreaker South-wind anchored near Palmer Station on the Antarctic peninsula shortly before researchers began the survey of seals inhabiting the pack ice of the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas. (Photo by U.S. Navy) 42 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT completion in 1962, was closed in January 1972. Siple Station in Ellsworth Land, which is strategically located for studies of the upper atmo\u00ad sphere, will become a year-round sta\u00ad tion next year. Working from the icebreaker Southwind, researchers from the Uni\u00ad versity of Idaho and the University oL Minnesota took a census of seals and other animals inhabiting the pack ice of the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, an area of about 140,000 square kilometers. Early analysis indicates that nearly a million seals inhabit the area. This and similar information from other areas of the southern ocean contribute to policy-making in the field of conservation, as exem\u00ad plified by the Conference for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, held in London in February 1972. Field work was carried out to se\u00ad lect the best sites for two drilling projects to begin next summer \u2014 one in the sea and the other on land. Eltanin cruised the Ross Sea to obtain essential preliminary information for the deep sea drilling ship Glomar Challenger, which will begin the first of three seasons of Antarctic drilling in January 1973. Seismic and magnet\u00ad ic properties of the ice-free valleys of southern Victoria Land were measured in preparation for a drilling project to be carried out jointly by Japan,-New. Zealand,-and_the .United- States. OCEANOGRAPHIC FACILITIES AND SUPPORT Ocean sciences research is support\u00ad ed in three of the directorate's offices, with different objectives, while gener\u00ad al support for the academic oceano\u00ad graphic fleet is provided through the Office for Oceanographic Facilities and Support (OFS). In fiscal year 1972, OFS functions were expanded to include: (1) operations support for facilities (other than ships), techni- ciail pools, data processing groups, and University National Oceanographic These crabeater seals are the most numerous species in the antarctic waters. (Photo by U.S. Navy) Laboratory System (UNOLS) staff activities; and (2) acquisitions sup\u00ad port for ship construction, shared ship\u00ad board and shore laboratory equipment, and ship staging facilities. Support provided through OFS was approxi\u00ad mately doubled to include these ex\u00ad panded services. Tlhe\u2014increased\u2014activity under OFS primarily results from efforts to de\u00ad velop a broadly based management approach to the acquisition, oper\u00ad ation, and use of large research facili\u00ad ties for the academic oceanographic community. The cooperative associa\u00ad tion of institutions, UNOLS, was chartered by 18 federally funded ship operator institutions in September 1971 to bring about better methods of sharing oceanographic faciUties. This coordination structure involves the two principal supporting agencies \u2014 NSF and the Navy \u2014 and other interested agencies. OFS undertook the responsibility for planning, coordi\u00ad nating, and managing the Founda\u00ad tion's share of support for the UNOLS staff office and serves in a liaison capacity with the community organization. An advisory council representing the entire academic oceanographic community provides an overview of all UNOLS activities. Through the advisory council, UNOLS monitors and evaluates how effectively the fa\u00ad cilities are used, assesses the current and future needs for adding or phas\u00ad ing out facilities, and provides reports and recommendations to the Federal funding agencies. During the year, a. contract was made with Woods Hole Oceanograph\u00ad ic Institution to construct a ship ap\u00ad proximately 170 feet long. Another NSF-funded ship, R/V Columbus Iselin, was launched in March and will be operated by the University of Miami under UNOLS agreements. Other awards included 21 grants for about $1.5 million for updating and improving oceanographic materi\u00ad als such as shipboard scientific equip\u00ad ment and facilities and specialized in\u00ad strumentation for data processing, communications, and navigation. NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS 43 The research vessel Columbus Iselin splashes into the sea March I, 1972, at the University o\u00a3 Miami Rosenstiel School o\u00a3 Marine and Atmospheric Science. The project's activities for the past 4 years of deep ocean drilHng and coring (August 1968 to August 1972) were designed for 25 cruises or legs, each of which lasts approximately 2 months. During the first 23 legs, which ended in May 1972, 349 holes had been drilled at 230 locations in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and in marginal seas. Ap\u00ad proximately 66,000 feet of core have been recovered. The maximum pene\u00ad tration into the bottom sediment achieved so far is 4,265 feet; max\u00ad imum water depth in which drilling has been accomplished is 20,483 feet. The typical scientific staff on board the drilling ship consists of 10 or 11 specialists in sedimentology, paleon\u00ad tology, and marine geophysics. Partic- OCEAN SEDIMENT CORING PROGRAM The Ocean Sediment Coring Pro\u00ad gram is an exceptionally importa nt of es le g n ve al he ic is effort to further our understanding the world in which we live. It com at a time when technology is availab to do the monumental task of drillin beneath the floor of the deep ocea basins, when geological sciences ha just achieved a unifying and glob perspective of the history of t earth, and when social and econom interest in the oceanic realms greater than ever. The Deep Sea Drilling Project, e s . e, n y e d which at present constitutes th Ocean Sediment Coring Program, ha been in operation since August 1968 Its objective is to explore the ag history, and development of the ocea basins and their marginal seas b means of drilling and coring th ocean floor. Operations are conducte from the specially designed drilling ship Glomar Challenger, owned and operated by Global Marine, Inc., of Los Angeles under a subcontract to the University of California.

HEPORT ular subjects \u2014 such as geochemistry \u2014 may be emphasized on certain legs and require stronger representation in that field. Foreign scientists contribute sub\u00ad stantially to work conducted aboard Glomar Challenger. To date, 66 scientists from 17 foreign countries have participated. NationaPaTid inters national scientific guidance to Scripps is coordinated through the Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES). This con\u00ad sortium, consisting of five major U.S. oceanographic institutions, advises on drilling itineraries, site selection, ini\u00ad tial core descriptions, and other aspects of the operation. Initial descriptions of the cores and interpretations of scientific results from each leg undertaken by Glomar Challenger are published in a series of reports called Initial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project. Each vol\u00ad ume gives a description of the cores and an overall scientific synthesis of the cruise. During the past year, the Founda\u00ad tion extended its contract with the University of California to cover 3 additional years of drilling and coring activities. Thus, the services of Glo\u00ad mar Challenger are now contracted for until August 197J. Two major departures from prior work are planned for the extended project. Drilling in seas surrounding Antarctica will be done during three austral summers, and attempts will be made to increase gradually the capa\u00ad bility to drill and take cores of the hard igneous rock below the sedimen\u00ad tary layer. A computer-based data re\u00ad trieval system is being developed to aid scientists in selecting samples. Recent cruises of Glomar Chal\u00ad lenger have traversed the northeastern Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, the western Pacific Ocean includ\u00ad ing\u2014the\u2014Melanesia\u2014area;\u2014the\u2014Indian\u2014 Ocean, and the Red Sea. Data ob\u00ad tained from these cruises will assist in determining the magnitude and direc\u00ad tion of both horizontal and vertical crustal motion. There are indications, for instance, that the Pacific sea floor has moved horizontally across the Equator in a northerly direction. In addition, a widespread hiatus in the sedimentary record has been found that is particularly evident in the Aus\u00ad tralia-New Zealand region. This gap in the record suggests that a \"circum- polar\" ocean current flowed north of Australia until Oligocene time when Australia had drifted far enough away from Antarctica to transfer the current to its present course. Indications of vertical motion come from the Ninetyeast Ridge in the In\u00ad dian Ocean, now about a mile below sea level. It was found to have been above sea level at one time and to contain coal, lagoonal deposits, and oyster beds. NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTERS The National Research Centers have the equipment, the facilities, and the expertise to support large-scale and complex investigations that could not have been undertaken by individ\u00ad ual universities. They represent large investments in capital equipment and operating costs. Furthermore, each major discovery or the attainment of the threshold of a new breakthrough increases\u2014the\u2014demand for larger, bet=^ ter, and more sophisticated equip\u00ad ment. In astronomy, for example, the progress in recent years has been spectacular. Each increment in obser\u00ad vational capability, in the form of more powerful instruments and im\u00ad proved observational techniques, brings us one step closer to under\u00ad standing two of the great mysteries of mankind \u2014 the origin and eventual fate of the universe. NATIONAL ASTRONOMY AND IONOSPHERE CENTER The National Astronomy and Iono\u00ad sphere Center (NAIC), operated un\u00ad der contract with the Foundation by Cornell University, has its headquar\u00ad ters on the Cornell campus, Ithaca, N.y. The observing facilities are lo\u00ad cated in Puerto Rico at a site 12 miles south of Arecibo. The principal observing instrument is a spherical antenna, 1,000 feet in diameter, that can function either actively as a radar telescope or passively as a radio tele\u00ad scope. During fiscal year 1972, steps were taken to upgrade the reflector by in\u00ad stalling a highly precise surface that Table 5 National Research Centers Fiscal Years 1970, 1971, and 1972 Fiscal year 1970 Fiscal year 1971 Fiscal year 1972 Capital obligations Research operations and support services Research operations Total Capital and support obligations services Total Research operations Capital and support obligations services Total National Astronomy and ionosphere Center $ Kitt Peak National Observatory .

Com\u00ad pletion of the resurfacing program is scheduled for May 1974. It will pro\u00ad ceed in stages that will allow the ob\u00ad servatory to maintain its research ca\u00ad pabilities and observational pro\u00ad grams. Another major Arecibo program initiated during the year was the de\u00ad sign and development of an S-band radar transmitter. This project is being supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administra\u00ad tion. When this new transmitter is installed in early 1974, it will be pos\u00ad sible to map the surfaces of planets at wavelengths in the 10-centimeter range. Radar astronomers will be able to study the details of the cloud- covered surface of Venus with a reso\u00ad lution of 2 to 5 kilometers, equaling the quality of the best earth-based optical photographs of the moon. In addition, the planet Mercury will be subject to mapping by radar techni\u00ad ques. Investigations of the moons of Jupiter can be conducted and, using these moons, the atmosphere and iono\u00ad sphere of the planet Jupiter itself can be studied. During the past year, a new high- powered, 430-MHz line feed was placed in operation to permit more detailed and accurate observations to be made of nearby planets, extended radio sources, and the Earth's iono\u00ad sphere. There were 31 visitors from 16 institutions using the Arecibo tele\u00ad scope in fiscal year 1972. The goal of NAIC is to apportion 70 percent of all observing time to visiting scien\u00ad tists, with the remainder being used for staff observations and calibration and maintenance. Upon completion of the resurfacing and the S-band ra\u00ad dar, it is expected that visitor use of observatory facilities will increase. NAIC employs 105 scientific, techni\u00ad cal, maintenance, and administrative personnel. KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY The Kitt Peak National Observato\u00ad ry (KPNO) is operated under a Na\u00ad tional Science Foundation contract with the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The ob\u00ad servatory supports visitor-oriented ob\u00ad servational and theoretical research programs in stellar, solar, and plane\u00ad tary astronomy, and engages in pro\u00ad grams to develop and improve astro\u00ad nomical research facilities and auxil\u00ad iary instrumentation. The observing facilities are on Kitt Peak, a 6,000- foot-high mountain located 40 miles west of Tucson, Ariz. The observatory headquarters at Tucson, adjacent to the campus of the University of Ari\u00ad zona, provide office, research, and engi\u00ad neering facilities for the 325-member staff and visitors. Six stellar telescopes of 84-inch, 50-inch, (two) 36-inch, and (two) 16-inch apertures were operated in fiscal year 1972 in support of 102 visiting astronomers and 44 graduate students from 5 5 U.S. institutions and five foreign countries. Visitor sched\u00ad uling of observing time on the stellar telescopes totaled 61 percent of the total available time. The two largest telescopes were assigned to visitors 70 percent of the time. The McMath solar telescope was used by 3 8 visiting scientists and 12 graduate students. Of these, 45 came from 22 U.S. institutions and five from foreign countries. In fiscal year 1972, the mounting for the new 150-inch telescope was installed within the new observatory building and dome. Observatory per\u00ad sonnel are conducting alignment tests in preparation for installation of the telescope optics in the late summer of 1972. The 150-inch fused quartz mir\u00ad ror has been completed and tests indi\u00ad cate that the performance character\u00ad istics of the mirror surface are excel\u00ad lent. Fabrication of auxiliary instru\u00ad mentation for this telescope is under way. Also, a 36-inch mirror was in- The 84-inch telescope and dome at Kitt Peak National Observatory.

Public visitors to Kitt Peak during the year numbered more than 48,500, with representation from all 50 States and five foreign countries. CERRO TOLOLO INTER-AMERICAN OBSERVATORY The Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) is operated un\u00ad der contract with the Foundation by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The observ\u00ad ing facilities at Cerro Tololo, atop a 7,200-foot-high mountain in the foothills of the Chilean Andes, in\u00ad clude several major telescopes: and Schmidt-type instrument. The headquarters, located at La Serena, contain offices, labora\u00ad tories, library, engineering support facilities, and a computer for the use of CTIO staff and visiting astronomers. The observatory provides U.S. as\u00ad tronomers with excellent facilities with which to observe objects in the southern skies. Many significant celes\u00ad tial objects, including nearby star clusters, the southern Milky Way, and the two Magellanic Clouds can be viewed only from the Southern Hem\u00ad isphere. During fiscal year 1972, 75 astron\u00ad omers from 36 institutions made ob\u00ad servations at CTIO. Visitors from the United States, including graduate stu\u00ad dents; were a\"s'stgned\"-5\"8-p\"ercent~of\"the available telescope time. Another 21 percent of the telescope time was di\u00ad vided among foreign visiting observ\u00ad ers. The remaining 21 percent was used by staff members of CTIO and the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) for research and mainte\u00ad nance activities. During the year, several new pieces of observing instrumentation were brought into use. The photoelectric scanner, built at the Harvard College Observatory under the supervision of John Danziger, is now being used by CTIO staff and visitors. A faint star photometer, developed and built ac\u00ad cording to specifications of Merle Walker of the University of Califor\u00ad nia, promises to be especially valuable for observations of the Magellanic Clouds. And working in cooperation with Kent Ward of the Carnegie In\u00ad stitution of Washington, D.C, CTIO staff adapted a sophisticated electron\u00adic imaging tube for use with the Cassegrain spectrograph. The building and dome for the 150-inch telescope are essentially complete and ready for the installa\u00ad tion of the mounting early in calendar year 1973. The grinding, polishing, and figuring of the Cervit mirror blank-for the-instrument began at the KPNO optical shops in Tucson in De\u00ad cember 1971. It is expected that the mirror will be completed late in calendar year 1973 and shipped to CTIO shortly thereafter. NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), with head\u00ad quarters in Charlottesville, Va., is op\u00ad erated and managed by Associated Universities, Inc., under contract to the Foundation. The principal observ\u00ad ing site is at Greenbank, W. Va.; a second observing facility is at the site of Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. The observatory provides the U.S. scientific community with large ground-based radio telescopes, sophisticated auxiliary instrumenta\u00ad tion, and the necessary support facih\u00ad ties for research in radio astron\u00ad omy. The major observing instruments at Greenbank are a 300-foot-diameter telescope constrained to move in a meridian plane, a 140-foot-diameter fully steerable parabolic telescope, an interferometer array incorporating three 8 5-foot-diameter dishes, and a portable 42-foot-diameter antenna used for remote operations with the interferometer. A 36-foot-diameter millimeter-wave telescope is located at Kitt Peak. Two new receivers have been added to the 31 receivers now avail\u00ad able at NRAO, one for use with the 140-foot and 300-foot telescopes, the other with the 36-foot telescope. A new 50-channel filter-bank receiver has been added to the 140- and An aerial view of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, with the essentially complete building and dome that will house the 150-inch reflector, perhaps early in 1S74.

(Photo by NRAO) 300-foot telescopes to facilitate the acquisition, processing, and analysis of observational data. The observatory has also completed development of a laser range-measuring device for use in surveying the sur\u00ad faces of large paraboloidal antennas. This instrument can measure distances up to 60 meters with an accuracy of 1/10,000 of a meter in a measuring time of 2.5 seconds. Sensitive Very Long Baseline (VLB) interferometer systems were put into operation to study the compact-point and point-like radio sources found in galaxies and quasars. Presently, 13 separate recording sys\u00ad tems are based at various sites throughout the United States and Eu\u00ad rope. Comparison of recordings made simultaneously at two or more sites allows radio astronomers to construct high angular resolution images of the radio sources. The highest resolution obtained so far has been achieved in a series of cooperative experiments be\u00ad tween NRAO staff, astronomers in the Soviet Union, and scientists using the 210-foot NASA space tracking antenna at Goldstone, CaHf. Further experiments yielding even greater resolutions are planned. ' Sensitive maser receivers, which Soviet astron\u00adomers are building specifically for this work, will be used by the U.S. and U.S.S.R. scientists. During fiscal year 1972, 168 visi\u00ad tors from 43 U.S. and foreign research organizations were allocated an aver\u00ad age of 63 percent of the available tele\u00ad scope time on NRAO instruments. NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH Reliable long-term weather fore\u00ad casts are of vital importance to some of our basic industries such as agri\u00ad culture and shipping. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) plays an important role in atmospheric research programs that are often worldwide in scope. Its non\u00ad pareil array of instrumentation and logistics equipment makes this center well suited to undertake large-scale projects on behalf of, and with the participation of, the academic com\u00ad munity. NCAR is operated under NSF sponsorship by the University Corpo\u00ad ration for Atmospheric Research. NCAR's permanent installations in\u00adclude the Mesa Laboratory, its head\u00ad quarters and principal laboratory in Boulder, Colo.; the National Scientific Balloon Facility at Palestine, Tex.; the Research Aviation Facility at Jefferson County Airport near Boul\u00ad der; and the Field Observing Facility's radar and instrument test site at Mar\u00ad shall, Colo. During fiscal year 1972, a major fraction of NCAR's research effort was devoted to cooperative research involving about 120 visiting university scientists. Some of these projects, characterized by work toward partic\u00ad ular goals on specific schedules over a lengthy period of time, have been de\u00ad signated \"key projects.\" NCAR's cur\u00ad rent key National Hail Research Experiment (NHRE), a 5-year field program with two objec\u00ad tives: to gain an increased un\u00ad derstanding of all aspects of the cloud physics and microphysics of severe convective storms that produce hail and, if possible, to develop a practical method for suppressing the occurrence of damaging hail. The NHRE field research area is in northeastern Colorado in a region of very high hailstorm frequency. Sever\u00ad al Government agencies, as well as six universities, participate in this program. The Global Atmospheric Re\u00ad search Program (GARP), an in\u00ad ternational effort designed to in\u00ad crease the accuracy of weather forecasting over periods from 1 day to several weeks and to gain a better understanding of the physical basis of climate. NCAR has been assigned the lead role in the Observing System Simulation Experiment. In addition, the cen\u00ad ter will provide an aircraft with accurate motion-sensing instru- mention for use in the 1974 GARP Atlantic Tropical Experi\u00ad ment and subsequent field exper\u00ad iments.

The Fate of Atmospheric Pollu\u00ad tants Study (FAPS), part of a study of air pollution in the St. Louis area involving a number of Federal agencies, university groups, and other organizations. The objectives of FAPS are closely linked to the practical problems of the effects of urban air pollution on regional and global air quality and its possible effects on weather and cli\u00ad mate. COMPUTING ACTIVITIES IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH The United States continues to maintain a leading position in com\u00ad puter science and technology as ex\u00ad emplified by the favorable balance of trade in computers \u2014 approximately $1 billion a year. In its program of Computing Activities in Education and Research, the Foundation continues to pursue the objective of providing the nation with a base of computer science knowledge that will foster innovative approaches for the use of computers in education and research. Progress in this program should also allow Government, industry, academic institutions, and other users to evalu\u00ad ate better the capabihties and limita- tions- of computers, as well as to develop methods of using computer technology to its fullest potential. COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A multiprogrammed computer can provide service to hundreds of users at the same time. Such a system con\u00ad tains a large number of programs, most of which are independent of each other and some of which may be required by several of the users. It consists of a variety of components such as memories, printers, tape drives, document readers, processors, etc., each of which operates at differ\u00ad ing rates and each of which can oper\u00ad ate independently of the others to a large extent. Thus, at one instant in time, the system may be printing a report for one user, receiving data by telephone from a second user, search\u00ad ing a tape file for a third user, doing arithmetic for a fourth user, and per\u00ad forming still other functions for other users. The question of how to con\u00ad struct, organize, and program^ the \"operating system\" which controls all of this activity so that the users all receive satisfactory, economical serv\u00ad ice continues to provide interesting and difficult problems in computer science research. The theoretical study of multipro\u00ad grammed systems is generally based on an abstract model of the system as an interconnected network of queues, each queue corresponding to pro\u00ad grams waiting to receive service from one of the components. As a program receives the needed service, it is re\u00ad moved from its former queue and attached to the queue for the com\u00ad ponent providing the next service needed by that program. To construct a specific network model for each NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS 49 proposed system is expensive, diffi\u00ad cult, and poses problems of detail we do not know how to solve. Recently, K. M. Chandy of the University of Texas at Austin has taken the first steps to develop a more general theo\u00ad ry in which analytical solutions can be obtained for large classes of queueing networks. Such a theory would make it possible to optimize the per\u00ad formance of a multi-programmed sys\u00ad tem through the choice of com\u00ad ponents and their organization and the type of queueing discipline used by the operating system. At Iowa State University, R. M. Stewart is studying the performance of an unconventional computer (called SYMBOL) specially designed to facilitate experimentation with op\u00ad erating systems, while the measure\u00ad ment and performance evaluation of more conventional operating systems is being investigated by G. Estrin at the University of California, Los An\u00ad geles, and by J. Noe at the University of Washington. COMPUTER INNOVATION IN EDUCATION The U.S. system of education is placing increasing demands on the na\u00ad tion's resources. The fraction of the GNP devoted to all educational ex\u00ad penditures (public and private, from kindergarten through graduate school) has risen steadily since the end of World War II \u2014 from about 3 percent to over 7 percent in 1969-70. The Computer Innovation in Educa\u00ad tion Program has as its goal improve\u00ad ment in the cost-effectiveness of education generally (with special em\u00ad phasis on science education) through the application of modern computer and communication technology. In fiscal year 1972, approximately $8.4 million was awarded toward this end to academic and nonprofit organiza\u00ad tions. Based on developments supported by earlier Foundation awards, con\u00ad tracts were negotiated with the Uni\u00adversity of Illinois, the MITRE Corp., and Educational Testing Service for a J-year test and evaluation of the edu\u00ad cational, engineering, and economic feasibility of two alternate systems of computer-assisted instruction, applied principally to instruction at the com\u00admunity college level. Illinois' PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic system TRE's TICCIT (Time-Shared In\u00ad teractive Computer Controlled In\u00ad formation system are shown schematically. The concepts of two computer-assisted instruction systems developed with the Foundation's support are shown above. The PLATO CAI system utilizes a central computer which transmits its information via television and telephone cables to the various terminals. The TICCIT sys\u00ad tem employs separate minicomputer units containing their own educational packages and designed to transmit to special television terminals. 50 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Widespread application of computer- based instructional systems depends in part upon the development of suitable instructional strategies and innovative computer-oriented curricu- lar materials \u2014 at all levels of educa\u00ad tion. In fiscal year 1972, 21 grants were awarded for this purpose. In higher education, researchers at~ Purdue University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Ne\u00ad braska are working together to de\u00ad velop and test curricular materials for computer-based experiments in an an\u00ad alytical chemistry laboratory. At the University of Iowa, computer-based curricula are being developed for economics, political science, and so\u00ad ciology. Innovative materials are being developed at the University of California, Irvine, for teaching physics, using an interactive com\u00ad puter graphics system to present com\u00ad plex processes and phenomena in situ\u00ad ations where conceptuaUzation is difficult. At the University of Pitts\u00ad burgh, Thomas Dwyer is testing the use of a commercial, time-shared ter\u00ad minal, and is developing a wide vari\u00ad ety of curriculum modules in physics, biology, the social sciences, mathemat\u00ad ics, and computer science for use in secondary schools. Seymour -Papert of\u2014the Massaehu- setts Institute of Technology and Robert Davis of Syracuse University are both using computers to teach problem-solving in mathematics to el\u00ad ementary school children. The chil\u00ad dren are taught to write computer programs which control a device called a \"turtle.\" With this computer device, children have demonstrated their ability to write programs to draw simple figures, construct com\u00ad plex geometric designs, generate mu\u00ad sic and poetry, and solve motion problems in physics. Over the past 4 years, the National Science Foundation has assisted in the establishment of educational com\u00ad puter networks, through the Regional Cooperative Computing Activities Program, to explore the application of computer techniques and networks to the educational process. Specifically, the regional program involved training faculty members at institutions willing -t-o^harre- the -cost to enable~them to \u2014 explore ways of using computer service to improve the science education of both science and nonscience majors and to provide remote access to com\u00ad puter services necessary to support this activity. Between fiscal years 1968 and 1971, 22 regional computer networks were established. Five of these were Statewide activities in North Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey, Colorado, and Washington. In fiscal year 1972, 46 grants were awarded to establish: (1) three regional networks making up Pennsyl\u00ad vania's Regional Instruction System for Education (PRISE); (2) a State- Nearly 3 50 institutions are part of regional educational computer networks that NSF has assisted in establish- NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS 51 wide network in New York involving the State University of New York at Binghamton and 15 participant col\u00ad leges; and (3) the Florida Regional Cooperative Computing Network com\u00ad prising 10 institutions. This program will be phased out in fiscal year 1973 with an analysis of the impact of these cooperative approaches on cost and effectiveness in science education. The figure shows the approximate location of each network supported to date. Involved are 26 major universi\u00ad ties, 237 4-year colleges, 43 junior col\u00ad leges, and 37 secondary schools. COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN RESEARCH Foundation programs in Computer Applications in Research support a wide range of activities to increase the usefulness of computers in the conduct of research. Some projects focus on research methodology in\u00ad cluding the creation of new computa\u00ad tional techniques and computer-based systems. Others involve research, de\u00ad velopmental activities, and special studies to explore the resource-sharing potential of a nationwide computer communication network. Still others are directed toward improving the quality and applicability of computer software for research. The three pro\u00ad jects described are representative of these programmatic thrusts. Scientists in the Natural Resources and Environmental Science Program at Purdue University are collabora\u00ad ting to develop a strong capabihty in the application of computers to their respective research interests. The pro\u00ad ject is focused on the development of a well-coordinated computer-based la\u00ad boratory system which incorporates a hierarchical structure of three levels of computing support. As one exam\u00ad ple, the research of Daniel L. Shankland, Department of Entomolo\u00ad gy, concerns the integrity and func\u00ad tion of nerve networks. Insect nerves are useful systems for detailed study because, unlike those in vertebrates, they can be removed from the animal and retain their functional integrity. Proper analysis of even such relative\u00ad ly simple networks requires the proc\u00ad essing of enormous amounts of data, coupled with experimental manipula\u00ad tion of the network by way of con\u00ad trolled feedback effects. Professor Shankland is developing advanced computer-based techniques for detailed analysis and quantitative description of a nerve network that controls breathing in the cockroach, and that shows a basic similarity to the reflex system that controls comparable move\u00ad ments in mammals. The feasibility and desirability of a national center devoted to computa\u00ad tion in chemical research is being ex\u00ad amined by the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of the Na\u00ad tional Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. A committee of approximately 30 individuals has been formed to carry out the study. The committee membership includes chem\u00ad ists from diverse areas of research, computer scientists, mathematicians, and representatives from other relevant scientific disciplines. The main tasks of the committee are to identify im\u00ad portant chemical problems susceptible to solution at such a laboratory, iden\u00ad tify special problems of computer science involved, and explore and characterize the structure and opera\u00ad tion of such a facility. The committee is concerned also with the broader questions of the impact of such a laboratory on university computing centers, development of computer net\u00ad works, computer program exchange, and interfacing of the laboratory with the scientific community. A major thrust is under way to provide researchers with highly accur\u00ad ate, consistent, well-documented, and extensively tested software. A collab\u00ad orative prototype effort involving the Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Texas, and Stanford University, in cooperation with vari\u00ad ous field test sites, is under way to certify and disseminate mathematical software. Selected mathematical soft\u00ad ware is tested first at the three princi\u00adpal institutions and then at 16 field test sites. The certified products are distributed by the Argonne Code Center. A key aspect of this project is the emergence of a collaborative test\u00ad ing methodology. SCIENCE INFORMATION ACTIVITIES Science communications cut across not only all of the Foundation's activ\u00ad ities but those of the entire Govern\u00ad ment, academia, and industry as well. The Office of Science Information Service has become the focal point in the Government for the support and coordination of science information activities which, in the end, will have major impact on the efficiency of re\u00ad search conducted and the application of the research results at all levels of our society. A major effort was made during the past year to revamp the pohcies, objectives, and organization of the Office of Science Information Service (OSIS) to meet new challenges and responsibilities. Grants totaUng ap\u00ad proximately $10 million were made in support of systems and services for more effective science communica\u00ad tion. An additional $1 million in equivalent excess foreign currencies supported eight contracts for the translation of scientific literature and related information services. New responsibilities accrued from the Foundation's acceptance of lead\u00ad ership for the Committee on Scien\u00ad tific and Technical Information (COSATI) of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. This as\u00ad signment, undertaken at the request of the Office of Science and Technol\u00ad ogy, requires the coordination of Fed\u00ad eral science information activities, and parallels the coordination of such activities in non-Federal, academic, and industrial sectors where OSIS had concentrated its attention in prior years. As a corollary to the COSATI 52 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT assignment, OSIS undertook to serve as the U.S. focal point in internation\u00ad al science information relationships. Changes in policy brought about a substantial reduction in funding pro\u00ad jections and timetables for commit\u00ad per\u00ad mitted reorientation of OSIS efforts. Under the new policy, the-eost--of- initial planning of new information systems (prior to design and develop\u00ad ment) and their operational costs once testing is completed, are the re\u00ad sponsibility of the proposing organiza\u00ad tion. In implementing these policy chang\u00ad es, operating practices concerning system development were also altered \u2014 chiefly to emphasize contracts rather than grants as the principal mode of support \u2014 and OSIS was reorganized into five program ele\u00ad ments that permit sharper manage\u00ad ment focus upon problem areas need\u00ad ing increased attention. INFORMATION SYSTEMS The Foundation's Information Sys\u00ad tems Program is concerned with com\u00ad puterized bibliographic systems for organizing, processing, and dissemi\u00ad nating scientific literature. Such sys\u00ad tems are of two main types: product- oriented and user-oriented. Examples of the first category include the disci\u00ad pline-based systems of the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), the Ameri\u00ad can Institute of Physics (AIP), and the American Psychological Associa\u00ad tion (APA), which produce abstracts and indexes in both published and computer-tape form. The AIP and APA systems reached full operational status in fiscal year 1972. CAS brought its Chemical Register to an operational condition and continued development of other system com\u00ad ponents on an accelerated schedule calling for completion in fiscal year 1975, 18 months earlier than original\u00ad ly planned. User-oriented systems, which em\u00ad ploy the bibliographic tools produced by the discipline systems to serve indi\u00ad viduals or groups at academic and research institutions, include six com\u00ad puterized information centers in vary\u00ad ing stages of development at the fol\u00ad lowing universities: Stanford, Geor\u00ad gia, Lehigh, UCLA, Ohio State, and Pittsburgh. The first three are ap\u00ad proaching operational status where full cost will be borne by the universi\u00ad ties, -and\u2014t-he~-other-s\u2014are on^ehedule toward that goal. DATA SYSTEMS The Data Systems Program focuses attention on quantitative and factual data in all fields of science and tech\u00ad nology to which literature systems provide little or no direct access. The principal effort in fiscal year 1972 lay in defining the scope and objectives of the program, which will concentrate upon determining data requirements and characteristics in various fields and in supporting the development of methods and techniques that will be broadly applicable to computerized data system activities. PUBLICATIONS The objectives of the Publications Program have been changed substan\u00ad tially in view of the growing econom\u00ad ic pressures confronting scientific pub\u00ad lications, particularly the professional journals. Heretofore, the program had subsidized the publication of periodi\u00ad cals and monographs on the basis of scientific value and the need for Foundation support to ensure their survival. Hereafter, it will concentrate much of its support upon innovations in the form or method of publication \u2014 innovations designed to reduce costs and increase the utility of the documentation. Assistance in the pub\u00ad lication of essential monographic works will continue on a limited scale, but will emphasize data compi\u00ad lations, critical reviews, and other such documents that serve to con\u00ad dense or evaluate the growing bulk of scientific literature. RESEARCH In recent years, the Research Pro\u00ad gram has devoted most of its resources to two university centers for in\u00ad formation research: The Ohio State University and Georgia Institute of Technology. When this support was terminated in fiscal year 1972, it made available more funds to support specific projects aimed at defining and solving problems affecting the in- foTmattoTi-transfer process. The-deter- mination of priority needs and the development of a framework for fu\u00ad ture support will permit more produc\u00ad tive apphcation of the funds available in the program. FOREIGN SCIENCE INFORMATION The primary objective of the For\u00ad eign Science Information Program is to facilitate communication between U.S. and foreign scientists by arrang\u00ad ing for translation of foreign materials and by supporting U.S. participation in international information activities. The program relies upon contracts in countries where foreign currency holdings can be applied to the transla\u00ad tion requirements of the U.S. Gov\u00ad ernment \u2014 specifically those of the Foundation and the 13 other Federal departments and agencies whose needs the program coordinates and administers under Public Law 480. In fiscal year 1972, 70,000 pages of for\u00ad eign science material were translated for use by the U.S. science community. INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE ACTIVITIES In fiscal year 1972, the Foundation continued or increased its support of major international programs such as the International Biological Program, the International Decade of Ocean Exploration, the Global Atmospheric Research Program, and Polar Pro\u00ad grams. Accomplishments under these programs are summarized on pages 36 to 42 of this report. In addition, the Foundation (1) served as executive agency for eight bilateral research and exchange programs with the following countries: Australia, Re- NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS 53 public of China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Romania, and Spain; (2) agreed to serve as executive agency for cooperative science programs with Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Iran; (3) started new cooperative science programs with Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria; (4) supported U.S. participation in the planning and development of the In\u00ad ternational Institute for Applied Sys\u00ad tems Analysis; (5) supported U.S. scientific cooperation with most of the nine excess currency countries; and (6) started a new program. Scientists and Engineers in Economic Develop\u00ad ment, in conjunction with the Agency for International Development. The Foundation also supported about 900 American scientists to visit foreign laboratories, plan internation\u00ad al programs, and attend scientific meetings abroad. The programs and activities sum\u00ad marized (right) are administered by the Foundation's Office of Interna\u00ad tional Programs. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), with NSF support, exchanged scientists with the Academies of Sci\u00ad ences of the U.S.S.R., Bulgaria, Czech\u00ad oslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The number of U.S. and foreign visitors and the man- months for each are summarized below: INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES Summary of Activities\u2014Fiscal Year 1972 Name of Program United States-Australia Agreement for Scientific and Technical Cooperation East Europe Cooperative Science Program France-United States Exchange of Scientists India-United States Exchange of Scientists United States-Italy Cooperative Science Program United States-Japan Cooperative Science Program United States-Republic of China Cooperative Science Program General Agreement for Friendship and Cooperation between the Governments of the United States and Spain Activity One seminar on rangeland ecosystems held in Adelaide, Australia. One short-term U.S. visitor funded to visit the University of Sydney. Seven research projects initiated in cooperation with Romania; 13 Romanian scientists visited the United States, and five Americans visited Romania. A joint symposium on science policy with Bulgaria was funded. Eight U.S. scientists received awards to study in France and eight French scientists received grants to do research in the United States. Nine U.S. scientists traveled to India, and six Indian scientists came to the United States. Two seminars were held in Italy, one on pro\u00ad teins and one on variable-structure systems. Twenty-five seminars were held; 11 grants were made for visiting U.S. scientists; supple\u00ad mental support was provided for 17 existing grants; and an exchange of eminent American and Japanese chemists was supported. Fourteen short-term and six long-term visits were made by U.S. scientists; one seminv was held in Taiwan on forest ecology and genetics and one seminar on hurricanes and typhoons was held in Miami, Fla.; and a grant was made to the Asia Foundation to support U.S. specialists in Taiwan. Ten Spanish scientists visited the United States and eight Americans traveled to Spain; scien\u00ad tific equipment was requisitioned for all ap\u00ad proved projects. In February 1972, the NAS negoti\u00ad ated a new exchange agreement with the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in\u00ad creasing the man-months of exchange from 180 to 216 man-months in each United States-U.S.S.R. and East Europe Academy Excliange Program Visits Each Way' Exchange Country U.S.S.R. _ Bulgaria Czechoslovakia Hungary Poland Romania Yugoslavia Totals * For the period April 1, Persons United States Foreign Man-Months United States Foreign 27 26 69 79 8 5 12 12 12 5 41 14 11 5 25 18 10 6 20 34 16 11 44 32 13 10 33 33 97 68 244 222 1971, to March 30, 1972. direction for the 1972-73 biennium. In May 1972, the NAS and the Polish Academy of Sciences agreed to in\u00ad crease the man-months of exchange from 40 to 50 man-months in each direction in the exchange year 1972-73. The Foundation awarded a grant to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to support an exchange of four scientists annually between the AAAS and the Soviet All-Union Society \"Znaniye.\" The visiting scientists will lecture on both scientific and \"science and soci\u00ad ety\" topics. 54 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS Foundation funding, through the NAS and other organizations, sup\u00ad ported U.S. participation in interna\u00ad tional cooperative science activities conducted by both governmental and nongovernmental science bodies. The Foundation supported the Academy's participation in the planning and de\u00ad velopment of the International Insti\u00ad tute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). Representatives from the founding nations (France, East and West Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the U.S.S.R.) met to prepare a charter, select a site, develop a pro\u00ad gram, and discuss institute member\u00ad ship. IIASA is expected to be formal\u00ad ly established in late 1972 to begin work on urbanization, transportation, communication, pollution, and other complex problems common to indus\u00ad trialized nations. SPECIAL FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAM FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES During fiscal year 1972, the Foundation awarded 23 grants for cooperative research projects in ex\u00ad cess currency countries and made 106 travel awards to U.S. scientists to at\u00ad tend meetings, develop projects, and visit or work in laboratories in eight of the nine excess currency countries (Burma, Egypt, India, Morocco, Pak\u00ad istan, Poland, Tunisia, and Yugosla\u00ad via; no project or travel awards were made for activities in Guinea). The Foundation supports these programs and activities with the U.S.-owned ex\u00ad cess currencies which accumulate to the credit of the United States through the sale of agricultural com\u00ad modities, the repayment of loans, and the payment of interest on loans. The commitment to the program by partic\u00ad ipating excess currency countries was demonstrated in fiscal year 1972 by Egypt and Yugoslavia, both of which converted currencies_. in. _ _amo-un.ts equal to particular NSF grants to dol\u00ad lars to purchase scientific instruments and equipment (mostly of U.S. manu\u00ad facture) for cooperative projects. A random example of the types of projects supported under the Special Foreign Currency Program is a study conducted by U.S. and Yugoslav elec\u00ad trical engineers on the characteristics of internal overvoltages of high volt\u00ad age electrical systems. An under\u00ad standing of the causes of overvoltages and methods to prevent them will assist , ho-th countries in reducing the frequency of failures and breakdown of equipment and lower the cost of constructing transmission towers, in\u00ad sulators, and other electrical equip\u00ad ment. A burning transformer resulting from a voltage overload, part of a study conducted by United States and Yugoslav electrical engineers on the characteristics of internal overvoltages of high- voltage electrical systems. Research Applications The Research Apphcations Direc\u00ad torate administers two programs: Re\u00ad search Apphed to National Needs (RANN) and the Intergovernmental Science Programs (ISP). In these ac\u00ad tivities, special emphasis is placed on exploration of technical opportunities that can lead to improvements in economic growth and productivity, to new products and services, and to improvements in our capabilities to deal effectively with social and envi\u00ad ronmental problems; and on de\u00ad veloping mechanisms for transferring research results to programs of State and local governments. The total NSF support of research that could properly be classified as applied research was approximately $71 million in 1972. This was an increase of about $22 million, or 45 percent, over 1971. The Foundation supports this applied research primarily under the RANN program which consolidates NSF's major problem-focused re\u00ad search efforts. Some applied research is also supported under Research Pro\u00ad ject Support, National and Special Research Programs, Computing Ac\u00ad tivities in Education and Research, the National Center for Atmospherijc Research, and other activities. The increase over the prior year was a reflection, principally, of growth in the RANN program and of expanded support for research projects in the atmospheric sciences, engineering, and materials research. The RANN program supports re\u00ad search on selected social, environmen\u00ad tal, economic, and technological problems of national importance with the objective of contributing toward their practical solution. In fiscal year 1972, the RANN program funded 341 projects, for a total of $53.8 mil\u00ad lion, in 14 broad problem areas. The Office of Intergovernmental Science and Research Utilization fo\u00ad cuses on the development of im\u00ad proved programs and institutions for making science and technology avail\u00ad able for use by States and local gov\u00ad ernments in solving problems. The work includes the use of results from RANN and other NSF programs that have important applications to those programs. The ofSce also develops strategies for the utilization of RANN research results at all levels of gov\u00ad ernment and in the private sector. In fiscal year 1972, this office sponsored 43 projects for a total of $1.0 million. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS The projects of Advanced Technol\u00ad ogy Applications are designed to stim\u00ad ulate the development and applica\u00ad tion of new technology that can create new industries and markets for U.S. goods and services, as well as help improve national productivity and environmental quality. Major em\u00ad phasis is given to research projects concerning energy systems to meet future national needs; earthquake en\u00ad gineering technology to better with\u00ad stand the forces of earthquakes; de- Table 6 Research Applications Obligations Fiscal Years 1971 and 1972 (Millions of dollars) Fiscal Year 1971 Fiscal Year 1972 Number Amount Number Amount Researcli Applied to National Needs Advanced Technology Applications .

Energy Problems\u2014\u2014^ Activities of the energy resources program fall into two general categor\u00ad ies: (1) surveys and analyses of en\u00ad ergy resources and research; and (2) support of specific research and de\u00ad velopment projects that will have di\u00ad rect impact on the energy problems of the nation. In order to assess the problems ^^s- sociated with energy production, conx version, and use, it is necessary to bring to a focus information from an exceedingly broad set of disciplines. These range over such areas as reac\u00ad tor engineering, coal technology, economics, and pohtical science. To provide the NSF energy program with a base for its program efforts, and to help the nation assess the mag\u00ad nitude of its future energy problems, the Foundation in the past year has sponsored several background studies. A survey of current energy research in the United States was carried out by the Oak Ridge National Labo\u00ad ratory. This was the first comprehen\u00ad sive survey to be undertaken which included both Federal and privately sponsored research. Questionnaires were sent to all industries involved in any way, and to all Federal agencies. The resulting bibliography, with ab\u00ad stracts, contains almost 5,000 entries, cross-indexed for ready reference. (Inventory of Energy Research, Committee on Science and Astronautics of the U.S. House of Representatives.) Factual material relating to nation\u00ad al energy problems was summarized in a two-volume report, The U.S. En\u00ad ergy Problem, prepared by Intertech- nology Corp. and available from the National Technical Information Serv\u00ad ice (NTIS). This report brings to\u00ad gether in one place summaries of the results of many previous studies con\u00adcerning energy, and attempts to sys\u00ad tematize the approach to determining potentially high impact energy research needs. An example of these works is a projection of future U.S. energy requirements. A total of 5 6 separate projections were combined to obtain an estimate of the way in which U^S. \"total\" energy and\"~electrical require^ ments may be expected to increase throughout the remainder of this cen\u00ad tury. The consensus of the projections is that demand for energy in all forms will grow at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, while that for electrical ener\u00ad gy will alone grow at a rate of 5.5 percent. The assumptions behind all the projections may, of course, be subject to question. Nevertheless, the Intertechnology study provides a comprehensive survey of existing ideas and of present energy technology. To assess needs for research in the energy area. Resources for the Fu\u00ad ture, under an NSF grant, identified research requirements in areas of en\u00ad ergy consumption, production, tech\u00ad nology, environmental effects, and pol\u00ad icy issues. The study, prepared in collaboration with the MIT Environ\u00ad mental Laboratory, indicates specific problems in these areas which are likely to prove important in the com\u00ad ing years. (Energy Research Needs, available from NTIS.) Environmental aspects of energy use are becoming increasingly impor\u00ad tant. This area was singled out for special attention through a workshop on Energy and the Environment con\u00ad ducted by Cornell University. The workshop brought together experts from a number of relevant fields to discuss four problem areas: (a) so\u00ad cial, environmental, and health costs of energy use; (b) technological op\u00ad tions for energy supply; (c) growth rates of energy demand; and (d) in\u00ad stitutional mechanisms for dealing with environmental problems associ\u00ad ated with energy use. (Cornell Work\u00ad shop, available from the U.S. Govern\u00ad ment Printing Office.) The second category of Foundation energy resources activities includes projects such as work on land use, power plant siting and power trans\u00ad mission, solar energy, and thermal en\u00ad ergy storage. The University of Min\u00ad nesota is developing a system aimed at the economical use of solar energy for generating electric power. The system will use a solar concentrator which focuses solar energy on a heat T5ipe\"with a selective optical coating. The heat pipe then conducts high temperature thermal energy via a heat transfer loop to a thermal stor\u00ad age unit; then the energy is released to the power cycle working fluid. L. O. Krampitz of Case Western Re\u00ad serve University is investigating the feasibility for direct formation of hy\u00ad drogen using sunlight and the photo- synthetic process of plants in combi\u00ad nation with the enzyme hydrogenase. This process may make it possible to produce economically useful supplies of hydrogen gas. A coal gasification program was established at City College of New York (CUNY) in June 1972 with Arthur M. Squires as principal inves\u00ad tigator. Advanced chemical engineer\u00ad ing techniques are being studied that can lead to a markedly increased abil\u00ad ity in the gasification of coal. These techniques can also facihtate the reac\u00ad tion of coal with hydrogen to produce extraordinary amounts of methane and aromatic liquids such as alcohols and turpentines. The program at City College should provide a basis for the design of pilot reactors for making hydrogen and other gases from coal or coke. Earthquake Engineering A major new thrust in earthquake engineering during the past year has been directed to technology transfer and utilization. The National In\u00ad formation Service for Earthquake Engineering had previously been es\u00ad tablished to collect, organize, and dis\u00ad seminate information. This activity has been augmented by a program aimed at the translation of earth\u00ad quake engineering research into crite\u00ad ria, specifications, and methods usable by professional engineers and builders. RESEARCH APPLICATIONS 51 Projects undertaken to develop improved building practices and to make that knowledge avail\u00ad able to State and local officials may help prevent future tragedies such as those caused by the San Fernando earthquake of 1971. Current building practices concern\u00ad ing land use planning, building codes, and inspection of new and existing buildings do not generally reflect the newest knowledge of responses of buildings to earthquake forces. Orga\u00ad nizations participating in this Nation\u00ad al Information Service have undertak\u00ad en a program that will: (a) synthe\u00ad size current knowledge and develop improved building practices for assur\u00ad ing the safety of new and existing buildings; (b) make this knowledge available to State and local officials for land use planning and building regulation to mitigate the effects of earthquakes, high winds, and ex\u00ad plosions. Objectives of the program will include greater human safety, protection of property, and mainte\u00ad nance of vital functions under disaster conditions. The Disaster Mitigation Project comprises three phases leading to im\u00ad proved building practices: evaluation of current building methods, develop\u00ad ment of improved methods, and imple\u00ad mentation of these improved methods. Results from the first phase include reports defining best current practice; needs of decision-makers and profes\u00ad sional users for land use planning, design, and evaluation of existing buildings; and significant gaps in knowledge which require research. Improved practice will be de\u00ad veloped in phase two, using results of new research; and phase three in\u00ad volves dissemination of the developed methodologies to the intended users, including State and local officials and Federal agencies. Vive Research Little is known about exactly how fire victims die, except in the obvious cases of severe burns, heart attacks, or fractures. In an attempt to deter\u00ad mine how people become victims of the byproducts of fires \u2014 smoke and confusion \u2014 a grant has been made to the Apphed Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University to conduct a cooperative study with the Baltimore City Medical Examiner's Office and the university's School of Hygiene and Public Health. They are trying to reconstruct the sequences of events in fatal fires, finding out what the vic\u00ad tims were doing, how much warning they had, how they reacted to it and, using results of post mortem analyses, what the causes of death were. A related program at the Universi\u00ad ty of Utah is studying the physiologi\u00adcal and toxicological effects of smoke produced during the combustion of polymeric materials. The research team includes medical staff members and participants from the Salt Lake City Fire Department and the Fire Marshal of the State of Utah, and also the National Bureau of Stan\u00ad dards. The program is concerned with problems connected with the burning Firemen and researchers are working together to investigate sites of fires in efforts to determine the sequence of events that results in loss of life. 58 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT versity of Oregon is presently apply\u00ad ing a technique of low temperature physics as an aid in the study and monitoring of air pollution. The tech\u00ad nique being studied is the quantitative use of a cold trap at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Such a trap can collect hundreds of different types of com- \"pouri^s~for lafeT^anMy nique has the potential for reducing costs and increasing the sensitivity of air pollution measurements. New instrumentation for improved medical diagnosis and more effective health care delivery systems is being developed in two areas. The first area of instrumentation and techniques for cancer radiotherapy involves four separate projects at Stanford, Har\u00ad vard, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Nebraska. These projects apply novel technology to the development of instruments for the treatment of localized cancer with neutron, proton, and negative pion radiation. Supporting studies, making extensive use of computer techniques, consist of determining the depths that doses of such radiations penetrate into tissues, as well as the relative biological effectiveness for various types of radiation. The second area of instrumentation for improved medical diagnosis and treatment includes four projects at MIT, Stanford, and the University of California, San Francis\u00ad co. One of the two MIT projects and the Stanford project will study the diagnostic value of magnetic fields produced by the heart and the brain. The second MIT project will develop a magnetically propelled catheter for possible use in treating diseases of the brain. At the University of Califor\u00ad nia, a new type of camera, consisting of multiwire proportional chambers, will be developed as a diagnostic device for the imaging of positron- emitting radioisotopes. eas where expected return on the re\u00ad search investment is great and where rapid progress is vital to the nation. Some grants for enzyme technology have been given to large interdisci\u00ad plinary teams focused on particular problems. At MIT, work is under way to develop new techniques involving enzymes- for^rhe synthesis of complex organic compounds, in particular the synthesis of the antibiotic gramicidin s. Synthetic biochemical reactions are not currently practical for industry because the necessary enzyme co-fac\u00ad tors, which are molecules that facili\u00ad tate the transfer of energy or elec\u00ad trons, cannot be reused. Large-scale economic regeneration of co-factors and immobilization of several enzy\u00ad mes for coupled reactions present for\u00ad midable scientific and engineering problems, and about one-third of the grantees are addressing aspects of co- factor enzymatic processes. A team at the University of Pennsylvania has immobilized a co-factor, designed a highly sensitive enzyme electrode for detecting phenol, and developed an enzymatic method for destroying phenol in waste waters. Several gran\u00ad tees are investigating various new in\u00ad dustrial uses of enzymes, some of which have been patented. Support for processes for extractive metallur\u00ad gy was initiated on a modest basis in fiscal year 1972, primarily for systems analysis of existing procedures and for research on automatic control. Highest priority is given for new proc\u00ad esses which not only are economical\u00ad ly attractive, but which avoid the air and water pollution problem usually accompanying existing technology. ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES of polymeric materials such as fabrics, coatings, elastomers, and cel\u00ad lular plastics. The research will provide the fundamental information necessary to develop improved fire-resistant ma\u00ad terials and to devise better testing procedures to evaluate material hazards under realistic conditions. Instrumentation Technology The application of research princi\u00ad ples in the design, construction, and use of instrumentation is a key factor in the achievement of an increasingly high standard of living in the nation and in its role of world technological leadership. It is the purpose of this program to support research projects leading to new uses for and improve\u00ad ments of instrumentation for environ\u00ad mental, social, and technological sys\u00ad tems. The support of the application of new techniques to the problem of en\u00ad vironmental monitoring included four new projects. At MIT, tunable semi\u00ad conductor lasers will be applied to the detection of molecular atmospheric pollutants. At the University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Davis, the use of X-ray fluorescence, which is being success\u00ad fully applied to large-scale aerosol monitoring in California, will be de\u00ad veloped further for quantitative an\u00ad alysis of biological and physical sam\u00ad ples of environmental interest. A group at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab\u00ad oratory is developing a portable in\u00ad strument for the quick and easy de\u00ad termination of trace concentrations of heavy metals such as mercury in bio\u00ad logical samples such as tuna. This in\u00ad strumentation uses the recently in\u00ad vented atomic-absorption method called atomic Zeeman effect for an\u00ad alysis of trace elements in organic materials in the part-per-billion range. The measurement takes less than one minute and does not require prior chemical separation of the mer\u00ad cury from the host material. Such rapid examination can prevent large economic losses in such industries as fishing. A research team at the Uni-Advanced Industrial Processing Enzyme technology and extractive metallurgy have been selected as ar-In efforts to direct scientific talents towards solving environmental prob\u00ad lems, 98 projects were selected with investments of $19.4 million in fiscal year 1972. These studies deal with problems of weather modification, en- RESEARCH APPLICATIONS 59 vironmental aspects of trace contami\u00ad nants and regional environmental issues, rural-urban development, im\u00ad pact of man on semi-primitive areas, land use allocation, and waste manage\u00ad ment strategies. They are set up in such a way that the specific users of the research results affect the formu\u00ad lation and conduct of the investiga\u00ad tions. Such involvement of benefici\u00ad aries in the scientific activities helps make the objectives more real and the results more practical. Mathematical Modeling for Environmental Issues Environmental problems are usual\u00ad ly complex and involve many factors and competing interests. As a result, environmental issues often arise from competition over the use of space or resources. With the use of mathemati\u00ad cal models, available research data can be analyzed and used in planning and helping select among alternative solutions. A team of computer researchers at the Harvard School of Design, led by Carl Steinitz, is developing methods for incorporating qualitative and quantitative environmental values into regional planning for an area southeast of Boston. Dr. Steinitz' work in computer graphics will pro\u00ad vide a foundation for a two- dimensional, spatial planning model that will cope with problems such as regional water suppUes, wetlands pro\u00ad tection, solid waste disposal, land use allocation, and location of industrial, shopping, and residential structures and transportation corridors. At Iowa State University, Earl Heady has developed a linear pro\u00ad gramming model of some 5,000 equa\u00ad tions which he is applying to deter\u00ad mine the impact of national agricul\u00ad tural practices upon water quahty. This approach will help evaluate the environmental effects of alternative practices and policies. A parallel pro\u00ad ject led by Russell Thompson at the University of Houston is examining the probable quantitative demands for water in the future by chemical indus\u00ad tries. Schedules of demands for both disposal and consumptive uses of water will be based on marginal val\u00ad ues implied by the production func\u00ad tions generated for each of the 50 most important chemical products. Such predictions for the next 3 dec\u00ad ades will then help develop policy to guide the development of water-using industries in specific regions. Information from programs of the International Biological Program is being used by RANN research groups in efforts to develop management strategies concerned with the use and conservation of natural resources. At the University of \"Washington, Colo\u00ad rado State University, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, investigators are adding economic, engineering, and so- ciologic parameters to ecological sim\u00ad ulation models in order to develop models for better management of for\u00ad est and grazing lands. The use of management gaming techniques with a computer can be an important ele\u00ad ment in helping instruct decision\u00ad makers on the probable consequences of their actions. Water Management in the Southwest A multi-institutional project is ex\u00ad amining the environmental impact of various activities, including develop\u00ad ment of major coal reserves, rec\u00ad reational opportunities, and water resources in the Lake Powell region of Utah and Arizona. In a coordi\u00ad nated program, natural and social scientists and professionals in law and medicine are studying such phenom\u00ad ena as lake eutrophication, heavy metal contamination, stream flow, ero\u00ad sion and evaporation, air quality and epidemiology, as well as recreation, economics, and legal factors. The pur\u00ad pose of the project is to provide an improved scientific basis for water re\u00ad source management taking into ac\u00adcount users in the Lake Powell region, ranging from local Indian populations to heavy industry. One result of studies on Lake Pow\u00ad ell is based on a computer model which utilizes chemical analysis of water samples to calculate ionic com\u00ad position and activity. These results show that calcite is precipitated as water plants withdraw carbon dioxide from surface waters, and that this calcite settles to deeper, more acid waters where it is dissolved. During the autumn and winter turnover of lake waters, a portion of this calcite may accumulate in bottom muds, thus representing a permanent withdrawal of calcite from the lake and from the Colorado River below the Glen Can\u00ad yon Dam. Weather Modification by Urban Centers The role of atmospheric pollutants in influencing weather patterns is not clear at this time, but evidence is growing that the impact of man's ac\u00ad tivities upon the weather is an impor\u00ad tant factor and must be recognized and understood more fully. Scientists at the Illinois State Water Survey are studying the effects of urban centers upon local weather patterns. A study of the St. Louis area has indicated increases in precipitation, lightning, and hail in the summertime which are believed to be urban-induced, but winter weather patterns show little urban-induced effects. An analysis of the Chicago area indicated urban- related increases in both warm and cold season precipitation within the city and as far as 3 5 miles down\u00ad wind of the city. Initial studies of Indianapohs have provided some slight evidence of an urban effect upon precipitation in the warm sea\u00ad son, but no noticeable effect in the cold season. Another initial study of the Washington, D.C. area indicated a rather pronounced and consistent increase in both the summer and winter precipitation across the urban area. 60 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Effects of atmospheric pollutants from urban centers on local weather patterns are being studied in a joint program undertaken by Argonne National Laboratory, University of Chicago, Illinois State Water Survey, and University of Wyoming. Lead\u2014A Trace Contaminant Lead is an acknowledged toxicant to man and other animals. The sources of lead found in the environment, the routes and rates of transport, and the ultimate fate, including health hazards, are the subjects of investiga\u00ad tion by three university teams. Half of the lead dispersed into the environment and 95 percent of atmos\u00adpheric lead is probably from gasoline additives and is in a particularly mo\u00ad bile form. Atmospheric lead concen\u00ad trations are closely correlated with traffic density. Typical values range from 1 microgram per cubic meter in rural areas to more than 40 in a vehicle tunnel. Concentrations in solids decrease rapidly with distance from highways. The major thrust of a University of Illinois team is to develop predictive models that describe the mobilization and transport of lead, especially from automobiles, in a 76-square-mile ecosystem. Food chain analysis and physiological effects are measured. A Colorado State University team is concentrating on the evaluation of at\u00ad mospheric transport, solubility, and mobihty. The recent opening of what has become the world's largest lead min\u00ad ing and smelting district in the Clark RESEARCH APPLICATIONS 61 Several studies are being made on the sources, routes, and impact of lead pollution on the environment. In one of the projects, the rural area surrounding the new lead mining and smelt\u00ad ing industry in southeastern Missouri is being analyzed for effects of lead on the vegetation, soil, and water. (Photo by American Metal Climax, Inc.) National Forest of southeastern Mis\u00ad souri has afforded an unusual oppor\u00ad tunity to study the effects of lead and associated metals in a forested ecosys\u00ad tem. A team at the University of Missouri at RoUa is collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service, the Geologi\u00ad cal Survey, and the mining industry to identify all lead pollution processes associated with mining, smelting, and transport to the consumer. This inves\u00ad tigation includes the use of remote sensing for detection of contamination in plants, especially sulfur dioxide toxicity emanating from the smelter. The efforts of the three research groups constitute a coordinated study of lead in the environment. The inves\u00ad tigators exchange samples of lead- containing soils and plant and animal tissue for calibration as well as re\u00ad sults. They also coordinate with simi\u00ad lar projects studying other heavy met\u00ad als such as cadmium, at Purdue, and mercury, at Stanford and Rochester. They are also assisted by analytical studies of toxic metals and by the toxic materials information center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND HUMAN RESOURCES The major aim of research sup\u00ad ported in Social Systems and Human Resources is to provide reliable in\u00ad formation and analysis to guide policy decisions and to illuminate the conse\u00ad quences of alternative social policies and programs. There are two major programs in the division: 1) Munici\u00ad pal Systems, Operations, and Services; and 2) Social Data and Community Structure. Research on municipal systems is concerned with improving the existing use of urban resources, with evalua\u00ad ting the social consequences of new technology, and with evaluating the benefits and costs of alternative orga\u00ad nizational forms for our cities. This research includes studying methods to improve such operations as refuse collection, police force activity, health care delivery, and new urban trans\u00ad portation systems. The social data and community structure program is concerned with developing information on changing trends in the U.S. population and data required for evaluating social pro\u00ad grams and policies. This involves anal\u00ad yses of the criminal justice system and efficiency of law enforcement agencies, as well as a search for ways to improve the public decisionmaking processes at all levels of government. The division allocated $10.7 million in fiscal year 1972, with 66 percent supporting research on municipal sys\u00ad tems and 27 percent on social data and community structure; grants were made with an average size of $43,000 and an average duration of 18 months. Solid Waste Management in New York City The Urban and Policy Sciences Program is continuing its research on urban problems in collaboration with municipal agencies in New York City through an award to the State Uni\u00ad versity of New York at Stony Brook. Principal attention is being given to 62 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Trying to ease problems like those of solid waste collection and disposal in New York City, a team of scientists at the State University of New York at Stony Brook is studying methods for more efficient public services in crowded cities. systems analyses of the collection and disposal of solid waste in New York City. The Stony Brook team has pro\u00ad vided the city and sanitation workers union with plans for improved man\u00ad power schedules which have been adopted for implementation. The city's Environmental Protection Ad\u00ad ministration estimates substantial sav\u00ad ings for the city as a result of the more efficient allocations of available manpower. The Stony Brook group is also studying the effectiveness of dis\u00ad trict court systems in Nassau County and is developing techniques for measuring the productivity of public services. Analyses of Urban Growth Results from an exploratory award to the RAND Corp. for research on problems of urban growth and de\u00ad velopment in San Jose suggest that the most important influences on de\u00ad velopment have been Federal pro\u00ad curement policies and Federal income tax policy. These provide large incen\u00ad tives for new residential development but little for rehabilitation of older housing sites. Because of these influ\u00ad ences, the range of decisions open to municipal officials is restricted. The RAND Corp. is continuing its research on urban growth in San Jose and, in collaboration with local uni\u00ad versities, has begun related research in Seattle and St. Louis, with the aim of specifying how Federal policies affect the growth and economy of differing urban areas. Clearinghouse and Laboratory for Census Data A clearinghouse and laboratory have been established at the Center for Research Libraries in Rosslyn, Va., to make efficient use of the large amount \"of\" computer data assembled during the 1970 Census of Popula\u00ad tion. More than 2,000 reels of tapes are being processed and edited, and programs are being developed to make the data more accessible for study. Training and advice will be provided to researchers in the social sciences and other fields in the use of census data for research and plan\u00ad ning. Social Costs of Natural Disasters A group of researchers of the Uni\u00ad versity of Colorado has begun a sys\u00ad tematic analysis of 15 types of natu- Development planned for San Jose, Calif., was restricted in five areas after analysis by the RAND Corp. showed that the cost of delivering services, such as police and fire protection and street and park maintenance, and utilities, such as sewers, water service, and storm runoff facili\u00ad ties, would create a large drain on the resources of the city. RESEARCH APPLICATIONS 63 ral hazards to determine their inci\u00ad dence, the social and economic costs associated with them, and to examine remedial steps which might lessen the costs of damage from these natural hazards. EXPLORATORY RESEARCH AND PROBLEM ASSESSMENT Exploratory Research and Problem Assessment is an attempt to define, analyze, and explore emerging nation\u00ad al problems relating to technology and the health of the economy, to human and social needs, and to the future trends of the nation's growth. Emphasis is placed on systems- oriented studies of the impacts of science and technology on society and of national policy alternatives. Exploratory Research This program supports the early stages of research into problem areas where there are significant and press\u00ad ing public policy issues. For example, the development of a citizen feedback system for Statewide environmental planning is being explored by the En\u00ad vironmental Planning Information Center in Montpelier, Vt. Public edu\u00ad cational materials will be drawn from both Government environmental agencies and the citizen groups con\u00ad cerned with environmental problems. Information on citizen attitudes and their environmental concerns will be provided to executive agencies, to leg\u00ad islative bodies, to the citizen groups, and to the general pubhc. The potential for improved eflS- ciency of small- and medium-scale manufacturing by automating parts programming is being studied by the University of Rochester with the col\u00ad laboration of an industrial partner, the Gleason \"Works. An important in\u00ad termediate objective is improvement of engineering graphics practices. Three fundamental problems must be solved: extraction and compaction of information from mechanical drawings and specifications; synthesis of processing sequences from that in\u00ad formation; and sequence implementa\u00ad tion for machine control. The desired results are part-programming soft\u00ad ware systems linked closely to engi\u00ad neering record-graphics systems, and prototype systems that can be tested in an industrial envirormient. Problem Assessment Research efforts in this program are intended to assist in defining and analyzing national issues in a broad context, to synthesize existing knowl\u00ad edge and identify specific opportuni\u00ad ties for research to aid decision\u00ad making and policy processes. The protection of privacy of per\u00ad sonal information in data banks is an important issue being addressed by the RAND Corp. of Santa Monica. This research involves mathematical investigations of the theoretical possi\u00ad bility of creating a data bank with perfect invulnerability to invasions of privacy. It also is analyzing bounds on the achievability of perfect data pri\u00ad vacy and technical and procedural means of achieving a desired level of data privacy. Formation of the foundations of a cohesive theory of information privacy is under way, and the RAND Corp.'s 1969 Computer Privacy Bibliography is being up\u00ad dated. The research is proceeding toward derivation of functional rela\u00ad tionships among security, costs, and performance for various data security techniques, such as access codes, pri\u00ad vacy transformations, and special se\u00ad curity features in operating system programs. The needs of society in deahng with the moral and ethical impHca- tions of behavior control are being investigated by a task force estab\u00ad lished by the Institute of Society, Eth\u00ad ics, and the Life Sciences at Hastlngs- on-Hudson, N.Y. The research will be conducted by a multidisciplinary group including scientists, ethicists, policy experts, and others. Individual experts or groups of experts will gather information and develop posi\u00adtion papers for examination and eval\u00ad uation by the panel of the institute. Researchers at Carnegie-Mellon University are investigating means to improve consumer safety through in\u00ad novative consumer education. They are attempting to develop instruction\u00ad al modules for high schools to prepare consumers to make better de\u00ad cisions in the marketplace with re\u00ad spect to product safety. The research\u00ad ers will determine consumer attitudes and level of knowledge concerning safety, and what technical concepts and guidelines should be transferred to consumers to enable them to un\u00ad derstand and develop an overall ap\u00ad proach for intelligent buying and safe handling of products. The research will also provide manufacturers and Government agencies with a descrip\u00ad tion of the appropriate information needed by the consumer to make more deliberate, intelligent, confident buying decisions. Finally, the investi\u00ad gations will evaluate the effectiveness of teaching modules in accomphshing their goals. This experimental ap\u00ad proach will use the skills of engineers, educational specialists, and behavior specialists, with the cooperation of a commercial television station. Technology Assessment Technology assessment studies are intended to explore systematically the impacts of technological intrusions on society. For example, the impacts of four biomedical technologies are being assessed by the Committee on Life Sciences and Social Policy of the National Academy of Sciences: 1) in vitro fertilization for human repro\u00ad duction; 2) predetermination of the sex of children; 3) retardation of the process of aging; and 4) technologies for the modification and control of behavior. The information developed by the Academy will be published in book form. The book will attempt to illustrate, by example, one approach to the assessment of biomedical tech\u00ad nology. It will also try to develop some general principles for the assess- 64 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT ment of biomedical technologies and to offer suggestions for the institution\u00ad alization of assessment procedures. Technological impacts frequently cause widespread public alarm. Case histories of such instances are being examined by the Midwest Research Institute, Kansas City, Mo., in an in\u00ad terdisciplinary research project on-the- properties assessments.\" The program in\u00ad volves the preparation of the histories of a minimum of 100 cases occurring during the past 25 years. Conse\u00ad quences of the cases will be studied in detail to derive understanding of the full nature of the associated impacts or consequences on society. Particular attention will be given to early warn\u00ad ing indications of public alarm and to effective remedial actions. Two survey studies of technology assessment activities are nearing com\u00ad pletion. \"Technology and Public Poh- cy: The Process of Technology As\u00ad sessment in the Federal Government\" has been studied by the George Washington University. A broader survey of the extant technology as\u00ad sessment activities at various levels of government, industry, and private in\u00ad stitutions has been accomphshed by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell, and Co., of Washington, D.C. INTERGOVERN\u00ad MENTAL SCIENCE AND RESEARCH UTILIZATION NSF's Intergovernmental Science Programs assist State and local gov\u00ad ernments in strengthening their capa\u00ad bilities to foster and support the de\u00ad velopment and use of scientific meth\u00ad ods and technologies. These programs are administered in close coordination with the Pres\u00ad ident's Office of Science and Technol\u00ad ogy and the Office of Intergovern\u00ad mental Relations in the Office of the Vice President as these offices move ahead with implementing the inter\u00ad governmental aspects of President Nixon's Science and Technology Mes\u00adsage of 1972. Continuing relation\u00ad ships are maintained with the Nation\u00ad al Governors Council on Science and Technology and with the Science and Technology Committee of the Na\u00ad tional Legislative Conference. Close relationships also exist with the na\u00ad tional instrumentalities of State and -l0eal-goveleMaeHt-s4n-pl*nniH^--a-nd-ad-- ministering activities in this area. Objectives of the Intergovernmen\u00ad tal Science Programs include improv\u00ad ing communications, identifying and assessing needs for science and tech\u00ad nology, testing new mechanisms to encourage the use of science and tech\u00ad nology, and disseminating and diffusing results of studies and demonstrations. Among the State-level activities, a grant was awarded to the Ohio State University Research Foundation for the design and implementation of a planning and decision information system for the Governor of Puerto Rico. The system is serving as a pro\u00ad totype for other such State systems. A planning grant was awarded to Cali\u00ad fornia for the design of a comprehen\u00ad sive mechanism to aid the State in bringing science and technology to bear upon domestic problems. A pilot project was initiated with the Pennsyl\u00ad vania Science and Engineering Foundation to extend to local govern\u00ad ments the technical assistance services of a university-based technology ap\u00ad plications program. To implement the President's science and technology message, six conference studies on Statewide re\u00ad search and development priorities were supported in Ohio, Oklahoma, Georgia, Pennsylvania, California, and Puerto Rico. These studies will serve to identify R&D needs and ca\u00ad pabilities, the potentials offered by science and technology to State gov\u00ad ernment operations, and the areas where Federal-State partnership ac\u00ad tivities might be enhanced. Funds were also provided for the partial support of a National Action Confer\u00ad ence on Intergovernmental Science Policy held in Harrisburg, Pa., co- sponsored in part by the U.S. House of Representatives Science and As\u00adtronautics Committee. Several proj\u00ad ects were approved in the area of academic public service, including a 3-day conference conducted by the National Association of State Univer\u00ad sities and Land Grant Colleges. Sup\u00ad port was provided for an Academic Resources Council in South Dakota -w-hieh-in-volves -a-H^f-the State's insti- - tutions of higher education. In order to strengthen the relationship between scientific and technological research and State government operations, a program administered by the Massa\u00ad chusetts Department of Community Affairs will involve graduate research students from a number of Boston area institutions with activities of the Commonwealth. Additional activity in the programs involving State legislatures was under\u00ad taken during the year with an initial grant to the State of New York As\u00ad sembly to provide partial support to the Assembly Scientific Staff and to fund public policy research by coop\u00ad erative graduate student and profes\u00ad sor groups. Increased emphasis was placed upon activities to aid local govern\u00ad ments in their use of science and technology in decision-making and program operations. An industry- related aerospace technology applica\u00ad tions program was initiated during the preceding fiscal year in Fresno, San jose, Anaheim, and Pasadena. Build\u00ad ing on this program and two projects at Auburn University and the Univer\u00ad sity of Missouri, which use the exper\u00ad tise of displaced engineers and scien\u00ad tists, grants were made to support two other models designed to enhance the use of science and technology in the local government setting. One of these models will address self-initiated institutional change for increased science and technology impact in Ta- coma. Wash.; the other will test out ways of maximizing the utility of voluntary activities conducted within the framework of a municipal science and technology advisory committee in Philadelphia. During the fiscal year, two particu\u00ad larly significant studies were pubhshed dealing with intergovernmental science policy. The first of these re\u00ad ports, Power to the States\u2014 Mobilizing Public Technology, was the product of an Intergovernmental Science Program-supported study conducted by the Council of State Governments. The other report. Pub\u00ad lic Technology\u2014A Tool for Solving National Problems, was transmitted to the Federal Council on Science and Technology by its Committee on Intergovernmental Science Relations. These studies have added greatly to the understanding of the field of in\u00ad tergovernmental science policy. During the year, responsibility for assuring the utilization of research results developed by RANN was assigned to the Intergovernmental Science Programs Office, and the name of the office was changed to reflect this new responsibility. This function will be accorded high priori\u00ad ty in the activities of the office in the coming fiscal year. Science Education New national priorities together with changes in public attitudes to\u00ad ward science and the education of sci\u00ad ence manpower have been reflected in the Foundation's programs supporting science education. With emphasis on innovation and improving the quality of science education, the refocusing of'the-Foundatiorfs-education activi^ ties, following the pattern which took clearly defined shape in fiscal year 1971, has continued at an accelerated pace. This new pattern has among its major goals: developing science education programs aimed at providing an appropriate number, variety, and quality of scientific and tech\u00ad nological manpower; stimulating a greater interest in and understanding of science among a broader spectrum of today's students and the general public; and improving the effectiveness of science education in terms of the nation's financial investment therein. Clearly, the nation's educational system has for several years been un\u00ad der great stress. Rising enrollments have brought with them at all levels a wider variety of students with a wider variety of abihties and a wider variety of goals. These efforts, together with new student attitudes about the pur- poses-of- education, have forced insti--^ tutions to adopt new practices and adapt programs to new and far more complex situations. Some of the changes have resulted in better educa\u00ad tion, others have not; some have been responsive to real needs, others have been far wide of the target. During this same time period, costs of educa\u00ad tion have increased markedly, resulting in increased taxes, increased tuition charges, and depleted institutional financial resources. The Foundation cannot, of course, provide even a small fraction of the funds needed to pay the increased costs related to science education. It can, however, by judiciously targeted investments aimed at developing, test\u00ad ing, and promoting better courses and curricula; at identifying appropriate uses of new educational technologies; Table 7 Education in Science Fiscal Year 1972 (Dollars in thousands) Number of proposals received Dollar amount requested Number of awards Funds obligated Science Education Research, Development, and Demonstration Alternative Instructional Methods and Materials Curriculum and Instruction Development .\u2014 Science Curriculum Improvement \u2014- Advanced Science Education - Experimental Models and Demonstrations Resource Personnel Worl(shops and Conferences Comprehensive In-Service Teacher Education Pre-Service Teacher Education \u2014 Technician Education Development Student-Originated Studies State and Urban Systems Instructional Improvement Implementation Training Educational Personnel for Implementation Secondary School Teachers Programs College Teachers Programs - School System and College Implementation Cooperative College-School Program College Science Improvement Program Instructional Scientifi?

SCIENCE EDUCATION 67 and at assisting in dissemination of information about and implementa\u00ad tion of new and innovative kinds of programs, stimulate higher quality science education which will at the same time result in a higher ratio of benefits to costs. In fiscal year 1972, therefore, groundwork was laid for more spe\u00ad cific reorientation of certain already existing programs and for develop\u00ad ment of new activities within a struc\u00ad ture targeted along three principal lines: Science Education Research, Development, and Demonstration; In\u00ad structional Improvement Implementa\u00ad tion; and The Talented Student. There has been, in addition, a sepa\u00ad rate program of Graduate Student Support. Under these four headings, the Foundation conducted education\u00ad al activities in fiscal year 1972 to meet the new changes and demands placed on the nation's scientific and engineering communities. SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION Research, development, and demonstration encompass two main lines of activity. The first is the de\u00ad velopment of alternative instructional methods and materials. The second involves experimental models and demonstrations. Together these pro\u00ad vide the cutting edge of new innova\u00ad tions in science education. Through them the Foundation seeks to redirect and revitalize the teaching of science and technology for both those who will pursue a career in these fields and those who need a sufficient knowledge of them to conduct the complex affairs of society more effectively. ALTERNATIVE INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS AND MATERIALS Essential to the improvement of science education is support for the development and testing of new teaching materials, courses, and cur\u00ad ricula at all levels\u2014pre-college, col\u00ad lege, and graduate. At all three levels, increasing attention is being given to newer disciplines and interdisciplinary fields, and to materials and education\u00ad al programs appropriate to the broad\u00ad er spectrum of students within the educational system. Curriculum and Instruction Development During fiscal year 1972, the Course Content Improvement Program, aimed at pre-college levels of educa\u00ad tion, became the Curriculum and In\u00ad struction Development Program (CID). The new name reflects more accurately the interests and functions of the program, which is concerned not only with development of courses and curricula, but with research in various areas including learning, the structure of educational organization and evaluation, and with development of more effective means of instruc\u00ad tion. The major effort within the pro\u00ad gram was to consolidate previous at\u00ad tainments with respect to out-of-school activities, vertical integration, and new models of school organiza\u00ad tion. Plans are to support additional work in all of these areas as well as in the areas of research and learning. Two areas given special attention in the CID program were Science Edu\u00ad cation Outside of School Walls and a Political Science Curriculum Study. Three grants have been made to support Science Education Outside of School Walls. The Smithsonian Insti\u00ad tution received a grant to develop an experimental touch exhibit for the purpose of investigating whether guided handling of real objects of natural beauty could indeed lead visi\u00ad tors to the kinds of curiosity and in\u00ad sights in learning about natural science that do not occur in the usual museum situation. A grant was made to the Palace of Arts and Science Foundation (San Francisco) for the development of a series of participa\u00ad tory exhibits for the Arts and Science Exploratorium, which is unique in its emphasis on sensory perception. The University of Cahfornia, Berkeley, was awarded a grant to provide sup\u00ad port to the Lawrence Hall of Science for a project to develop instructional models for outdoor education of stu\u00ad dents, ages 11 to 15. Fiscal year 1972 also saw the initi\u00ad ation of what may turn out to be a major curriculum development in the area of political science through a grant to the American Political Science Association for a curriculum development effort at both the ele\u00ad mentary and secondary school levels. Although the major theme will be political science, much material from Table 8 Curriculum and Instruction Development Program Financial Support by Discipline Fiscal Year 1972 Biological sciences IVIathematics Physics Social sciences Inter\u00ad disciplinary sciences IVIulti- discipiinary sciences * Other science Totals Elementary $ -0- $ 49,400 100.0 Includes Resource Personnel Workshops and Administrators' Conferences. 68 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT a variety of social and behavioral science areas will be incorporated. This interdisciplinary spread within the general areas of social and behav\u00ad ioral sciences is also evident in mate\u00ad rial being prepared under two grants to Education Development Center for continuing support of the Exploring Human Nature-Project. The distribution of program funds by discipline in fiscal year 1972, as seen in table 8, shows the emphasis on the social and behavioral sciences. Of the $3.5 million recommended for the usual kinds of activities supported through the Curriculum and Instruc\u00ad tion Development Program, $1.1 mil\u00ad lion or 23 percent was in grants iden\u00ad tified as social science. Science Curriculum Improvement New demands on science require continued improvement in undergrad\u00ad uate science curricula. In fiscal year 1972, initial grants were made in sup\u00ad port of large-scale projects capable of significantly altering the way under\u00ad graduate science is taught. Among these projects were The Experimental Approach in Undergraduate Engi\u00ad neering, at Illinois Institute of Tech\u00ad nology; Computer-Based Teaching Techniques in Undergraduate Science and Engineering Education, at the University of Texas, Austin; and the Biology Core Co-Tie (BIO-COTIE) Program, at Colorado State Univer\u00ad sity. The intent of the IIT project is to completely restructure the undergrad\u00ad uate engineering curriculum. The tra\u00ad ditional classroom lecture approach will be abandoned entirely and re\u00ad placed by a program of project- oriented studies. Problems of a broad scope will be posed to project groups composed of from four to 15 stu\u00ad dents. The factual information needed will be made available in modules developed to -enable and encourage self-instruction. Thus, the faculty members can concentrate on those teaching activities requiring personal interaction with students. At the University of. Texas, Aus\u00ad tin, a concentrated effort will be made to provide computer-based in\u00ad struction on a university-wide basis. Twenty-three individual projects in 18 departments in the colleges of engi\u00ad neering and of arts and sciences are involved, but with the significant -eha-r-a&terist-ie\u2014that-, all--of\u2014these^n\u2014. volvements are to be integrated and correlated with one another. The BIO-COTIE project at Colo\u00ad rado State University is designed to upgrade the sophomore biology offer\u00ad ings of all of the 2-year colleges in the State of Colorado, and to en\u00ad sure that biology graduates of these schools can proceed directly to ad\u00ad vanced work at 4-year schools. To supplement their own course materi\u00ad als, the 13 community colleges in\u00ad volved will be provided with a great deal of supportive instructional mate\u00ad rial, much of it in the form of video\u00ad tapes prepared by both CSU and 2-year college personnel. The focus of interest in this project, like the one at the University of Texas, is the use of specially prepared materials in a widespread and integrated fashion. Advanced Science Education Support for the development of alternative kinds of doctoral-level de\u00ad gree programs began in fiscal year 1970 and continued this year with four grants. One grant will assist the necessary to reduce the degree of un-University of California, Los Ange\u00ad les, in inaugurating a new 5-year pro\u00ad gram leading to a Doctor of Environ\u00ad mental Science and Engineering de\u00ad gree. This program is intended for students with undergraduate degrees in any field of natural science and engineering who wish further educa\u00ad tion\u2014in\u2014the application of-scientific_ and engineering technology to existing and anticipated environmental prob\u00ad lems. Another award went to the Univer\u00ad sity of Illinois at Chicago Circle for a doctoral program to produce college teachers. Based in the biology, chemistry, and mathematics depart\u00ad ments, this program will incorporate various communications methods and education technology in the design of new instructional systems. The University of California, Berke\u00ad ley, with the help of NSF funds, is developing a new Ph.D program in the Graduate School of Public Pohcy. A feature of this program is that in their second year, groups of four or five students join groups of at least three faculty members from different fields in \"syndicates\" to study substan\u00ad tive policy areas such as the technolo\u00ad gy of police service delivery or in\u00ad come maintenance systems. The ulti\u00ad mate objective of this approach is to provide the nation with needed professionals who can furnish policy- u.^:^A Under a grant to Worcester Polytechnic Institute for a program akin to that at Illinois Insti\u00ad tute of Technology to implement a new flexible curriculum, students pursue independent study projects.

Michigan State University received a grant in the Advanced Doctoral- Level Program to provide partial as\u00ad sistance for the development of a 3-year sequence of activities in scien\u00ad tific instrumentation. This sequence is intended to make available to stu\u00ad dents of many science departments an instrumentation minor in their Ph.D programs. A grant to the University of Den\u00ad ver was one of five new projects initi\u00ad ated during 1972 directly concerned with the development or strengthen\u00ad ing of master's-level programs intend\u00ad ed to meet critical needs. The College of Law and the Graduate School of Arts and Science have inaugurated a new Master of Science degree in Law and Society. An innovative feature of the program is the provision for a practice program enabling the stu\u00ad dents to teach law at the high school or college level and also to pursue legal activities in a variety of commu\u00ad nity settings. Three other projects in this category involve a joint M.S. pro\u00ad gram in Engineering and Public Ad\u00ad ministration, at New York University; the development of computer-aided in\u00ad structional materials and time-sharing procedures as part of an M.S. pro\u00ad gram in economics, at Florida Atlan\u00ad tic University; and a new design- oriented M.S. program at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Continuing education at the gradu\u00ad ate level was supported through a grant made to Stanford University to carry out experiments with and to assess television techniques expected to be widely used in the future. Stan\u00ad ford now operates a four-channel In\u00ad structional Television Network with a two-way audio capability between the originating classroom and remote sites in the San Francisco Bay area. Five awards were made in the category of Interdisciplinary Student- Originated Research Training (ISORT). As was the case in fiscal year 1971, all were concerned with environmental or social problems. These projects involved planning for meteorological and pollutant net\u00ad works in Cahfornia, being carried out by a team of three UCLA students; social cybernetics and computer-based communications media by two gradu\u00ad ate students at the University of Illi\u00ad nois; problem-solving in urban play\u00ad grounds by three CUNY students; and population density and social pa\u00ad thology in selected areas in New York City, by a team of Queens College students. The fifth ISORT project was a study at Stanford University on Mass Media Coverage of Environmental Problems, carried out by students in the School of Medicine and the De\u00ad partment of Communication. EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND DEMONSTRATION While the Foundation is unable to support full-scale implementation of new courses and curricula throughout the country, it is prepared to take the intermediate step of establishing mod\u00ad els and demonstration projects in which new materials, techniques, and instructional modes can be tried out and subjected to careful evaluation. In this way, new courses and curricu\u00ad la can be managed and publicized' so that their characteristics and value as teaching and learning mechanisms will be clearly evident. Included also are some of the Foundation's most recently initiated activities, still being operated as \"experiments,\" and to be continued pending more thorough evaluation of their usefulness. Within Experimental Models and Demonstra\u00ad tions are activities targeted at all levels of education. Resource Personnel Workshops and Conferences Resource personnel projects are de\u00ad signed to inform pre-college supervi\u00ad sory and teaching personnel about prospective new curricula. Supervisor Projects include short courses which provide the information necessary for educational decision-makers \u2014 prin\u00adcipals, directors of education, and other school administrators \u2014 to con\u00ad clude whether or not to adopt specific curricula changes for their school sys\u00ad tems. They also give these supervisors the necessary background to support their teachers should these new cur\u00ad ricula be implemented. Other pre- college resource personnel projects in\u00ad clude a course of 3 to 4 weeks' dura\u00ad tion, with some follow-up in the Academic Year Institutes Program discussed later. A major focus of these projects is to provide leadership training for implementing new curri\u00ad cula. Such projects typically bring to\u00ad gether a team consisting of a science educator, a school administrator, and a teacher to take the course, after which they assist their home school district in adopting the curriculum improvements. In addition to funding the distribu\u00ad tion of information about newly de\u00ad veloped courses and curriculum mate\u00ad rials and providing courses on them, NSF supports conferences directed toward planning the cooperative de\u00ad velopment of new courses. At these conferences, scientists, educators, and educational technology experts plan concise materials and curricula that can be fully developed in appropriate teacher-training institutions. Students in pre-service teacher education pro\u00ad grams at these institutions help with the design, development, and testing of these materials. Together, the 20 grants for these administrators' con\u00ad ferences and the 26 grants for the resource personnel projects provide various degrees of background or training for nearly 2,700 participants in fiscal year 1972.

Support, normally provided for a 4-year period with renewal grants on a yearly basis, is offered to institutions which show evidence that changes in\u00ad duced by the projects are likely to persist beyond the period of the grant. During the past year, five supple\u00ad mental grants were made for compre\u00ad hensive projects initiated last year at the University of Notre Dame and San Jose State College (mathemat\u00ad ics) ; the universities of Mississippi and South Dakota (biology and chemistry); and the University of Wyoming (physical sciences). In ad\u00ad dition, three new projects were fund\u00ad ed at the University of Arkansas (mathematics); California State Col\u00ad lege at FuUerton (science); and Vir\u00ad ginia State College (biology and earth sciences). The comprehensive grant awarded to ~th-e- UniveTstty^-f Wyoming pro^ vides an example of the way in which such grants foster a lasting interaction between the teacher training institu\u00ad tion and the teachers in the region it serves. Under the project at Wyo\u00ad ming, a system of \"portal schools\" is being developed throughout that State and in neighboring States, designed to train teachers in newly developed cur\u00ad ricula and materials, and staffed by teachers trained in summer and academic year institutes at the univer\u00ad sity. At present, there are 20 portal schools serving 920 teachers. A Science Teaching Center at the uni\u00ad versity serves as administrative cen\u00ad ter, library, and materials repository for demonstration and developmental work on courses and curricula. In addition, a distinguished professorial chair of science education has been established to enhance the prestige of science education and stress the high priority assigned to it by the univer\u00ad sity. Pre-Service Teacher Education In recent years, the Foundation has stressed improvements in the pre- service training of elementary and secondary school teachers as an economical way to decrease the need for their early retraining. This ap\u00ad proach often requires extensive chan\u00ad ges involving the entire curricula through which all students in the in\u00ad stitution who are preparing to teach science receive their initial training. Its potential is exemplified in a pre- service education project begun some 3 years ago by the Physical Science Group at Newton, Mass., which has SCIENCE EDUCATION 11 produced instructional materials spe\u00ad cially adapted for undergraduates who plan to become teachers of science in secondary schools. Pre-service teacher education clear\u00ad ly involves a coordination of effort between higher education and ele\u00ad mentary and secondary education. The same principle, that of recogniz\u00ad ing seemingly separate elements as actually units of an overall education\u00ad al system, is applied in the program of Cooperative Projects for 2-Year Colleges. In this program, the Foundation supports State or urban consortia of 2-year college science de\u00ad partments cooperating with neighbor\u00ad ing university departments to improve the substance and quality of educa\u00ad tion. As a result, students may ad\u00ad vance more efficiently to study at 4-year colleges and universities. Over 1,000 2-year college science depart\u00ad ments in over 600 2-year colleges have benefited from these grants. Technician Education Development The Technician Education De\u00ad velopment Program, which became operative during fiscal year 1972, is intended to provide a variety of in\u00ad structional models. Ten initial grants have been awarded for projects to strengthen curricula and to estabhsh new opportunities in both 2-year and 4-year colleges. The past year has seen a significant rise in the number of programs being offered by colle\u00ad giate institutions for training techni\u00ad cians and technologists primarily for research. And there are indications that many colleges are making efforts to reach back into local secondary schools to make a career in technolo\u00ad gy more attractive. To encourage ex\u00ad perimentation in this effort, a grant was made to Los Angeles Pierce Col\u00ad lege to develop a program in Com\u00ad puter Electromechanical Technology for interested 11th and 12th grade high school students. The experience gained in cooperative ventures of this sort should provide greater latitude in technical education and an improved relationship among all technical ar\u00ad eas. Student-Originated Studies Still another type of model, one which shows considerable promise of influencing the pattern of student- teacher interaction, is developing in the Student-Originated Studies Pro\u00ad gram. Now in its second year of oper\u00ad ation, this activity provides a large-scale test of the degree to which students are capable and ready to undertake self-instruction through self-designed and self-managed scientific investiga\u00ad tions. In fiscal year 1972, grants awarded to 120 colleges and universi\u00ad ties supported 103 student projects involving more than 1,300 undergrad\u00ad uate college students. In addition to demonstrating stu\u00ad dents' readiness to assume increased responsibility for their own education\u00ad al development, student-originated projects encourage college students to express productively their concern for the environmental and societal well- being of the nation. Some examples of this have been projects on: An economical way to force water into molecules so that waste glass could be formed into a commercially usable insulating material; A cheap and effective way to reduce stream pollution caused by runoff from farm feedlots; and Biological uptake of heavy met\u00ad als in sediments washing down from old mines. Many student-originated projects funded by this program have elicited wide public interest as reflected by their coverage in the news media. State and Urban Systems Two systems grants were made in 1972, a supplemental grant for the Systems Approach to Science Educa\u00ad tion in Delaware to support the sec\u00ad ond year's operation of the Del Mod Project, and an initiating grant for the Oregon System in Mathematics Education. The Del Mod Project, which is a cooperative effort of the University of Delaware, Delaware State College, Delaware Technical and Community Region Table 10 Student-Originated Studies Distribution of Grants Fiscal Year 1972 Discipiine Type Total Number of Grants New England Middle Atlantic .

The Oregon System in Mathematics Education is a coordinated Statewide project dealing with mathematics education in grades K-14, with a strong emphasis on in\u00ad struction at the elementary level. INSTRUCTIONAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTATION Within this area of activity there are two principal lines of attack \u2014 one oriented toward training that will provide to educational personnel in the schools and colleges the back\u00ad ground required to institute or imple\u00ad ment course and curricular changes; the other providing support for imple\u00ad mentation of new courses or curricula in a limited number of institutions, with the intent that these will serve as models for consideration by others. These three groups are conducting projects as part of the Student-Originated Studies Program. (Top) Students at Virginia Polytechnic Institute are establishing space criteria and design criteria that may influence the behavior of pre-school children. (Center) Another VPI group is assessing effects of pollutants on the ecology of a stream. (Bottom) A University of California, Riverside, team is studying the geological, economic, and social implications of earthquakes incident to the San Jacinto fault. Seismic measurements help them give specific fault location data to homeowners, contractors, and highway officials. EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL FOR IMPLEMENTATION Activities within this category take into account the fact that implemen\u00ad tation of new courses and curricula and introduction of new modes of teaching can be effected only in insti\u00ad tutions in which the teaching faculty is already receptive to change. That faculty must also be competent to perform in a way that will ensure viability or at least an objective try- out of new instructional patterns. The intent, therefore, is to provide teach\u00ad ers and other personnel with the knowledge and understanding of new materials and the techniques of their SCIENCE EDUCATION 73 planning and development necessary to achieve this goal. Since the nature of the educational process varies from level to level, there are activities di\u00ad rected at both pre-college and post- secondary personnel. Secondary School Teachers Programs In addition to classroom study in courses designed to meet the needs of participants, the Foundation supports a number of summer and in-service institutes. Some focus on acquainting teachers with new course materials and assisting them in implementing these new materials in their classes. Others assist teachers in developing their own course materials. Many teachers are inadequately prepared to conduct field work with their students, hence, many institutes include field work; some are conduct\u00ad ed entirely in the field. One summer of the Michigan State University 3-summer sequence in biology has been conducted at Gull Lake Biologi\u00ad cal Station. The University of Wis\u00ad consin System has provided a field institute in biology at its Pigeon Lake Biological Field Station and one in \"environmental assessment\" at its Clam Lake Field Station. The Iowa State University Institute in Field Studies in Earth Science has been conducted at Philmont Scout Ranch, Cimarron, N. Mex.; each participant in this institute has been given experi\u00ad ence in practice teaching in the field through planning and his conducting instructional hikes with groups of Scouts. By contrast, the Illinois Insti\u00ad tute of Technology institute in physics has been devoted to the \"inner city\"; its participants have been Chicago in\u00ad ner city teachers. A combined Summer/In-Service Institute for physical science teachers in eastern North Carolina was de\u00ad signed and conducted jointly by Eliza\u00ad beth City State University and East Carolina University. One of the pur\u00ad poses was \"to provide a common goal for two state universities that have been working separately . . . for many years. The fact that the project in\u00ad volves a predominately black school and a predominately white school should help build lines of communica\u00ad tion between students and staff of the two schools.\" The project staff is drawn equally from the two institu\u00ad tions. The close in-service institutes (ISI) involvement in the implementation of new curricula was continued with the fiscal year 1972 program. Particularly noteworthy is the increase in the number of training opportunities allo\u00ad cated to social science. Engineering Concepts Curriculum Project, and In\u00ad termediate Science Curriculum Study materials. The seven Man: A Course of Study projects are to be involved in a national assessment, similar to the 3-year evaluation of earth science institutes undertaken by the Earth Science Curriculum Project at Boul\u00ad der, Colo., during 1968-71. For the social sciences, the estimated distribu\u00ad tion of participant opportunities by discipline was up from last year's 4.2 percent to 9.3 percent, which more closely approximates the 12.6 percent called for by the numbers of social science teachers. In accordance with a pohcy insti\u00ad tuted in fiscal year 1972, Academic Year Institutes (AYI) may have ei\u00ad ther a national or regional orienta\u00ad tion, that is, they may draw partici\u00ad pants from the country at large or from a carefully circumscribed geo\u00ad graphic region such as a metropolitan area, a State, or a group of States. Regardless of the geographical scope selected, AYI participation is intend\u00ad ed for well-trained teachers capable of moving into leaderhsip positions. In fiscal year 1972, seven nationally oriented and 18 regionally oriented projects were awarded. Of the former, one is intended for in-service science supervisors, three for supervi\u00ad sor-trainees, two for resource person\u00ad nel in mathematics, and one for economics education consultants. College Teacher Programs It is through summer institutes and short courses (including the new Chautauqua-type short courses) that the Foundation assists college teach\u00ad ers. An increasing proportion of cur\u00ad rent support by the College Teacher Programs is for projects in interdisci\u00ad plinary areas, environmental controls, curricular innovations, and new ap\u00ad proaches to teaching and learning. These programs are being used more and more to assist teachers in replac\u00ad ing outmoded curricula with major revisions of undergraduate course se\u00ad quences. There is also a noticeable in\u00ad crease in the involvement of social scientists in the use of these programs to prepare teachers for implementing curricular improvements. The insti\u00ad tutes and short courses supported in fiscal year 1972 include such topics as the application of micro-economic theory to public policy problems, the use of computer science in social and behavioral science research, and the apphcations of systems analysis to land use problems. SCHOOL SYSTEM AND COLLEGE IMPLEMENTATION School System and College Imple\u00ad mentation activities are directed toward the support of actual imple\u00ad mentation of change at both pre- college and post-secondary levels \u2014 for the former, indirect support (via colleges and universities) for imple\u00ad mentation of new courses or curricula within a school or school system; for the latter, direct support to colleges and universities for reform of their science education programs. Cooperative College-School Science The Cooperative College-School Science (CCSS) Program assists schools and school systems in attain\u00ad ing substantive improvements in their science and mathematics courses and 74 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT curricula. A planned project of 1 to 3 years seeks to provide the participat\u00ad ing schools with a central core of teachers capable of introducing changes in classrooms involved. The projects supported by the CCSS program reflect the distinctiveness of the coop\u00ad erating school systems and their needs, as well as the strength-of their- commitment to improve their science and mathematics programs. The quahty of projects to strength\u00ad en science education in elementary schools has improved steadily since 1967. The number of proposals has increased from 111 to 479; the num\u00ad ber of projects serving elementary teachers alone has increased from 12 out of 56 (or 21 percent) to 69 out of 143 (or 48 percent), a trend the Foundation is seeking to encourage. Additional projects are training both elementary and secondary teachers. In the past 3 years, the CCSS pro\u00ad gram has supported 165 projects in\u00ad volving 8,768 participants in elemen\u00ad tary curricula developed under Foundation grants: Science \u2014 A Process Approach (SAPA); Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS); Elementary Science Study (ESS); and Man: A Course of Study (MACOS). Since 1968, a considerable number of proposals have been received to improve science and mathematics edu\u00ad cation for the disadvantaged. Several of these proposals have been sup\u00ad ported. Two such projects in 1972 have the primary objective of provid\u00ad ing educationally and culturally disad\u00ad vantaged junior or senior high school students with positive educational ex\u00ad periences which stress achievement and minimize failure. A basic assump\u00ad tion in each program is that poor motivation is a significant cause of low achievement by the culturally disadvantaged, that success in a high status subject will raise a student's self-image. One project at Purdue University involves development of audio-tutorial methods for implemen\u00ad tation by 30 science teachers in the high schools of Gary, Ind. A second project at Southern Methodist Uni\u00ad versity is training high school teachers and students from inner city schools in Dallas, Tex., in computer program\u00ad ming and data processing. The pri\u00ad mary objectives are to improve the self- image of the students in a depressed area containing large percentages of minorit-ies-and\u2014to\u2014provide\u2014them-with-- employable skills in computer science. A project at Northern Montana Col\u00ad lege will assist in bringing a coordi\u00ad nated activity-centered and inquiry- oriented elementary science curricu\u00ad lum to schools serving Montana Indi\u00ad an children. A unique project involves a grant to the Jericho Public School System, Jericho, N.Y., to assist in the imple\u00ad mentation of the Science Curriculum Improvement Study program in grades K-6. The project is among a small number of experimental endeavors in the program to explore a variety of approaches to school system improve\u00ad ment. The commitment by the school system is extraordinarily strong. Every teacher in the system will be trained in one year, and a viable leadership cadre will be developed to sustain the pro\u00ad gram. The amount of Foundation sup\u00ad port is a small fraction of the normal expenditure for such a project. College Science Improvement In fiscal year 1972, the College Science Improvement Program initi\u00ad ated the development of what may be the most innovative institutional mod\u00ad el yet supported. Worcester Polytech\u00ad nic Institute is developing an entirely new organization of its undergraduate instructional program. The project will involve the use of individually prescribed instruction in all courses; a computerized catalog of individual\u00ad ized student research projects, includ\u00ad ing many with the cooperation of off-campus agencies; and a new com\u00ad prehensive evaluation system for the certification of students for degrees. This project represents a significant departure from the usual pattern of support signaling a continuing move in the program toward phase-out of implementation support and increas\u00ad ing emphasis on developing nontradi- tional patterns of education. Typical also of this transition is a project at Bakersfield State College to develop a model institution for the California -State College system, based \"on the construction of \"learning villages.\" Such villages use faculty in new roles (primarily as resource persons to en\u00ad able more meaningful interaction be\u00ad tween \"students and teaching\") and employ modular units of instruction (typically in the audio-tutorial format) by the students themselves. Another section of the College Science Improvement Program was initiated to accelerate the development of the science capabilities of predom\u00ad inately undergraduate minority insti\u00ad tutions. Catch Up and Keep Up is the prevailing theme of the institutional developments supported by this section of the program. Changes in what is being taught as reflected by local curriculum revision, renovation of ex\u00ad isting facilities, and acquisition of instructional equipment are the major elements in the plans currently being implemented. Fourteen institutions have been supported thus far involving both natural science and social science departments. Instructional Scientific Equipment The Instructional Scientific Equip\u00ad ment Program encourages implemen\u00ad tation of course and curriculum improvements by providing necessary equipment. The program received 1,- 529 proposals in fiscal year 1972 in\u00ad volving requested funds roughly five times the amount available for alloca\u00ad tion. Nevertheless, it continues to reach a broad spectrum of institu\u00ad tions; for many, including a substan\u00ad tial number of 2-year colleges, this experience for a small fraction of the program provides the only direct of science talent by providing special contact with the Foundation. SCIENCE EDUCATION 15 TALENTED STUDENTS Although today there is no serious shortage of scientific manpower gen\u00ad erally, it is quite possible that a few years from now (the period beyond which projections of manpower needs may be quite inaccurate) the situation may be quite different. Through the Talented Student Program, NSF sup\u00ad ports steps to identify talented science- oriented, young people currently in college and in high school and moti\u00ad vate them to remain committed to careers in science. The program has as its primary objective the conservation of science talent by providing special experience for a small fraction of the nation's highly talented science-ori\u00ad ented students. A second objective of almost equal importance is that of en\u00ad couraging schools and colleges to alter their \"regular\" science programs to in\u00ad clude more activities that give stu\u00ad dents an opportunity for choice, that lead them into problem-oriented study, and that place upon them more re\u00ad sponsibility for their own learning. Student Science Training The Student Science Training Pro\u00ad gram (SSTP) is designed to provide academically talented secondary school students with educational ex\u00ad periences in science and mathematics beyond those available in high school or early college courses. It also brings outstanding students into direct con\u00ad tact with college teachers and research scientists of recognized competence. Over the past several years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of proposals received in the program, but the support level has remained at about $2 million during this period, approximately the same as in previous years. One hundred and twenty-four proposals were supported this year at the funding level of $1.9 million for 4,300 students. Two gen\u00ad eral types of projects continue to be supported in this program: (1) Special Advanced Courses designed to give the student a unique experience in science and associated laboratory work which may include open-ended projects or laboratory assignments; and (2) Research Participation involving the student as a junior associate of a research team or as principal investigator on a problem of appro\u00ad priate difficulty under the direct su\u00ad pervision of an experienced research scientist. In 1972, the number of projects supported which were designed espe\u00ad cially for students with limited educa\u00ad tional opportunities increased from 25 percent to 38 percent of the total grants. Students in this category have demonstrated high potential, but come from secondary schools in which training is inadequate; these students may be located in inner city or in isolated rural areas and may belong to minority groups as well as to other segments of the educationally disadvantaged population. While all projects receive economically disad\u00ad vantaged students of high ability, in 1972 eight were especially designed to meet the needs of these students. Undergraduate Research Participation Since 1959, the Foundation has been instrumental through the Under\u00ad graduate Research Participation Pro\u00ad gram in providing valid research ex\u00ad perience to approximately 63,200 un\u00ad dergraduate students. In 1972, the program introduced some changes to broaden student participation; Ph.D.- granting departments were required to select at least 40 percent of their par\u00ad ticipants from smaller, neighboring institutions. The program seeks to implant the research participation concept in in\u00ad stitutions where it is not yet a regular part of the curriculum and to provide faculty members with the opportunity to exploit the potential for enhancing teaching effectiveness by placing ma\u00ad jor responsibility for learning upon the student. In 1972, grants were awarded to 208 institutions to support a total of 2,63 5 college students throughout the country. GRADUATE STUDENT SUPPORT FELLOWSHIPS AND TRAINEESHIPS NSF's direct support of individuals through fellowships and traineeships which in prior years included young postdoctoral, college faculty, and ad\u00ad vanced scholars, centered on the graduate student in 1972. For the first time, 3-year awards were made in the graduate fellowship program. Previously, 2-year fellow\u00ad ships were offered to new applicants, with the option to apply for one or more years of additional support as needed. The new awards permit an individual, after completing the first year of tenure, to utilize the remain\u00ad ing 2 years over the following 4 years. Thus, for example, fellows may now interrupt their formal training for meaningful work experiences in industry and, on returning to graduate school, modify their academic pro\u00ad grams to accommodate newly discov\u00ad ered, specific career objectives. Of the 1,5 50 graduate fellowships offered in this year's competition, 5 50 are for 3 years; the remaining 1,000 awards represent second- and third- year fellowships for prior-year awardees. NSF graduate fellows are selected on the basis of ability in national competition. Nevertheless, the dis\u00ad tribution of awards by field of study closely parallels apphcant interest, and this has undergone some shifting over the 21-year history of the pro\u00ad gram. Most notable is the decreasing proportion of awards in the physical sciences, principally chemistry and physics, accompanied by a significant\u00ad ly increased share of fellowships for the social sciences, especially since 1964 when full coverage of these fields was achieved. The phase-out of traineeships continued this year. The 1,808 awards made to 224 universi\u00ad ties represented only commitments from prior years; fiscal year 1973 will 76 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT Percent PERCENT DISTRIBUTION OF NSF GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS BY FIELD OF STUDY FISCAL YEARS 1952-1972 (4-YEAR INTERVALS) 45 40 w 30 25 20 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \\ ^PHYSICAL SCIENCES /LIFE SCIENCES MATHEMATICAL SCIENCESs - - ,\u00bb\u00ab'\" ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES :i1:960 ?:T9681; mark the final year of such commit\u00ad ments. The last new awards were made in fiscal year 1970. PRESIDENTIAL INTERNSHIPS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING The Presidential Internship pro\u00ad gram was developed by the Founda\u00ad tion in September 1971 at the request of the Office of Science and Technol\u00ad ogy. Funds made available ($4 mil\u00ad lion) from the Department of Labor permitted the allocation of 570 in\u00ad ternships to 81 federally funded R&D laboratories. Unemployed scientists or engineers holding a master's degree or higher and whose qualifications and promise were deemed by the recruit\u00ad ing laboratory to be clearly superior were assigned to internship activities which would facilitate their transition to future jobs needed by society. Of the stipend offered the interns, $7,000 is furnished by the Foundation and the remainder is from matching funds supphed by the laboratory. These 1 -year appointments are nonrenewable. A profile of appointments based on information from 262 interns in 46 installations shows that 50 percent of the interns hold a doctorate; 93 percent are male; 18 percent are veterans; and 66 percent were unem\u00ad ployed at the time of their appoint\u00ad ments and the remainder were un\u00ad deremployed, temporarily employed, or students. SCIENCE RESOURCES AND POLICY STUDIES The overall objective of the Foundation's programs in science resources and policy studies is the development of the factual and an\u00ad alytical basis for national planning and policy formulation in the area of science and technology resources. The program encompasses the two closely related activities of analysis and data collection related to science and tech- -nology\u2014issues; \"The^information' de\u00ad veloped through these studies is used in arriving at decisions concerning the NSF and national science efforts. Staff studies and analyses are supplemented with a program of grants and con\u00ad tracts conducted mainly with univer\u00ad sities, other nonprofit organizations, and other Government agencies. SCIENCE RESOURCES STUDIES Science resources studies of general interest appear as NSF publications available at the Foundation or through the Government Printing Office. Appendix E Hsts those released in fiscal year 1972. The completed and ongoing studies described in the following section provide a brief sam\u00ad pling of the study activities conducted in this program. Manpower manpower Characteristics System. The development of an alternative system to the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel was undertaken during the year in order that necessary information on the nation's science manpower would continue to be available. After con\u00ad sideration of a number of alterna\u00ad tives, in terms of coverage of popula\u00ad tion, capabihty to supply needed data, feasibility of development, and pos\u00ad sible costs, the Manpower Character\u00ad istics System was chosen. This system will provide information which is rep\u00ad resentative of a defined population, will produce the essential data ele\u00ad ments required by policy-makers, and is estimated to entail costs which are less than its predecessor. SCIENCE EDUCATION 77 The Manpower Characteristics Sys\u00ad tem includes three major subsystems: a Comprehensive Doctorate Roster, based on existing National Academy of Sciences efforts; periodic surveys of an augmented sample of scientists and engineers, similar to the sample used for the 1972 Postcensal Survey; and a series of surveys of nondoctorate en\u00ad trants to science and engineering. This last subsystem will be based on sam\u00ad ples drawn from existing cohorts of college students now maintained by the American Council on Educa\u00ad tion. Postcensal Manpower Survey. Late in fiscal year 1972, the Census Bu\u00ad reau, under NSF sponsorship, con\u00ad ducted a survey of a representative sample of 100,000 persons classified in the 1970 census as being in scien\u00ad tific, engineering, and technical occu\u00ad pations, or as having a college educa\u00ad tion. This project provided a once-in- ten-years opportunity to obtain na\u00ad tional benchmark data for scientific and technical personnel by functional activities, types of employment, sal\u00ad aries, formal education, supplemen\u00ad tary training, mobility, and their in\u00ad terrelationships, for a large sample. Research, Development, and Academic Science Federal R&D Funding. The Foun\u00ad dation report National Patterns of R&D Resources, 1953-72 estimated total U.S. expenditures for research and development in 1972 at $28 bil\u00ad lion. This report also indicates that the number of scientists and engineers engaged in research and development declined in 1971 to 519,000 from the peak employment level of 5 59,000 in 1969. Most of this 40,000 reduction occurred in industry as a result of lower Government funding in the space and national defense areas, al\u00ad though miscellaneous nonprofit insti\u00ad tutions and Government staff were also lower. A more detailed report on Federal financing of research and develop\u00ad ment, which accounts for approx\u00ad imately 5 5 percent of total research and development, appears in the NSF report Federal Funds for Research, Development, and Other Scientific Activities, Volume XX. Federal R&D funding now is turning upward, after a period of decline that began in 1968. Academic Research Price Index. The increasing cost of academic re\u00ad search is of major concern to both the universities performing research and the sponsors of such research, notably the Federal agencies. In the absence of price indexes directly ap\u00ad plicable to academic research and de\u00ad velopment, administrators must de\u00ad pend upon more general indicators such as indexes of wholesale prices, consumer prices, GNP deflators, or professional salaries to estimate the extent of inflation in academic research expenditures. A staff study has sought to improve such estimates by develop\u00ad ing an experimental price index of costs associated with such expenditures. The index so developed shows a con\u00adsiderably sharper rise in academic re\u00ad search costs than that estimated from the more conventional indexes. Higher Education Panel. A new system was established to obtain rap\u00ad idly, from a sample of universities and colleges, information needed for policy and planning purposes. NSF, with the co-sponsorship of the Na\u00ad tional Institutes of Health and the Office of Education, contracted with ithe American Council on Education to operate a fast response system known as the Higher Educational Panel (HEP). Among the surveys completed during the year were the following: Changes in Graduate Programs. A panel of institutions granting advanced degrees reported on the addition or elimination of gradu\u00ad ate programs since 1970 and further modifications planned through 1974. Only about half as many new doctoral and mas\u00ad ter's degree programs in science 78 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT and engineering are planned for the 1972-74 period as were added in 1970-72. Field Enrollment of Junior- Year Students (1970-71 and 1971-72). During January 1972, sample institutions were re\u00ad quested to report junior-year en\u00ad rollments for fall 1970 and fair 1971 in certain designated fields. This information provides pre\u00ad liminary indications of career choice at the bachelor level. Sur\u00ad vey findings indicate that engi\u00ad neering and the physical sciences generally suffered declines in junior-year majors, while the hfe and social sciences experienced increases between 1970 and 1971. Graduate Student Enrollments. A timely report on graduate student en\u00ad rollment in doctorate-granting institu\u00ad tions reported that first-year, full-time graduate science enrollment decreased 5 percent between 1970 and 1971 after declining 2 percent the previous year. Other major findings of the re\u00ad port included: The \"top 20\" graduate institu\u00ad tions experienced reductions in first-year, full-time enrollment at an above average rate \u2014 8 per\u00ad cent. Virtually all areas of science experienced~feductions~~in enroU- ment. The number of full-time gradu\u00ad ate students supported primarily by fellowships and traineeships dechned nearly 10 percent from 1970 to 1971. The proportion of full-time graduate students receiving their primary support from the Feder\u00ad al Government declined from 37 percent in 1969 to 32 percent in 1971. Industry Basic Research in Industry. Late in the fiscal year, an intensive interview survey of industrial research officials was conducted in about 50 major R&D performing companies to identi\u00ad fy the factors responsible for current changes in the nature and level of industrial research. Small Business R&D Conference. In June 1972, the National Science Foundation joined with the Depart\u00ad ment _of Cojtnmerce. and the__ Small Business Administration to sponsor a national conference aimed at explor\u00ad ing the problems of the small R&D firm. Over 300 representatives of small business firms, universities, and Government met for 3 days to discuss such topics as Government Markets, Selling Research and Development to the Federal Government, Managing Financial Growth, and New Opportu\u00ad nities for the Small R&D Firm. The conference recommendations to im\u00ad prove the position of the small R&D firm are now being assessed. Economics of Research and De\u00ad velopment. Following the April 1971 symposium on the relationship of re\u00ad search and development to the econo\u00ad my, several studies seeking to clarify further these relationships have been funded. Among the studies now in process is a university-conducted series dealing with R&D relationships to innovation, marketing, and produc\u00ad tivity in the service industries. A Con\u00ad ference Board study of the extent to which m.ultinational U.S. companies conduct research and development abroad and related implications for this country will be completed in 1973. The National Bureau of Economic Research is investigating and attempting to develop measures of the relative economic returns at\u00ad tributable to'private investment in re\u00ad search and development, to advertis\u00ad ing, and to plant expansion. At the National Planning Association, re\u00ad searchers will examine some conven\u00ad tional production indexes to deter\u00ad mine feasibility of adjusting them in order to take qualitative factors into account. The adjusted indexes, when related to R&D expenditures, may provide further insight into produc\u00ad tivity trends. SCIENCE EDUCATION 79 SCIENCE POLICY STUDIES Activities of COSPUP-COPEP The Foundation has continued sup\u00ad port of the Committee on Science and Pubhc Pohcy (COSPUP) of the National Academy of Sciences in their program to develop priorities for scientific research. Two major reports have been completed and published this year: Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 197O's, which ex\u00ad amines the status of astronomy and develops priorities for research in both earth-based and space-based astron\u00ad omy, and Physics in Perspective. The summary volume of this latter report contains recommendations for policy and program emphasis by both the scientific community and the sponsors of physics and describes a methodology for assigning priorities among various subfields and major programs in physics. The Committee on Public Engi\u00ad neering Policy (COPEP) of the Na\u00ad tional evalu\u00ad ates current and foreseeable develop\u00ad ments in the field of engineering and determines their relevance to the needs of society, as well as providing advice to the Foundation on policy matters to serve as a guide for estab- hshing program priorities. During the past year, the Committee has devoted its efforts to four important areas: environmental impact statements, multidisciplinary problem-oriented re\u00ad search, environmental quality stand\u00ad ards, and technological goals. Committee on Radio Frequencies The Foundation has also provided support to the Committee on Radio Frequencies of the National Academy of Sciences. This committee, which maintains close contact with the In\u00ad ter-Union Commission on Frequency Allocations for Radio Astronomy and Space Science (lUCAF), has proven significant in providing advice for policies for the assignment of radio frequencies and in assisting in planning for the use of the radio frequency spectrum. Other Planning Activities Support was provided for a research team at MIT to conduct a study of possible policy alternatives for science. A major result has been the development of a manpower model for engineers and physicists. This model has successfully fitted historic manpower curves and is capable of being used for predictive purposes. As part of a Government-wide pro\u00ad gram to identify new technological opportunities, the Foundation sup\u00ad ported activities examining the proc\u00ad ess of innovation and looking for specific problem areas or technologies that were ready for exploitation. Evaluation Activities The National Academy of Sciences assisted the NSF with a survey and evaluation of the nature and urgency of needs for equipment, instrumenta\u00ad tion, and facilities in ten science and engineering disciplines. The evaluation showed clearly that there is a pressing need for equipment in the $10,000 to $300,000 price range in university science and engineering research cen\u00ad ters, equipment which, with few ex\u00ad ceptions, would improve the quality and increase the output of research programs in these institutions without requiring additional manpower. Im\u00ad portantly, the needed equipment would frequently make possible the exploration of new and promising lines of research otherwise virtually impossible. Other evaluation activities under way in fiscal year 1972 include a system dynamics study of the doctor\u00ad ate manpower market, to determine the impacts of alternative policies on the future balance between supply and demand of doctoral scientists; and development of a computerized budget model which allocates NSF funds for any specified or proposed budget to a given State, region, or institution, and to scientific disci\u00ad plines. Other studies included develop\u00ad ment of a methodology for the use of citation and publication counts as measures of research productivity and a study of implications of social and technical developments on the supply of and demand for R&D technolo\u00ad gists. In addition, an evaluation of the terminated Science Development Pro\u00ad gram has been initiated to ascertain whether and to what extent the pro\u00ad gram accomplished its objectives and how effectively it aided the recipient institutions. UNIVERSITY SCIENCE PLANNING AND POLICY The Science Policy Research Section of the Division of Social Sciences has some 21 currently active grants whose objectives are to support the field of science policy research and to develop a core capability in the United States for science poHcy studies and training. One such research effort is the Uni\u00ad versity of Illinois project on the So\u00ad cial Implications of Science and Tech\u00ad nology. It is a computer program for analyzing population problems and al\u00ad ternatives. The system, developed by Paul Handler of the University of Illinois, is usable for instruction in demography as well as for policy anal\u00ad ysis and public education in that it enables a person, through a keyboard similar to that of a typewriter, to type out assumptions about demographic variables for a broad range of coun\u00ad tries and time periods and then to 80 NSF 1972 ANNUAL REPORT observe the effects of these assump\u00ad tions, as portrayed on a display screen through graphs, tables, population growth curves, and age pyramids. The system can be operated via long distance telephone, which links the keyboard and screen to the com\u00ad puter program at the University of Illinois, and hasHbeen demonstrated in Washington, D.C, to various groups. With assistance from the Agency for International Development, Pro\u00ad fessor Handler is currently using the system to train groups of population officials from less developed nations concerning the dynamics of popula\u00ad tion for their respective countries. Each official is thereby enabled to experiment with and to perceive the effects of changing the value of vari\u00ad ous demographic variables for his own country. Additional variables and information of use to pohcy-makers are being added to the system, for example, data on the labor force, mi\u00ad gration, and a demand for energy based on a per capita consumption schedule. As the result of the addition of new data, the computer program will be\u00ad come even more useful in that it will enable policy-makers to analyze the effects of alternative rates of popula\u00ad tion growth for a whole range of problem areas such as the environ\u00ad ment and the demand for resources and services. PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE Science and technology continue to be essential to our standard of living and quality of Hfe but are often viewed by the nonscientist as remote from the general public's comprehen\u00ad sion and control. Better public under\u00ad standing of the potential and limita\u00ad tions of science and technology is particularly critical at present, as deci\u00ad sions on those many issues which are profoundly influenced by science and technology \u2014 the environment, ener\u00ad gy, population, etc. \u2014 must ultimate\u00ad ly be made by citizens themselves through the democratic process. The importance of this was stressed by the President in his .1972 Message on Science and Technology when he said: \"As our national hfe is increas\u00ad ingly permeated by science and tech\u00ad nology, it is that public un\u00ad derstanding grow apace.\" The Na\u00ad tional Science Board, in its annual report to Congress in 1972, also made a major recommendation that the National Science Foundation un\u00ad dertake efforts to enhance public understanding of technology and how it differs from science. The Public Understanding of Science Program seeks to encourage meaningful communication between scientists and engineers and the public on the role and substance of science and technology. This involves com\u00ad municating the \"facts\" of science and an understanding of the relationships of science to the society we live in and the use of science and technology in meeting current and emerging soci\u00ad etal problems. In fiscal year 1972, the Foundation made 20 awards amounting to $794,000 for public understanding of science projects. These included books, films, and seminars on science for nonscientists, support for youth- oriented activities and community and regionally based programs. Productive working relationships were also estab\u00ad lished during this period with other groups and organizations interested in furthering public understanding of science including private foundations and professional scientific and techni\u00ad cal societies. Specific projects supported included funding of two television films pro\u00ad duced by the American Institute of Physics \u2014 one film on stellar evolu\u00adtion and the other on the relationships of physics to the biosciences. Both of these films will be shown over the pubhc television stations. Another film project receiving support is the Bat- telle Memorial Institute's production of a 1-hour program on the \"State of Science in the Seventies.\" This pro\u00ad gram is scheduled to be shown over television cluring the 1972-73 season. An award was made to Rockefeller University for the preparation of a book for lay readers on the relation\u00ad ships between basic research and soci\u00ad etal needs. Distinguished scientists will write sections of the book dealing with their own areas of expertise. In addition to support provided in\u00ad dividual projects such as books, films, and exhibits, the program also pro\u00ad vided support to several multipurpose programs in public understanding of science at national, regional, and community levels. The American As\u00ad sociation for the Advancement of Science received support for a num\u00ad ber of specific science activities in\u00ad cluding films and television programs, special publications on scientific and technical topics, seminars for pubhc and civic leaders on scientific issues, and science information services for the media. In what may become a prototype of a new regional-type ac\u00ad tivity, the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, Colum.bia, is conducting a planning study on needs and opportunities in the Midwest for a public understanding of science pro\u00ad gram. The school will also conduct a series of seminars on science and scientific issues for newspaper editors in the region. In California, Sonoma State College has introduced a pilot program designed to bring to the pub\u00ad lic in that region a new awareness of the contributions of science to the solution of regional and local environ\u00ad mental problems. \"Town Hall\" ses\u00ad sions are planned between scientists and civic leaders, and a series of video\u00ad tapes will be produced and shown by local cable television stations to fur\u00ad ther illustrate various environmental concerns facing the region. SCIENCE EDUCATION 81 ^1 A mock public hearing on the issue of land development for recreation culminates a 4-day Seminar on Environmental Arts and Sciences held at Aspen, Colo. Institutional Programs In fiscal year 1972, the Foundation made the final awards under the former program of University Science Development and continued, on a re\u00ad duced scale, its program of Institu\u00ad tional Grants for Science. The admin\u00ad istration of grants made through these two programs was transferred during the year to the Foundation's Gr ants and Contracts Office. UNIVERSITY SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT The President's Science Advisory Committee in 1960 issued a state\u00ad ment (the Seaborg report) urging Federal action to increase the number of excellent university centers of science. The committee hoped that instead of the \"fifteen or twenty [centers of excellence] today, there will be thirty or forty in another fifteen years.\" Since 1964, the Foun\u00ad dation has sought to help reach that goal. In fiscal year 1972, the final grants were made under the Uni\u00ad versity Science Development (USD) Program. In all, 31 universities have received USD awards, and the prog\u00ad ress they have shown gives reason to believe that the hope expressed in the Seaborg report may become actual\u00ad ity- Of the universities that had earlier obtained USD support for the first stage of their science improvement plans, nine had not had an opportuni\u00ad ty to apply for supplemental awards when the program was suspended in fiscal year 1971. In January 1972, however, the Office of Management and Budget released funds specifically for supplemental USD awards to those eligible institutions whose prog\u00ad ress under the initial grants merited further assistance. The following universities received supplemental USD grants for 2 years of further improvement: Carnegie- Mellon, Duke, Florida State, Indiana, Michigan State, New York, Pitts\u00ad burgh, Purdue, and Vanderbilt. The grants, which totaled $9 million. ranged from $300,000 to $1,600,000. In all instances, the awards were for continuing and consolidating the gains made under the initial grants. The universities themselves have con\u00ad tributed substantially to the improve\u00ad ment programs aided by the Founda\u00ad tion; therefore, the nine supplemental awards were designed to ...assist the universities to phase into their own budgets the increased costs incurred during the development process. Through the USD program and the related Departmental Science De\u00ad velopment Program, which was also terminated in fiscal year 1971, the Foundation has granted $230 million to 102 universities in achieving higher levels of quality in education and re\u00ad search in 260 departments or areas of science and engineering. The Founda\u00ad tion believes that this investment will not only ensure a strong academic base for the continued advancement of science but will also provide a much wider national distribution of the opportunities and benefits emana\u00ad ting from good universities. INSTITUTIONAL GRANTS FOR SCIENCE Institutional Grants for Science provide general support for science annually to about one-fourth of the nation's colleges and universities. Each grant is computed by applying a graduated arithmetical formula to the amount of an institution's Federal re\u00ad search support during the preceding year. In fiscal year 1972, the Foundation made 628 institutional grants totaling $12 million. Each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands had one or more institutions receiving grants, all but one of which were under $100,000. The average grant was $19,100\u2014about $3,000 less than in fiscal year 1971, and only a little over half the average of 6 years before. Since the program began in fiscal year 1961, over 1,000 colleges INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS 83 and universities have received institu\u00ad tional grants amounting to $120.4 million. Three-fourths of the fiscal year 1972 institutional grant funds were awarded to universities granting doc\u00ad tor's degrees, about one-sixth to mas\u00ad ter's grantors, and about one-tenth to colleges offering only undergraduate programs. The accompanying figure shows, for the entire span of the pro\u00ad gram from 1961 through 1972, the number of participating institutions in each of these three groups and each group's share of the total amount of institutional grant dollars. Institutional officials decide how the grant funds are to be spent. The methods of determining priorities with respect to the use of institutional grant funds vary considerably among the participating colleges and univer\u00ad sities. There is an increasing tenden\u00ad cy, however, to vest control of the funds in special committees whose primary purpose is to set institutional guidelines and criteria for allocating the funds. Table 11 shows how the recipients of institutional grants have used the funds since the beginning of the pro\u00ad gram through fiscal year 1971. Equipment and supplies (including scientific books and periodicals) ac\u00ad count for half the expenditures \u2014 considerably more than half for insti\u00ad tutions offering only undergraduate programs. Salaries and stipends rep\u00ad resent nearly 30 percent of the expen\u00ad ditures; doctoral-level institutions. many of which have especially used the grants to encourage their younger faculty members to initiate research projects, spend a larger proportion of their funds for faculty salaries than do undergraduate colleges. Most of the facilities expenditures are for renovation of science laboratories or INSTITUTIONAL GRANT AWARDS FOR FISCAL YEARS 1961-1972 Percent of total 100 75 50 25 Number of Institutions Millions of Dollars BACHELOR'S MASTER'S DOCTOR'S Highest Degree Offered Table 11 Uses of Institutional Grant Funds Fiscal Years 1962-71 (Millions of Dollars) A.

Total amount of awards, $93.9 million; total expenditures fiscal years 1962-70,| for relatively inexpensive new con\u00ad struction. The physical sciences have received about one-third of the funds, and the life sciences about one-fifth. Percentage allocations to social sciences and psychology tend to be higher in universities than in colleges where instructional equipment for natural science laboratories had the highest priority. Institutional administrators value the grants highly because the funds are discretionary, flexible, and imme\u00ad diately available. By shifting decision\u00ad making to the campus, the grants provide a means of building up or restoring institutional loyalty among faculty members. They also enable institutions to fill gaps and respond to Opportunities, which may not require large amounts of money but for which only the institutional grant may be at hand. During a time of shrink\u00ad ing revenues for colleges and universi\u00ad ties, institutional grants have fur\u00ad nished a small but important resource for sustaining academic science.
