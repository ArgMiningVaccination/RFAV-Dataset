In fact, they couldn't be more interconnected. Holistic medicine must address both your physical and mental health to ensure optimal wellness, with some conditions reacting almost instantly to changes in your mental and emotional balance. Yggdrasil Naturopathic Medicine in Minnetonka is proud to serve patients from around the twin cities by providing a space for mind-body healing. Our goal is to help you gain awareness of how your body affects your mind and vice versa, so you can be the best you and live your best life. What Is Mind-Body Medicine? In mind-body treatment, we're teammates. The first step in mind-body therapies is developing a sense of self-awareness when it comes to your thought patterns, emotions, habits, and physical symptoms. You have an active role in your treatment and get home exercises to practice what you've learned. The brain is like a muscle thanks to neuroplasticity, and just as you learn negative thought patterns and habits, you can replace them with something much better. Like learning any new skill, this takes practice, persistence, and patience. Above everything else, be kind to yourself. At Yggdrasil Naturopathic Medicine, we believe in the power of improving mental health to create a healthier body. Our mind and body medicine packages leave no stone unturned, with sessions often including breathing techniques, meditation, tai chi, yoga, mindfulness training, insight-oriented counseling, biofeedback, and neurofeedback therapies. Biofeedback is a unique approach, as it teaches you to use your body's signs to monitor and improve your health. You may even be able to gain some control over physical processes conventionally seen as automatic! Mindbody therapy looks past the label of any diagnosis you may have, but you can use your symptoms as a guide. However, Bastyr University lists the following conditions as particularly responsive: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Anxiety - Depression - Asthma, especially if it's stress-induced - Insomnia - Chronic pain - PMS - High blood pressure - Low muscle control Personalized Care at Affordable Prices Yggdrasil Naturopathic Medicine packages mind and body medicine as eight-session sets. This allows for the process of neuroplasticity to take place, where new neural patterns strengthen and harmful, older ones become less noticeable. It also enables you to set up new habits, so these pathways and patterns can continue to get stronger. Additionally, our longer sessions let you take time to fully explore your mind and its relationship with your body. For non-members, a package of eight sessions costs $720, or $90 per appointment. It drops to $480 for Maintain Plan members and $360 for the Active Care Plan.
