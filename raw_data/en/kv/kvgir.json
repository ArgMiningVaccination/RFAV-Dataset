These teas contain beneficial properties that can help to strengthen your immune system and ward off illness. Whether you're worried about flu season, or just want to improve your overall health, many people turn to tea for its medicinal effects. Tea and the immune system Tea is great for your immune system, high in antioxidants, and a great source of hydration. Many types of tea also have antiviral and antibacterial properties that can help to prevent you from getting sick. If you're afraid you've already caught a bug, tea can also help to soothe your body and ease symptoms while you recover. While tea is full of health benefits, it isn't a replacement for professional medical treatment if you think you might be sick. You should always seek the help of a medical professional if you think you're suffering from a serious illness.

Our green teas What is the healthiest kind of tea? Many of our customers who are drawn to tea for its unique health benefits ask us what the healthiest type of tea is. Since different herbal and \"true\" teas contain different medicinal benefits, it's hard to say just what type of tea is best for an individual. Many teas are high in antioxidants, and often contain other beneficial properties, like boosting the immune system, aiding digestion, reducing inflammation, and increasing energy. Herbs like ginger, turmeric, peppermint, and hibiscus are also full of healthful properties. No matter what kind of tea you drink, tea is always going to be a tasty, healthy alternative to coffee, soda, alcoholic beverages, and other drinks. Some studies suggest that green tea may contain even more antioxidants than other types of tea. While green tea is certainly high in antioxidants, we find that the best and \"healthiest\" tea for you is one that you will make often and enjoy drinking. Whether that means green tea, a frothy bowl of matcha, black tea with a little milk and honey, iced tea, herbal tea, or any other kind of tea, you'll be sure to reap the rewards of incorporating tea into your lifestyle. Using tea to boost your immune system A cup of tea can be a great way to boost your body's defenses in order to keep from getting sick. Many types of tea have antiviral, antimicrobial, and immune-boosting properties that can help to keep you in tip-top shape. Tea has been used as a component in herbal medicine for hundreds of years in order to ward off illness and soothe the symptoms of colds and sore throats. That said, tea isn't a replacement for proper medical treatment if you think you might be getting sick. While tea can help to ward off illnesses and soothe symptoms when you're feeling under the weather, you should always check with your doctor and if you're seriously sick. "}
