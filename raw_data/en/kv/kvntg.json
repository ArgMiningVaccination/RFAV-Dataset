This document provides general guidance to help ensure smooth operations at SLVCs and is broken into 4 phases, each with specific considerations: 1. Planning 2. Clinic Set -up 3. Clinic O perations 4. After -Clinic Activities PHASE 1: Planning Identify SLVC leaders for overall vaccination delivery operations. Identify partners to fulfill mass immunization roles in ImmPact. Register your clinics according to guidelines found in the SLVC Toolkit. Develop a communication plan among all clinic partners. Develop clinic process es, including: location, size, # of stations, and staff required , mindful of any state recommendations. Identify staff to fill the positions. Meet the language needs of the community using multi -lingual staff as appropriate. Prepare staff members regarding their roles and responsibilities during clinic operations. Cross -train staff members, if possible, to enable flexibility in meeting needs at various stations as demands fluctuate. If possible, provide additional staff to meet fluctuating clinic demands and schedule breaks for staff. Ensure the presence of an onsite emergency medical kit and supplies. Ensure that emergency procedures are in place to respond to urgent medical problems. 11 Vaccine Clinic Location If you plan to vaccinate a large number of students at one time, it is recommended clinic planners consider holding the clinic in school gyms, auditoriums, or other large covered spaces that can accommodat e a large number of students and staff. If you plan to vaccinate smaller numbers of students in small groups by classroom, it is recommended that you carefully consider the building layout to ensure adequate clinic flow and spacing requirements during dise ase surges. Items such as adequate lighting and heating, functional and accessible restrooms, adequate space for all clinic functions such as screening, registration, vaccine storage, vaccination, and staff breaks are considered. Clinic Notification & Par ental Consent Ensure that adequate vaccine is available for the clinic. Best practices indicate providing consent forms and information packets to parents six to seven days prior to the clinic date and sending reminders to parents to return the consent for ms. Reminders can include mailings to the parents and making personal or automated phone calls. Prior to vaccinating students, staff should review the consent forms to verify that parents have fully completed the forms. Consent forms are available in the School Health Manual, SLVC section of the Maine Department of Education website. Immunizations | Department of Education (maine.gov) PHASE 2: Clinic Set -up Clinic Lay -out and Specifications You may want to adjust your clinic's lay -out based on items identified during the initial clinic planning phase. Spacing must be adjusted during transmission surges per state guidelines. Use signs in multipl e languages, as needed. Provide seating for students and staff if possible. Provide a waiting area where students can be observed after vaccination. See \"Example of Influenza Vaccine Clinic Lay -Out\" on next page. Clinic Security/Safety Use name tags or ID badges to ensure those inside the clinic are authorized to be there, especially if your school will be utilizing outside volunteers to help operate your clinic. Assure that vaccine is stored in a safe and secure location that can be locked and access can be restricted to medical personnel only. Recruit local volunteers as needed to assist with clinic flow. Depending on the time of the clinic (during school or off -hours) you may want to coordinate and collaborate with local community resources. 12 13 PHASE 3 : Clinic Operations Ensure equal access for all students and staff into the clinic. (ADA compliant) Direct arriving students into clinic to expedite vaccine administration. Ensure all students who will be receiving vaccine have completed all forms, inclu ding the consent form and health screen. Based on the results on the health screening process, determine the correct vaccine presentation (multi -dose, pre -filled, nasal mist (for seasonal influenza), etc.) for each student and direct them to the correct va ccination station. Utilize non-medical clinic staff as supply runners to assist in the clinic supply management process. Maintain a steady flow of students through the clinic so that vaccinators are never without a client at their stations; redirect studen ts to other stations if bottlenecks occur. PHASE 4: After -Clinic Activities After -clinic activities need to be part of the initial planning process. Step 1: Close the vaccine clinic o Clear all the students for the vaccination area prior to closing o Post clear signage indicating that the site is closed o Assign staff for breakdown of site o Catalog and re stock consumable supplies o Collect and dispose of trash properly o Bag and properly dispose of medical waste (sharps containers) Step 2: Clean -up o Follow you r school 's policy regarding post -event clean -up Step 3: Report doses administered o At the conclusion of the vaccine clinic, report clinic information to Clinic Authority and to Maine CDC, as required by the Maine Immunization Program. o Doses administered mus t be entered into ImmPact as soon as possible , but no longer than five days, after the completion of SLVC. Delays in doses administered reporting can have multiple effects : Results in delayed billing and reimbursement for vaccine Inability of the person's healthcare provider to view up -to-date vaccination history, which may lead to double vaccination of the patient. 14 SLVC TIMELINE -SCHOOL WORKING WITHOUT A PARTNER (INDEPENDENT) *This is a suggested timeframe for annual clinic planning.

School Nurse/Partner Partner 23 Insert your School Identifier Here Model Plan for Standing Order for School -Located Vaccine Clinics The following order provides direction to be followed at mass immunization clinics designated as School -Located Vaccine Clinics (SLVCs). 1. The school staff may work in coordination with other entities to order vaccine, manage inventory and/or administer vaccine at the school immunization clinics. 2. The school staff will use the Vaccine Health Screen and Permission Form (found in SLVC Toolkit) provided by the Maine Immunization Program to obta in relevant health history for the purpose of determining possible contraindications to receiving vaccine. 3. Vaccine clinic staff will screen for moderate or severe illness (including fever > 100) in clients. Persons who are moderately or severely ill shou ld usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If the client is ill, they should be directed to another SLVC for vaccination or to their healthcare provider. Persons with mild illness can usually get the vaccine. 4. An emergency plan must b e in place in the event of anaphylaxis or symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity following administration of the vaccine. (See Part 4 of the SLVC Toolkit ). Prior to the clinic, clinic staff shall be familiar with the emergency procedures for anaphylaxi s and the administration of Epinephrine and Benadryl . Note: An Emergency Kit containing the following items must be at the clinic site: Aqueous epinephrine EpiPen). If epinephrine autoinjectors are to be stocked, both junior dose (0.15 mg) and adult dose (0.30 mg) should be available. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) oral (12.5 mg/5 mL suspension) and 25 or 50 mg capsules or tablets. Syringes: 1 -3 cc, 22 -25g 1\", needles for epinephrine and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Pediatric and adult airways (small, medium, and large).

Wrist watch Tourniquet Cell phone or access to an on -site phone Ref: Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine -Preventable Diseases, 1 2th Edition; U.S. DHHS, CDC; May 2012, Appendix D-19 5. There must be a second responsible person present at each clinic site while vaccine is being administered in order to activate the Emergency Medical Services if necessary. The second person may be fro m a program other than the school. 6. There shall be no pre -filling of syringes at clinics if using multi -dose vials. All doses of vaccine and emergency medication shall be drawn up at the time of administration. 7. During the clinic, if the vaccine is stored in a transport co ntainer/cooler, the insulating barrier must be left in place between the vaccine and the refrigerated/frozen packs, and cold chain must be maintained. 8. During the clinic, cooler temperatures will be checked at least hourly to ensur e that the cold chain is not broken. If the temperature range is out of the acceptable CDC ranges for storage of vaccine ( 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) the following action must be taken immediately: a. Label the vaccine that it has been stored out of temperature range. b. Notify the vaccine provider. c. Notify the manufacturer of the product for instructions in handling the vaccine . d. Notify the Maine Immunization Program (287 -9972 ) if vaccine comes from the Maine Immunization Program. 9.

Background VAERS, administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC), is a safety surveillance program that collects information about adverse events (pos sible side effects) that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed for use in the US. Each report provides valuable information that is added to the VAERS database that supplies the information needed for evaluation of vaccine safety. Anyone can file a VAERS report; including health care providers, vaccine recipients and parents or guardians. Vaccine recipients and parents/guardians should consult their health care provider if they suspect an adverse event associated with the vaccine. FDA and CDC do not provide individual medical treatment, advice or diagnosis. What can be reported to VAERS? Report any clinically significant medical event that occurs after vaccination, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires health care providers to report any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to receive additional doses of the vaccine and any adverse event listed in the \"VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination\" that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. For influenza this includes events described in manufacturer's package insert as contraindications to additional doses of vaccine (interval - see package insert). How to report to VAERS: 30 Anyone may report but preferably the SLVC Vaccinator or Clinic Authority should complete the VAERS report if the eve nt occurs in the SLVC setting.

Purpose: To define allergic hypersensitivity to drugs administered by parenteral route as well as the emergency management that is to be provided by the School Vaccine Provider. II. Policy: A plan for contacting emergency medical services that are available in the area shall be established prior to starting any clinic. The plan shall include local emergency telephone numbers. Recipients of medication, vaccine, or biologicals administered by parenteral route shall be requested to remain on site for a minimum of 15 minutes for sign of hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction. Symptoms of anaphylaxis usually begin within 15 minu tes after administration of the drug, and intervention should be implemented immediately. A school vaccine provider shall remain on site for 15 minutes after each drug is administered. Individuals with symptoms categorized as mild may only require close monitoring on site with notice to their health care provider. Individuals with symptoms that progress shall require intervention including the administration of epinephrine. (See SLVC Toolkit, Model Plan: Administration of Epinephrine Plan: Administration of Epinephrine and Benadryl NOTE: The signs and symptoms of anaphylactic are: hypotension, respiratory distress such as laryngeal edema, dyspnea, wheezing, a sense of retrosternal pressure or tightness, rapid and/or irregular pulse, urticarial, loss of consciousness, agitation, faintness, burning and/or itching eyes, tearing, congestion and itching nose, rhinitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushed skin, general itching, non -prur itic swelling of extremiti es as well as the face and perioral or periorbital regions, and/or a sense of uneasiness. After an injection of medication and/or vaccine it is determined that the individual has symptoms categorized as mild, the client may only require close monitoring on site with notice to their health care provider. Using clinical judgment, when the individual's symptoms progress to those of anaphylactic shock, School Vaccine Providers shall initiate the emergency procedure for the administration of Epinep hrine and Benadryl.

MMWR 2005;54(RR09);1 -17 40 Model an: Prevention of Post -Immunization Syncope -Related Injuries Syncope, also called fainting, is a temporary loss of consciousness resulting from decreased blood flow to the brain. Immunization providers should be aware of the potential for syncope associa ted with vaccination, particularly among adolescents. Syncope after vaccination itself is usually not a serious event, and patients generally recover within a few minutes. The main concern is injury, especially head injury. Vaccine clinic staff should take appropriate measures to prevent syncope and to readily respond to the client/student who feels faint. Steps to Prevent Syncope -Related Injuries Make sure the patient is either seated or lying down at the time of vaccination. Observe patients for 15 minutes after vaccination for signs and symptoms that commonly precede syncope, such as weakness, dizziness, light -headedness, nausea, sweatiness, coldness of the hands or feet, paleness or visual disturbances. If client/student is experiencing possible si gns or symptoms of fainting, take the following steps to prevent syncope and injury from falling: o Have the patient sit or lie down immediately. o Have the patient lie flat or sit with head between knees for several minutes. o Loosen any tight clothing and main tain an open airway. o Apply cool, damp cloths to the patient's face and neck. o Observe the patient until symptoms completely resolve. If client/student falls but does not experience loss of consciousness: o Check the patient to determine if injury is present b efore attempting to move him/her. o Place the patient flat on back with feet elevated. o Observe the patient until symptoms completely resolve. If client/student loses consciousness: o Check the patient to determine if injury is present before attempting to move him/her. o Place the patient flat on back with feet elevated. 41 o Maintain an open airway. o Call 911 if the patient does not recover immediately.

No food or beverage can be stored in them. 1. One school nurse and a backup person shall be assigned the responsibility for the proper storage and handling of vaccines kept in school offices. 2. Each location that stores vaccine shall have a working refrigerator and a certified calibrated digital data logger suitab le for checking internal temperatures of the refrigerator. The refrigerator compartment must maintain temperatures between 36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) for vaccine viability. The refrigerator temperature should be set at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). The freezer compartment must maintain temperatures between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F ( -50\u00b0C and - 15\u00b0C) for vaccine viability. 3. Refrigerator temperature should be maintained between 3 6\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 F. Freezer temperature should be maintained between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F . The temperature of the refrige rator must be checked and documented at the beginning of each workday . The min and max temperatures sh all be recorded on the log sheets with the time and initials of the person checking the temperature. This should be placed on or near the refrigerator as well as documented in ImmPact . Each log shall be maintained by the school for three years and then destroyed. 4. Upon arrival of the vaccine, the designated school nurse or backup person shall immediately inspect the vaccines and temperature strip or other temperature reading device unpack the vaccines and place them in the refrigerator or freezer as appropriate. The lot number and 44 quantity received should be verified and match what is listed in ImmPact and on the packing list. The vaccines shall be stored i nside the refrigerator and never placed on the door shelves (there is too much temperature variation when the door is open). The vaccines shall be placed so that the cool air can circulate around the vaccines. The newest vaccine shall be placed behind any of the same type of vaccine that has an earlier expiration date. 5. The vaccines shall be written into the vaccine record book and added to the supply on hand so that the count in the record book matches the count in the refrigerator. Log into ImmPact and a ccept vaccine transfer. Records shall be retained in the office for three years and then destroyed. 6. The school nurse shall rotate the vaccines monthly so that the ones with the earliest expiration dates are placed in the front of the refrigerator and used first. (This is called stock rotation) 7. Ice packs shall be placed inside the freezer to help maintain the temperature when the door is opened. 8. Bottles of cold water shall be placed to line the inside walls of the refrigerator and on the door shelves to maintain the internal temperature of the refrigerator when the door is opened. 9. The School Nurse shall place a \"Do Not Disconnect\" sign on each refrigerator and circuit breaker , as well as sign on or near all outlets where units are plu gged in that are visible . The electrical connection shall be protected from accidental disconnect by either a protected location or protective plug cover. 10. If the temperature of the refrigerator or freezer is measuring above or below the allowable temperat ures listed above , the school nurse discovering a refrigerator or freezer out of temperature range shall: Label the unit \"DO NOT USE ,\" store vaccines in a unit where they can be kept under appropriate conditions and generate a report from the data logger for discussion with the vaccine manufacturer. Contact the vaccine manufacturer to obtain documentation for the viability of the vaccine. Contact the Maine Immunization Program, if obtained from the Maine Immunization Program. 45 Document all steps taken on temperature recording paper log and in ImmPact. 11. In the event of an extended power outage the school nurse shall follow the procedure for extended power outages . 12. For further instructions for storing frozen vaccine, please reference the link below, pages 33-35: https://www. maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious -disease/immunization/documents/MIP - Policies -and-Procedures.pdf 46 School -based Vaccine Clinic Checklist for Safe Vaccine Handling and Storage Here are the 17 most important things you should do to safeguard your vaccine supply. Are you doing them all? ___ 1. We have a school nurse or a designated person in charge of the handling and storage of our vaccines. ___ 2.

We post a sign on the refrigera tor door showing which vaccines should be stored in the refrigerator and which should be stored in the freezer. ____10. We always keep a certified calibrated thermometer in the refrigerator that can record temperatures at 3 6-46\u00b0F and -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F in the freezer. ____11. The temperature in the refrigerator is maintained at 3 6-46\u00baF. The temperature in the freezer is maintained at -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F. ____12. We use bottles of cold water to line the inside walls of the refrigerator to help maintain cold temperatures. ____13. We post a temperature log on the refrigerator door on which we record the refrigerator minimum and maximum temperature once a day \u2014first thing in the morning and we know whom to call if the temperature goes out of range. ____14. We understand that these temperature logs must be submitted to the Maine CDC Immunization Program at least monthly with copies maintained by the schoo l for three years. ____15. We have a \"Do Not Unplug\" sign next to the refrigerator's electrical outlet. ____16. In the event of a refrigerator failure, we take the following steps: ______ We call the manufacturer immediately. ______ We notify the Maine CDC Immunization Program. ______ We label the vaccine stating that it has been stored out of range and not to use the vaccine until given the guidance to use from the manufacturer. (this vaccine should be kept in a cold storage unit) ____17. We keep important phone numbers posted where they are easily accessible includin g contact information for vaccine manufacturers . 47 Transportation of Vaccine Rationale : The best assurance of vaccine efficacy is to minimize the number of times vaccines are handled and transported. If vaccine transportation to another location is required, it is critical that the potency is protected by always maintaining the cold chain . It is essential that refrigerated vaccine shall be maintained at 3 6 - 46 degrees Fahrenheit during transportation. Instructions for all transported vaccine: 1. The school vaccine provider shall pack the vaccine in the appropriately sized cooler the day of the clinic according to quantity guidelines outlined below. The vaccine should remain in their original boxes when transported to the home or clinic site. 2. The school vaccine provider shall attach a label to the outside of the container to clearly identify the contents as fragile vaccines. 3. The certified calibrated thermometer shall be fixed to the outside of the cooler by velcro and used for all temperature readings. 4. The school vaccine p rovider shall record the time and temperature inside the cooler on the Vaccine Transport Temperature Log . 5. The school vaccine provider shall check the temperature at least hourly to ensure that the cold chain is not broken. Record the time and temperature on the Vaccine Transport Temperature Log. Do not open the cooler for hourly temperature readings . Retain these records for three years and then destroy. 6. If the t emperature of the cooler falls outside of the recommended guidelines the school vaccine provider shall take the following actions: Label the Vaccine \"DO NOT USE.\" Contact the vaccine manufacturer to obtain documentation for the viability of the vaccine. Contact the Maine Immunization Program, if obtained from the Maine Immunization Program 207-287-9972. 48 Special Instructions for Refrigerated Vaccine Transport : MIP recommends transporting refrigerated vaccines with a portable refrigeration unit. If this type of unit is not available, a hard -sided insulated cooler with at least 2 -inch walls, a Styrofoam vaccine shipping container, or other qualified container may be used if it maintains the recommended temperature range (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C]) . Using a hard -sided cooler, Styrofoam vaccine shipping container, or other qualified container requires the following: o Coolers should be large enough to hold the MIP supply of refrigerated vaccines. o Label the container with the facility name, \"Fragile Vaccines - Do NOT Freeze\", and the date and time the vaccines was removed from the permanent storage unit. NOT E: Do not use soft -sided collapsible coolers for transporting vaccine. Conditioned frozen water bottles are recommended for keeping vaccines cold. o Use 16.9 oz. bottles for medium/large coolers and 8 oz. bottles for small coolers o Before use, condit ion the frozen water bottles. This is done by placing them in a sink filled with several inches of cool or lukewarm water until there is a layer of water forming near the inner surface of the bottle. The bottle is properly conditioned when the ice block sp ins freely within the bottle when rotated. NOTE : Do not reuse coolant packs from original vaccine shipping containers. Insulating material - two each of the following layers is needed: o Corrugated cardboard - two pieces cut to fit the internal dime nsions of the coolers(s) and placed between the insulating cushioning material and the conditioned water bottles. o Insulating cushioning material such as bubble wrap, packing foam, or Styrofoam for a layer at least 2 -inches thick above and below the vaccines. Ensure this layer covers the cardboard completely. NOTE : Do not use packing peanuts or other loose material that may shift during transport. A data logger with a buffered probe must be used as a temperature monitoring device. o Prepare the probe by pre -chilling it in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours prior to transport. o Ensure the data logger has a current and valid certificate of calibration testing. o Ensure the data logger certificate is documented to be accurate within +/ - 1\u00b0F (+/ - 0.5\u00b0C). o The data logger currently stored in the refrigerator can be used for transport, as long as there is a de vice in place to measure the temperature for any remaining vaccines. 49 MIP recommends the following packing assembly for refrigerated vaccines: Line the bottom of the cooler with a single layer of conditioned water bottles. Place a sheet of corrugat ed cardboard over the water bottles. Place at least a 2 -inch layer of insulating material (i.e., bubble -wrap, packing foam, or Styrofoam) over the cardboard. Stack boxes of vaccines on top of the insulating material. When cooler is halfway full, p lace the data logger buffered probe in the center of the vaccines, but keep the display outside the cooler. Cover vaccines with another 2 -inch layer of insulating material. Add the second layer of corrugated cardboard. Fill the remaining space in the cooler with conditioned water bottles. Close the lid of the cooler securely and attach the data logger display and a temperature log to the top of the lid to record and monitor the temperature during transport. Use the temperature recording form to record the time and temperature inside of the storage unit at the time the vacci nes were removed. If vaccines are kept in a transport container for longer than an hour, record the temperatures hourly. As soon as the destination site is reached, check and record the vaccine temperature. If the vaccine temperature is 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0 F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C), place the vaccine in the refrigerator. If the vaccine is below 36\u00b0F (below 2\u00b0C) or above 46\u00b0F (above 8\u00b0C), label the vaccine as \"Do Not Use\", place in the refrigerator, and immediately contact the vaccine manufacturer to determine viabili ty. NOTE: Always keep vaccine properly stored until otherwise instructed by the vaccine manufacturer or MIP. Special Instructions for Frozen Vaccine Transport : Varicella and MMRV vaccines are fragile and must be kept frozen. For transporting instructions, please reference the following link, pages 46 - 48:https:// www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious -disease/immunization/documents/MIP - Policies -and-Procedures.pdf 50 COVID -19 vaccine storage and handling requirements, transportation instructions, and other information is listed in section 5.5 of the SLVC toolkit. 51 Ordering and Storage of Vaccine FAQ ' s about School -located Vaccine Clinics (SLVC's) What forms do I need to fill out to receive vaccine from the Maine Immunization Program? You will need to contact our Provider Relations Specialist for an enrollment packet and other information at 287 -3746. Do I need to fill out a new provider agreement every calendar year? A provider agreement needs to be renewed at the beginning of every other fiscal year unless there is a change with the me dical director vaccine coordinator or back -up coordinator . Why do I need to fill out all these forms every year just to get influenza vaccine? This is a FEDERAL requirement for any organization that receives vaccine from our program. What are the storage requirements for properly storing vaccine at our school? You can use units like this: Pharmaceutical grade units are recommended . A refr igerator unit with no freezer compartment is not considered dormitory -style and is acceptable for vaccine storage. 52 2. You cannot use a dorm style refrigerator to store vaccine. What are the temperature requirements for storing vaccine? 1. Refrigerated vaccine must be stored between 3 6 \u00b0F and 46 \u00b0F degrees (Example : influenza vaccine) 2. Freezer vaccine must be stored between -58 \u00b0F degrees and +5 \u00b0F degrees (Example : varicella vaccine) How many days of temperatures must I record and submit before I can order vaccine? You must record and submit through the ImmPa ct system five days of within -range temperatures before you will be sent vaccine. Once I receive vaccine how many times a day do I need to check the temperature? You (or your designee) must check and record the minimum and maximum temperature of the vaccine storage unit at the beginning of each work day. You do not have to record the temperature if the school is not open or if you do not have any vaccine. (example: weekends, holidays, school vacation week) School nurses who work part -time in buildings must have designee record temperatures on the days the nurse is not in the building. Do I really need to keep vaccine until it expires in June? Yes, y ou need to keep vaccine until either it expires, or you can transfer it to another provider who may be able to use the vaccine before its expiration date. Contact th e Maine Immunization Program at the end of the school year for further instructions. Please remember that we receive money back even for vaccine that is expired so please do not throw out vaccine. Do I have to complete an educational webinar in order to receive vaccine? Yes, all primary and backup vaccine coordinators must complete an educational webinar. This is a federal requirement. You can access the webinar at https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious -disease/immunization/annual -education - requirement.shtml . You need to complete the Vaccines for Children module and posttest . A refrigerator with a built -in freezer Compartment is considered dormitory -style and is not acceptable for vaccine settings. 53 COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Storage and Handling Resources COVID -19 Vaccine Routine Storage and Handling resources can be found here: COVID -19 Vaccine Providers Portal | St orage and Handling Resources | Disease Surveillance | MeCDC | Maine DHHS Checklist of Current Versions of U.S. COVID -19 Vaccination Guidance and Clinic Support Tools (immunize.org) CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit Checklist for Safe Vaccine Storage and Handling (PDF) COVID -19 Vaccine Transporting/Clinic Storage and H andling COVID -19 Vaccine Transfer Form (PDF) Transport Temperature Log (PDF) Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics He ld at Satellite, Temporary or Off -Site Locations Vaccination Guidance During a Pandemic Transporting Vaccines (PDF) COVID -19 Hourly Clinic Temperature Log (PDF) COVID -19 Vaccine Temperature Logs COVID -19 Refrigerator Temperature Log (PDF) COVID -19 Freezer Temperature Log (PDF) 54 COVID -19 Vaccine Manufacturer Contact Information McKesson Specialty Distributed COVID Vaccine (Any issues with vaccine other than viability, damaged shipment, missing supplies, etc .)
