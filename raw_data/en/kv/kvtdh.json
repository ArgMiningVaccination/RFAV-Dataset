For the most part, this is true.1 However, because of a dubious twist in the development of medication regulation,2 there is one type of over the counter medication that can advertise effectiveness against diseases without scientific proof: ho meopathic medication.3 As it stands, medications labeled as \"homeopathic\" advertise misleading \"health claims\" \u2014assertions that their product has the ability to cure diseases and ease symptoms.4 For example, Hyland's Homeopathic company adver tises that certain products provide \"Safe & Effective Relief of Runny Nose, Nasal Congestion, [and] Sore Throat\"5 or \"Relief of Occasional Sleeplessness, Fussiness, and Irritability\" of babies.6 Unfortunately, none of the claims made by manufacturers of h omeopathic medications need to be scientifically proven in order to be advertised.7 1.

Each has differing standards as to what can and cannot be claimed on medication packaging. There is currently a tension between the FDA's medication regulation and the FTC's goal to protect consumers from false advertising.14 The FTC has authority to bring action against a company engaging in \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices i n or affecting commerce.\"15 Since homeopathic medications can advertise that their product has an effect on the consumer that is not scientifically proven, the claims are not verifiably true.

There is no reason for an antique20 and unscientific form of medicinal practice to be subject to less stringent demands of efficacy and safety. This comment is not suggesting that homeopathic medications be removed from the marketplace en tirely, as homeopathic medicine may very well be effective for some consumers.21 However, if drug manufacturers are, for example, claiming that a medication will definitively reduce cold symptoms, such claims must be adequately and scientifically proven be fore those statements can be advertised.

PART I - THE DISCREPANCY O F LABELING REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES AND TRADITIONAL OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICATION A. Homeopathy In General Homeopathic medicine is a distinct branch of alternative medicine developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700s.22 Homeopathy, contrary to common belief, is not the same as \"natural\" or \"herbal.\"23 Rather, homeopathy is its own medical discipline based on principles developed independently by Hahnemann, and it has remained unchanged over its 200 - plus years of existence.24 The following discussion includes the true and accurate beliefs of homeopathic medicine practitioners with no hyperbole. These principles and beliefs underlie the theory of the effectiveness of the medication sold alongside traditional (and proven) medical remedies. The two main principles of homeopathy are the \"law of similars\" and the \"law of infinitesimals.\"25 The \"law of similars\" is based on the principle of \"like cures like,\" or that age nts that produce a certain symptom can cure that same symptom.26 In other words, \"substances capable of causing disorder in healthy subjects are used as medicines to treat similar patterns of disorder experienced by ill people.\"27 It is from this principle that \"homeopathy\" gets 22.

Homeopathy protects itself from this expectation by implementing their second principle: \"the law of infinitesimals.\" This principle of homeopathy states that the smaller the dose of medication given to a patient, the stronger its effect.30 Hahnemann chose to believe that \"dilution of a substance actually increased its strength and efficacy.\"31 The theory is that with ever increasing dilutions, the drug becomes more effective, as it leaves behind \"a spiritlike essence or imprint that heals the b ody.\"32 All homeopathic medication that exists and is for sale contains substances that have been diluted to various potencies.33 Hahnemann believed that it was impossible to separate \"matter and force,\" and that \"the smallest conceivable part does not ceas e to be some of this substance and cannot possibly become nothing.\"34 Of course, modern molecular chemistry has indisputably refuted this claim. For instance, a popular dilution is 3C, which is one part drug to 1,000,000 parts water.35 It is contended tha t the odds of even having one molecule of active ingredient after a common dilution of 30C (a 1060 dilution) is \"infinitesimal.\"36 In fact, stating that 28.

While traditional medications are required to adhere to statutory requirements defining \"adequate and well -controlled studies,\"44 homeopathic remedies are required to only adhere to standards of proo f found in a publication that they themselves created: the HPUS.45 In fact, the FDA readily admits that \"compliance with requirements of the HPUS . . . does not establish that [the medication] has been shown by appropriate means to be safe, effective, and not misbranded for use.\"46 Effectively, the only institution qualified to comment on the product's effectiveness are the product's creators. The methods of \"provings\" of homeopathic medications use the same principles developed by Hahnemann in the late 170 0s.47 Specifically, negative effects of the drug must be observed on a healthy individual in order to subsequently dilute the substance for treatment of those same symptoms.48 The goal of the \"proving\" is to demonstrate that the substance to be potentially used for treatment causes positive symptoms.49 Once those symptoms have been documented and proven on healthy individuals, the homeopathic practitioner can then dilute the substance to an appropriate dose.50 The diluted medicine is not tested for efficacy.

Determining whether a product has violated FTC regulations is a three -step inquiry: what claims are conveyed in the ad; whether those claims are false, misleading, or unsubstantiated; and whether those claims are material to prospective consumers.63 Currently, all claims made by a product, including products not classified as drugs, must be substantiated with scientific evidence.64 This results in counterintuitive and surprising results in the marketplace. For instance, the FTC is comfortable bringing a ction against a pomegranate juice company because of claims unsubstantiated by scientific evidence,65 but being classified as a \"homeopathic drug\" has meant, thus far, that no sci entific validation was required .66 Especially troubling is the fact that the effectiveness of h omeopathic medication has never been proven.

The \"proving\" does not refer to proving the effectiveness of the remedy; rather, homeopaths prove that a potential remedy creates a negative effect among a heal thy individual.83 \"Provings\" and \"treatments\" are distinguished, where \"provings induce states of ill -health.\"84 Thus, by proving that a substance creates a negative effect, homeopathy teaches that the same substance can be diluted in order to heal that ne gative effect. According to the main principle of homeopathy, the \"reaction provoked by that substance in subtoxic amounts can aid the patient's recovery.\"85 Experiments were performed on the healthy because homeopaths taught that \"a drug that produced sp ecific effects in the provers would be efficacious in diseases with symptoms similar to the effects caused by the drug.\"86 The completed, diluted medicine is never proven to be effective. As long as a substance is \"proven\" to invoke negative reactions amon g a healthy individual, that substance can be included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia. Homeopathic products require double -blind testing among healthy individuals in which symptoms of a particular substance are observed by participants.87 These observati ons are then submitted to a committee on standards of the American Institute of Homeopathy, which determines whether the drug will be included in the United States Homeopathic Pharmacopeia.88 This procedure is a far cry from the rigorous standards applied to traditional medication.

Classifying homeopathic products as dietary supplements would subject them to requirements of scientific validation of any \" indication\" claim.92 An \"indication\" tells the consumer what the drug should be used for. For example, the statement \"temporarily relieves . . . symptoms due to hay fever or other respiratory allergies\" is an indication for use.93 As it stands, homeopathi c products can make such claims without reliable and competent scientific evidence, resulting in consumer confusion as well as a current regulatory conflict between government agencies. B. Regulating Homeopathic Products As Dietary Supplements Will Result In More Effective Regulation The standards for proof of safety and efficacy are different for dietary supplements than for drugs.94 Congress enacted the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994 to clarify that dietary supplements would be regula ted \"similar to food products\" as long as the products did not promote themselves as being drugs.95 Consequently, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation of safety and efficacy before the product can be marketed.96 They must, however, compl y with the truth -in-advertising standards of the FTC.97 90.

A \"health claim\" is where a substance is claimed to be effective against a disease or health - related condition.98 A dietary supplement may not make a \"health claim\" unless that claim is proven through competent scientific evidence.99 Dietary suppleme nts can, however, make \"structure/function\" claims.100 Those claims are as follows: Finally, structure/function claims (1) describe a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease and disclose the prevalence of such disease in the United States , (2) describe the role of a dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, (3) characterize the documented mechanism by which a dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or (4) describe the general well -being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient.101 A structure/function claim requires a disclaimer stating that the claim has not been evaluated by the FDA and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.102 Such a permissible claim, for example, would be that a particular homeopathic product \"improves immune system function.\" A homeopathic product would not be able to, for instance, claim that their product \"cures common cold symptoms\" without scientific p roof. There are concerns and issues with dietary supplement regulation in general.103 For instance, issues have surfaced regarding the problematic definition of a \"dietary supplement\" and the claims made by the manufacturers.104 However, the regulatory lands cape of the DSHEA is perfect for homeopathic products.

Dietary supplements are able to make such health claims only when the FDA \"determines, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence . . . that there is significant scienti fic agreement, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.\"108 Consumers will further continue to be secure in the knowledge that the FDA regulates and confirms that pr oducts making claims can be scientifically backed.

Further, if the FDA finds that the purpose and marketing materials of homeopathic products is meant for the treatment, mitigation, and cure of a disease, then homeopathic products would go back to being classified as \"drugs.\"114 Once a product's claim goes \"beyond risk reduction and purports to treat a disease,\" the FDA can mandate that the product be classified as a drug.115 The FDA has discretion as to how to classify the claims.116 Further, regulation of h omeopathic products as a dietary supplement could restrict the sale of homeopathic medication not ingested in the way of capsules or pills. Homeopathic medications used, for instance, as nasal sprays may be subject to greater scrutiny and regulation due t o the delivery mechanism.117 Because nasal sprays and topical creams are more similar to drugs than simple nutritional supplements, such products may be restricted from sale at all regardless of the types of claims made.118 However, once homeopathic products are classified as dietary supplements, the regulatory landscape would provide benefits to the consumer, benefits to the manufacturers, and would allow the FTC to perform its duties and protect against false advertising. 112. \"[T]he FDA 's current regulatory framework could lead homeopathic drug advertisers to incorrectly assume, or at least argue, that the FTC does not require competen t and reliable scientific evidence to support the advertisers ' efficacy claims. \" FTC Staff Comment, supra note 10, at 7 (2015). 113.

Withdrawing the CPG While Still Classifying Homeopathic Products As \"Drugs\" - Homeopathy's Death Knell The FTC has suggested that one of the solutions to solving the conflict would be to simply withdraw the CPG.119 However, if this were the case, homeopathic drugs would never obtain approval by the FDA and would signal the end of homeopathic medication. The main issue is that homeopathic products would still be classified as \" drugs.\" Drugs are able to \"advertise a beneficial relationship to a disease or health -related condition.\"120 If homeopathic products were classified as drugs, they must pass the same control trials as other drugs. The drug approval process is \"arduous.\"121 The chances of approval of homeopathic products through rigorous scientific testing are slim to none.122 Further, according to the true practice of homeopathy, \"an appropriate remedy is chosen only after detailed documentation of a patient's symptoms and si gns . . . is completed . This 'individualization' would make it extremely difficult to conduct a randomized clinical trial.\"123 Finally, there is dubious scientific evidence that homeopathic medication has any true effectiveness whatsoever.124 The costs of cli nical trials are staggering, and even if homeopathy were truly effective, the sheer cost of the tests would result in an almost insurmountable burden to the industry. A clinical trial can cost more than $100 million.125 With the list of commonly used homeo pathic remedies 119. FTC Staff Comment, supra note 10, at 5. 120. Pearson v. Shalala, 164 F.3d 650, 652 (D.C.

However, if homeopathic manufacturers were given an incentive to perform those studies, it would result in a great benefit to the industry and medicine as a whole. If homeopathy was regulated under the DSHEA, only health claims with scientific backing could be made.128 Thus, manufacturers would be incentivized to prove that their product was clinically effective . B. Why Not Kill Homeopathy? The argument begs to be made of whether homeopathy as an industry deserves to die. One of the main reasons is \"the lack of scientific proof establishing its efficacy,\" which, according to some, renders the entire practice as \"quackery.\"129 According to Kathleen M. Boozang's article Western Medicine Opens the Door to Alternative Medicine , to prescribe homeopathic medications would violate basic medical ethics; physicians must at the very least \"utilize their skills and knowledge to offer patients treatment which they reasonably believe will actually treat the condition from which they suf fer.\"130 Boozang further asserts that even acquiescing to a patient's demand for alternative therapies is against \"traditional ethical principles\" because of a physician's \"affirmative obligation to refuse to provide medical treatment when medicine cannot c ure the disease or improve the patient's condition.\"131 126.

Further, consumers report real benefit from homeopathic medications.132 Alternative medicine is us ually used in conjunction with traditional allopathic cures.133 Consumers should have the option to purchase products that they believe help them. Further, the lack of marketing on the packaging of the products would not dissuade consumers from purchasing homeopathic remedies.134 Finally, over the counter homeopathic medication is only allowed to be sold in the cases of self-limiting and non -serious medical conditions.135 Thus, the option to purchase homeopathic remedies should be left available for consumers . Requiring proof for homeopathic effectiveness would be beneficial for the scientific community as a whole. Some of the ideas behind homeopathy have inspired medicinal progress. The \"provings\" of Hahnemann in the 1800s resulted in, for example, the disc overy of the use of nitroglycerin for the treatment of angina pectoris.136 Although nitroglycerin was not used as a homeopathic remedy, the homeopathic community's observations resulted in the discovery of its use as a legitimate and proven treatment.137 Further, scientific studies on homeopathic medication could result in breakthroughs. For instance, the botanical drugs Fulyzaq and Veregen were approved by the FDA in 2012 and 2006 respectively.138 The regulation of homeopathic medication as a dietary suppleme nt offers adequate protection for consumers from false advertising. Any claim made by homeopathic products that would cause consumer confusion would have to be backed by adequate scientific research.139 As long as consumers are protected from misleading and false advertisements, they should not be restricted as to the choices of treatment available to them.140 132.

His suggestion was threefold: first, to require that homeopathic products \"be clearly labeled and advertised as homeopathic;\" second, to require that the product has not been evaluated by the FDA; and third, to require that over the counter homeopathic ingredients \"be subject to a final monograph in the HPUS\" to \"ensure that the drug has been reviewed for quality and safety.\"142 A similar proposal was approved by courts in multiple class action lawsuits against homeopathic manufacturers.143 Recently, a settlement agreement was approved by a district court regarding homeopathic labeling.144 The court approved an injunc tion requiring the drug manufacturer to include a disclaimer stating that the drugs' uses have not been evaluated by the FDA.145 Further, the court approved the requirement that there must be language in close proximity to the drug facts on the package stat ing that \"X is a homeopathic dilution\" with a link to educational materials on the dilutions in language that an average member of the public can understand.146 A similar proposal was accepted by the California District Court against the homeopathic manufact urer Heel, Inc.147 The settlement includes the mandate of a disclaimer regarding FDA evaluation and a link to the explanation of what homeopathic dilutions are.148 Further, the settlement mandated that the company cannot use the words \"Clinically Proven\" on any product \"for which it does not possess two, independent, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled human clinical trials.\"149 Although this 141.

One of the reasons of the FTC's call to the FDA to revise the regulations governing homeopathic medication is because of confusion among consumers as to what homeopathy is.151 Many consumers cannot \"distinguish between herbal and homeopathic pr oducts.\"152 Adults and parents also cannot \"readily differentiate between evidentiary requirements and federal regulatory requirements for different types of products.\"153 Homeopathy was not fully understood by focus group participants, and \"homeopathy\" was used interchangeably with terms such as \"natural\" and \"herbal.\"154 In focus group tests, even adding prominent FDA disclaimers on packaging resulted in a percentage of respondents believing that the products were FDA approved and were tested for safety and efficacy.155 Aggressive disclosures did reduce the risk of confusion.156 Further, the question still remains as to why the claims should continue to be allowed in the first place, remedied only with a disclosure. The disclosure remedy also does not solve the discrepancy between the FDA and FTC. The solution adopted by the courts results in homeopathic products continuing to make unsubstantiated health claims. If the labeling imposed by the injunction was implemented, homeopathic medications would still be t he only product that would be able to make health claims without scientific evidence and would thus still be misleading.157 Further, the average consumer would have difficulty understanding what a 150.

This would reduce the confusion among consumers as to the efficacy of the products being sold. Further, it would allow homeopathic products to remain on the shelves by not subjecting them to the rigorous drug approval process.

I would like to thank all those who have been patient with my chronic irritability throughout my law school education. Thank you to Alexandra Wright, whose support allowed me to overachieve beyond what I thought was possible. Thank you to my family, my mother Chareta Manukyan, my sister Becky Manukyan, and to my late father Ruben Manukyan, who I try to make proud each and every day. "}
