Our LIPO LASER Body Contouring System is considered to be one of the safest body shaping procedures available today, as it stimulates the natural release of excess fat in the body without destroying or structurally altering adipose tissue and other nearby organs. This unique technique performs procedures for fat removal, body shaping, and cellulite, 100% non-invasively. This is based on the application of laser energy safely (and painlessly) at very precise wavelengths and strengths, targeting areas like the abdomen, waist, thighs, hips, arms, neck. How does it work? Lipo Laser Body Contouring System stimulates adipose cells to release much of their cellular content (water, fatty acids, and glycerol) into the interstitial space so that it is subsequently drained and naturally metabolized by the body. This is how the fat cells shrink, which may be visibly seen as a loss in centimeters on the treated areas, slimming patients effectively. Laser pads are positioned around the body area to be treated and are held in place with our convenient Velcro straps. Once turned on, the machine emits lasers onto the skin which generates heat and metabolizes fatty acids within your adiposities, or fat cells. Results like better contour and a slimmer shape and may be visible seen after one treatment and are maintained and improved with regular sessions. View our Testimonies that our clients give us!
