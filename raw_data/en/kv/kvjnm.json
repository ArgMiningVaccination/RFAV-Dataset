Every Proper Wild shot has a room temperature shelf-life of 24 months at the time of production. Shake well and refrigerate after opening. How does Proper Wild Taste? Proper Wild tastes fruity and natural, not syrupy and artificial like most energy shots. We take great pride in only using clean, 100% plant-based ingredients that you can actually pronounce and feel good about putting into your body on a daily basis. Drink Proper Wild straight, which we like best when chilled, or mix it in with a smoothie or shake. [](/pages/faq) What Our Customers Are Saying "}
