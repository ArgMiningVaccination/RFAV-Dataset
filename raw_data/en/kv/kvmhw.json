So, before we jump into specific questions about the business, why don't you give us some details about you and your story. When I was growing up in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago, I learned a lot about the cycle of the year from my Italian grandmother, who came to Chicago when she was 17. She shared with me the many ancient traditions of plant medicine, potion making, & mentoring folks in need of guidance. She held 'salons' where people from various cultural traditions gathered to discuss the issues of the day & to trade secrets. It was there at the age of 9 that I met 2 people from the Sociatas Rosicruicana in America the S.R. I.A. which began my life-long journey into esoteric studies. I went on to study Comparative Religion & Philosophy in College, where I met the works of Rudolf Steiner, thru the writings of Owen Barfield, one of the inklings. Great, so let's dig a little deeper into the story - has it been an easy path overall and if not, what were the challenges you've had to overcome? The road is more like a river, etching its way thru time. Sometimes meandering, often turbulent, full of rocks & twists & dry spells where the flow seems to stop. But always the rain of inspiration falls & refreshes, bringing changes of consciousness & growth that take me back to the source of the spring, or plunges me into the ocean of the all. I have found that most folks are caught up in the duties of the everyday, a materialistic mind-set that denies them access to the life of the spirit. I consider life a path of initiation, & treat my encounters as sacred opportunities, a chance for exchange, for healing, for divine connection. What I offer takes a willingness to be awake, a will to work. To think, outside the box; & unfortunately many prefer to simply be entertained. Spiritual Science is a discipline, a practice. That involves inner development & practical application in the world. Anthroposophy is a source of spiritual knowledge & a practice of inner development. Through it one seeks to penetrate the mystery of our relationship with the spiritual world by searching for answers & insights that come through a schooling of one's inner life. It draws, & strives to build, on the spiritual research of Rudolf Steiner, who maintained that every human being (Anthropos) has the inherent wisdom (Sophia) to solve the riddles of existence & to transform both self & society. We are meant to recognize and work with the Spiritual Being of Anthroposophia. Anthroposophy is a human oriented spiritual philosophy that reflects and speaks to the basic deep spiritual questions of humanity, to our basic artistic needs, to the need to relate to the world out of a scientific attitude of mind, and to the need to develop a relation to the world in complete freedom. It is a path of knowledge or spiritual research, developed on the basis of European idealistic philosophy, rooted in the philosophies of Aristotle, Plato, and Thomas Aquinas. It is primarily defined by its method of research, and secondly by the possible knowledge or experiences this leads to. From this perspective, anthroposophy can also be called spiritual science. As such, it is an effort to develop not only natural scientific, but also a spiritual scientific research on the basis of the idealistic tradition, in the spirit of the historical strivings, that have led to the development of modern science. On this basis, anthroposophy strives to bridge the clefts that have developed since the middle Ages between the sciences, the arts and the spiritual strivings of man as the three main areas of human culture, and build the foundation for a synthesis of them for the future. Anthroposophy is also an impulse to nurture the life of the soul in the individual and in human society, meaning among other things to nurture the respect for and interest in others on a purely human basis independently of their origin and views. It also lives as applied or practical anthroposophy in various \"daughter movements\" or initiatives of anthroposophy. Such as: Biodynamic farming, Waldorf schools, Curative Education, Medicine, The Christian Community, Eurhythmy, etc.... Alright - so let's talk business.
