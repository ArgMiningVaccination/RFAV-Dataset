Get answers to frequently asked questions here.", "sitename": "Transformyou", "date": "2019-04-18", "cleaned_text": "produced by the thymus gland. The thymus is a critical part of your immune system, where individual T-cells respond to the millions of bacteria, fungi, or viruses that could invade your body. Ta1 is most often given for chronic viral diseases, but it can also increase immunity. Additionally, it can help control inflammation associated with chronic diseases, which can cause excess fatigue. Is Thymosin Alpha 1 FDA Approved? Yes, it has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of malignant melanoma, Hepatitis B and C, and influenza. It is also used for support of immune systems suppressed by chemotherapy. Further studies are investigating its antiviral properties and possibilities as cancer treatment, as well as its use as a powerful antioxidant, to supplement treatments for tick-borne infections, and for immune modulation and boosting. Thymosin alpha 1, marketed worldwide as Zadaxin, has been approved in 30 countries to treat hepatitis and cancer. In clinical trials, it has been used to support immunity, either as monotherapy or in conjunction with current allopathic medicines. Zadaxin is currently in Phase III trials for the treatment of hepatitis C and Phase II trials for hepatitis B in the United States. How does Thymosin alpha 1 work? T1 has been shown to enhance the function of certain immune cells called T and dendritic cells. This is very important to anyone with a depressed immune system or suffering from an infection, as these white blood cells play pivotal roles in the body's defense process. T1 has been shown to exhibit antibacterial and antifungal properties, suppress tumor growth, increase vaccine effectiveness, and protect against oxidative damage. Infection and T1 Supplementation with T1 has potentially excellent benefits for patients suffering from infection or autoimmune disease. In addition to its use in the treatment of Hepatitis, AIDS, and cancer, T1 has shown promise in the treatment of Lyme disease, though because of the large role the immune system plays in combating the disease, this isn't too surprising. T1 assists the immune system in finding and eliminating Lyme bacteria and infected cells while helping to prevent oxidative damage, thereby decreasing inflammation and enabling better quality of life throughout treatment. Possible Side Effects Great news -- Thymosin Alpha 1 is very well tolerated. No adverse drug interactions have been observed, and no side effects, other than some irritation or burning sensation at the injection site, have been seen. Benefits of Thymosin Alpha 1 Some of the key benefits of Ta1 include: - Antibacterial and antifungal properties - Increased vaccine effectiveness - Suppression of tumor growth - Help in eradicating the unhealthy cells to stop infection or cancer growth - Strengthening of your immune system Thymosin Alpha 1 is used for clinical conditions where immune support is necessary, such as: - Conditions requiring immune response modulation - Hepatitis B & C - HIV/AIDS - Cancer - non-small cell lung (NSCLC), hepatocellular, malignant melanoma - Chemotherapy adjunct - Chronic inflammatory conditions - Autoimmunity - Cystic fibrosis - Lyme disease - Blocks steroid-induced apoptosis of thymocytes - Depressed response to vaccinations; adjunct to flu vaccine - Geriatric immune support - DiGeorge's syndrome - May reduce hematological toxicity of cytotoxic drug therapies Find out more about Ta1 and peptide therapy by c [ontacting us today](/contact-us-today)!
