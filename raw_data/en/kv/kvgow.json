[7500] CHIP A nnual Report Templ ate - FFY 2019 11 Section II Program's Performance Measur ement and Progress This section consists of two subsections that gather information about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program. Section IIA captures your enrollment progress as well as changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children in your state. Sec tion IIB captures progress towards meeting your state's general strategic objectives and performance goals. Section IIA: Enrollment And Uninsured Data 1. The information in the table below is the Unduplicated Number of Children Ever Enrolled in CHIP in your state for the two most recent reporting periods. The enrollment numbers reported below should correspond to line 7 (Undu plicated Number Ever Enrolled Year) in your state's 4th quarter data report (submitted in October) in the CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS). The percent change column reflects the percent change in enrollment over the two -year period. If the percent change exceeds 10 percent (increase or decrease), please explain in letter A below any factors that may account for these cha nges (such as decreases due to elimination of outreach or increases due to program expansions). This information will be filled in automatically by CARTS through a link to SEDS. Please wait until you have an enrollment number from SEDS before you complet e this response. If the information displayed in the table below is inaccurate, please make any needed updates to the data in SEDS and then refresh this page in CARTS to reflect the updated data.

Please indicat e by checking the box below whether your state has an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuri ng the change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children. Yes (please report your data in the table below) No (skip to Question #4) Please r eport your alternate data in the table below. Data are required for two or more points in time to demonst rate change (or lack of change). Please be as specific and detailed as possible about the method used to measure progress toward covering the uninsur ed. Topic Description Data source(s) Rutgers Center for State Health Policy (CSHP) Reporting period (2 or more points in time) 2009 and 2014 Methodology The Rutgers Center for State Health Policy (CSHP) calculated an estimate of the number of of indiv iduals who would gain insurance with the changes of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). They included children under 19 in Medicaid and CHIP. CSHP drew from several sources of data for this analysis: (1) pooled data from 2007 - 2009 of the Current Population S urvey (CPS), (2) the 2009 New Jersey Family Health Survey (NJFHS), and (3) July 2009 Medicaid ad ministrative records. Estimates for 2014 apply MAGI rules to the 2009 estimate. CSHP estimates that with the changes due to ACA, approximately 102,000 children would become enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. Population (Please include ages and income levels) Children under 19 years of age, with family income levels from 0% to 350% of Federal Poverty Level. Sample sizes The 2009 estimate of children eligible for M edicaid and CHIP was 719,000. Number and/or rate for two or more points in time In 2009, the n umber of children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP was 598,000. By applying the 2014 ACA rules to this group, it is estimated that 698,000 would be eligible for Me dicaid and CHIP Statistical significance of results There was to be expected that an 17.1% increase in the number of children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP through changes due to the Affordable Care Act. A. Please explain why your state chose to adopt a d ifferent methodology to measure changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children. [7500] NJ covers children up to 350% FPL. CPS data does not tell a complete story for New Jersey B. What is your state's assessment of the reliability of the estimate? P lease provide standard errors, confidence intervals, and/or p -values if available. [7500] The estimate does not take into consideration the number of children above 133% FPL who may enroll in marketplace coverage with their parents. CHIP A nnual Report Templ ate - FFY 2019 14 C. What are the limitation s of the data or estimation methodology? [7500] The d ata is no longer current. D. How does your state use this alternate data source in CHIP program planning? [7500] This data source is used in estimates for budget planning and determining the level of outre ach needed to reach the un -enrolled population. Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIA below. [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Templ ate - FFY 2019 15 Section IIB: State Strategic Obj ectives And Performance Goals This subsection gathers information on your state's general strategic objective s, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting goals, as specified in your CHIP state plan. (If your goals reported in th e annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other C omments on Measure.\" Also, the state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides your state with a n opportunity to track progress over time. This section contains templates for reporting performance measurem ent data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrol lment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well child care) Please report perfor mance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two col umns, data from the previous two years' annual reports (FFY 2017 and FFY 201 8) will be populated with data fro m previously reported data in CARTS. If you reported data in the two previous years' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter that data. If you reported no data for either of those two years, but you now have data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the current annual report (FFY 2019 ). In this section, the term performance measure is used to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five broad categories listed above, while \"goals\" are state -specific, and should be listed in the appropriate subsections within t he space provided for each objective. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular measure are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for e ach measure. In addition, please do not report the same data that were reported for Child Core Set reporting. The intent of this section is to capture goals and measures that your state did not report elsewhere. As a reminder, Child Core Set reporting migr ated to MACPRO in December 2015. Historical data are still available for viewing in CARTS. Additional instructions for completing each row of the table are provided below. A. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to report up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective. All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (t arget) the number of CHIP beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MM R, three hepatitis B vaccinations and one varicella vaccination by their 13th birthday.\" B. Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting wi thin a given strategic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: CHIP A nnual Report Templ ate - FFY 2019 16 New/revised : Check this box if you have revised or added a goal. Please explain how and why the goal was revised. Continuing : Check this box if the goal you are reporting is t he same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued : Check this box if you have met your goal and/or are discontinuing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. C. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are reporting for each goal, as follows: Provisional: Check this box if you are reporting performance measure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way befor e you finalize them for FFY 2019 . Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported field is selected as \"Provisional\", the s tate must specify why the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final: Check this box if the data you a re reporting a re considered final for FFY 2019 . Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report: Check this bo x if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reported for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year 's annual report you previously reported the data. D. Measurement Specification: This section is included for only two of the objectives \u2014 objectives related to increasing access to care, and objectives related to use of preventative care \u2014because these are the two objectives for which states may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. In this section, for each goal , please indicate the measurement specification used to calculate your performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be completed. If \"Other\" measure ment specification is selected, the explanation field must be completed. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2016). This field must be completed only when a user selects the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specifica tion explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field must be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected. E. Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the source of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives related to reducing the number of uninsured children and CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whether y ou have used eligibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the othe r source). For the objectives related to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of administrative data used), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (specify how the t wo were used to create the data source), survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). In all cases, if another data source was used, please explain the source. CHIP A nnual Report Templ ate - FFY 2019 17 F. Definition of Population Included in Measure: Numerator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusi on, e.g., one or more visits in the past year). Denominator: Please indicate the definition of the population inc luded in the denominator for each measure. For measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care, please Check one b ox to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) ch ildren combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representative of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, or the CHI P and Medicaid (Title XIX) populations combined), please further define the denominator. For example, denominator includes only children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations preventing reporting on the full population defined, etc.). Please report information on exclusions in the definition of the denominator (including the proportio n of children excluded), The provision of this information is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominat ors across the states and over time can occur. G. Deviations from Measure Specification For the measures related to i ncreasing access to care and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from the measure specification, please sele ct the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The types of deviation parallel the measure specification categ ories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to explain in greater detail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), Numerator ( e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollm ent), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for eac h performance measure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization to ok place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both o f which may be different from the period corresponding to enrollment or utilization of services. H. Date Range: avail able for 201 9 CARTS reporting period. Please define the date range for the reporting period based on the \"From\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the beginning period in which utilization took place and please report the \"To\" time per iod as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were colle cted for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to utilization of services. I. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numera tors and denominators, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on CHIP A nnual Report Templ ate - FFY 2019 18 whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodologies. The form fields have been set up t o facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give yo u enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method is to calculate a \"weighted rate\" by summin g the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state -level rate based on t he ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple report ing units (e.g., individual health plans, different health care delivery systems), states must aggreg ate data from all these sources into one state rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multiple report ing units, all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter z eroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In these cases, it should report the state -level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure,\" along with a description of the method used to derive the state -level rate. J. Explanation of Progress: The intent of this section is to allow y our state to highlight progress and describe any quality -improvement activities that may have contribu ted to your progress. Any quality -improvement activity described should involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, and relate to the performance m easure and your progress. An example of a quality -improvement activity is a state -wide initiative to inform individual families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rates. CHIP would either be the prim ary lead or substantially involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this sec tion can be used to discuss potential reasons for why progress was not seen and to describe future quality -improvement plans. In this section, your state is also asked to set annual performance objectives for FFY 20 20, 202 1 and 202 2. Based on your recent performan ce on the measure (from FFY 2017 through 201 9), use a combination of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three year s. Please explain your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been in creasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project future increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time. If the rate has been fluctuat ing over time, you might look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctuations are not an artifact of the data or the methods used to construct a rate. You might set an initial target that is an average of the recent rates, with slight increases i n subsequent years. In future annual reports, you will be asked to comment on how your actual performance compares to the objective your state set for the year, as well as any quality -improvement activities that have helped or could help your state meet fu ture objectives. K. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other comments on the measure, such as data limitations, plans to repor t on a measure in the future, or differences between performance measures reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

What other strategies does your stat e use to measure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have you found? [7500] DMAHS, through the Office of Quality Assurance (OQA), performs various quality monito ring/quality assurance activities to assess the care and services delivered through the managed care program. Enrollees in the managed care program may be covered through various eligibility categories such as NJ FamilyCare, Aged Blind and Disabled, enroll ees under The Division of Developmen tal Disabilities (DDD), enrollees under The Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P), etc. Therefore, the strategies do not focus on a particular group of individuals, but on different aspects of performance of the MCOs participating in the man aged care program. The state -contracted external quality review organization (EQRO), IPRO, whose contract was effective April 25, 2011, and renewed November 30, 2017, performs the mandatory EQRO activities, along with op tional activities such as focused st udies, care/case management audits, and individual quality concern reviews. Other monitoring activities, such as the review of managed care provider networks, contractually -required MCO reports, and other tracking activi ties, are performed by OQA staff or other DMAHS units. IPRO conducted a detailed review of each MCO's compliance with contractual, federal, and State operational and quality requirements through a review of documentation, files, and discussions with key M CO staff. The Annual Assessment of M CO Operations performed by the EQRO in Fiscal Year 2018 for Aetna Better Health of New Jersey (Aetna), Amerigroup New Jersey, Inc. (Amerigroup), Horizon NJ Health (Horizon), UnitedHealthcare Community Plan (United), and WellCare Health Plans of New Jersey, Inc. (WellCare) resulted in compliance ratings between 91% and 97%. During the latter part of 2019, IPRO conducted the Annual Assessment of MCO Operations for Aetna, Amerigroup, Horizon, United, and WellCare where resul ts are still under review. IPRO re viewed the MCO's 2019 HEDIS performance (MY 2018) using the CMS protocol, Validating Performance Measures: A Protocol for Use in Conducting Medicaid External Quality Review Activities. Validation activities included: 1) review of the data management proces ses; 2) evaluation of algorithmic compliance; and 3) verification that the reported results are based on accurate sources of information. The OQA monitors the MCOs' care/case management through focused chart audits con ducted by the EQRO. The records are evaluated for identification of needing care management, timely outreach, documentation of preventive services and age -appropriate EPSDT services, continuity of care, and coordination of services. Populations for the aud it include enrollees under the DDD, DCP&P, and the general population. Benchmarks have been established to determine the MCOs' compliance with the NJ FamilyCare Managed Care Contract care management requirement of attaining a Performance Standard of at lea st 60 -80%. The results of the 2019 (MY 2018) care management audit are as follows: Aetna 51% 83% -100%. 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future measurement and r eporting on access to, quality, or o utcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] As a result of the 2016 Developmental Screening focused study completed by IPRO for the New Jersey DMAHS, a PIP was initiated on Dev elopmental Screening and Early Inter vention (EI). The PIP will be conducted from January 2018 through December 2019. The sustainability of this PIP will be measured in 2020. Additionally, an MCO Collaborative PIP was initiated in 2018 on Risk Behavi ors and Depression among Adolescents . The PIP focus is on screenings for adolescents ages 12 -21 years for tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual behaviors that contribute toward unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, and depres sion. The PIP will be conducted fro m January 2019 through December 2020. The sustainability of this PIP will be measured in 2021. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 64 In the January 2019 New Jersey FamilyCare Managed Care Contract, DMAHS added the following HEDIS performance measures: Pla n All-Cause Readmissions, Metabolic Monitoring for Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics, and Risk of Continued Opioid Use. Additionally, in the January 2019 New Jersey FamilyCare Managed Care Contract, DMAHS added the PQI -01: Diabetes Short Term Com plications Admission Rate Core Set m easure. The MCOs began reporting on these measures in 2019. In the July 2019 New Jersey FamilyCare Managed Care Contract, DMAHS added the CCP: Contraceptive Care -Postpartum Women and CCW: Contraceptive Care -All Women Core Set measures. The MCOs will b egin reporting on these measures in 2020. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath care needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you f ound? [7500] As a follow up to the 2016 Focused Study: Developmental Screening Medicaid Managed Care Enrollees, IPRO conducted a second focused study, Developmental Screening Focused Study II: Medicaid Managed Care Enr ollees, to supplement the findings o f the previous study and to assess the coordination of Care Management (CM) and Early Intervention (EI) services. This study assesses the policies, processes, and procedures undertaken by MCOs to identify candidates for EI services or members receiving EI services, and the role played by CM in coordinating services for members receiving EI services. The study was conducted and included the findings of three populations - Care management and/or case management members in NJ Medicaid managed care with a d iagnosis pertinent to early intervention (EI) but no claims for EI procedures (CMa), Care management and/or case management members in NJ Medicaid managed care with claims for EI procedures (CMb), and members in NJ Medic aid managed care in lead case manage ment (LCM). The study produced the following results: 97% of CMa had any care management and/or case management record documentation and had care management and/or case management record documentation within the review period. 93% of CMb had any care m anagement and/or case management record documentation and had care management and/or case management record documentation with the review period. 76% of LCM had any lead case management record documentation and ha d a lead case management record documenta tion within the review period. Comprehensive documentation in the care management record improves the MCOs capabilities to coordinate care for children at risk for developmental delay. Through the guidance of care managers, they can direct the receipt of EI services, as well as coordinate referrals for specialty services, and follow up on screenings. Additionally, IPRO is in the early development of conducting a Maternal Mortality Focused Study. This study aims to investigate pregnancy -associated death s in the New Jersey Medicaid population. Predictors of maternal mortality will be explored. IPRO is also currently conducting an Encounter Data Validation Project Focused Study. The objective of this project is to verify the accuracy of pharmacy encoun ter data submitted to DMAHS by the NJ Medicaid Managed Care Plans. The pharmacy encounter data submitted to DMAHS will be reconciled to the corresponding source claim data from the originally adjudicated claims. A ll differences will be reported and inves tigated. 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outreach, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP program's performance. P lease include any analyses or description s of any efforts designed to reduce the number of uncovered children in the state through a state health insurance connector program or support for innovative private health coverage initiatives. [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 65 New Jersey u tilizes the Consumer Assessment of Health care Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. This standardized survey allows beneficiaries to evaluate their experience with healthcare. The survey asks enrollees about their recent experience with health plans and co vers topics such as provider communicatio n skills and the ease of access to healthcare. This supplies valuable information to aid in improving the quality of care offered to NJ FamilyCare beneficiaries. The 2019 survey indicated that the respondents are sa tisfied with the New Jersey Medicaid mana ged care programs. General ratings of healthcare services were high and most respondents felt that they usually or always had access to services when needed. Their responses indicated an overall satisfaction with healthcare providers and to their access to care. In fact, 85% of the adult enrollees surveyed rated their overall healthcare with high standards and 93% rated their child's healthcare highly (rated a 7 or above on a 10 point scale). In addition, for both adults and children, most of the responde nts had high opinions of their own health plans. In 2019, 88% of adult respondents rated their overall health plan highly and 94% rated their child's health plan highly. Therefore, the respondents felt that their healthcare was satisfactory and most respondents felt that the managed care health plans met their needs. In 2019, the State of New Jersey conducted a separate Statewide CHIP Child Survey. Responses indicated an overall satisfaction with healthcare provi ders and to their access to care. In fac t, 94% of respondents rated their child's overall healthcare with high standards (rated a 7 or above on a 10 point scale) and 92% of respondents rated their child's health plan highly. Enter any Narrative text rel ated to Section IIB below. [7500] Sectio n IIB: State Strategic Objectives and Performance Goals oIt appears that there are new measures being included in the CARTS report, such as the \"Increase the percentage of members 2 -20 years of age who had at least one dental visit during the measurement year\" and some measures have been modified. The current state plan references an Attachment 9 in relation to the state's performance goals and strategic objectives, but it may have been lost in the most recent update . We ask that the state review and revise section 9 to align with any of the changes in the CARTS report and then provide the updated attachment. New Jersey will work to revise attachment 9 to align with any changes in the CARTS report. oPlease note that for the FY2020 CARTS report, the goals listed in CARTS should align with the goals in the state's CHIP state plan. If the state is no longer measuring the goals in the CHIP state plan, please update section 9 (and any related attachments) with the mea sures reported on in CARTS with your next state plan amendment. New Jersey will update accordingly.

You will not be able to enter responses with characters greater tha n the limit indicated in the brackets. Section IIIA: Outreach 1. How have you redirected/changed your outreach stra tegies during the reporting period? [7500] During this reporting year, we continued to train on NJ FamilyCare Part 1, which is a 1 -hour online c lass and the NJ FamilyCare Part II, which is a full day, in -person class is needed to become a Certified Applica tion Assistor for NJ FamilyCare. From October 1, 2018 - September 30, 2019, New Jersey provided grant funding to five NJ - based agencies that we re former and/or current recipients of a CMS FFM Navigator grant. Grantees were trained in the NJ FamilyCare ap plication and enrollment process so they could help families, particularly families with lower incomes, understand and enroll in appropriate hea lth coverage options to meet NJ's individual health insurance mandate. NJ FamilyCare provided promotional materi als to the grantees. The Office of NJ FamilyCare Outreach as well as the five grantees, attended community events to provide healthcare educatio n and application assistance for NJ FamilyCare and the Federally Facilitated Marketplace. In July, 2019, New Je rsey was awarded a Connecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) HEALTHY KIDS 2019 grant. The award amount in year one was $750,000 to develop application assistance resources to provide high -quality, reliable and streamlined NJ FamilyCare (NJFC) enrollment which can help applicants apply and remain enrolled for as long as they are eligible. The Office of NJ FamilyCare Outreach, has identified three targeted populations for outreach in order to get eligible New Jersey children enrolled in NJFC: 1) Uninsured children i dentified by New Jersey school districts, 2) Uninsured children identified through data matching with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Prog ram (SNAP), 3) Uninsured children who receive temporary health coverage through the Presumptive Eligibility (PE) process. 2. What methods have you found most effective in reaching low -income, uninsured children (e.g., T.V., school outreach, word -of-mouth)? Ho w have you measured effectiveness? [7500] Outreach through clinics, hospitals, and schools have proven to be mo st successful. We support hospitals in holding open registration events at their facilities. We have worked extensively with the NJ Department o f Health to make sure that the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) use our combined Presumptive Eligibili ty (PE)/NJ FamilyCare application to enroll the uninsured as they present for care. Since all PE sites have their own designated PE enrollment n umber, we are able to count the number of PE applications submitted to track success. We also continue to work with hospitals to make sure they apply for PE for uninsured children and pregnant women who could be presumed eligible for Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare. This is a more appropriate use of funding as opposed to charity care or uncompensated care funds. Having pro fessional staff complete an online application that serves as both PE and Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare has been effective in reac hing low -income uninsured people. This reporting year we continued PE training for NJ FamilyCare PE Providers. All PE staff are req uired to be trained and certified after completing the in -person class and passing the examination. The online PE CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 68 applicat ion is simultaneously sent to the appropriate eligibility determination agency for a full eligibility determination. Regarding schoo l outreach, we realized the population that needed to be enrolled was basically in school all day. NJ schools inquire about the health insurance status of their students and take an active role in getting kids enrolled by sending information on those ident ified as uninsured to NJ FamilyCare. Families of students identified as uninsured and/or unknown health insurance status ar e outreached with information on how to apply for NJ FamilyCare or the Federal Facilitated Marketplace. Here is a brief synopsis of our ongoing statewide outreach initiatives: Schools and Child Care: NJ FamilyCare is working in conjunction with the Depa rtment of Education and individual school districts' student rosters to help identify and outreach the uninsured. New Jersey schools incorporated the requirement to inquire about health insurance into their existing forms and shared the information with N J FamilyCare for follow up and outreach. School districts were given until October 30th to send an electronic mail file of their unin sured students and/or students with unknown health insurance status so the parents could be outreached with information on how to apply for NJ FamilyCare. The Head Starts and child care centers ask the health insurance status of the students enrolled in t heir schools and regional NJ FamilyCare staff are available to provide outreach, enrollment and follow up. We continued o ur MOU with the Department of Education and Agriculture to provide information on the uninsured students and their level of participa tion in the School Lunch Program. We use the data submitted by the school districts to outreach and enroll, uninsured but e ligible children. Hospital and FQHC: Hospitals continue to be reminded on the availability of PE for children and appropriate utili zation of available state funds for the uninsured. We continued to offer PE training for NJ FamilyCare PE Providers. All PE staff are required to be trained and certified after completing the in person class and passing the examination. NJ FamilyCare continues to partner with the FQHCs which are focusing on helping eligible families apply for NJ FamilyCare instead of rely ing on Uncompensated Care for their uninsured populations. PE staff at FQHCs are also required to attend the PE training mentioned ab ove. On the Web: Our NJ FamilyCare website, www.njfamilycare.org, continues to be a great source of information for the p ublic, with fact sheets available in 19 languages. Not only can families learn all about NJ FamilyCare, get program materials in vari ous languages, and be updated about any program changes, but they can apply online as well. 3. Which of the methods described in Question 2 would you consider a best practice(s)? [7500] NJ uses a combined Presumptive Eligibility (PE)/NJ FamilyCare applicati on whereby the one application serves to establish both PE and full NJ FamilyCare/Medicaid eligibility, including enrollmen t into the HMO chosen by the family. This has been a best practice since one application completed on behalf of the family by a train ed professional healthcare worker allows for temporary eligibility as well as for the determination of full eligibility wit hout necessitating the family to complete another application CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 69 4. Is your state targeting outreach to specific populations (e.g., minorit ies, immigrants, and children living in rural areas)?

[7500] oPlease provide a response to Question 5 regarding the percent of children under 200% FPL who ar e eligible for Medicaid/CHIP have been enrolled. New Jersey is u nable to answer this question due to a lack of reliable data sources to calculate the denominator (number of children under 200% of FPL who are eligible). We would welcome any assistance or s uggestions from CMS on this topic. Section IIIB: Substitution of Coverage (Crowd -out) Please answer the following questions as they apply to your state's program (some quest ions are not applicable to Medicaid expansion programs.)

Duration Measure of Selected Children, Ages 0 -16, Enrolled in Title XIX and Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2018 The purpose of tables 3a and 3b is to measure the duration, or continuity, of Medicaid and CHIP enrollee s' coverage. This information is required by Section 402(a) of CHIPRA. Reporting on this table is required . The measure is designed to capture continuity of coverage for a co hort of children in title XIX and title XXI for 18 months of enrollment. This m eans that reporting spans two CARTS reports over two years, with enrollment status at 6 months being reported in the first reporting ye ar, and 12 and 18 month enrollment status reported in the second reporting year. States identify a new cohort of childre n every two years. States identify newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2018 (January, February, and March of 2018) for the FFY 2018 CARTS report. This same co hort of children will be reported on in the FFY 2019 CARTS report for the 12 and 18 month status of children newly identified in quarter 2 of FFY 2018 If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an addit ional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. The FFY 2019 CARTS repor t is the second year of reporting in the cycle of two CARTS reports on the cohort of children identified in the second quarter of FFY 2018. For the FFY 2018 report, States only reported on lines 1 -4a of the tables. In the FFY 2019 report, no updates will b e made to lines 1-4a. For the FFY 2019 report, data will be added to lines 5 -10a.The next cohort of children will be identified in the second quarter of the FFY 2020 (January, February and March of 2020). Instructions : For this measure, please identify new ly enrolled children in both title XIX (for Table 3a) and title XXI (for Table 3b) in the second quarter of FFY 2018, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolled in January 2018 must have birthdates after July 2001 (e.g., children mu st be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensure that they will not age out of the program at the 18th month of coverage. Simil arly, children enrolled in February 2018 must have birthdates after August 2001, and children enrolled in March 2018 must hav e birthdates after September 2001. Each child newly enrolled during this time frame needs a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the cohort can be tracked over time. If your e ligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's a ge at enrollment creates an age cohort that does not change over the 18 month ti me span) Please enter the data requested in the tables below, and the template will tabulate the percentages. In the FFY 2019 report you will enter data on lines 5 -7a related to the 12 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. You will al so enter data on lines 8 -10a related to the 18 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero. If data are unknown or unavailable, leave the field blank. Note that all data must sum corre ctly in order to save and move to the next page . The data in each individual row must add across to sum to the total in the \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" column for that row. And in each column, the data within each time period (6, 12 and 18 months) must each sum up to the data in row 1, which is the number of children in the cohort. This means that in each column, rows 2, 3 and 4 must sum to the tot al in row 1; rows 5, 6 and 7 mu st sum to row 1; and rows 8, 9 and 10 must sum to row 1. These tables track a ch ild's enrollment status over time, so when data are added or modified at each milestone (6, 12, and 18 months), there should always be the same total number of children account ed for in line 1 \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" over the entire 18 month period. Rows numbered with an \"a\" (e.g., rows 3a and 4a) are excluded from the totals because they are subsets of their respective rows. The system will not move to the next section of the report until all applicable sections of the table for the reporting year are co mplete and sum correctly to line 1.

Does your state rely on contractors to perform the above functions? Yes, please answer question below. No 5. If your state relies on contractors to perform the above functions, how does your state provide oversight of those contractors? Please explain: [7500] DMAHS, the State's Single State Agency, Is within the New Jersey Department of Human Services. DMAHS contracts with and oversees the MCOs that handle the operations of the Medicaid program for their re spective beneficiaries. Each MCO is required to maintain an SIU, which reports Its active investigations, and outcomes to OSC -MFD on a quarterly basis. Each MCO Is also required to perform audits and reports on the status of their audits to OSC -MFD. Prior to initiating an investigation or audit the MCOs and OSC -MFD deconflict their respective investigations/a udits. In addition to tracking each MCOs SIU and audit activity, OSC -MFD holds quarterly meetings with the MCOs to discuss issues that relate to the Me dicaid program, active Investigations and audits, best practices and other related matters. OSC -MFD also audits the MCOs for compliance with the State MCO contract and issues findings and recommendations to the MCOs as to how to improve their efforts to prevent, detect and recover Medicaid funds spent as a result of fraud, waste or abuse. OSC - MFD also relie s upon MCOs to effectuate provider suspensions and Medicaid payment suspensions, which OSC -MFD than monitors to ensure that Medicaid funds were not spe nt improperly. In addition to the State's oversight of the MCOs, DMAHS contracts with and oversees the Medicaid program's fiscal agent, DXC, which handles the duties relating to provider payments, enrollment and credentialing. As part of the payment proce ssing function, DXC is responsible for ensuring that no Medicaid payments are made to providers who have been excluded, debarred or suspended from the Medicaid program or against whom there is an active payment suspension order. OSC -MFD oversees this funct ion by reviewing the State's centralized claims payment system. Moreover, the State, monitors the provide r screening/enrollment process. As part of this process, DXC transmits to OSC -MFD provider enrollment applications for designated high risk providers. OSC -MFD performs background checks and unannounced site visits in accordance with CMS and ACA requirement s for high risk providers foiwarded through the State's application process by DXC. In addition, the State contracts with ACS to make beneficiary eligi bility determinations at the county level for enrollment into the various NJ Family Care programs. 6. Do you contract with managed care health plans and/or a third party contractor to provide this oversight? Yes No Please Explain: [500] Enter any Nar rative text related to Section IIIF below. [7500] The State presently contracts with five Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). Each of the MCOs is contractually required to have a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) for the detection, deterrence and CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 90 remediat ion of fraud, waste and abuse. Each SIU is contractually obligated to submit quarterly reports to MFD detailing the case status of each ongoing investigation and any related monetary recoveries, as well as any referrals to law enforcement agencies. MFD reg ularly meets with the MCOs to discuss cases, identify trends, share information and monitor aberran t providers. In instances, where recipient ineligibility is confirmed, MFD will pursue a financial recovery from the recipient and termination from CHIP. Whe n credible or suspected allegations of provider fraud are identified, such matters are referred to the appropriate body for criminal prosecution. Cases involving potential recipient fraud are referred to the respective county Prosecutor's Office for crimin al prosecution.

Please confirm whether these reported metrics are specific to FY2019 or served by th e program in total. The actual number of calls seeking program information or requesting spe cific services is reported in Section III I question 3 Outcome, whereas the number of children served for each service is an estimate based on prior yearly data ( see Section III I question 2). oIn regards to the respite care HSI, it appears that New Jerse y did not provide the percentage of low - income children served through this HSI. We've previously indicated that due to respite care being a direct service provid ed to a child that we would expect the state to provide this information. Please clarify wheth er the state tracks this information and include in the CARTS report if available. If not, we are happy to provide further technical assistance in preparation for the 2020 CARTS report. With regards to respite care, New Jersey does not currently track the percentage of low -income children served through this HSI but is actively exploring ways to report. We would welcome further technical assistance. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 98 Section IV. Program financing for State Plan 1.

For the reporting period, please provide an overview of your state's political and fiscal environment as it relates to health care for low income, uninsured children and families, and how this env ironment impacted CHIP. [7500] From October 1, 2018 - Septe mber 30, 2019, New Jersey provided grant funding to five NJ - based agencies that were former and/or current recipients of a CMS FFM Navigator grant. Grantees were trained in the NJ FamilyCare appl ication and enrollment process so they could help families, particularly families with lower incomes, understand and enroll in appropriate health coverage options to meet NJ's individual health insurance mandate. NJ FamilyCare provided promotional material s to the grantees. The Office of NJ FamilyCare Outreach as w ell as the five grantees, also attended community events to provide healthcare education and application assistance for NJ FamilyCare and the Federally Facilitated Marketplace. 2. During the reportin g period, what has been the greatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] New Jersey continued to offer trainings during this reporting period and it has been challenging to keep the training curriculum current and relevant using state resources to meet this need. 3. During the reporting period, what accomp lishments have been achieved in your program? [7500] NJ FamilyCare PE training for PE providers took place this reporting period. This reporting year NJ FamilyCare trained more than 440 new PE st aff at provider agencies and provided oversight to about 500 certified PE Provider agencies. NJ FamilyCare launched a new PE application system in July 2019. The system was designed to make the application process more streamlined for the patients, PE Pr oviders, and NJ FamilyCare Eligibility Determining Agencies. In the preceding months, NJ FamilyCare trained 1680 previously -certified PE staff on the features of the new system and coordinated efforts to get their system accounts set up so PE Providers wou ld be ready to use the new system when it launched. After th e system launch, NJ FamilyCare provided technical and other support to the PE Providers as they became accustomed to using the new system. 4. What changes have you made or are planning to make in yo ur CHIP program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planned. [7500] NJ passed legislation to extend post -partum coverage for all pregnant women from two months to six months with federal approval. Higher income pregnant wom en who fall under the CHIP program are included in this chan ge. Enter any Narrative text related to Section V below. [7500] When is the effective date for the expansion of the postpartum period from 2 to 6 months? Where is the state in the process to impl ement this extension of postpartum benefits? New Jersey sub mitted an amendment to the 1115 demonstration on March 3, 2020 that includes the expansion of the postpartum period from 2 -6 months. NJ competed the 30 day public notice process and the amendment is currently under review with CMS. Therefore, NJ does not h ave an effective date for the expansion.
