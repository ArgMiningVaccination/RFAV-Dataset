It considers environmental and lifestyle factors such as stress, nutrition, social connection, sleep, activity level and more to promote optimal functioning, mind, body, spirit, and emotions. Is one of your goals to live your best life? Do you wonder how to access your best self mentally, physically and emotionally? With each change of season comes a new opportunity to reset. Identify and incorporate simple lifestyle choices that allow you to tune in to your mind and body for better balance and improved mood. Manage Stress Pause to take 3-5 deep breaths when you are feeling tense or overwhelmed. If that feels like too much, just bring awareness to your breath, feeling the sensation of air moving into the body as you breathe in and out of the body as you breathe out. Finally, learn how to meditate by joining a meditation group [like this one](https://www.specializedtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Managing-Stress-through-Mindfulness-Meditation-Group-Flyer-2019-Ramsey-1.docx). Upgrade your fuel Are you being fueled (or fooled) by food devoid of nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber? Up your intake of fresh, local, seasonal produce. Check out your local farmers market. Try something new like microgreens, kohlrabi, spring onions, fennel, snap peas or cherries. Get your Vitamin D While we are advised against \"tanning\" and prolonged exposure, there are safe and simple ways to benefit from the sun. Enjoy your lunch outside. Take a morning walk. Swing by the park on the way home from picking up your kids. Bonus: morning sun helps regulate circadian rhythms which supports your sleep/wake cycle. Curtail your use If you consume alcohol, (or other substances) consider taking a break for at least one month to experiment with how you feel. Even moderate alcohol consumption can adversely impact your health and happiness by affecting neurotransmitter function, inflammation and sleep among other areas. Connect with others In real life. Put the phone down. Search for a local Meet Up group or class in your areas such as hiking, biking, gardening, painting, or cooking.
