Alzheimer's and Other Types of Dementia The ugly reality is that dementia often manifests as a relentless and cruel assault on personhood, comfort, and dignity. It siphons away control over thoughts and actions, control that we take for granted every waking second of every day. Michael J. Passmore, Geriatric Psychiatrist University of British Columbia Dementia is the collective name for progressive, global deterioration of the brain's executive functions. It develops primarily in later adulthood and is a major cause of disability in older adults. Almost everyone with dementia is elderly but nevertheless dementia is not considered a normal part of aging. Very early identification of dementia\u2014before obvious symptoms appear\u2014is an intense focus of research. Staging (used primarily in the research setting) and correctly diagnosing dementia is becoming increasingly important in the clinical setting. Understanding the difference between Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia and differentiating dementia from delirium and depression is of critical importance. Once a person has been diagnosed with any form of dementia, management becomes a priority. Because dementia is progressive, patients and caregivers are faced with the challenge of managing an array of behavioral issues associated with dementia while providing more care as the disease progresses. Dementia is not an easy disease, either for the person experiencing the progressive loss of independence and control or for caregivers and family members. Education, collaboration, communication, and support are critical. Did you know . . . Worldwide more than 35 million people live with dementia and this number is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050 (Alzheimer's Disease International).Although dementia is widespread in humans and occurs throughout the world, its exact cause is still unknown. In Alzheimer's disease, and likely in other forms of dementia, damage within the brain is associated with the formation of unwanted structures called beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It is also related to the degeneration and loss of nerve cells within the brain. Degeneration of Cerebral Neurons Left: A healthy nerve cell. Right: A dying nerve cell. Source: ADEAR, 2014. We are learning that the changes associated with dementia occur over years, or even decades, before emotional, physical, or cognitive symptoms emerge. Eventually symptoms become obvious, and they lead to gradual and progressive decline (DeFina et al., 2013). Alzheimer's Dementia You likely already know that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent and most studied cause of dementia in older adults. Its onset is gradual and progressive, meaning it gets worse over time. Memory problems are the most common early symptom of AD although language difficulties, apathy, depression, and vision and spatial difficulties can also be early symptoms. The latter two symptoms are less studied than memory changes but can be just as debilitating. Difficulties with vision and spatial awareness affect reading and comprehension of form and color, and can affect the ability to see contrast. This can make it difficult to detect motion and process visual information accurately (Quental et al., 2013).A B C Different levels of contrast, with less contrast below (50%, 75%). Source: Wikimedia Commons.The progressive brain damage associated with Alzheimer's dementia is illustrated in the drawings below, which show the formation and spread of plaques and tangles in the brain. In the earliest stage, before symptoms appear, plaques and tangles form in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, where new memories are formed (A). As the disease progresses, plaques and tangles spread to the front part of the brain; symptoms begin to be obvious at this stage (B). In the severe stage (C), plaques and tangles are found throughout the brain. Damage eventually affects memory, emotions, communication, safety awareness, logical thinking, recognition of loved ones, and the ability to care for oneself. The Progression of Alzheimer's Disease A: Plaques and tangles (shaded in blue) are beginning to form within the hippocampus. B: As the disease progresses, they spread toward the front and rear of the brain. C: In severe Alzheimer's, plaques and tangles cause widespread damage throughout the brain.

Difficulties with vision and spatial a wareness affect our ability to move about safely in the environment. Because of these changes, walking on a busy street can be dangerous, driving is no longer safe, and avoiding obstacles is a challenge.It turns out that memory loss isn't the only thing that happens in early Alzheimer's disease. In fact the hippocampus is just one part of a larger br ain structure called the limbic system . This area of the brain is not only responsible for the formation of new memories; it is also involved with emotions. To understand why emotions and memory are so strikingly affected by Alzheimer's disease please view this clear, concise video. Emotions: The Limbic System (10:31) Source: The Khan Academy, 2013. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDlDirzOSI8 Non-Alzheimer's Dementia Although Alzheimer's disease is the most common and well-known form of dementia, there are other causes and types of dementia that you are likely to encounter in your work. Some other common types of dementia include: Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment Frontotemporal dementia Dementia with Lewy bodies Dementia associated with Parkinson's disease In all, nearly twenty different types of non-Alzheimer's dementia have been identified. Determining if someone has Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia is important because some types of dementia are treatable and reversible if the underlying cause is identified and treated (S\u00f6nke, 2013). Vascular Dementia and Vascular Cognitive Impairment Emotions: limbic system | Processing the Environment Emotions: limbic system | Processing the Environment ......Damage to the brain's frontal and temporal lobes causes forms of dementia called frontotemporal disorders. Source: National Institute on Aging.Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment are caused by injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain. Damage can be due to multiple small strokes or to any injury to the small vessels within the brain. Generally, the first symptoms of vascular dementia are difficulty making decisions and impaired judgment. The risk of developing dementia from vascular damage can be significant even when individuals have suffered only small strokes or minor damage to the blood vessels (NINDS, 2013). Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, affecting approximately 20% of the dementia cases worldwide (Neto et al., 2015). Risk factors for developing vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment include heart rhythm irregularities, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, and obesity. Vascular dementia also has been associated with a condition called amyloid angiopathy , in which amyloid plaques accumulate in the blood vessel walls, causing them to break down and rupture (NINDS, 2013). Symptoms of vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment often begin suddenly and usually proceed in a step-wise progression. This means the symptoms stay the same for a period of time, and then suddenly get worse, usually as a result of additional small strokes or other vascular damage. In vascular dementia, memory is less affected than in Alzheimer's but mood changes are more common. Cognitive impairment often seems \"patchy\" because of the many areas of the brain that are affected. Vascular dementia can be largely prevented if the underlying causes are identified and addressed. Frontal-Temporal Dementia Frontal-Temporal (frontotemporal) dementia begins in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. This contrasts with Alzheimer's dementia, in which damage begins in the hippocampus and then spreads to the front part of the brain. Fronto temporal dementia typically starts at an earlier age than Alzheimer's disease; it is a relatively common type of dementia in those under the age of 60. In the early stages of fronto temporal dementia, judgment is more affected than memory, although memory is eventually affected as well. There is a gradual and progressive change in behavior (mood changes, apathy, and disinhibition*), gradual difficulties with language, and gradual weakness or slowing of movement. Behavior is often referred to as \"odd,\" \"socially inappropriate,\" and \"schizoid.\"*Disin hibition: a loss of inhibition, a lack of restraint, disregard for social convention, impulsiveness, poor safety awareness, an inability to stop strong responses, desires, or emotions. Because frontotempor al dementia can also affect the hippocampus and because of the many variations found in the disease, it is often difficult to tell the difference between frontotempor al dementia and Alzheimer 's disease. It can also be confused with other psychiatric conditions such as late-onset schiz ophrenia. Dementia with Lew y Bodies Dementia with Lewy bodies is one of the most common t ypes of progressiv e dementia. It is caused b y the buildup of abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies inside nerv e cells in areas of the br ain responsible for certain aspects of memory and motor control. It is not known exactly wh y Lewy bodies form or how Lewy bodies cause the symptoms of dementia (NINDS , 2015). The centr al features of dementia with Lewy bodies are progressiv e cognitiv e decline, \"fluctuations\" in alertness and attention, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian motor symptoms, such as slowness of mo vement, difficult y walking, or rigidit y (stiffness). P eople may also suffer from depression (NINDS , 2015). Difficult y sleeping, loss of smell, and visual hallucinations can precede mo vement and other problems b y as much as 10 y ears. Because of this, dementia with Lewy bodies can go unrecogniz ed or be misdiagnosed as a psy chiatric disorder until its later stages (NINDS , 2013). The similarit y of symptoms between dementia with Lewy bodies, P arkinson' s disease, and Alzheimer 's disease can mak e diagnosis difficult. It is possible that either dementia with Lewy bodies is related to these other causes of dementia or that an individual can ha ve more than one t ype of dementia at the same time. Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no known family history of the disease. Howev er, familial cases ha ve occasionally been reported (NINDS , 2015). Parkinson's Disea se Dementia Mild cognitiv e impairment is common in the early stages of P arkinson' s disease and a majorit y of people with P arkinson' s disease will ev entually dev elop dementia. The time from the onset of mo vement symptoms to the onset of dementia symptoms v aries greatly from person to person.Cognitiv e problems such as impaired memory , lack of social judgment, language difficulties, and deficits in reasoning can dev elop o ver time. A utopsy studies show that people with P arkinson' s disease dementia often ha ve amyloid plaques and tau tangles similar to those found in people with Alzheimer 's disease, though it is not understood what these similarities mean. Risk factors for dev eloping P arkinson' s disease dementia include the onset of P arkinson' s- related mo vement symptoms followed b y mild cognitiv e impairment and sleep disorders, which in volves frequent vivid nightmares and visual hallucinations (NINDS , 2013). Dementia with Lewy bodies and P arkinson' s disease dementia are now recogniz ed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), where they are respectiv ely coded as \"Major and Mild Neurocognitiv e Disorder with Lewy Bodies\" and as \"Major and Mild Neurocognitiv e Disorder due to P arkinson' s Disease\" (Donagh y & McK eith, 2014). Staging Alzheimer's Disease In 2011 the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer 's Association (NIA/AA) issued updated criteria and guidelines for the staging of Alzheimer 's disease. Staging is an attempt to define the sev erity of a disease and understand its progression. Staging is not a diagnosis. The NIA/AA guidelines describe Alzheimer 's disease as occurring along a continuum, starting with health y aging, then progressing to: The NIA/AA guidelines also recogniz e for the first time the importance of biomarkers in identif ying v ery early br ain changes. Biomark ers are changes in sensory and cognitiv e abilities or substances in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine. Biomark ers can indicate exposure to a substance, the presence of a disease, or disease progression o ver time (Lobello et al. , 2012). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomogr aphy (PET), am yloid imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are potential biomark ers and ma y aid in the identification of abnormal br ain changes well before symptoms appear . These techniques are only useful, howev er, when large numbers of people are screened long before symptoms appear , which is currently impr actical and ev en contro versial.Preclinical Alzheimer 's disease 1. Mild cognitiv e impairment 2. Dementia due to Alzheimer 's disease 3.Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Preclinical Alzheimer 's disease is the stage in which pathologic changes ha ve begun to appear in the br ain but no cognitiv e or emotional symptoms are present. During the preclinical stage\u2014currently used only in the research setting\u2014 amyloid buildup can be detected in some people using positron emission tomogr aphy (PET) scans and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. It is unknown what the risk for progression to Alzheimer 's dementia is for these individuals. These biomark ers are still being dev eloped and standardiz ed and are not ready for use b y clinicians in gener al practice (NIA, 2011). Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease Mild cognitiv e impairment (MCI) is identified in the NIA/AA guidelines as the next stage of Alzheimer 's disease progression. It is fairly common in older adults and does not necessarily indicate the presence of AD . It is char acteriz ed by a decline in cognitiv e function that falls between the changes associated with t ypical aging and changes associated with dementia (Lee et al. , 2014). The NIA/AA guidelines for mild cognitiv e impairment are largely for research, although they clarif y existing guidelines for use in a clinical setting. The MCI stage is mark ed by symptoms of memory problems\u2014enough to be noticed and measured\u2014but not compromising a person' s independence. P eople with MCI ma y or ma y not progress to Alzheimer 's dementia (NIH, 2011). Although mild cognitiv e impairment has been described as a tr ansitional stage between normal cognitiv e aging and dementia, particularly Alzheimer 's disease, communit y-based studies suggest that man y individuals diagnosed with MCI do not progress to Alzheimer 's disease and ma y even rev ert to normal. Nev ertheless, receiving a diagnosis of mild cognitiv e impairment can be tr aumatic and it is important for clinicians to be able to provide their patients with information regarding the lik elihood of progression to Alzheimer 's disease (Lee et al. , 2014). Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease The onset of dementia due to Alzheimer 's disease is the third stage described in the NIA/AA guidelines and marks a period in which symptoms become more obvious and independent living becomes more difficult. This stage is referred to as the \"dementia phase. \" Identifying Alzheimer's and Other Types of Dementia in the Clinical SettingCurrently, the identification and diagnosis of dementia in the clinical setting is mostly based on a clinician's suspicion of patient symptoms or caregiver concerns. Because the onset of dementia is gradual and the early symptoms of dementia are extremely common, cognitive or cognitive-related functional complaints may not be obvious during routine office visits unless they are directly assessed. To make matters more complicated, many individuals with subjective memory complaints often have normal cognition when tested (Lin et al., 2013). Unfortunately, patients with unrecognized impairment usually do not get tested for reversible causes of dementia, do not get counseling regarding the disease process or advanced care planning, and are not offered treatment (Cho et al., 2014). Several barriers may contribute to a missed or delayed diagnosis of dementia, particularly in the primary care setting: Physician and patient lack of knowledge Physicians' concerns about over-diagnosis and labeling Lack of appropriate assessment tools Patient's refusal to be assessed for dementia Time and financial constraints (Lin et al, 2013) Did You Know . . . Compared to patients who see a geriatrician or neurologist, dementia patients followed up exclusively by primary care physicians are less likely to receive a specific dementia diagnosis and less likely to have their initial diagnosis change over time. They are also less likely to have neuroimaging or receive dementia medication (Cho et al., 2014). Screening for Cognitive Impairment Screening is a method for detecting dysfunction or disease before an individual would normally seek medical care. Screening tests are usually administered to individuals without current symptoms, but who may be at high risk for certain adverse outcomes. Screening has the potential to identify very early signs of dementia, which may allow early diagnosis and treatment. It also offers the chance to identify reversible causes of dementia (such as high blood pressure) and treat conditions that contribute to cognitiv e decline.Screening tests for cognitiv e impairment in the clinical setting gener ally include asking patients to perform a series of tasks that assess at least one cognitiv e domain (memory , attention, language, and visuospatial* or ex ecutiv e functioning). Blood tests and r adiology examinations are not currently used as screening tests but are often used after a positiv e screening result to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and determine its subt ype (USPSTF , 2014). *Visuospatial ability: the ability to perceive and understand the special relationship between objects within the environment that are within our field of vision, including our own body's relationship to other objects. In 2011 Medicare began co vering the \"detection of cognitiv e impairment \" as a part of the annual wellness visit benefit, which is mandated b y the Affordable Care Act. Howev er, the recommendations issued b y the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pro vide little guidance on recommended screening instruments or techniques, other than directing providers to use direct observ ation and consider information from informants (Lin et al. , 2013). A strong argument in fa vor of screening for cognitiv e impairment is that knowledge of the patient 's cognitiv e status is important for the management of comorbid conditions. Cognitiv e impairment can affect the management of comorbid conditions and ma y lead to worsened outcomes of the comorbid conditions. K eep in mind that cognitiv e impairment may lead patients to report symptoms and health beha viors inaccur ately, may decrease their abilit y to consent to treatments, ma y affect medication adherence, and ma y mak e followup of chronic conditions challenging (Lin et al. , 2013). Additionally , because the sensitivit y of a clinician' s diagnosis appears to be strongly related to dementia sev erity, most people with dementia are not diagnosed until the moder ate to severe stages of the disease. Screening tests in all or targeted older adults ma y help identif y patients with dementia or mild cognitiv e impairment that is otherwise missed (Lin et al., 2013). Although no professional organizations explicitly recommend screening for dementia in asymptomatic adults, man y groups ha ve recommended assessing the cognitiv e abilities of older adults who present with cognitiv e or cognitiv e-related functional complaints (Lin et al., 2013). The Alzheimer 's Association has published guidance for the detection of cognitiv e impairment during the annual wellness visit and recommended an algorithm in volving a health risk assessment, patient observ ation, and unstructured questioning. The Alzheimer 's Association recommends the use of a brief structured assessment if signs or symptoms of cognitiv e impairment are present or if an informant is not a vailable to confirm the absence of signs or symptoms (USPSTF , 2014).Due to the man y obstacles associated with screening for dementia, the U .S. Prev entive Services T ask Force has recommended that, for cognitiv e impairment in older adults, current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening (USPSTF , 2014). Diagnosing Alzheimer's and Dementia Diagnosis involves a thorough medical ev aluation, medical history , and testing of mental status. Diagnostic tests are performed to rule out rev ersible causes of dementia such as drug inter actions, depression, delirium, th yroid problems, alcohol and drug abuse, and vitamin deficiencies. Diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease and other t ypes of dementia is based on symptoms. This gener ally includes a gr adual decline in mental capacit y, changes in beha vior, and the eventual loss of the abilit y to liv e independently . As yet, there is no blood test or imaging technique that can definitively diagnose dementia. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer 's Association (NIA/AA) has published guidelines for the diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease. The diagnostic criteria are as follows: Episodic memory : a type of long-term memory associated with personal, individual events, places, people, time, and emotions (a person' s remembr ance of who , what, when, where, and wh y).A gradual, progressiv e decline in cognition that represents a deterior ation from a previous higher lev el;1. Cognitiv e or beha vioral impairment evident in at least two of the following domains:2. episodic memorya.1 executiv e and/or beha vior Significant functional impairment that affects the individual' s abilit y to carry out daily living activities3. A situation in which symptoms are not better accounted for b y delirium or another mental disorder , strok e, another dementing condition (ie, v ascular dementia, frontal-tempor al dementia) or other neurologic condition, or the effects of a medication (DeFina et al. , 2013).4. 1Executive functioning : within the frontal lobe, the part of the br ain that o versees or controls planning, attention, ethical beha vior, memory , reasoning, problem solving, as well as other cognitiv e functions. Visuospatial abilities : the abilit y to perceiv e and understand the special relationship between objects within the en vironment that are within our field of vision, including our own body' s relationship to other objects. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) contains updated criteria for diagnosing Alzheimer 's disease that par allel the NIA -AA diagnostic guidelines. Clinicians should familiariz e themselv es with these revised criteria, listed within the Neurocognitiv e Disorders section of the DSM-5 because the criteria contained in the prior DSM- IV-TR are not reflectiv e of the current state of the liter ature (DeFina et al. , 2013). 2 3Diagnostic criteria of Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, and other Dementias Alzheimer's disease Development of multiple cognitive deficits, with both memory impairment and one (or more) of the following cognitive disturbances: Aphasia (language disturbance) Apraxia (learned motor skills disturbance) Agnosia (visuospatial/sensory disturbance) Executive functioning (foresight, planning, insight anticipation) Significant impairment in social or occupational functioning, representing a significant decline from a previous level of functioning Other diagnostic criteria: Hachinski (NINDS-AIREN)Cognitive decline from previous higher level of function in three areas of function including memory Evidence of cerebrovascular disease by examination Evidence of cerebrovascular disease by neuroimaging Onset either abrupt or within three months of a recognized stroke Vascular Dementia (Modified Hachinski Ischemia Score: 4)Two-point items Abrupt onset History of stroke Focal neurologic symptoms One-point items Stepwise deterioration Somatic complaints History of hypertension Emotional incontinence Other criteria: ICD-10; DSM-51 2 3 1 2Hachinski Ischemic Scale: Used to identify a vascular component once dementia has been diagnosed.

Source: Modified from Beydoun et al., 2014.Diagnostic criteria of Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, and other Dementias Frontal-Parietal Dementia Behavioral or cognitive deficits manifested by either: Early and progressive personality change, with problems in modulating behavior; inappropriate responses/activities Early and progressive language changes, with problems in language expression, word meaning, severe dysnomia Deficits represent a decline from baseline and cause significant impairment in social and occupational functioning Course characterized by gradual onset and continuing decline in function Other causes (eg, stroke, delirium) are excluded Gradual onset and progressive cognitive decline Dementia with Lewy BodiesFluctuating in cognitive performance: Marked variation in cognition or function, or episodic confusion/decreased responsiveness Visual hallucinations: Usually well formed, unprovoked, benign Parkinsonism: Can be identical to Parkinson's Disease (PD ), milder or symmetric Parkinson's Disease with DementiaBradyphrenia (slowness of thought) Executive impairment Neuropsychiatric symptoms Dysphonia Clinical Index to Predict Progression1 2 3To help clinicians better understand the progression of Alzheimer 's disease, researchers at the Univ ersity of California, San Fr ancisco ha ve dev eloped a brief clinical index, which they used to predict whether 382 older adults diagnosed with a certain t ype of mild cognitiv e impairment would progress to probable Alzheimer 's disease within 3 y ears. The index utilizes eight items that are readily obtainable in most clinical settings: Gender Four questions regarding caregiv er report of the patients' beha viors (stubborn/resists help and upset when separ ated) and functional status (difficult y shopping alone and forgets appointments) and Three items focusing on abilit y to complete basic cognitiv e tasks (10-item list word recall, orientation to time and place and clock dr aw test) (Lee et al. , 2014). Researchers also used other measures, including demogr aphics, comorbid conditions, caregiv er report of participant symptoms and function, and participant performance on individual items from basic neuropsy chological scales. In this study , subjects had a mean age of 75 y ears and 43% progressed to probable Alzheimer 's disease within 3 y ears (Lee et al., 2014). Important predictors of progression included being female, resisting help , becoming upset when separ ated from a trusted caregiv er, difficult y shopping alone, forgetting appointments, number of words recalled from a 10- word list, orientation and difficult y drawing a clock. F ourteen percent of subjects with low risk scores con verted to probable Alzheimer 's disease o ver 3 y ears, compared to 51% of those with moder ate risk scores and 91% of those with high risk scores (Lee et al. , 2014). The 3 Ds: Deliriu m, Dep ressio n, and Dementia Delirium and depression can cause cognitiv e changes that ma y be mistak en for dementia. Delirium can also be superimposed on dementia, particularly in older hospitaliz ed patients. Clinicians and caregiv ers need to learn to distinguish the differences. DeliriumDelirium is a neuropsy chiatric syndrome with an acute onset and a fluctuating course. The term delirium literally means, \"out of the tr ack,\" and w as first used b y Celsus, in the first century A.D . to describe either states of agitation or ex cessiv e somnolence.* Historically , this syndrome has been described under different names and classifications. Gr adually the term delirium started to be more consistently used to designate rev ersible states of acute brain dysfunction associated with fev er or medical/surgical conditions (Cerejeir a & Mukaeto va-Ladinska, 2011). Somnolence: sleepiness or drowsiness, a desire to sleep for long periods of time during the day, falling asleep while working, during meals, or even in the middle of a conversation. Delirium dev elops acutely \u2014over hours or da ys\u2014and is tempor ary and rev ersible. The most common causes of delirium, which are usually identifiable, are related to medication side effects, h ypo- or h ypergly cemia, fecal impactions, urinary retention, electrolyte disorders and deh ydration, infection, stress, metabolic changes, an unfamiliar en vironment, injury , or severe pain. Inattention is the most frequent clinical finding in a delirium episode. If sev ere enough, it can be detected during a clinical interview . In mild cases, impairment of attention can be uncovered only b y formal cognitiv e testing (eg, naming the months in rev erse order). Attention is impaired in early stages and throughout the course of a delirium episode, correlating with the sev erity of cognitiv e deficits (Cerejeir a & Mukaeto va-Ladinska, 2011). A person experiencing delirium usually has difficult y with: Specific deficits in visual perception ha ve been described in people with delirium: Video: Patient Experience of Delirium (5:51)Orientation1. Mukaeto va-Ladinska, 2011) 4. Illusions (misinterpretations of real sensory stimuli, as when the patient in a dark en vironment sees a threatening figure emanating from shadows on the walls)1. Hallucinations (r anging from simple flashes or unstructured sounds to elabor ate visions, that occur without corresponding sensory stimuli) (Cerejeir a & Mukaeto va-Ladinska, 2011).2.Source: Northumbria Healthcare Foundation Trust, England, U.K. The prev alence of delirium increases with age, and nearly 50% of patients o ver the age of 70 experience episodes of delirium during hospitalization. Delirium is under -diagnosed in almost two-thirds of cases or is misdiagnosed as depression or dementia (Hope et al. , 2014). Early diagnosis of delirium can lead to r apid impro vement. Nev ertheless, diagnosis is often delayed, and problems remain with recognition and documentation of delirium b y healthcare pro viders. Although there are no definitiv e quantitativ e mark ers available to diagnose delirium, qualitativ e tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and modified Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale ha ve been v alidated. Unfortunately , these tools are underused and healthcare pro viders often simply record the patient 's mental status in narr ative (Hope et al. , 2014). Depression Although it presents with an arr ay of ph ysical symptoms, depression is considered a disorder of mood. It is also called an affective disorder to signif y that one of its k ey aspects is a disturbance of emotions or feelings (Diamond, 2015). The diagnosis of depression depends on the presence of two cardinal symptoms: (1) persistent and perv asive low mood, and (2) loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities. Depressiv e symptoms are judged to be of clinical significance when they interfere with normal activities and persist for at least 2 weeks, in which case a diagnosis of a depressiv e illness or disorder ma y be made (Diamond, 2015).Along with apath y, depression is one of the most common affectiv e symptoms in Alzheimer 's disease (Nowr angi et al. , 2015). Almost one-third of long-term care residents have depressiv e symptoms, while an estimated 10% meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depressiv e disorder (Jordan et al. , 2014). Depression, although frequently present in those with Alzheimer 's disease, is much more persistent in dementia with Lewy bodies. Depressiv e symptoms in Alzheimer 's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are associated with a greater cognitiv e decline and, in Alzheimer 's disease, significantly relate to lower surviv al rates o ver a 3- year period (Vermeiren et al. , 2015). Causes o f Dep ressio n in Those w ith Dem entia Depression has been associated with an increased risk of dementia in old age, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. Sev eral possible mechanisms ha ve been proposed: (1) depression is a prodrome* of dementia, (2) depression reduces the threshold for dementia, and (3) depression leads to damage to neural systems, particularly the hippocampus, which contributes to the dev elopment of dementia (Olazar\u00e1n et al. , 2013). *Prodrome: an early symptom that may indicate the presence of a disease. Past or lifetime history of depression is known to increase the risk of dev eloping both Alzheimer 's disease and v ascular dementia. This is true ev en when depression occurred more than 10 y ears before the onset of dementia. A history of depression nearly doubles the risk of dev eloping dementia. This is further confirmed b y a study that demonstr ated increased plaque and tangle formation in the hippocampus of Alzheimer 's patients who had a lifetime history of depression. Prolonged damage to the hippocampus due to hypercortisolemia* link ed to depression has been proposed to underlie this finding (Muliy ala & V arghese, 2010). *Hypercortisolemia: abnormal, high levels of circulating cortisol, often cause by stress and leading to a \"fight or flight\" response. Vascular factors ma y play a role in depression and dementia. Cerebro vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other v ascular factors ma y cause both cognitiv e impairment and depression. Howev er, this potential role of cerebro vascular disease and other v ascular factors in the association between depression and dementia has barely been in vestigated (Olazar\u00e1n et al. , 2013). Management of Dep ressio nIn the long-term care population, depression is both common and under -treated. Depressive illness is associated with increased mortality, risk of chronic disease, and the requirement for higher levels of supported care (Jordan et al., 2014). Long-term care staff can play a key role in the detection, assessment, management, and ongoing monitoring of mental health disorders among those they care for . However, staff members usually receive little training in mental health and often hold misconceptions about disorders such as depression and the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. As a result, they have demonstrated poor skills in managing residents with these disorders (Jordan et al., 2014). Pharmacologic interventions are targeted at alleviating depressive symptoms primarily to improve quality of life and improve function (Nowrangi et al., 2015). Treatment of depression in patients with dementia has involved the use of tricyclic agents1, SSRIs2, and MAO inhibitors3 even though the evidence to support the effectiveness of these agents is weak (Muliyala & Varghese, 2010). 1Tricyclic agents: used to treat depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other disorders of mood. 2SSRIs : selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are used to treat major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders. 3MAO inhibitors : monoamine oxidase inhibitors are prescribed for the treatment of depression. Randomized controlled trials have evaluated the a recent multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled trial did not demonstrate efficacy for the treatment of depression with sertraline (Zoloft) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Muliyala & Varghese, 2010). Antidepressant treatment may reduce cognitive decline in depressed older Alzheimer's patients. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors* with SSRI may improve activities of daily living and global functioning in patients with dementia. Non-pharmacologic management of depression involves both patient-focused interventions as well as family and caregiver support. In one study, treatment with donepezil (Aricept) delayed progression to Alzheimer's disease among depressed subjects with mild cognitive impairment (Muliyala & Varghese, 2010). *Cholinesterase inhibitor : a drug that prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine, a chemical that helps with memory and thinking.Comparing Dementia, Delirium, and Depression Delirium Depression Dementia Onset Rapid, hours to days Rapid or slow Progressive, develops overs several years Cause Medications, infection, dehydration, metabolic changes, fecal impaction, urinary retention, hypo- and hyperglycemiaAlteration in neurotransmitter functionProgressive brain damage Duration Usually less than one month but can last up to a yearMonths, can be chronicYears to decades Course Reversible, cause can usually be identifiedUsually recover within months; can be relapsingNot reversible, ultimately fatal Level of consciousnessUsually changed, can be agitated, normal, or dull, hypo- or hyperactiveNormal or slowed Normal Orientation Impaired short-term memory, acutely confusedUsually intact Correct in mild cases; first loses orientation to time, then place and person Thinking Disorganized, incoherent, ramblingDistorted, pessimistic Impaired, impoverished Attention Usually disturbed, hard to direct or sustainDifficulty concentratingUsually intact Awareness Can be reduced, tends to fluctuateDiminished Alert during the day; may be hyperalertSource: Ad apted from Eliopoulos, 2010.Comparing Dementia, Delirium, and Depression Depression Sleep/waking Usually disrupted Hyper or hypo somnolenceNormal for age; cycle disrupted as the disease progresses Depressio n vs. Grief The diagnosis of dementia can cause grief related to actual or anticipated losses associated with the dementia diagnosis (Vroomen et al. , 2013). Good support following the initial diagnosis helps people adapt and pro vides opportunities to dev elop coping responses. Grief, like depression, can cause ph ysical symptoms such as shortness of breath, headaches, fatigue, a feeling of hea viness, and a lack of energy . Psychological symptoms associated with grief include clinical depression, h ypochondria, anxiet y, insomnia, and the inabilit y to get pleasure from normal daily activities. These issues can lead to self - destructiv e beha viors, such as alcohol or drug abuse. Grief is often associated with the man y losses experienced b y a person with dementia: Loss of ph ysical strength and abilities Increased confusion Loss of income and sa vings Loss of health insur ance Changes in housing and personal possessions, including loss of pets Loss of self -sufficiency , privacy, and self -esteem Changes in social contacts and roles The onset of dementia in a friend, spouse, or relativ e can also cause family members and caregiv ers to griev e due to: Loss of companionship Loss of income Loss of priv acy and free time Changes in social roles Changes in routineIn the early stage of dementia, counseling, assessment of co-morbid conditions, information about dementia, caregiv er training, and dev elopment of a care plan can help a person deal with grief . Unfortunately , these resources are often lacking. In later stages, mo ving a lo ved one to a care home can be the cause of immense grief and loss for people with dementia and for their caregiv ers. P eople with dementia newly admitted to an institution are often disoriented and disorganiz ed in their new en vironment and feel grief due to a loss of control o ver their liv es (Vroomen et al. , 2013). When a lo ved one dies, family members, and especially spouses, experience a period of acute grief that gener ally includes intrusiv e thoughts,* intense emotional distress, and withdr awal from normal daily activities. When a spouse dies, in addition to grief , about 28% of surviving spouses experience major depression. This period, along with the chronic grief that follows, ma y vary in length and intensit y from individual to individual and often resembles clinical depression (Monk et al. , 2013). *Intrusive thoughts: unwanted, involuntary thoughts, images or ideas that can be obsessive, distressing, or upsetting. This risk of depression appears to peak during the first six months of berea vement, although depressiv e symptoms can be present for up to two y ears. Ev en berea ved persons with minor depression ma y suffer , for they ha ve a greater lik elihood of functional impairment, poorer health, more ph ysician visits and mental health counseling, and increased use of antidepressants than do non-berea ved individuals (Monk et al. , 2013). Neuropsychiatric Sy mptoms of Dem entia Behavioral chological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) or neuropsy chiatric symptoms of dementia (NSP) occur in up to 90% of patients with dementia (P assmore, 2013). Neuropsy chiatric symptoms can r ange from mild (depression, anxiet y, irritabilit y, apath y) to sev ere (agitation, aggression, v ocalizations, hallucinations, disinhibition,* among others). S ymptoms can persist or recur o ver time and are associated with patient and caregiv er distress, increased r ates of institutionalization, and increased mortalit y (Nowr angi et al., 2015). *Disin hibition: a loss of inhibition, a lack of restraint, disregard for social convention, impulsiveness, poor safety awareness, an inability to stop strong responses, desires, or emotions.Management of neuropsy chiatric symptoms of dementia relies on the use of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ther apies based on treatments dev eloped for other psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately , there has been a lack of progress in the dev elopment of effectiv e treatments due to an incomplete understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these symptoms. Because of this, treatment str ategies are in response to behaviors and largely based on observ ation and experience r ather than on an understanding of the underlying cause (Nowr angi et al. , 2015). Among the man y neuropsy chiatric beha viors associated with Alzheimer 's disease and other types of dementia, depression,* apath y, agitation and aggression, and delusions and hallucinations (psy choses) are some of the most common. Challenging beha viors such as wandering, rummaging and hoarding, and sleep disturbances can arise and ma y or ma y not be related to neuropsy chiatric changes. *See M odule 4: The 3 D's: Dementia, Delirium, and Depression for more on depression. Non-Pharmacologic Approaches There is growing evidence to suggest that the management of neuropsy chiatric beha viors (particularly in long-term care) should shift from the tr aditional pr actice of medication- based symptom management to comprehensiv e non-pharmacologic approaches aimed at maintaining the ph ysical and emotional comfort of the individual. Such non-pharmacologic interv entions can be used with the individual or can be applied to the ph ysical setting or built en vironment (Soril et al. , 2014). Non-pharmacologic treatments for the challenging beha viors associated with dementia include cognitiv e beha vioral animal ther stimulation (Snoez elen*), among others. Non-pharmacologic interv entions can also be aimed at caregiv ers and include education, support, case management, and respite care (Nowr angi et al., 2015). *Snoezelen: a Sn oezelen or controlled multisensory environment room uses light, sound, scents, and music to initiate sensations. These have both relaxing and activating effec ts on the various parts of the brain related to sensory perception. The specific design directs and arranges the stimuli; it creates interest, brings back memories and guides relationships. Video: Snoezelen Room (2:07) Behavior ther apy using antecedent -beha vior-consequence (ABC), also called a problem- solving provide sustained impro vements vior. One meta- analysis found management techniques focused on individual patients' beha vior and individually oriented techniques pro vided longer (sev eral months) positiv e effects on beha vior when compared with placebo (Nowr angi et al. , 2015). Other studies ha ve shown that staff education leads to reductions in beha vioral outbursts and fewer episodes of restr aint use. In a meta- analysis b y Olazar\u00e1n and colleagues, the majorit y of the studies reviewed showed positiv e effects for impro vements in mood, behavior, and qualit y of life of persons with dementia while dela ying institutionalization (Nowr angi et al. , 2015). One effectiv e non-drug approach used to address challenging beha viors associated with dementia encour ages caregiv ers to problem solve \u2014to look for and understand the root cause of a beha vior. Treatment can include solving problems within the en vironment, managing medication issues, and br ainstorming with caregiv ers. The problem-solving approach encour ages caregiv ers and healthcare work ers to identif y critical points for interv ention based on observing the antecedent , behavior , and consequence (A, B , C) vior. what consequences of the beha vior? The ABC problem-solving approach is particularly effectiv e when successful str ategies are shared b y staff , caregiv ers, and family members and used to unco ver the cause of a particular beha vior. The ABC method helps staff and caregiv ers understand when and how often a beha vior occurs and offers the opportunit y for discussion and planning. In Norw ay, researchers work ed with healthcare work ers in a small rur al nursing home to identif y the effectiv eness of the problem-solving approach in addressing challenging behaviors in residents with dementia. A t the start of the study the healthcare work ers described what they understood about \u2014and how they responded to\u2014challenging behaviors. Most regarded challenging beha viors as a symptom of dementia, including physical attacks, such as hitting, spitting, and pinching (L ykkeslet et al. , 2014). One of the care work ers described her reaction to the beha vior of a female patient: I do not think she always knows that she pinches us. . . then we try to get away. . . we pretend that nothing has happened and her behavior is a great challenge to us, because her inhibitions against hitting and kicking are very low. Residents who w andered around or repeatedly said that they w anted to go home were also identified as a challenge. The caregiv ers regarded such beha vior as a symptom of dementia that affected other residents. They noted that when one patient w ants to go home, others also w ant to go home L ykkeslet et al. , 2014). All the time she wants to go someplace, but does not know where. She puts on a lot of clothes and walks around. . . if I tell her the truth about where she is she becomes irritated, resigned, or offended. During the course of the first y ear of the study the staff reported that, as a result of being encour aged to look for the cause of a beha vior, they began to get into the habit of searching for meaning in patients' beha vior and gr adually began to change their attitude toward the people they were caring for . Health work ers claimed they were learning to see peculiar beha vior more as a result of a challenging situation than as a symptom of a difficult patient (L ykkeslet et al. , 2014). One of the work ers ga ve an example of a patient who did not w ant to eat her food: She refuses to open her mouth, so it is impossible to feed her. Any new caregiver who helps her will often fail. When I assist her, I always start by touching her hand, holding her hand, and then she gradually starts to eat. The care work er added that this patient might ha ve misunderstood the situation and therefore did not trust the new caregiv er, who had to spend some time building trust.You cannot go straight to the task\u2014she needs some preparation to understand what is going on and what she has to do. By observing the patient 's reactions, the care work er understood that the patient needed time to prepare. She needed to understand that the situation w as a meal and that the care worker wished her well (L ykkeslet et al. , 2014). Another care work er told about how she began to understand patients with poor v erbal language. We try to read their body language. Perhaps she is in pain. . . sometimes she can tell us. . . other times we get no answer. Sometimes the care work ers sa w the beha vior as a response to a critical situation (\"because he is vulner able he becomes angry\"). As the study progressed, researchers began to observ e changes in the care pro vider's attitudes and approach to activities. They noted that when the caregiv ers experienced a situation as challenging, they more frequently started to reflect on the patients' needs (L ykkeslet et al. , 2014). For pragmatic suggestions that healthcare work ers can use when working with individuals who can no longer express themselv es appropriately , see A Train's course entitled Dementia Care: Common Sense Guidelines. Dementia and Apathy Apathy is described as a lack of interest or emotion and ma y be an early symptom of cognitiv e impairment, especially in frontal-tempor al dementia. The prev alence of apath y increases with the sev erity of dementia. Apath y is different from depression although apath y and depressiv e symptoms ma y occur together (V olicer & v an der Steen, 2014). For a diagnosis of apath y, the diminished motiv ation must persist for no less than four weeks, and two of the following three dimensions should be present: Reduced goal-directed beha vior 1. Reduced goal-directed cognitiv e y Reduced emotions (R ea et al. , 2014) 3.Location of the Amygdala in the Human Brain The figure shows the underside of a human brain, with the front of the brain at the top. The red areas show the approximate location of the amygdala in the temporal lobes of the human brain. Source: kimedia Commons.Although symptom of neurodegener ative and other br ain disorders it is one of the most under -recogniz ed, under -diagnosed, and poorly managed aspects of these diseases (Leroi & R obert, 2012). It is the cause of distress for caregiv ers because it places the responsibilit y for da y-in and da y-out decisions on the caregiv er. Over time, anger and conflicts inevitably follow between patients and caregiv ers. This mak es apath y a risk factor for institutionalization (R ea et al. , 2014). Causes o f Apathy In Alzheimer 's disease, apath y is associated with loss of nerv e cells within specific parts of the br ain. In the past, apath y was classified as a motiv ational loss not attributable to emotional stress, cognitiv e impairment, or consciousness reduction. Apath y has since been related to disconnection of certain br ain circuits, including the am ygdala, which receiv es nerv e impulses from various parts of the br ain. This suggests that impaired cholinergic neurotr ansmission is involved in apath y pathoph ysiology (R ea et al., 2014). Amygdala : part of the limbic system, associated with memory , decision-making, and emotions. Cholinergic neurotransmission : a receptor is it ylcholine as its neurotr ansmitter . The cholinergic system is involved in the regulation of memory and learning. Management of Apathy At present apath y accompan ying Alzheimer 's disease is a disorder not largely in vestigated and its treatment remains a challenge. Only a few treatments ha ve been proposed, but so far there is no clear demonstr ation of the adv antage of one treatment o ver others (R ea et al. , 2014). Four categories of drugs are currently used to treat apath y in people with Alzheimer 's dementia. These include:1 2 1 2 Cholinester ase inhibitors (inhibits the breakdown of acet ycholine) et al. , 2014) 4.Agitation and Aggression The terms agitation and aggression are often used in reference to beha vioral symptoms associated with dementia. Agitation refers to observ able, non-specific, restless beha viors that are ex cessiv e, inappropriate, and repetitiv e. This can include v erbal, v ocal, or motor activit y (Burns et al. , 2012). Aggression involves ph ysically or v erbally threatening beha viors directed at people, or Aggressiv e beha viors are gener ally perceiv ed as a threat to the safet y of those with dementia and to those around them, which includes family caregiv ers, staff , and other residents. Aggression is often described b y specific acts such as: Verbal insults Shouting, screaming Obscene language Hitting, punching, kicking Pushing and throwing objects Sexual aggression (Burns et al., 2012) Agitation and aggression occur in about 50% to 80% of nursing home residents with cognitiv e impairments (Ahn & Horgas, 2013). Men are more lik ely than women to engage in aggressiv e beha viors. Cognitively impaired people are more lik ely to engage in non- aggressiv e physical beha viors (such as pacing). Functionally impaired people are more likely to engage in v erbally agitated beha viors (complaining, v ocal outbursts) (P elletier & Landreville, 2007). Causes o f Agitation and Aggressio n Agitated and aggressiv e beha viors are a t ype of communication often related to feelings of helplessness, loss of control, discomfort, pain, or fear . Agitation and aggression can be a response to a violation of personal space or a perceiv ed threat. These beha viors often occur during personal care tasks in volving close caregiv er-resident contact (Burns et al. , 2012). Physiologically , aggression ma y be related to a decrease in the activit y of serotonin or reduced tr ansmission of acet ylcholine in the br ain. Frontal lobe dysfunction has also been implicated. Aggression ma y also be related to underlying depression or psy chotic symptoms (Burns et al. , 2012).Pain severity is associated with the frequency of agitated and aggressive behaviors. Nursing home residents with more severe pain are more likely to display these behaviors (Ahn & Horgas, 2013). Management of Agitation and Aggression To understand and prevent agitation and aggression, consider the antecedent: What precipitated the behavior? Observe the person and try to determine the cause of the agitation. Look for patterns. Use one of the many available rating scales\u2014such as the Rating Scale for Aggressive behavior in the Elderly (RAGE)\u2014to assess aggressive behaviors. For agitated behaviors rating instruments such as the Brief Agitation Rating Scale can be used to assess the different aspects of agitation (Burns et al. , 2012). Psychosocial and environmental interventions can reduce or even eliminate agitated or aggressive behaviors. Music therapy, massage, craniosacral therapy,* therapeutic touch, acupressure, and tactile massage have been shown to be successful for treating aggression. In addition, individual behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, Montessori activities, and individualized person-centered care based on psychosocial management is recommended (Burns et al., 2012). *Craniosacral therapy : a hands-on technique that uses soft touch to release restrictions in the soft tissue surrounding the central nervous system. For people with dementia, antipsychotics may reduce aggression and psychosis, particularly among those most severely agitated. However, in older people, antipsychotics are associated with increased overall mortality, worsening cognitive impairment, hip fracture, diabetes, and stroke (Jordan et al., 2014).Case My mom Kimberly has dementia and my sister and I take turns staying with her at her home. She's a pretty quiet person but a couple of years ago she starting getting really agitated and angry in the evening\u2014we blamed this on her dementia. It got so bad that we thought about sedating her but a nurse practitioner suggested we try to figure out what was causing her agitation using the problem-solving approach. We watched her behavior carefully and finally figured out that she was getting really cold in the evening\u2014even when it was warm outside. She didn't tell us she was cold but when we asked she said \"I'm freezing.\" Once we realized what was wrong, we ordered special heated slippers and also got an electric mattress pad so her bed is nice and warm when she goes to bed. It sounds simple but it took us a long time to figure it out because she doesn't complain. Now she's rarely\u2014actually she's never\u2014agitated or angry in the evening! Family Caregiv er, Santa R osa, California Delusions and Hallucinations (Psychosis) Psychosis is a disturbance in the perception or appreciation of objectiv e realit y (Burns et al., 2012) and can include delusions and hallucinations. A delusion is a false idea or belief or a misinterpretation of a situation. Hallucinations are sensory ev ents in which a person hears, tastes, smells, sees, or feels something that is not there. Delusions and hallucinations can occur in people with dementia, with hallucinations particularly common in those with P arkinson' s disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. In fact, the presence of recurrent visual hallucinations has been identified as one of the core features in the clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies. Delusions and hallucinations can trigger other neuropsy chiatric symptoms, such as agitation or aggression, which can lead to early nursing home admission (V ermeiren et al. , 2015). Causes o f Psychosis Delusions and hallucinations can be caused b y health factors such as urinary tr act infections, en vironmental factors such as poor lighting or sensory o verload, or a reaction to certain medications. Changes in the br ain can also contribute to these beha viors, especially changes related to sensory a wareness, memory , and decreased abilit y to communicate or be understood.People suffering from delusions and par anoia can become suspicious of caregiv ers or friends. Sensory deficits can contribute to delusions and hallucinations due to the distortion of sound or sight. Visual hallucinations can occur in the moder ate to sev ere stages of dementia and are particularly common in those with Lewy body dementia. While at ypical antipsy chotics are sometimes used off -label to manage hallucinations, in a person with Lewy body dementia antipsy chotic medications can mak e hallucinations worse. In a person with new onset of visual hallucinations, the number one cause is medication side effects. F or this reason, all medications should be carefully reviewed. This includes prescription and o ver-the-counter (OTC) medications, as well as herbal supplements. Management of Psychosis The first step in the management of delusions and hallucinations is to rule out delirium as a cause (see Module 4 for more on delirium). Another important factor is to determine if the claims b y the person with dementia actually did occur (Burns et al. , 2012). At present, antipsy chotics are the primary pharmacologic treatment option used to alleviate depression and psy chosis in Alzheimer 's disease\u2014 although they ma y induce serious side effects, increase mortalit y rates, and their efficacy is \"modest \" at best. The administr ation of psy chotropic medication has also been associated with a more r apid cognitiv e and functional decline, and not necessarily with impro ved neuropsy chiatric symptoms (V ermeiren et al. , 2015). The pharmacologic treatment of neuropsy chiatric symptoms of dementia in those with dementia with Lewy bodies requires a cautious approach. All drugs with anticholinergic side effects, such as tricy for bladder or gastrointestinal tr act, should be avoided due to their potential to exacerbate psy chotic symptoms. Finally , the administr ation of memantine (Namenda) ma y result in v ariable symptomatic side effects in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, including worsening of psy chosis or ev en an adverse drug reaction (V ermeiren et al. , 2015). From a non-pharmacologic standpoint, psy chotic beha viors can often be successfully managed b y observing the beha vior and listening to what the person experiencing the paranoia or delusion has to sa y. Is the feeling pleasant or frightening? If the hallucination elicits a fearful or negativ e response, address the person' s need to regain comfort. F or example, y ou ma y ask \"What will mak e you feel safe or comfortable?\"When communicating with someone who is expressing par anoia or delusions, realiz e that even if their complaint is not true, it is real for that person. It is best not to argue; simply explaining the truth of the situation will not work. Do not agree with the person or further validate the par anoia or delusion, but respond to the person' s emotion. Decreasing auditory and visual stimuli can help in managing hallucinations. It ma y also be helpful to ha ve the person ev aluated for visual or hearing impairment. Delusions and hallucinations can be addressed using beha vioral interv entions or , in some cases, antipsy chotic medication (Burns et al. , 2012). Here are some other suggestions for addressing hallucinations: Reduce stimulation in the en vironment \u2014minimiz e violent or noisy TV , remo ve wall hangings, reduce noise, pla y relaxing music. Cover mirrors. Reduce glare from windows. Ensure adequate lighting. Review medications for potential side effects. Other Challeng ing Behavioral Issues Although man y of the challenging beha viors seen in Alzheimer 's disease and other t ypes of dementia are associated with changes to the br ain, other beha viors ma y be only partly related to dementia. Isolation, loneliness, frustr ation, constipation, pain, feeling too cold or hot, and boredom can lead to repetitiv e beha viors such as w andering, rummaging, and hoarding. A person ma y be o ver-medicated or be receiving medications with un wanted side effects. It is not uncommon for sleep to be disrupted, particularly with those living in a nursing facilit y. Man y of these things would frustr ate an yone\u2014not only a person with dementia. Wandering or \"Walking About\" Wandering is a broad term encompassing a div erse set of beha viors. It can include aimless locomotion with a repetitiv e pattern, h yperactivit y, and ex cessiv e walking, as well as lea ving a safe en vironment and becoming lost alone in the communit y (Rowe et al. , 2011).Wandering gener ally falls into two categories: goal-directed, in which residents attempt to reach an unobtainable goal (such as going home or to the store), and non-goal-directed, in which the resident w ander aimlessly . Wandering patterns v ary and can include mo ving to a specific location, lapping or circling along a path or tr ack, pacing back and forth, or wandering at r andom. R esidents with Alzheimer 's disease are more lik ely to w ander than those diagnosed with other t ypes of dementias. The Alzheimer 's Association estimates that up to 60% of persons with dementia will \"wander \" into the communit y at some point during the course of their disease (R owe et al. , 2011). In nursing homes, w andering occurs in about half of residents with dementia (Ahn & Horgas, 2013). Causes o f Wandering People with Alzheimer 's disease are more lik ely to w ander than those diagnosed with other types of dementias. W andering is more prev alent in men and in y ounger people with dementia. Those with frontal-tempor al dementia ha ve a greater tendency to pacing and lapping beha viors whereas those with Alzheimer 's disease are more inclined to engage in random locomotion. W andering in the form of restlessness, with a compelling need for movement or pacing, has been link ed to side effects of psy chotropic medications, particularly antipsy chotics (Burns et al. , 2012). Wandering is often related to boredom, pain and discomfort, disorientation, and memory problems. P eople ma y wander out of habit or because they think something from their past needs to be done, such as going home after work, w alking the dog, getting ex ercise, or searching for something they think they ha ve lost. A person' s pre-dementia lifest yle ma y be a factor in whether they are lik ely to w ander . Studies ha ve indicated that people with the following char acteristics are more lik ely than others to w ander: Those with an activ e physical and mental interest in music Those who ha ve an extro verted personalit y showing w armth, positiv e emotion, altruism Those who were v ery in volved with social activities and were activ e in social-seeking behaviors Those who were ph ysically active Those who experienced stressful ev ents throughout their life, necessitating multiple readjustments Those who respond to stress by engaging in motor activities (Futrell et al. , 2010)Management of Wandering Best pr actice in management of hospitaliz ed older adults with dementia who w ander involves: Identif ying risk for w andering Providing appropriate supervision Reducing en vironmental triggers for w andering and Using individualiz ed nursing interv entions to address the causes of w andering behavior (HIGN, 2012) Wandering can be a beneficial activit y if there are safe places to w ander , in and around a facilit y or home. Management of w andering should include a regular review of medications to mak e sure w andering is not the result of medication side effects, o vermedicating, or drug inter actions. The most important goal is to prev ent a person from w andering into unsafe areas, other resident 's rooms, or a way from the facilit y. Additional str ategies to manage w andering include: Redirecting to a purposeful activit y Providing safe, looping wandering paths with interesting rest areas Providing regular ex ercise Engaging a person in simple chores such as folding laundry or assisting with dinner Reducing ex cessiv e noise levels Avoiding medications that increase fall risk Putting up visual barriers on exit doors such as stop signs Using electronic devices attached to the person' s ankle or wrist that alert staff or family when someone has w andered out of a designated area Installing alarms on entryw ays into unsafe areas or to the outside Putting up ph ysical barriers such as y ellow tape to prev ent w andering into unsupervised areas Subjectiv e barriers such as grid patterns on the floor in front of exit doors, camouflage, and concealment of doors and doorknobs ma y discour age a w anderer from exiting a building.

Case Mrs. Winkler has moderate dementia. A nursing assistant has wheeled her to the activities room and left her there. After about 20 minutes, Mrs. Winkler decides to leave the activities room. She heads down the hall and is stopped several times by staff, all of whom turn her back toward the activities room\u2014usually with a reprimand. As soon as the staff member is gone, Mrs. Winkler turns around and continues on her way. She stops near the elevator, where she sits for about 10 minutes watching people come and go. Several staff members pass her and sternly tell her not to get on the elevator. Each staff member leaves her in exactly the same place next to the elevator. Finally, when no one is looking, Mrs. Winkler wheels into the elevator. The door closes and the elevator takes off for the ground floor. Antecedent : Mrs. Winkler is a curious person and always liked walking around the city for exercise. She liked exploring the various neighborhoods. She was never one to sit around doing nothing. Mrs. Winkler can propel herself independently in the wheelchair but is no longer able to think logically or understand the consequences of her decisions. The elevator is interesting and looks like fun. People keep walking by and talking to her although she doesn't understand or remember what they are saying. Behavior : The door to the elevator is an interesting visual cue. When a door opens, it is a common reaction to pass through it. The opening door cues Mrs. Winkler to wheel into the elevator. When the door opens on the ground floor, she wheels herself out of the elevator without knowing where she is. Her behavior is consistent with her personality and her previous habits. Consequence : Once she gets into the elevator, Mrs. Winkler's inability to think logically puts her at great risk. If she were to exit the elevator next to a door that leads out of the building, she could wander into the street. People not familiar with her may be unaware she has dementia and is unable to exercise good judgment. Discussion : Mrs. Winkler cannot understand the danger and does not remember the warnings to stay out of the elevator. One solution is to alter the environment. Move Mrs. Winkler to a place where she cannot see or hear the elevator. Try to determine the reason for her wandering. Review medications to make sure wandering is not the result of medication side effects, over-medicating, or drug interactions. People wander out of habit and because they are restless, bored, or, disoriented. Use the following suggestions to keep Mrs. Winkler out of the elevator: Redirect her to a purposeful activity.Provide a place where she can wander safely. Provide her with regular exercise. Engage her in simple, meaningful chores. Review her medications. Attach an electronic device to Mrs. Winkler's ankle or wrist that alerts caregivers when she has wandered out of a designated area. Paint a grid in front of the elevator to discourage her getting into the elevator. Place a plastic vertical PVC pole on the back of her wheelchair and a horizontal pole across the entrance to the elevator so that she is physically stopped from entering the elevator. Encourage a family member to take her for a stroll outside the building or for a ride in a car. Rummaging and Hoarding Rummaging and hoarding refer to beha viors in which a person gathers, hides, or puts a way items in a secretiv e and guarded manner . These actions are considered a t ype of obsessiv e-compulsiv e beha vior. Rummaging and hoarding are not necessarily dangerous or unsafe but they can be frustr ating for caregiv ers, residents, and family members. Causes o f Rummaging and Hoarding In people with dementia, hoarding can arise due to lack of control, a fear of losing money or possessions, the need to \"sa ve for a r ainy day,\" confusion, or simply to ha ve something to do. Hoarding is associated with insecurit y and anger and ma y be an attempt to hold onto possessions and memories from the past. Confusion can lead to rummaging through another person' s belongings, which can be particularly frustr ating for neighboring residents. Cognitiv e changes can contribute to the impulse to rummage and hoard. P eople ma y obsess about something they think has been misplaced. They ma y have a fear of being robbed or feel a need to protect their own possessions. R ummaging through familiar items may create a sense of safet y and securit y. Management of Rummaging and HoardingTo address rummaging and hoarding beha viors, try to determine what triggers or causes the beha vior and look at the consequences, if an y. Put y ourself in the other person' s head \u2014the reason for rummaging and hoarding ma y not be clear to y ou but there ma y be a perfectly good reason wh y someone with dementia is rummaging. Rummaging through another person' s belongings can be prev ented b y installing locks on drawers and closets. The rummaging impulse might be satisfied b y creating a rummaging room or a bag or dr awer of items that can be pick ed through. Placing restrictions on rummaging and hoarding can be frustr ating for a person who enjo ys these activities. If possible, place important items such as credit cards or k eys out of reach or in a lock ed cabinet. Consider ha ving mail deliv ered to a post office bo x and check w astepaper bask ets before disposing of tr ash. Other recommendations: Look for patterns. Get rid of poisonous items such as caustic liquids and poisonous plants. Label cabinets, doors, and closets with words or pictures to help the person find what they are looking for . Reduce clutter . Observ e carefully to learn the person' s hiding places. Check garbage for missing items. Case I used to work at a large nursing home in an urban area in northern California. One wing of the nursing home faced an alley where homeless people sometimes slept. Unfortunately, the sliding glass doors in rooms 1 through16 opened onto this alley and for some reason the doors were left unlocked day and night. Several residents with dementia began to complain loudly that they were losing things from their rooms. They spent a great deal of time obsessing about the lost items and rummaged all over the place, including in other residents' rooms looking for lost items. The staff, almost to a person, associated the rummaging and complaints with the residents' dementia. After several months of trying everything from activities to antipsychotics, one of the occupational therapists noted during a staff meeting that several doors were ajar when she walked to the grocery store via the alley. She suggested we try locking the sliding glass doors in the residents' rooms. It turned out that several of the doors didn't even have locks on them and didn't even close properly. The facility fixed the doors and added surveillance cameras in the alley. Sure enough the cameras revealed that someone had been entering the residents' rooms and stealing items. Once the doors were fixed and locked much of the complaining and rummaging subsided. It turns out, at least in this case, that items really were missing from residents' rooms. Registered Nurse, Berkeley, CA Sleep Disturbances Sleep disturbances are v ery common among older adults and are of particular concern in people with dementia. Sleep disturbances probably contribute to the onset and sev erity of some beha vioral problems, particularly anxiet y, increased confusion, w andering, and sundowning.* *Sundowning: increased confusion and restlessness in the late afternoon and early evening, possibly due to damage to the part of the brain that regulates sleep patterns. The symptoms of sleep disruption v ary according to the t ype of dementia and ma y present with the following features: Increased sleep latency (difficult y getting to sleep) Nocturnal sleep fr agmentation (waking often) Increased early -morning awakeningsDecreased total sleep time Decreased sleep efficiency (how much time y ou are actually asleep) Decreased slow -wave and r apid-ey e-movement (REM) sleep Nocturnal confusion (episodes of delirium or disorientation during sleep) Increased da ytime napping and excessiv e daytime sleepiness Other beha vioral and psychological symptoms such as agitation, v erbally disruptiv e behaviors, hallucinations, and nighttime wandering (Burns et al. , 2012) Causes o f Sleep Disturbances Studies ha ve suggested that appro ximately one-quarter to one-third of those with Alzheimer 's disease ha ve problems with sleep , partly due to the degener ation of neurons in the part of the br ain that controls circadian rh ythms. Sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, medical and psy chiatric issues, and en vironmental and beha vioral factors often predate the onset of dementia. Chronic pain also interferes with sleep and disturbed sleep reduces the pain threshold (Deschenes & McCurry , 2009). Medications used to treat the psy chological and beha vioral symptoms of dementia, as well as those used to slow the progression of dementia, can negativ ely affect da ytime alertness and can cause sleep disturbances. Short -term sleep disturbances in people with dementia are often treated with antidepressants, benz odiazepines, or non-benz odiazepines. There is limited evidence to support their long-term safet y in cognitiv ely impaired older adults (Deschenes & McCurry , 2009). Management of Sleep Disturbances Before treating sleep disturbances, look for potentially treatable causes such as pain, hunger and thirst, the need to urinate, infections, adv erse drug reactions, and ev en noise. Some non-pharmacologic treatments that ha ve been used successfully in nursing homes to treat sleep disorders include: Light ther apy High-intensit y or ambient light in morning or ev ening Full-spectrum light bo x Melatonin with light ther apy Bright light exposure during the da y Good sleep h ygiene pr actices Get up at the same time ev ery morning and go to bed at the same time ev ery nightTurn on music or r adio at bedtime Provide a comfortable and warm bed Empty bladder before bedtime Limit da ytime napping Other T reatments Exercise during the da y Individualiz ed social activities Restriction or elimination of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol Calm atmosphere Biofeedback (Deschenes & McCurry , 2009) Challenging Behaviors and Adverse Drug Events Older people are susceptible to adv erse drug ev ents due to chronic medical conditions, age-related ph ysiologic changes, and polypharmacy . In people with dementia, functional impairment ma y mak e them more susceptible to adv erse drug ev ents, falls, fr actures, and excess sedation. Despite these dangers, population-based research suggests that older people continue to tak e drugs with an unfa vorable risk -to-benefit r atio. Despite guidelines advising against the use of drugs with sedativ e or anticholinergic properties in people with Alzheimer 's disease, such drugs remain widely used in people with Alzheimer 's disease (Gnjidic et al. , 2014). Among people with Alzheimer 's disease in Europe, 23% used anticholinergic drugs with significant or moder ate effects. In people with adv anced dementia in institutional care in the United States, 28% used antipsy chotics and 54% used antidepressants. P otentially inappropriate drugs, defined using the Beers Criteria,* were used b y 20% of older adults with dementia living in the communit y in the United States (Gnjidic et al. , 2014). *Beer s Criteria: In 1991 Beers and colleagues published an expert consensus document that attempted to establish criteria for identifying medications that are inappropriate for use in older adults. The Beers criteria are commonly used to identify \"potentially inappropriate medications\" for older adults, meaning the risk may outweigh the benefit.Several studies ha ve emphasiz ed the need to a void drugs that affect cognition or induce delirium when treating patients with co-existing cognitiv e impairment. Memory loss, decline in intellectual function, and impaired judgment and language ha ve a negativ e impact on decision making and often influence treatment adherence. These cognitiv e changes can also cause communication difficulties, which can affect a person' s abilit y to report adv erse effects. F or this reason the use of drugs to treat non-dementia illnesses in older adults with sev ere cognitiv e impairment ma y lead to serious adv erse effects, ev en when clearly beneficial drugs recommended b y clinical guidelines are prescribed. These concerns represent barriers to pharmacologic treatment of complex patients with sev ere cognitiv e impairment and should be carefully ev aluated b y prescribing healthcare pro viders when treating older persons with this dementia (Colloca et al. , 2012). Rejection of Care Because those with dementia ma y not understand the need for care, they ma y not cooper ate with the caregiv er and ma y actually activ ely resist caregiv er's attempts to provide care. If the caregiv er persists in trying to pro vide care, the person with dementia may become combativ e and ma y be called \"abusiv e.\" In addition, depression ma y cause \"abusiv e beha vior\" even in absence of rejection of care (V olicer & v an der Steen, 2014). Rejection of care can include rejecting an ev aluation or rejecting specific aspects of care such as blood work, medications, or assistance with activities of daily living. It is not considered rejection of care if a patient 's somnolence prev ents the person from sw allowing medications nor does it include aggressiv e beha viors intended to harm others. The prevalence of rejection of care increases with sev erity of dementia because of increased lack of understanding of caregiv er's intent and ma y be present in up to 35% of nursing home residents (V olicer & v an der Steen, 2014). Using Restraints to Control Challenging Behaviors A physical restraint is an y device, material, or equipment attached to or near a person' s body that can neither be controlled nor easily remo ved by the person, and that deliber ately prevents or is deliber ately intended to prev ent a person' s free body mo vement to a position of choice or a person' s normal access to the body (Lai et al. , 2011). Restraint also includes using (or threatening) force to mak e a person do something that resists or restricts their mo vements, whether or not they resist (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2009). The prev aries to 56% as reported in existing liter ature (Lai et al. , 2011). The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987The Omnibus Budget R econciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87) established a resident 's right to be free of restr aints in nursing homes when used for the purpose of discipline or convenience and when not required to treat the resident 's medical symptoms. R elated regulations specif y that uncooper ativeness, restlessness, w andering, or unsociabilit y are not sufficient reasons to justif y the use of antipsy chotic medications (Agens, 2010). Use of restr aints should be: Reserv ed for documented indications Time limited and Frequently re-ev aluated for their indications, effectiv eness, and side effects in each patient (Agens, 2010) In most states the use of ph ysical and chemical restr aints on nursing home patients is illegal. Types of ph ysical restr aints can include v ests, str aps, wrist ties, splints, mitts, belts, recliners, geri-chairs, lap boards, and bedside r ails, among others. Sev eral studies ha ve demonstr ated that carefully planned restr aint-reduction progr amming reduce the use of ph ysical restr aining devices (Lai et al. , 2011). The use of ph ysical restr aints (including belts) can increase the risk of death or serious injury and can increase the length of a hospital sta y. Their use ma y also indicate a failure to address the real needs of residents and patients. Both prolonged and short periods of physical restr aint use are associated with pressure sores, loss of muscle strength and endur ance, joint contr actures, incontinence, demor alization, humiliation, feelings low self-worth, depression, aggression, and impaired social functioning (Gulpers et al. , 2010). The use of ph ysical restr aints also creates an ethical dilemma b y impinging on a person' s autonom y. Their use is associated with increased instances of falling, the dev elopment of hospital- associated infections, and cognitiv e decline. R estraints also increase dependency in activities of daily living and w alking (Lai et al. , 2011). Overall, in U .S. nursing homes, ph ysical restr aint use has steadily declined to about 1.7%, although antipsy chotic use as a chemical restr aint is still common, with nearly 25% of residents receiving some sort of antipsy chotic medication (CMS , 2013). These statistics do not include side r ails and bed r ails.A recent study has r aised some troubling issues, indicating that restr aint use is higher among black nursing home residents than among whites. The researchers look ed at the use of fiv e types of restr aints: bed r ails, side r ails, trunk restr aints, bed restr aints, and chair restr aints. The results indicated that some sort of restr aint w as used on 50% of black residents but on only 38% of white residents (Cassie & Cassie, 2013). The differences were particularly evident with bed r ails, side r ails, and trunk restr aints. Reducing Restraints in Clinical Practice Many attempts ha ve been made to reduce restr aint use in clinical pr actice. Most interv entions ha ve used educational approaches, aiming to impro ve nursing staff knowledge and confidence to a void ph ysical restr aints and to use alternativ e measures that target the resident 's underlying problems (Gulpers et al. , 2010). In a small Dutch study in volving thirt y residents, education, institutional changes, and alternativ e interv entions resulted in a significant reduction in the use of belt restr aints. Belts were replaced with resident -centered interv entions such as mo vement and balance training, lower beds, hip protectors, extr a supervision, and monitoring devices (video camer a, sensor mat, and infr ared alarm systems) (Gulpers et al. , 2010). Other str ategies ha ve been used as an alternativ e to ph ysical restr aints. R educing clutter , keeping hallw ays free of equipment and obstacles, and liber al use of r ails, gr ab bars, and transfer poles in rooms, bathrooms, hallw ays, and common areas is recommended. A friendly , uncluttered, home-lik e environment pro vides a safe and effectiv e alternativ e to physical restr aints. Other suggestions related to the en vironment: Redesign the location of nursing stations so they are part of a home-lik e design. Provide pressure-relief wheelchair and chair cushions to impro ve comfort. Lower wheelchairs to allow self-propelling with feet. Provide comfortable, easy-to-access alternativ e seating. Install carpeting to reduce injury from falls. Psychosocial policies and activities can also assist in reducing or eliminating the use of restraints. Establishing a routine, including a toileting schedule, will impro ve comfort and reduce anxiet y. Regular ex ercise and comfortable places to rest and nap are important. Other psy chosocial suggestions: Assess and treat hunger , thirst, and discomfort. Change medications or taper medications with adv erse effects. Treat all underlying causes, including pain.Assess hearing and vision. Establish a nap schedule. Relieve impaction. Pain in Those with Cognitive Impairment The assessment of pain in people with cognitiv e impairment is a significant challenge. Cognitiv ely impaired patients tend to v oice fewer pain complaints but ma y become agitated or manifest unusual or sudden changes in beha vior when they are in pain. Caregiv ers ma y have difficult y knowing when these patients are in pain and when they are experiencing pain relief . This mak es cognitiv ely impaired patients vulner able to both under -treatment and o ver-treatment. Pain management is a particular challenge for patients with adv anced dementia and at the end of life. Although pain is not the main symptom of dementia, people with dementia often ha ve pain because of chronic conditions such as arthritis or from diseases such as urinary tr act infections. P ain perception is not diminished in Alzheimer 's disease but ma y actually be increased. Howev er, pain perception ma y vary according to the t ype of dementia; for example, those with frontal-tempor al dementia ma y have an increased pain threshold and pain toler ance (V olicer & v an der Steen, 2014). Detection and diagnosis of pain in residents with adv anced dementia is one of the most important factors in their total care. Nurses and other healthcare pro viders ma y feel uncertain about pain in residents with dementia, especially if the resident is unable to report when they are in pain. P atients with adv anced dementia are less able to respond to pain scales, necessitating the use of observ ational scales in up to about half of patients. More than half of residents who were dying with adv anced dementia experienced pain in the last week of life that w as not satisfactorily managed (V olicer & v an der Steen, 2014). Several observ ational scales for measuring pain in non-communicativ e patients ha ve been developed. One commonly used scale is the P ain Assessment in Adv anced Dementia (PAINAD). It is able to distinguish effect of analgesics and difference between v arious severities of pain (V olicer & v an der Steen, 2014). This tool w as dev eloped b y a team of clinicians at the E.N. R ogers Memorial V A Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts and in volves the assessment of breathing, negativ e vocalization, facial expression, body language, and consolabilit y. Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) 0 1 2 Score* Breathing Normal Occasional labored breathing Short period of hyperventilationNoisy labored breathing Long period of hyperventilation Cheyne-Stokes respirations Negative vocalizationNone Occasional moan/groan Low level speech with a negative or disapproving qualityRepeated, troubled calling out Loud moaning or groaning Crying Facial expressionSmiling or inexpressiveSad Frightened FrownFacial grimacing Body languageRelaxed Tense Distressed Pacing FidgetingRigid Fists clenched Knees pulled up Pulling/pushing away Striking out ConsolabilityNo need to consoleDistracted or reassured by voice or touchUnable to console, distract, or reassure PAINAD Scoring: 1-3 = Mild; 4-6 = Moderate; 7-10 = Severe * Some institutions have developed policies in which a PAINAD score of four or greater must be addressed in the nursing care plan. Public domain.Total: Interventions and TreatmentsTreatment seeks to impro ve qualit y of life and maximiz e function b y addressing cognitiv e, mood, and beha vioral impairments, as well as to treat an y modifiable or rev ersible causes of impairment (USPSTF , 2013). In the management of Alzheimer 's disease, a multimodal approach is necessary . Pharmaceutical Interventions Pharmaceuticals, primarily cholinester ase inhibitors, antipsy chotics, and antidepressants are commonly used in older adults with dementia. These medications are gener ally used (1) to treat or slow the progression of symptoms associated with dementia, (2) to manage neuropsy chiatric symptoms of dementia, and (3) as chemical restr aints. Increasing the Lev els o f Acet ylcholine Glutamate Although there are no ther apeutic interv entions that can stop the progression or rev erse the deterior ation caused b y Alzheimer 's disease, there are four FDA -appro ved pharmaceuticals, currently prescribed, that ma y tempor arily slow cognitiv e, functional, and behavioral decline: Inhibit cholinester ase Increase glutamate lev els The first three medications work b y increasing the lev els of acet ylcholine, a neurotr ansmitter in the br ain in volved in learning and memory . Cholinester ase inhibitors are indicated for the treatment of individuals in the mild to moder ate stages of Alzheimer 's disease (DeFina et al. , 2013). The fourth medication, memantine, works b y increasing the lev els of glutamate, another chemical implicated in learning and memory . This drug is indicated for the treatment of moder ate to sev ere Alzheimer 's disease. There is evidence that memantine ma y provide added benefits for individuals with Alzheimer 's disease who are already taking donepezil (Aricept). Ov erall, the benefits of these drugs are limited, are effectiv e for only a short period of time (about one y ear), and work in only about half of individuals for whom they are prescribed (DeFina et al. , 2013). AntipsychoticsDonepezil (Aricept)1. (Namenda)4.Antipsy chotics, also known as major tr anquiliz ers and neuroleptics, are a group of drugs used to treat psy chiatric conditions. They were first dev eloped in the 1950s to manage psychiatric symptoms associated mostly with schiz ophrenia and bipolar disorder . There are two antipsy chotics: the at ypical ved by Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) in the 1990s for the treatment of schiz ophrenia. In short order , these medications began to be used for the treatment of beha vioral and psy chological symptoms of dementia, particularly for delusions, depression, and agitation. The use of these drugs in people with dementia is fr aught with contro versy, partly because of serious side effects and partly because they ha ve only a modest effect on the beha vioral and cognitiv e symptoms of dementia. No at ypical antipsy chotic is FDA -appro ved for the treatment of an y neuropsy chiatric symptoms in dementia (Steinberg & L yketsos, 2012). For older people with dementia, antipsy chotics ma y reduce aggression and psy chosis, particularly among those most sev erely agitated. Howev er, antipsy chotics are associated with increased o verall mortalit y, worsening cognitiv e impairment, hip fr acture, diabetes, and strok e. Withdr awal of medication can reduce falls and impro ve verbal fluency , but aggressiv e beha vior ma y return, particularly among those with the most sev ere symptoms (Jordan et al. , 2014). Attention to the misuse of antipsy chotic drugs, particularly the newer at ypical antipsy chotic drugs, w as brought to public attention b y Lucette Lagnado , writing in the Wall Street Journal in December 2007. She reported that at ypical antipsy chotic drugs are often used off-label* in nursing facilities. Lagnado described sev eral reasons for this, including the 1987 Nursing Home R eform La w's limits on the use of ph ysical restr aints, off -label marketing of antipsy chotic drugs b y drug companies, and insufficient staffing (Center for Medicare Adv ocacy , 2013). *Off label: the use of a drug in an unapproved age group, for an unapproved purpose, or in an unapproved manner. Several large clinical trials ha ve demonstr ated an increased risk of mortalit y with the use of atypical antipsy chotics in older adults with dementia. All at ypical antipsy chotics now carry a black bo x warning from the FDA about this risk, and a similar w arning applies to conventional antipsy chotics. A typical antipsy chotics are also link ed to a two- to three-fold higher risk of cerebro vascular ev yketsos, 2012).The 2012 American Geriatric Societ y (AGS) Beers consensus criteria for safe medication use in elders recommended avoiding antipsychotics for treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia due to the increased mortalit y and cerebro vascular ev ents risk \"unless nonpharmacologic options ha ve failed and patient is threat to self or others\" (Steinberg & L yketsos, 2012). A prescriber ma y choose to prescribe antipsy chotic medications for beha vioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia and they ma y be effectiv e in some cases. The prescriber must, howev er, disclose to the patient or family that the medication is being used off -label and obtain permission to use it for beha vioral symptoms. T reatment seeks to impro ve qualit y of life and maximiz e function b y addressing cognitiv e, mood, and behavioral impairments, as well as to treat an y modifiable or rev ersible causes of impairment (USPSTF , 2013). Please review the following article and video for more information about the risks associated with antipsy chotic use in elderly , demented patients. Risks Run High When Antipsychotics Are Prescribed for Dementia By Scott Hensley, Training and (9:46) https://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/igec/iaadapt/ Antipsychotics as Chemical RestraintsA chemical restr aint is the intentional use of an y medications to subdue, sedate, or restr ain an individual. T raditionally chemical restr aints ha ve been used to restrict the freedom of movement of a patient \u2014usually in acute, emergency , or psy chiatric settings. Chemical restraints are t ypically prescribed for patients exhibiting dangerous, uncontrolled, aggressiv e, or violent beha vior and should alw ays be used for the shortest time possible. In older adults with dementia, psy chotropic agents such as anti- anxiet y, antidepressant, and antipsy chotic medications are commonly used to treat the beha vioral and psy chological symptoms associated with dementia. These medications, which affect mood, perception, consciousness, cognition, and beha vior, can become a chemical restr aint if used improperly and ma y be o verused a means of beha vioral control in older adults with dementia (P eisah & Skladzien, 2014). Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Researchers ha ve begun to explore non-pharmaceutical interv entions that ma y reduce toxins and prev ent cell loss. Laser light ther apy is one such interv ention, and animal studies using infr ared light treatment ha ve documented positiv e results in mice with traumatic br ain injury . More recently , researchers rev ealed a significant reduction of amyloid-B aggregates in neuroblastoma cells that were irr adiated with intense 670 nm laser light, leading the authors to suggest that their approach might inspire a pr actical therapy for AD (DeFina et al. , 2013). Ultimately , the most successful model of treatment for Alzheimer 's disease will lik ely include early detection and control of ph ysical factors (diabetes, h ypertension, hyperlipidemia), followed b y application of multifaceted disease-modif ying interv entions to prevent the early and continued loss of neurons and to reduce the to xins that result in further cell deterior ation (DeFina et al. , 2013). Nutraceutical Agents and Medical Foods Nutraceutical agents , also called \"functional foods, \" are thought to ha ve health benefits beyond their basic nutritional v alue. Numerous studies ha ve demonstr ated the effects of nutraceuticals from fruit or plant extr acts in reducing o xidativ e damage* and promoting health y aging in in vertebr ate models. The activ e ingredients in nutr aceuticals that are gener ally produced b y plants as \"secondary compounds\" appear to help plants o vercome stressful conditions. The beneficial properties of nutr aceuticals can be attributed to phytochemicals, such made from fruits, spices, and teas are commonly consumed b y humans in daily life (Dong et al. , 2012).*Oxidative damage: a disruption of the body's ability to balance the production of free radicals and counteract their harmful effects with antioxidants. Alpha GPC, phosphatidylserine, Huperzine A, and choline show promise as nutr aceutical agents for enhancing cognitiv e performance and slowing cognitiv e decline. Alpha GPC, a natur ally occurring form of choline, has shown promise in impro ving cognitiv e symptoms related to Alzheimer 's disease, v ascular dementia, and multi-infarct dementia. Phosphatidylserine has been shown to impro ve age-related cognitiv e changes. Huperzine A (a natur al cholinester ase inhibitor) has been link ed to impro ved memory performance in elders with benign forgetfulness, as well as patients with Alzheimer 's disease and v ascular dementia. Cholinester ase inhibitors ha ve been shown to ha ve neuroprotectiv e properties in patients with mild as well as moder ate-to- advanced Alzheimer 's disease (DeFina et al. , 2013). Medical foods were defined in 1988 as a special category of products intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition that has distinctiv e nutritional requirements, established b y medical ev aluation and based on recogniz ed scientific principle (Thaipisuttikul & Galvin, 2012). Recently , there is the dev elopment of medical foods that are thought to ha ve some promise in impro ving mental status: Ax ona, CerefolinNAC, and Souv enaid. Each works via a different mechanism of action, and all are prescriptiv e supplements. Howev er, Souv enaid is not currently a vailable for use in the United States (DeFina et al. , 2013). Ax ona supplies ketone bodies as alternativ e energy source to neurons. Souv enaid pro vides precursors thought to enhance synaptic function. CerefolinNAC addresses the role of o xidativ e stress related to memory loss (Thaipisuttikul & Galvin, 2012). Preliminary studies of medical foods ha ve largely been conducted in patients with mild Alzheimer 's disease, so results cannot be gener alized to all stages of Alzheimer 's. The potential benefit of medical foods in mild cognitiv e impairment is also unclear . It is important to stress that the F ood and Drug Administr ation does not require the same high level of testing to appro ve medical foods as it does for prescription medications. Medical foods are gener ally considered safe and ha ve a minimal side-effect profile compared with drugs; howev er, careful use after a discussion about risks and benefits with the ph ysician is still recommended. The prescription of medical foods should be considered as an adjunct to and not a replacement for current medication use (Thaipisuttikul & Galvin, 2012). Disea se-Modifying TreatmentsOngoing research is aimed at finding disease-modif ying treatments. A multifaceted approach is considered important, using a combination of drugs to target a number of factors associated with the disease process. F or example, a phase II clinical trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), an immunother apy agent, w as found to stabiliz e cognition and functioning in a small sample of Alzheimer 's disease patients for three y ears. Another promising finding came from a pilot clinical trial of an intr anasal insulin ther apy for Alzheimer 's disease in which participants who underwent treatment experienced memory impro vement or maintained their current lev el of o verall cognitiv e and functional performance (DeFina et al. , 2013). Dementia's Effe ct on Activities o f Daily Living The \"small things\" of care are particularly important in ensuring that care is genuinely supportiv e of the individual, and enhances that person' s autonom y and well-being. The humanit y with which assistance for ev eryday living is offered, especially help with eating and intimate care, is as crucial in helping the person retain self -esteem and dignit y as the manner and tone in which a person is addressed; the care tak en to ensure that they participate as much as they can or wish in an y decision about their da y-to-da y life; the trouble tak en about appropriate and attr active food and en vironments; and access to meaningful activit y. Nuffield Council on Bioethics Activities of daily living (ADLs) are the tasks we do in our daily liv es. Because ADL skills tend to worsen as dementia progresses, caregiv er involvement natur ally changes o ver time. ADLs are gener ally divided into two categories: basic ADLs and instrumental ADLs. Basics ADLs are the skills needed to tak e care of personal needs such as eating, bathing, dressing, and toileting. Instrumental ADLs are the skills needed to function within societ y and within the communit y. The skills needed for ADLs decrease as dementia progresses.When a person is no longer able to perform basic math calculations, a caregiv er or financial advisor must o versee finances. When insight becomes limited and memory is significantly compromised, medical decision making and medication management will also shift to the hands of a caregiv er. Pursuit of guardianship and capacit y evaluations are not uncommon, especially when estate and legal issues need to be addressed (DeFina et al. , 2013). Although there is often no clear demarcation between mild, moder ate, and sev ere dementia, caregiv er responsibilities increase as independence decreases. When assisting someone with ADLs, encour age people to express their wishes. \"No , I don' t want to! \" means just that, ev en when spok en by someone with dementia. K eep these techniques in mind: Make eye contact and maintain a calm demeanor and v oice. Repeat requests in the same words if needed. R ephrasing the request is confusing. Engage the resident. Offer simple choices, such as \"Do y ou want or ange juice or apple juice?\" Be empathetic. Examples of empathetic responses include \"Y ou must be cold\" or \" Are you uncomfortable in that chair \"? Problem solv e by asking \"What would help now?\" Give the person ph ysical space\u2014do not crowd. Be aware of y our body language and v ocal tone. Be aware of the speed of y our movements and speech. Keep in mind that in different cultures, non verbal gestures and ey e contact ma y have different meanings. W estern Europeans and North Americans of European ancestry gener ally associate direct ey e contact with attentiv eness and respect. In man y Nativ e American cultures, although ey e contact is expected during the initial greeting, prolonged eye contact is considered disrespectful. Man y consider it a sign of respect to k eep their gaze turned down. In Japanese culture, b y contr ast, people are taught not to maintain ey e contact with others because too much ey e contact is often considered disrespectful. Japanese children are taught to look at others' necks because this w ay, the others' ey es still fall into their peripher al vision (Uono & Hietanen, 2015). ADLs in a Person with Mild DementiaIn the early stage of dementia most people are independent with basic ADLs. Most people with mild dementia will begin to need help with some instrumental ADLs\u2014especially complex tasks requiring multiple steps or extensiv e planning. Basic ADLs such as eating, dressing, and bathing are lik ely still independent. At this stage, a person will instinctiv ely try to co ver up confusion b y turning to others for help with simple tasks. This is a natur al response and denial, anger , and ex cuses are common defense mechanisms. There ma y be some loss of interest in hobbies and activities. Mood changes, such as depression and anxiet y, can occur . Learning new tasks may be difficult and complex tasks ma y be left uncompleted. F aulty judgment and mild changes in personalit y become obvious to caregiv ers. Those with mild dementia ma y need v ery little help , if an y with basic ADLs. Nev ertheless, it is good to k eep certain core principles in mind: Dressing Encour age choice in the selection of clothes. Assist as needed but allow resident to direct the activit y. Grooming Allow residents to groom themselv es, pro vide tools if needed. Monitor progress and pro vide assistance as needed. Eating Ask for food preferences. Ask the person to help with meal prepar ation and meal set -up. Provide adaptiv e utensils if needed. Provide assistance as needed. Bathing Give choice as to when, where, and what t ype of bathing. Assist in the decision to bathe. Assist with bathing or shower as needed. Monitor for safet y and comfort. Toileting* Monitor and assist as needed. Encour age fluids ev en though more bathroom visits ma y be necessary .*Be aware that some medications cause constipation while others increase or decrease the urge to urinate. ADLs in a Person with Moderate Dementia As dementia progresses to the moder ate stage, instrumental ADLs such as work, medication management, and k eeping tr ack of personal finances become difficult or impossible. A person ma y begin to need help with basic daily activities. Mobilit y is often still good and, if so , safet y becomes a concern for caregiv ers. Because of this, family caregiv er responsibilities increase, causing stress, anxiet y, and worry among family members and caregiv ers. In the moder ate phase: Cooking, housework, and shopping require direct assistance. Basic ADLs require assistance for set -up and safet y. Completing basic ADLs ma y be disrupted b y beha vioral and psy chological symptoms such as anger , frustr ation, and difficult y communicating needs. Keeping in mind that there is no clear delineation between mild and moder ate dementia, it will become clear to caregiv ers that a person in the moder ate stage of dementia will need more help with ADLs, especially instrumental ADLs. There is v ariabilit y at this stage, depending on a person' s physical capabilities and the t ype of dementia, but for some, walking, tr ansferring, bed mobilit y, and basic ADLs ma y remain relativ ely independent. F or others, especially those with ph ysical limitations, more help ma y be required. In the moder ate stage of dementia: Dressing Provide comfortable clothes with elastic w aistbands and V elcro closures. Limit choices but encour age participation in the choice of clothing. Assist closely but encour age independence. Grooming Limit choices. (\"W ould y ou like lipstick toda y?\" \"W ould y ou lik e to brush y our hair?\") Encour age as much independence as possible. Eating Ask for food preferences. Set up the meal before serving. Open packages, unco ver trays. Provide adaptiv e equipment as needed. Monitor closely .Bathing Ask about bathing preferences. Initiate and monitor the activit y. Provide direct assistance as needed, particularly in showers. Toileting Ask regularly if the resident needs to eliminate. Provide close assist, particularly with tr ansfers. Label bathroom door for easy identification. Provide toileting on a regular schedule. ADLs in a Person with Severe Dementia As dementia enters the sev ere stage, independence is gr adually lost and caregiv ers must provide consistent direct care with most if not all ADLs. A t this stage a person must be directly assisted with basic ADLs such as eating, bathing, tr ansfers, and w alking. Control of bodily functions ma y be inconsistent, requiring direct help with bathing and toileting. Family members ma y find it impossible to continue to pro vide care and ma y be forced to move their lo ved one to an assisted living or skilled nursing facilit y. Safety issues and w andering require constant monitoring. If the person with dementia is still at home, tired and o verwork ed caregiv ers must pro vide ev en more support with ADLs to maintain a safe en vironment. If in a skilled nursing or assisted living situation, the facilit y must pro vide enough staffing and equipment to create a safe en vironment. As sev ere dementia progresses, balance and safet y awareness go from bad to worse, requiring significant direct help with tr ansfers and mobilit y. To prev ent injuries from falls, it may be necessary to use bed and chair alarms or pro vide a one-on-one caregiv er. Caregiv ers and healthcare pro viders must mak e difficult decisions to prev ent injury and to provide a safe en vironment.Once a person reaches the sev ere stage of dementia, the more complex instrumental ADLs have likely been completely tak en over by a family member or caregiv er. Basic ADLs will require a great deal of assistance to complete, depending on the person' s physical capabilities. A person with sev ere dementia ma y still be able to w alk independently . They may be independent or nearly so with bed mobilit y and tr ansfers. An ything that requires planning, sequencing, or judgment will be sev erely impaired at this stage so close assistance will be needed for dressing, bathing, meal prepar ation, grooming, and toileting. If mobilit y is compromised, close assistance will be needed for all ADLs. In the sev ere stage of dementia: Dressing Limit choices, select clothes and set them out. Choose comfortable clothing that is easy to w ash. Use simple, one-step commands and gestures. Encour age as much independence as possible. Grooming Provide as much assistance as needed. Move slowly , limit choices. Use one-step commands and gestures. Eating Ask for food preferences. Fully set up meal before serving. Provide adaptiv e equipment as needed. Monitor closely and be ready to pro vide feeding assistance. Offer liquids on a regular schedule. Allow plent y of time to finish eating. Bathing* Provide complete bathing care. Retain as much of resident 's earlier bathing rituals as is reasonable. Use resident beha vior as a guide. Toileting** Expect both bowel and bladder incontinence requiring total care.Set up timed toileting schedule. *Consider bathing habits (time of day, bath or shower); consider bed bath if more acceptable to resident. **Goal is for resident to be clean and comfortable. Shower or tub bath is not necessary\u2014a sponge bath may suffice. Case Mrs. Johnson has moder ate dementia due to Alzheimer 's disease and liv es at home with 24-hour care from family members and a caregiv er. She is often incontinent of urine at night and has been wearing a diaper for the last y ear when she is in bed. The caregiv ers usually ha ve to change her diaper once or twice each night and occasionally need to change wet sheets if Mrs. Johnson tak es her diaper off at night. They k eep a spare set of sheets and a pad handy just in case. Antecedent : One night Mrs. Johnson' s daughter is helping her mom get ready for bed. She bends o ver to help her mother put on the diaper but her mother gets v ery angry and shouts, \"I despise that thing, I won' t wear it \" and pushes it a way. Her daughter explains the need to wear the diaper at night to k eep from peeing in her bed. She also gets angry at her mother , thinking of her own fatigue and lost sleep when faced with the prospect of stripping a wet bed in the middle of the night. Mrs. Johnson again refuses the diaper and climbs into bed. Behavior : Mrs. Johnson' s daughter is confused\u2014her mother has nev er refused the diaper before. She is worried that her mother 's dementia is getting worse. She checks back in about an hour and slips a diaper onto Mrs. Johnson while she is sleeping. A little while later she hears Mrs. Johnson getting up to go to the bathroom and goes in to help her. She has torn off the diaper and angrily throws it to the ground. \"I despise that thing and I won' t wear it \" her mother y ells. Consequence : When her mother wets the bed her daughter a wakens fully and has a hard time getting back to sleep . She already gets up 2 to 3 times per night to check on her mother and can' t imagine losing ev en more sleep . Sometimes she a wakens and finds her mom asleep in a wet bed and v ery cold. Her mother has frequent urinary tr act infections and the caregiv ers are making a concerted effort to k eep Mrs. Johnson clean and dry. Discussion : Mrs. Johnson' s daughter tries to figure out what has changed. Her mother is usually easy to deal with and understands the reason for the diaper . After a little thinking she realiz es that her mother doesn' t like the new diapers she recently bought. They are too tight and chafe her mother 's skin. She offers a larger , softer diaper to her mother who replies, \"Y es, thank y ou\u2014that 's much better . I love you\" as she happily pulls up the diaper and climbs back in bed. In the morning both the diaper and the bed are completely dry . Exercise, P hysical Activity, and Dem entiaAs the population ages, health and social care services will come under pressure to pro vide services for older people with dementia as well as individuals with a wider r ange of other chronic diseases that are accompanied with ph ysical impairments. In older adults with a neurodegener ative form of dementia, the on-going degener ation of br ain tissue ev entually leads to a loss of cognitiv e and ph ysical functions (T elenius et al. , 2015). Growing evidence suggests that lifest yle factors ha ve a significant impact on how well non- demented people age, and ph ysical activit y is one of the most important protectiv e factors against cognitiv e decline. Howev er, only a few studies ha ve look ed at the effect of ph ysical activit y in patients already suffering from Alzheimer 's dementia. Sev eral small studies were able to demonstr ate significant cognitiv e benefits for patients with Alzheimer 's dementia and also on qualit y of life and depression. Study limitations included sample siz e, lack of information on the use of psy chotropic medication, nursing home setting, and discrepancies in contact time. Ph ysical activit y may induce neuroplastic changes in elders and thus ex ert a protectiv e effect against cognitiv e decline; this ma y also occur in patients already suffering Alzheimer 's dementia, thus inducing impro vement of clinical symptoms (Holthoff et al. , 2015). Physical Activity Physical activit y is the mo vement of sk eletal muscles, resulting in energy expenditure beyond the resting state. Ph ysical activit y, which includes ex ercise, is different from physical fitness. A person can be ph ysically activ e without necessarily ha ving good ph ysical or aerobic fitness (Blondell et al. , 2014). Animal studies ha ve demonstr ated ph ysical ex ercise effects on br ain function o ver the lifespan. Activit y in an enriched en vironment stimulates the br ain on a ph ysical and cognitiv e level and has the potential to affect br ain plasticit y. In humans, growing evidence suggests that lifest yle factors ha ve a significant impact on how well non-demented people age, and ph ysical activit y is one of the most important protectiv e factors against cognitiv e decline (Holthoff et al. , 2015). In older adults with mild cognitiv e impairment, emerging evidence suggests that ex ercise training has cognitiv e benefits. F or example, a 24- week, home-based ph ysical activit y progr am impro ved performance on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitiv e Subscale in seniors with probable mild cognitiv e impairment. Additionally , a six -month aerobic tr aining progr am impro ved selectiv e attention and conflict resolution, processing speed, and v erbal fluency in senior women with amnestic mild cognitiv e impairment (Nagamatsu et al. , 2013).Preventing Loss of Independence Through Exercise (PLI\u00c9) Currently a vailable dementia medications are associated with small impro vements in cognitiv e and ph ysical function but ha ve man y adv erse effects and do not stop or slow the disease course. In addition, sev eral new medications that initially appeared promising ha ve recently failed in Phase III clinical trials. Therefore, it is critically important to study alternativ e approaches that allow individuals with dementia to maintain ph ysical function, cognitiv e function, and qualit y of life to the greatest degree possible throughout the disease process (Barnes et al. , 2015). A growing body of evidence suggests that \"con ventional\" ex ercise progr ams such as walking, resistance tr aining, and seated ex ercises that focus on impro ving aerobic endur ance, strength, balance, and flexibilit y have beneficial effects on ph ysical function in individuals with cognitiv e impairment and dementia. A recent meta- analysis identified 16 randomiz ed, controlled trials of con ventional ex ercise interv entions in 937 individuals with dementia, finding evidence that ex ercise impro ves the abilit y to perform basic activities of daily living such as eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, and tr ansferring from bed to chair. Howev er, the effects of con ventional ex ercise on other important outcomes such as cognitiv e function, mood, beha viors, and qualit y of life were less consistent (Barnes et al. , 2015). A handful of recent studies suggest that \"complementary/alternativ e\" forms of ex ercise such as tai chi, y oga, and dance ma y be effectiv e for impro ving these other outcomes. F or example, studies ha ve found that tai chi and y oga are associated with impro vements in cognitiv e function and qualit y of life as well as ph ysical function in older adults with and without cognitiv e impairment. In addition, dance-based ex ercise progr ams are associated with reductions in problematic beha viors and greater enjo yment in individuals with dementia. T aken together , these studies suggest that different t ypes of ex ercise ma y offer different benefits, and that a progr am that combines different approaches ma y result in greater impro vements across multiple domains. In addition, it ma y be important to incorpor ate recent evidence from ph ysical and occupational ther apy studies, which suggest that a personaliz ed, goal-oriented approach can lead to better outcomes in other settings (Barnes et al. , 2015). At the Univ ersity of California, San Fr ancisco , a recent dev eloped an integr ative group ex ercise progr am for individuals with mild to moder ate dementia. The progr am, called Prev enting Loss of Independence through Ex ercise (PLI\u00c9), focused on tr aining procedur al memory* for basic functional mo vements (eg, sit -to-stand) while increasing mindful body a wareness and facilitating social connection (Barnes et al. , 2015).*Procedural memory: a type of long-term memory that is responsible for storing information related to motor tasks such as walking, talking, cooking, and other learned tasks. The results suggest that PLI\u00c9 ma y be associated with impro vements in ph ysical performance, cognitiv e function, and qualit y of life in individuals with mild to moder ate dementia, as well as reduced caregiv er burden when compared with a usual care progr am that in volved daily chair -based ex ercises. The magnitude of impro vement observ ed with PLI\u00c9 w as substantially larger than what has been observ ed with currently appro ved dementia medications such as cholinester ase inhibitors and memantine and affects a broader r ange of outcomes (Barnes et al. , 2015). Video: Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLI\u00c9): A Pilot Clinical Trial in Older Adults with Dementia (5:17) http://www.osher.ucsf.edu/research/current-research/preventing-loss-of-independence-through-exercise-plie/ How Dementia Affects Balance and Gait Balance is the abilit y to automatically and accur ately maintain y our center of mass or center of gr avity over your base of support. This happens because multiple systems interact fla wlessly and automatically \u2014coordinating, weighing, and modulating information from both the en vironment and the centr al nerv ous system. The onset of dementia leads to changes in sensory and motor systems, affecting their abilit y to coordinate input. UCSF PLIE: Pr eventing Loss of Independence thr ough E UCSF PLIE: Pr eventing Loss of Independence thr ough E ......Balance is a centr al function in most ADLs. R educed balance increases the risk of falling, and falls and fr actures are common among residents with dementia. P eople with dementia have a two-fold increased risk of falls compared with non-demented older adults. In nursing homes, one-third of all falls result in injuries, and people with dementia are more often injured compared to non-demented residents. Acute tr auma with soft tissue damage or fractures, hospitalizations, and immobilization can lead to pressure sores, pneumonia, and fear of falling. F ear of falling itself is a risk factor for inactivit y and can create a vicious circle. Impro vements in balance ma y potentially reduce the risk of falling and increase mobilit y through increased confidence (T elenius et al. , 2015). Dementia impairs judgment, alters visual-spatial perception, and decreases the abilit y to recogniz e and a void hazards. Dementia aggr avates age-related changes in sensory perceptions, which adv ersely affects a person' s abilit y to adapt to changing en vironmental conditions (Eshk oor et al. , 2014). When cognitiv e impairment is mild, studies indicate that lower attention/ex ecutiv e function or memory function ma y lead to a decline in gait speed. Slow gait speed ma y indicate deficits in the cognitiv e-processing speed or in ex ecutiv e and memory functions. Cognitiv e processes related to prefrontal lobe function, such as attention and ex ecutiv e function, are associated with slower gait and gait instabilit y. The decline in cognitiv e function in people with mild cognitiv e impairment is not uniform, but r ather depends on the t ype of cognitiv e impairment (Doi et al. , 2014). Walking in volves complex processes that require the ongoing integr ation of visual, proprioceptiv e, and v estibular sensory information. Joint positions must be controlled, the terrain a person is w alking on has to be considered, and the en vironment the person is moving in needs to be observ ed. W alking often must be integr ated with another activit y, such as w atching for tr affic or using a mobile phone\u2014this is referred to as dual-task walking (Beursk ens & Bock, 2012). As we age, w alking speed and stride length decrease, while later al sway increases. Some of these changes are compensatory and act to stabiliz e posture, while others are dysfunctional and increase the risk of falls. Changes in gait ha ve been attributed to cognitiv e decline\u2014the critical role of cognition is supported b y the fact that age-related gait changes are more pronounced in people with cognitiv e impairment and that they are accentuated under dual-task conditions (Beursk ens & Bock, 2012).Age-related deficits in w alking can be partly compensated for using cognitiv e workaround strategies, replacing automated sensorimotor processing with conscious effort. This is a good example of neur al plasticit y, as it shows that deficits arising in one part of the nervous system can be o vercome b y engaging another part of that system. Those with reduced cognitiv e capacit y have only limited abilit y to compensate in this w ay; they are more lik ely to w alk unsteadily and their risk of falling is higher (Beursk ens & Bock, 2012). Activities fo r People with Dem entia Engaging people in regular cognitiv e, physical, and social activities is a promising dementia prevention str ategy . This requires activit y progr ams that combine the most beneficial dementia prev ention activities, are acceptable to people, and result in long-term activit y participation and lifest yle change (Dannhauser et al. , 2014). Regular participation in specific ph ysical, cognitiv e, and socially stimulating leisure activities during mid-life reduces the risk of dementia in later life b y 28% to 47% (Dannhauser et al. , 2014). This activit y-associated risk reduction is probably due to the positiv e effects that specific activities ha ve on modifiable dementia risk factors such as physical and cognitiv e inactivit y, obesit y, hypertension, and diabetes (Dannhauser et al. , 2014). Stimulating cognitiv e activities are associated with reduced risk of cognitiv e decline in later life. The effects are particularly pronounced when cognitiv e activities are more complex. Social activities are also associated with reduced dementia risk. Socializing stimulates memory , attention, and ex ecutiv e processing (Dannhauser et al. , 2014). A number of studies ha ve suggested that carefully designed activities can also ha ve a positiv e effect on depression, confusion, and challenging beha viors. Intellectual Stimulation/Cognitive Interventions Cognitiv e rehabilitation w as originally dev eloped through work with y ounger br ain-injured people, although it is easily applied to people with dementia. Cognitiv e ther apists help individuals and their families identif goals and str ategies aimed at impro ving e function. Interv entions address difficulties considered most relev ant by people with dementia and their families (Bahar -Fuchs et al. , 2013).Several types of ve been described. These interv entions typically in volve a range of gener al activities and discussions, can be conducted one-on- one or in groups, and are aimed at gener al enhancement of cognitiv e and social functioning. A recent Cochr ane R eview concluded that gener al cognitiv e stimulation and reality orientation consistently produced impro vements in gener al cognition and, in some cases, in self -reported qualit y of life and well-being, primarily for people with mild to moder ate dementia (Bahar -Fuchs et al. , 2013). Cognitiv e training can in volve guided pr actice on a set of standardiz ed tasks designed to reflect particular cognitiv e functions, such as memory , attention, or problem solving. T asks may be paper -and-pencil or computeriz ed, or can focus on ADLs. The abilit y to adjust the level of difficult y in response to performance is one of the strengths of computeriz ed progr ams (Bahar -Fuchs et al. , 2013). Cognitiv e training can be offered through individual or group sessions or facilitated b y family members with ther apist support. There is some evidence that cognitiv e training ma y enhance the effects of pharmacologic ther apy and some studies ha ve evaluated cognitiv e training in combination with acet ylcholinester ase-inhibitors or other medications (Bahar - Fuchs et al. , 2013). Social Participation and Social Identity Social participation is in volvement in interpersonal inter actions outside the home, including social, leisure, communit y activities, and work. Significant reduction of social inter actions can lead to poor health outcomes and loneliness in later life. Interv entions to increase social participation are indicated (Goll et al. , 2015). Reduced social participation, especially in older adults, ma y be related to the loss of social identit y that a person previously deriv ed from their profession, job , or membership in a group . There is evidence for a strong link between social identit y and utilization of healthcare; for example, healthcare is more readily accepted when receiv ers share their social identit y with the pro vider, and lack of shared social identit y may lead to service refusal. This suggests that an older man ma y not wish to attend a group populated mainly b y women because this would challenge his male identit y. Alternately , older people who identif y as care pro viders ma y not w ant to attend a support group for fear they would become a care recipient . Moreo ver, widespread ageism ma y lead individuals to a void groups of older people lest they become identified as \"old, \" and thus be stigmatiz ed (Goll et al., 2015).Social Interaction in an Adult Daycare Setting Source: AD EAR, 2014.Lonely older adults ma y avoid social participation out of fear of rejection or exploitation b y their peers. Social fears ha ve been link ed to loneliness and social isolation in working- age adults and in lonely older people. Loneliness can reflect a lack of perceiv ed safet y in social situations, which leads to cognitiv e and beha vioral patterns that reinforce loneliness (Goll et al., 2015). Talking ther apies that target maladaptiv e beha viors and cognitions, lik e Cognitiv e Behavioral Ther apy (CB T), might enhance late-life social participation. Howev er, since lonely and socially fearful older people are unlik ely to engage in ther apy without significant support, a more effectiv e strategy might add CB T principles into pre-existing communit y groups. F or example, organizations might challenge fears about attendance b y emphasizing the friendliness of groups, implementing a \"buddy\" system for new members, normalizing social fears, and facilitating gr adual steps tow ards participation. Organizations can implement these pr actices in consultation with a mental health professional such as a clinical psy chologist (Goll et al. , 2015). Lonely older adults a void social opportunities for fear of invalidating their preferred identities. In one study , participants sought to uphold independent and y outhful identities. They frequently emphasiz ed their self - sufficiency , distinguished themselv es from \"old\" people whom they described as dependent and decrepit, and avoided opportunities for support in case this mark ed them as old and dependent. P articipants emphasiz ed their preferred social identities (eg, caregiv er, Christian, educated person, sports fan). They a voided social situations that might contr adict their preferred identities, and wished for (but could not find) opportunities that might pro vide identit y reinforcement (Goll et al. , 2015). Societ y commonly associates y outhfulness with v alued tr aits such as independence, economic productivit y, and usefulness, and aging with intensely negativ e char acteristics such as dependency and uselessness. Efforts to maintain y outhfulness and independence can be viewed as attempts to preserv e valued identities. A ttempts to maintain pre-existing social identities, which often in volved being productiv e in some w ay, are important to older adults (Goll et al. , 2015). Improving CommunicationPhotos Used as a Memory Device Photos of family member can be used to encourage memories. Source: National Institute on Aging.While memory problems are the most char acteristic symptom of Alzheimer 's disease, most individuals with dementia also experience progressiv e problems with communication. The deterior ation of the individual' s abilit y to communicate contributes consider ably to the stress and burden of caregiv ers and is often classified among the most serious stressors that caregiv ers face. P oor communication between the caregiv er and the care recipient can lead to conflicts, isolation, or depression in one or both of these individuals and ma y lead to earlier placement in institutions. Pr actices to enhance the v erbal communication of individuals with Alzheimer 's disease can help with these problems. V arious methods ha ve been proposed to impro ve caregiv er-patient communication; these include memory aids, education and tr aining of caregiv ers, and activit y progr ams (Egan et al. , 2010). Memory Aids Memory aids pro vide language support in the form of sentences, words, and images, and access to other semantic information stored in long-term memory . Written support can compensate for certain comprehension deficits that ma y appear when instructions are pro vided v erbally . By offering visual cues, memory aids can also serv e to remind individuals of the current task or topic of con versation, enabling better participation in the con versation. Cues also limit the number of choices and pro vide concrete topics for conversation. Socially , memory aids support the desire to communicate, another aspect of communication that often remains intact in individuals with dementia (Egan et al. , 2010). Memory aids gener ally consist of biogr aphical information, photos of family members, and descriptions of important ev ents in the life of the individual. By using images and phr ases that are brief and simple, memory aids encour age patients' automatic communication abilities, with the goal of impro ving the structure and qualit y of communication with others (Egan et al. , 2010). Caregiver Education and Training Caregiv er education and tr aining is another method used to impro ve communication between caregiv ers and care recipients. R ecommended str ategies include using close- ended or choice-based questions r ather than open-ended ones, using direct and simple phrases, repeating k ey words and ideas in the con versation, noting a change in the topic of conversation, using direct contact, as well as using comments and non verbal cues to preserv e the qualit y and flow of the con versation (Egan et al. , 2010).Activit y-based approaches can also increase communication. These interv entions ma y be carried out individually or in groups and use v ery specific (eg, preparing a meal) or div erse activities to stimulate communication. Gener ally, the focus of these groups is on impro ving or maintaining functional skills, including communication (Egan et al. , 2010). One method for impro ving communication between caregiv ers and care recipients is validation therapy . Naomi F eil dev eloped v alidation ther apy through her work with patients she described as sev erely disoriented. Her work o ver the y ears has led to the increasing use of v alidation in dementia care as a w ay of demonstr ating to the patient that their feelings, thoughts, and opinions are acknowledged and respected b y the caregiv er. A combination of v alidation and reminiscence is often useful in helping confused patients experience the jo y of earlier life experiences and contributes to their qualit y of life (Z eman, 2015). A wonderful and effectiv e demonstr ation of F eil's work can be viewed in the following video . Video: Gladys Wilson and Naomi Fell (5:46) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrZXz10FcVM Dementia Care In and Out of the Home Caregiving tends to emerge natur ally from customary family tr ansactions that involve support giv en and receiv ed before the onset of dementia. The need for care tends to escalate o ver time, from increased support for household, financial, and social activities, to personal care. F or some, this will ev entually dev elop into the need for almost constant supervision and surv eillance. Important tr ansitions in caregiving include the in volvement of professional caregiv ers, institutionalization, and berea vement (ADI, 2013). Gladys Wilson and Naomi F eil Gladys Wilson and Naomi F eilFamily, the Cornerstone In dev eloped countries, the vital caring role of families and their need for support is often o verlook ed, while in dev eloping countries the reliabilit y and univ ersalit y of the family care system is often overestimated . Alzheimer 's Disease International, 2013 All over the world, the family is the cornerstone of care for older people who ha ve lost the capacit y for independent living. In recent y ears, howev er, there has been tremendous growth in the paid, direct -care industry , which is pla ying an increasingly important role in sustaining the work of family caregiv ers. F amily caregiv ers pro vide what is referred to as informal care . They are often cast into the role of caregiv er unexpectedly and are largely unpaid or nearly unpaid. Ov erall, about half of people who need help with personal care have dementia, which creates a tremendous burden on family members (ADI, 2013). The system of informal, unpaid care pro vided b y family members is under tremendous pressure due to declining fertilit y rates and fewer y oung people willing to care for older adults. Changing attitudes and expectations among the y oung as well as increased workforce mobilit y mean that family members are not alw ays living nearb y their older adult relativ es. The education of women\u2014the majorit y of informal caregiv ers\u2014has led to more workforce participation and less a vailabilit y for informal care (ADI, 2013). Most people with dementia liv e in the communit y, and for appro ximately 75% of these individuals care is pro vided b y family and friends. More than 10 million Americans are caring for a person with Alzheimer 's disease or another t ype of dementia. The largest group of those caregiv ers are spouses, followed b y children and children-in-la w, mostly female. The t ypical profile of a dementia caregiv er is a middle- aged or older female child or spouse of the person with dementia (Brodat y & Donkin, 2009). In the United States, at least 60% of unpaid caregiv ers are wiv es, daughters, daughters- in-law, granddaughters, and other female relativ es, although male caregiv ers are becoming more prev alent. In 2008 men made up 40% of family caregiv ers in the United States, an increase of 21% from a 1996 study b y the Alzheimer 's Association (Brodat y & Donkin, 2009).The challenges of pro viding home care ha ve been well documented. Lack of support for family caregiv ers, lack of recognition and poor working conditions for home support workers, early hospital-to-home discharge policy , and poor system coordination are examples of the challenges faced b y people living with dementia and their familial and formal caregiv ers. Furthermore, limited resources to implement and sustain home care and a shift of chronic care to communit y settings without the corresponding tr ansfer of funds compound the difficulties encountered (W ard-Griffin et al. , 2012). Supporting Caregivers, Improving Outcomes Providing care to a family member with dementia is often a stressful experience that can erode the mental and ph ysical health of the caregiv er. Caregiv ers not only dev elop feelings of burden but also show higher lev els of psy chiatric symptoms, depressiv e and anxiet y disorders, decreased immune function, and ev en a higher death risk compared to non- caregiv ers or the gener al population. Therefore, the W orld Health Organization stresses the importance of caregiv er support (Blom et al. , 2015). Reducing caregiv er str ain and impro ving outcomes for those with dementia is possible when caregiv ers receiv e education, tr aining, support, and respite. Caregiv ers can reduce their stress b y getting enough sleep , eating properly , seeing their own doctors, and sharing their feelings about their caregiving duties with co- workers, family , and friends. Dementia Care Ser vices P rogram An inno vative progr am in North Dak ota called the Dementia Care Services Progr am tr ained consultants throughout the state to support individuals who care for people with dementia, offering emotional support, education, and referr als to local agencies that can help . After conducting an in-depth initial assessment, the consultants work with the caregiv ers to develop a care plan that la ys out action steps to address k ey problems and subsequently check on their progress in following the plan (AHRQ , 2015a). The consultants t ypically speak with the caregiv ers three times during the first six months and subsequently remain a vailable to them for as long as they need support. Surv eys of participating caregiv ers suggest that the progr am has helped them feel more empowered, which in turn has led to reduced need for costly medical services and placements in long- term care facilities for the dementia patients they serv e. These reductions ha ve gener ated an estimated $40 million in sa vings across the State, primarily due to the reductions in the likelihood of long-term care (AHRQ , 2015a). Supporting Caregivers of Patients with DementiaA dementia care consultant discussing resources with family members. Source: AH RQ, 2015a. Collaborative Care Model Another am established b y Indiana Univ ersity's Center for Aging R esearch, the Health y Aging Br ain Center uses a team-based collabor ative care model to treat patients with dementia and support their caregiv ers. A multidisciplinary team conducts an initial diagnostic assessment, holds a family conference to communicate the diagnosis and develop an individualiz ed care plan, and pro vides ongoing clinic - and telephone-based monitoring, care coordination, and support (AHRQ , 2015b). The team also regularly collabor ates with primary care pro viders to help them better manage their dementia patients' health problems. The model has impro ved health outcomes for patients with dementia, including reducing emergency department visits, inpatient use, readmissions, and medication problems, and impro ving blood sugar and cholesterol control. Collectiv ely, these impro vements ha ve gener ated savings Yet another inno vative caregiv er support progr am, Mastery o ver Dementia, look ed at the effectiv eness of Internet -based tr aining to reduce anxiet y and depression among family members caring for a person with dementia. The results demonstr ated that caregiv ers' symptoms of depression and anxiet y were significantly reduced after participating in the Mastery o ver Dementia progr am, compared to a minimal interv ention in which caregiv ers receiv ed digital newsletters b y e-mail (Blom et al. , 2015).The Internet course consists of eight lessons and a booster session with the guidance of a coach, who monitors the progress of participants and ev aluates their homework. Each lesson has the same structure and consists of information (text material and videos), exercises, and homework, with an ev aluation at the start and end of each session. The elements of the course were presented in the following order: coping with beha vioral problems (problem solving); relaxation; arr anging help from changing non-helping thoughts into helping thoughts (cognitiv e restructuring); and communication with others (assertiv eness tr aining). The booster session is pro vided a month after participants finish the eight lessons, and it pro vides a summary of what has been learned (Blom et al. , 2015). After ev ery lesson, participants sent their homework to a coach via secure softw are. The coach sent electronic feedback to caregiv ers on their homework within three working da ys. The feedback had to be opened before the next lesson can be started. P articipants are automatically reminded to start with a new lesson or to send in their homework. All participants in this study receiv ed feedback from the same coach, a psy chologist emplo yed by a healthcare agency with additional tr aining in cognitiv e beha vioral ther apy and experience in the field of dementia (Blom et al. , 2015). From the perspectiv e of family caregiv ers themselv es, Internet support ma y have sev eral advantages compared to face-to-face support. P eople can participate in an Internet course at the time that is most suitable for them; they do not ha ve to tr avel to a healthcare professional, which sa ves time; and Internet support ma y be easier for them to accept because of the stigma associated with seeking help from a professional (mental) healthcare pro vider (Blom et al. , 2015). Encouraging Independence Through Exercise A growing body of evidence suggests that con ventional ex ercise progr ams such as w alking, resistance tr aining, and seated ex ercises that focus on impro ving aerobic endur ance, strength, balance, and flexibilit y have beneficial effects on ph ysical function in individuals with cognitiv e impairment and dementia. A recent analysis of con ventional ex ercise interv entions in 937 individuals with dementia found evidence that ex ercise impro ves the ability to perform ADLs such as eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, and tr ansferring from bed to chair (Barnes et al. , 2015).A handful of recent studies suggest that complementary and alternativ e forms of ex ercise such as tai chi, y oga, and dance ma y be effectiv e in impro ving cognitiv e function, mood, behaviors, and qualit y of life. F or example, studies ha ve found that tai chi and y oga are associated with impro vements in cognitiv e function and qualit y of life as well as ph ysical function in older adults with and without cognitiv e impairment. In addition, dance-based exercise progr ams are associated with reductions in problematic beha viors and greater enjoyment in individuals with dementia. T aken together , these studies suggest that different t ypes of ex ercise ma y offer different benefits, and that a progr am that combines different approaches ma y result in greater impro vements across multiple domains. Ph ysical and occupational ther apy studies also suggest that a personaliz ed, goal-oriented approach can lead to better outcomes in other settings (Barnes et al. , 2015). Dementia Care Programs In the United States, long-term care service progr ams pro vide a great deal of care to those with dementia. About 8 million people are regularly serv ed in adult da ycare, home health, assisted living, nursing homes, and residential care communities. About one-third to one- half of the people serv ed in these progr ams has a diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease or other type of dementia (Harris-K ojetin et al. , 2013). Adult da ycare progr ams are designed to pro vide both respite for family caregiv ers and meaningful social and ph ysical activit y for older adults with dementia. Depending on the facilit y, services can include personal care, counseling, ph ysical and occupational ther apy and, in some cases, health services. For long-term care facilities, there is a trend tow ard designing facilities as homelik e as possible. This idea w as pioneered in S weden in the 1980s, where a homelik e environment for people with dementia w as tried for the first time. T oday, similar concepts can be found all over the world, from Green Houses in the United States, to group homes in Japan, to small-scale living arr angements in the Netherlands, to German shared housing arrangements (Gr\u00e4sk e et al. , 2015). All of these concepts challenge the tr aditional view , in which care is organiz ed around nursing and medical tasks and the needs of the institution. Living arr angements in small and homelik e settings are built around person-centered care, respecting residents' needs and choices. Daily routines include meaningful activities to encour age normal living while tasks focus on household chores such as cooking and baking (Gr\u00e4sk e et al. , 2015).Family inter actions and communication tend to change when a person enters long-term care. This is particularly true when work pressures are present, when the family member lives a long distance from the care facilit y, and when family members feel they ha ve a limited role in the pro vision of care. The loss of in-depth communication, as well as social conversations, can result in the person with dementia feeling socially isolated and without the opportunit y to express needs (Mo yle et al. , 2014). One w ay to alleviate this stress is to encour age family members to become in volved in a facilit y's dementia care progr am. Dementia care progr ams are multidisciplinary and multi- departmental progr ams designed to meet the daily needs of individual residents. The qualit y and success of a dementia care progr am is strongly influenced b y the en vironment of a care facilit y and b y the facilit y's philosoph y of care, services a vailable, and staff experience and tr aining. A well-designed dementia care progr am: Allows and encour ages families to visit at an y time Plans activities that include family members Encour ages family in volvement in the planning of activities Informs family members about changes in their lo ved one' s condition Keeps a log of resident activities to share with the family Encour ages residents to call and write to family members and friends Uses technology to k eep families in touch with one another A dementia care progr am should include cues and themes to help residents remain oriented to their en vironment, electronic door securit y for safet y, comfortable and familiar furniture, specializ ed foods and bev erages, and regular personaliz ed group and individual activities. The pro vision of care for this population is more complex than for residents needing just physical care; cognitiv e decline requires an additional lev el of support. This includes care plans designed to preserv e the skills for ADLs and additional pro visions for the socialization, stimulation, and safet y of residents who w ander or cannot call for help when needed. Additional tr aining for staff members includes the causes of dementia and what to expect in the v arious stages of the disease (Z eman, 2015). Good dementia care includes the recognition that there can be major differences in each person residing on a dementia unit. The t ype of dementia, the stage of dementia\u2014 and even the fact that sev eral different dementias ma y exist in an individual at the same time\u2014 can be an issue. Additionally , most people with dementia are elders who ma y be suffering from multiple chronic diseases (Z eman, 2015).The en vironment in which a person liv es has a profound effect on their sense of well-being. Studies examining modifications to the built en vironment suggest that purposeful design can pla y an activ e role in promoting well-being and impro ved functioning. While no single definition of the built en vironment has been univ ersally adopted, it is commonly understood as the constructed ph ysical surroundings (interior and exterior) where an individual conducts activities of daily living\u2014eating, bathing and sleeping\u2014 and inter acts socially (Soril et al. , 2014). In her ex cellent book Kisses for Elizabeth , Stephanie Z eman offers dementia-care guidelines\u2014not rules\u2014based on commonsense. These guidelines go further to meet the needs of dementia patients than the OBRA regulations, which are inflexible and not directed at long-term care residents with cognitiv e disabilities (Z eman, 2015). Z eman suggests the following: Concluding RemarksImagine y ourself in the place of the person with dementia. 1. Learn good dementia care communication skills.2. Don't argue with or sa y no to the person with dementia. Use div ersion and distraction instead.3. Validate the feelings of the person with dementia. 4. Consider the whole person, not just the dementia.5. Learn to use \"feel-goods. \" 6. Do not use realit y orientation ex cept for early -stage dementia. 7. Encour age independence. 8. Arrange for appropriate activities. 9. Everyone needs to lo ve and be lo ved. 10. We all need something important to do each da y. 11. Don't be judgmental. 12. Keep y our sense of humor . Use it wisely . 13. Religion is a comfort, ev en for people with dementia. 14. Expect the unexpected. (Z eman, 2015) 15.Dementia is a degener ative disease that ys person' s abilit y to liv e independently . There are man y types of dementia, although Alzheimer 's disease is the most common t ype. Delirium and depression can be confused with dementia and a thorough ev aluation should rule out other causes of cognitiv e loss prior to making a diagnosis of dementia. Although people with dementia often exhibit beha viors that are challenging for family and professional caregiv ers, the beha viors are caused b y damage to the br ain and are not intentional. Challenging beha viors can be caused b y unmet needs and ma y be a means of communication. By carefully observing what comes directly before and after a beha vior, the caregiv er ma y be able to determine the underlying need and learn how to alleviate the challenging beha vior. People with dementia need to be treated with kindness and with the knowledge that they can still enjo y life. Ph ysical and chemical restr aints should be used only as a last resort. There are man y proven alternativ es to ph ysical and chemical restr aints that are the mainsta ys of individualiz ed care. Activities of daily living are disrupted in those with dementia. As dementia progresses, family members and caregiv ers must step in and assist with personal care and household management. Caregiv er training is an essential component for an yone caring for a person with dementia. F amily caregiv ers pla y a critical and often-o verlook ed role in the care of loved ones with dementia\u2014especially in the early -to-moder ate stages. Caregiv ers often experience stress, which does not abate simply b y placing their family member in a care facilit y. In a facilit y, professional caregiv ers must be tr ained to view the person in the context of a family . Facilities built around a philosoph y of person-centered care can ha ve a profound and positiv e effect on challenging beha viors associated with dementia. Pro viding a safe, clean, home-lik e environment in which residents and staff work together has been shown to impro ve outcomes in those with dementia. Simply put, good dementia care must be flexible. Dementia is not a one-siz e-fits- all disease.
