Nevada Medicaid PERSONAL CARE SERVICES (PCS) assist, support, and maintain recipients living independently in their homes and in setting s outside the home. These services are to be provided where appropriate, medically necessary, and consistent with program utilization control procedures. Personal Care Services may be an alternative to institutionalization. These services and hours are esta blished based on medical necessity and must be prior authorized by Medicaid and established using a Medicaid defined functional assessment. P ersonal care services cannot exceed hours determined by a functional assessment conducted by State Medicaid staff o r their designee. Services may be reassessed when a significant change in condition or circumstance occurs or annually as specified in policy . Personal care services include a range of human assistance provided to persons with disabilities and chronic con ditions of all ages, which enables them to accomplish tasks they would normally do for themselves if they did not have a disability. Assistance may be in the form of hands -on assistance (actually performing a personal care task for a person) or cuing so th at the person performs the task by him/herself. Such assistance most often relates to performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). ADLs include eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and maintaining continence. IADLs capture more complex life activities and include light housework, laundry, meal preparation, transportation, and grocery shopping. Personal care services can be provided on a continuing basis or on episodic occasions. Skilled services that may be performed only by a health professional are not considered personal care services. Personal care services may be provided by any willing and qualified provider through a Provider Agency (PA), Intermediary Service Organization (ISO), or by an Independent Contractor when a PA or ISO is not available in that area of the state. All providers must meet established qualifications of 16 hours of basic training, background checks, and TB testing. Legally responsible individuals (e.g. spouse, legal guardian, parent of minor child, legally responsible stepparent, or foster parent) may not be reimbu rsed for providing personal care services.
