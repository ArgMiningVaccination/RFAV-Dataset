Code: MBE The Marine Biology and Ecology (MBE) academic program focuses on a wide range of eld, laboratory, and theoretical coursework in a range of research areas, such as physiology, genetics, evolution, diseases, molecular biology, coral reef ecology, tropical marine ecosystem conservation, sh biology, ecology, conservation and management, and biological oceanography. MBE faculty, students, and their many international collaborators participate in multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary research programs. The University of Miami Rosenstiel School hosts many research centers and groups, such as the experimental hatchery, the Rescue-a-Reef citizen science initiative, and the world-renowned NIH/University of Miami National Resource for Aplysia. Graduate students can choose from a diversity of research areas and coursework taught by internationally recognized scientists studying animal behavior and physiology, coastal ecosystem ecology, coral reef biology and ecology, sheries biology and management for sustainability, genomics, mangrove and marshland ecology, marine life population dynamics, microbiology, marine toxins, and marine organism diseases, zoogeography and invertebrate systematics, zooplankton and phytoplankton ecology, and microbial ecology. Degree Programs Master of Professional Science (M.P.S.) (p. 1) Requires 30 credit hours, including a minimum of 24 course credit hours and 2-6 internship credit hours. Master of Science (M.S.) (p. 1) Requires 30 credit hours, including 24 course credit hours and 6 research credit hours. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (p. 1) Requires 60 credit hours, including a minimum of 16 course credit hours and a minimum of 12 research credit hours. Research Areas The Department of Marine Biology and Ecology (MBE) is dedicated to enhancing our understanding of marine organisms and their interrelationships with their biotic and physical environments. The pursuit of this understanding involves studies of physiology, genetics, ecology, behavior, population dynamics, connectivity, toxicology and conservation science. Study organisms are from coastal and oceanic ecosystems, from seagrass to corals, plankton to seabirds, and minnows to marlins. Enhancing our understanding of marine systems requires research, the education of undergraduates and training of graduate students and post- doctoral fellows. We strive to provide our students with the tools, training and opportunities to pursue cross-disciplinary research and develop integrative thinking that will impact our understanding of fundamental biological processes and the conservation of marine life. MBE faculty pursue these goals to address important societal problems including the degradation and depletion of habitats and species, the effects of climate change, and the unsustainable exploitation of marine resources.

Engaging the Arts in Science Communication. 1 Credit Hour. Modern education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has left little place for the arts and humanities. Coincidently, there is a large gap in scientic literacy between specialists and non-specialists. This interferes with the transmission of scientically-generated knowledge to the broader society. Some members of the scientic community have recognized this problem, particularly in the context of failed attempts to motivate behavioral and policy changes that are deemed benecial to society, and have recognized the power of the arts to motivate change. This has resulted in the re-emergence of art and science collaborations such as that between evolutionary biologist E.O. Wilson and actor Alan Alda, and the reintegration of arts in STEM education to create STEAM education. This seminar course explores the synergy between the arts and sciences. It particularly examines the role of arts and artists in improving communication of scientic research. Each semester the course is offered will focus on a specic topic within this broader theme.
