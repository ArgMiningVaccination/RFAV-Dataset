The Steering Committee thanks the 290+ community forum participants, from Worthington to Brainerd to Grand Rapids to Northfield, for their insights and suggestions. More than 500 people completed an online survey offering more creative ideas and input. The Mental Health Summit was attended by 150 mental health stakeholders who spent the day discussing solutions for Minnesota's mental health workforce challenges. This plan, and the process leading to its development, were guided by a Steering Committee whose members met monthly from September 2013 through December 2014. It would not have been possible without their commitment and expertise. Particular thanks to Senator Greg Clausen (SD 57), who authored the legislation and served on the Steering Committee.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report grew out of a concern for the ability of Minnesota's mental health workforce to adequately meet the needs of its citizens, now and in the coming years. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and mental health parity regulations, the demand for mental health care will increase and the system will become even more strained. The demand for mental health providers will also be exacerbated by the combined challenges of an aging mental health workforce, ongoing discrimination associated with mental illnesses, low wages, increasing regulations and the costs of education and training. These challenges are even more pronounced for diverse communities and for those living in rural parts of the state. PURPOSE In the spring of 2013 legislation (SF 1236) was enacted requiring Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) to hold a mental health summit and to write a state workforce plan. The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) will convene a summit involving the Department of Human Services, MnSCU, U of M, private colleges, mental health professionals, special education representatives, child and adult mental health advocates and providers, and community mental health centers. The purpose will be: to develop a comprehensive plan to increase the number of qualified people working at all levels of our mental health system, ensure appropriate coursework and training and create a more culturally diverse mental health workforce. The plan must be submitted to the legislature by January 15, 2015. Mental Health Workforce Steering Committee Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) has eight Centers of Excellence with industry sector responsibilities. HealthForce Minnesota, the Center of Excellence in healthcare, was charged with leading the implementation of this legislation on behalf of the MnSCU system. Working with the primary sponsors of the legislation, HealthForce Minnesota established a Steering Committee of mental health workforce stakeholders. The Steering Committee met monthly to advise and assist HealthForce Minnesota staff with the approach to, and implementation of, this legislation; the data analysis needed; and the determination of recommendations. The Steering Committee looked at efforts Minnesota had made over the previous decade to address mental health workforce challenges. It also reviewed other states' mental health workforce development plans to identify best practices. Data A data report that analyzes the supply of and demand for Minnesota's mental health professional workforce confirmed what providers and consumers had been noting for the previous decade. The shortage of psychiatrists and other professionals who 4 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota Recommendations fall under the general categories of: Recruitment Education and training Placement after program completion Retention Assessmentare able to prescribe medications is critical, especially in greater Minnesota. The shortage of child mental health professionals is worse than for adult populations. Diversity among all mental health professionals is not representative of the state's diverse population. While the supply of some professions appears adequate, there are concerns for all professions about geographic distribution. Available data on the mental health workforce is limited and the available data has many limitations. Community Forums Recognizing that the data analysis alone would not provide a clear understanding of the mental health workforce needs throughout the state, 20 community forums and outreach meetings were held throughout Minnesota to gather information and recommendations. Over and over again, Minnesotans indicated that workforce shortages were acute and that mental health resources were scarce and, as a result, the delivery of mental health care was compromised. Survey To broaden the opportunity for input even more, an online survey was developed. The survey was completed by more than 500 Minnesotans. Survey respondents described problems, such as filling psychiatrist and psychiatric nurse practitioner positions (e.g. it could take more than one year to fill a position) and access (e.g., wait times for appointments could stretch to three or more months). Many respondents proposed recommendations for the state plan. The 2014 Mental Health Summit As required by the legislation, a Mental Health Summit was held on May 28, 2014, at Hennepin Technical College. The Summit resulted in more than 100 recommendations aimed at increasing both the number and diversity of the mental health workforce as well as ensuring the availability, accessibility and quality of education and training of the mental health workforce. For many of the attendees, the highlight was having educators and providers at the same table, crafting solutions to the challenges they face. Attendees also heard from individuals with mental illnesses and their family members, bringing home the very reason for the Summit. Recommendations Utilizing all the information gathered, Minnesota's Mental Health Workforce Development Plan of 2014 was drafted and forwarded to the Steering Committee for approval. The Steering Committee approved the report's recommendations on December 3, 2014, and the final report was submitted to MnSCU Chancellor Steven Rosenstone. Recommendations fall under the general categories of: Recruitment Education and training Placement after program completion Retention AssessmentGearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 5They are listed below and are described in greater detail in the body of the state plan.

The purpose will be to: Develop a comprehensive plan to increase the number of qualified people working at all levels of our mental health system, Ensure appropriate coursework and training and Create a more culturally diverse mental health workforce. The following state plan and recommendations are in response to this legislation. INTRODUCTION Of Minnesota's 11 geographic regions, 9 have been designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as mental health professional shortage areas. This designation is based on a psychiatrist to 30,000 population ratio calculation. Other workforce metrics can also be used to understand access to mental health services. Waiting time for an appointment, number of culturally diverse mental health professionals and practitioners, and time required to recruit providers are examples of other constructs by which the sufficiency of the mental health workforce could be measured. Concern about all of these factors - combined with concerns about geographic distribution, cultural diversity, and care across the lifespan - led to the legislative action responsible for this workforce development plan. This legislative action is built on a decade of previous state efforts which will be summarized later in this report. This State Mental Health Workforce Development Action Plan will define the workforce issues relevant to working with persons with mental health conditions, and does not include workforce issues relevant to persons with autism or substance use disorders. 1 The mental health workforce is a broad range of provider types defined as: Mental Health Professionals: The core mental health providers: psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, advanced practice psychiatric nurses, marriage and family therapists, and clinical counselors who meet specified training and licensing criteria. Of Minnesota's 11 geographic regions, 9 have been designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as mental health professional shortage areas. Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 9 Mental Health Practitioners: Individuals who have advanced degrees and are pursuing licensure in one of the core professions identified above and provide clinical services under the supervision of a Mental Health Professional. > There are also Mental Health Practitioners who are not pursuing licensure in one of the core professions identified above. They have a Master's or Bachelor's Degree or extensive experience and meet the qualifications as defined in Minnesota statute and provide mental health services under the supervision of a Mental Health Professional. Direct Service Workers: Individuals who are in the work force in roles such as mental health case managers, residential treatment supervisors and counselors, child and youth workers, mental health behavioral aides, peer support specialists, rehabilitative workers and EBD (Emotional/Behavioral Disorders) teachers. Most work under the supervision of a Mental Health Practitioner or a Mental Health Professional. 2 BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE WORKFORCE INITIATIVES Mental health workforce development has been of deep concern at both the federal and state levels for the past decade and more. The themes remain alarmingly constant and similar over time. Federal The Federal Action Agenda for the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2002) reported that \"The Mental Health Delivery System can only be as good as the practitioners who staff it. Therefore the Commission recommended making strong efforts to train, educate, recruit, retain, enhance an ethnically, culturally, and linguistically competent mental health workforce throughout the country. \" 3 The Commission developed a National Strategic Workforce Development Plan with the overarching goal statement: ...to expand and improve the capacity of the mental health workforce to meet the needs of racial and ethnic minority consumers, children and families; to address the concerns of rural mental health, children and families; to make consistent and appropriate use of evidenced-based mental health prevention and treatment interventions; and to work at the interface of primary care and behavioral healthcare settings. The Annapolis Coalition, commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), created a strategic plan for developing a mental and behavioral health force. Its 2007 Action Plan for Behavioral Health Workforce Development states: There is substantial and alarming evidence that the current workforce lacks adequate support to function effectively and is largely unable to deliver care of proven effectiveness. There is equally compelling evidence of an anemic pipeline of new recruits to meet the complex behavioral health needs of the growing and increasingly diverse population...The improvement of care and the transformation of systems of care depend entirely on a workforce that is adequate in size and effectively trained and supported. 4 Mental health workforce development has been of deep concern at both the federal and state levels for the past decade and more. The themes remain alarmingly constant and similar over time. 10 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota In 2013, SAMHSA's Report to Congress on the Nation's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Workforce Issues5 responded to the changes in access and care delivery as a result of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Its recommendations highlighted continued need for: Minority fellowship programs Recovery to Practice Initiative National Child Traumatic Stress Network Creation of career pathways Recruit people earlier in the pipeline Diversity training Cross-training Greater use of clinical supervision Use of Peer Specialists Minnesota Minnesota has addressed workforce shortages over the past several years through various committees, workgroups and initiatives such as The Minnesota Mental Health Action Group (MMHAG) 6 and The Mental Health Acute Care Needs Workforce Subcommittee Report7. The reports from these initiatives contain many of the same themes such as the need for mentoring programs with child psychologists and other mental health professionals, working with third-party payers to redefine payment rules, expanding loan forgiveness programs to more agencies, offering classes for social work and chemical dependency counselors at tribal colleges, and requiring training programs to include rotations in community-based clinics, primary care clinics and community mental health centers. A few recommendations from these committees, workgroups, and initiatives have been implemented. Progress is being made in developing a curriculum for the Mental Health Behavioral Aide II to help build a career ladder for entry-level mental healthcare workers. An additional role of Family Peer Specialist has been created and will be added to the workforce category of Direct Service Workers. Minnesota's Medical Education and Research Costs (MERC) funding has been expanded to include psychologists and clinical social workers. The Steering Committee chose to focus this report on recommendations which were realistic, had widespread support, and were actionable in a relatively short time frame. It acknowledges that more remains to be done than is recommended in this plan but believes the work described in these recommendations lays the foundation for future Mental Health Workforce Summits and further successes in providing quality mental health care to all Minnesotans. The Steering Committee chose to focus this report on recommendations which were realistic, had widespread support, and were actionable in a relatively short time frame.Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 11DATA ANALYSIS A data report on mental health professionals was commissioned and provided a starting point for discussion by the Steering Committee. The report is a compilation of well-defined, well-recognized data sets. Where data was available, it is presented regionally based on Minnesota's six economic planning regions. The data report contains more data than is summarized below including vacancy rates, wages, demographic, and education completion data, as well as more detailed analysis of the tables below. The report was completed in March 2014 and is included as Appendix A. Additional data on diversity was collected subsequent to the March report and is also included in Appendix A. Scope and Limitations Preliminary discussions with experts in this field regarding data on the mental health workforce identified significant data challenges and constraints. This discussion led to a data analysis focused solely on mental health professionals. (Information on workforce needs related to mental health practitioners and support services was gathered through different means.) Mental health professional data is available through a variety of sources including licensing boards (supply and basic demographic information), the Minnesota Department of Health, Office of Rural and Primary Care (race and practice information), the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) (demand and labor market information), and the Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) (completer data). While Minnesota is widely acknowledged as having some of the best workforce data in the country, the mental health professional data analysis identified the following shortcomings. Standard occupational classifications do not always correspond to the practitioner/professional designations in the mental health field. For example, licensed and unlicensed workers are often reported within the same classifications so that shortages of licensed professionals are difficult to identify. Similarly, education program codes cross major categories making identification of programs difficult resulting in the possibility of an overstatement of supply. DEED employment survey data does not include individuals who may be self-employed or in private practice, a particular limitation in the mental health professional arena where self-employment is significant. Current occupational codes do not identify the myriads of mental health workers, not designated as professionals, who play critical roles in caring for people with mental illnesses. Practitioners who are not pursuing licensure, mental health case managers, behavioral aides, Education/Behavioral Disorders (EBD) teachers and many other mental health workers are not included in the data analysis, not because their work is not extremely important, but because data collection methods are currently inadequate, an issue recommendations made in this report hope to rectify in the future.While Minnesota is widely acknowledged as having some of the best workforce data in the country, the mental health professional data analysis identified ... shortcomings.12 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota Employment The table below summarizes the current employment and projected growth for mental health professionals.

While Minnesota does have a larger number of psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurses, and marriage and family therapists per 100,000 population than the U.S. overall, it is below the U.S. number for both psychiatrists and child and adolescent psychiatrists. Given the extreme shortage of mental health professionals around the country, the comparison of Minnesota to the U.S. tells us relatively little about the adequacy of mental health care in the state. The Steering Committee cautions against complacency relative to this national data. The numbers are helpful, however, in providing a benchmark from which progress can be measured. * * Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Behavioral Health, United States, 2012, pp. 195-196.

The table below identifies Minnesota colleges and universities that educate mental health professionals at the master's degree and above. Data on the number of graduates from these programs in 2012 can be found in Appendix A. It is worth noting that the table above, and the data analysis provided in Appendix A, does not include bachelors-prepared social workers, who may be licensed as an LSW (licensed social worker). These licensed professionals serve a critical role in the mental health workforce in the State of Minnesota. As of June 30, 2014, there were 5,814 LSWs. While not authorized to engage in \"clinical social work practice\" , LSWs work in a variety of agencies such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, private non-profit agencies, and county social service agencies. They provide assessment, intervention, case management, client education, counseling, crisis intervention, referral, advocacy, development and administration of social service programs and policies, and community organization. They work with some of the most vulnerable populations and serve a vital role in the social service delivery system and the mental health workforce.Mental Health Professional Educational Programs Offered Within Minnesota8 (Master's and Doctoral) Psychiatric Psychologist/ Psychiatric Marriage & Social Worker LPCC/MH Residency doctoral APRN Family Therapy Counselor Adler Graduate School Argosy University Augsburg College Bethel University Capella University College of St. Scholastica Mayo Clinic, Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education Minnesota State University, Mankato Minnesota State University-Moorhead Regions Hospital/ County Medical Center St. Catherine University St. Cloud State University Saint Mary's University of Minnesota University of Minnesota, Duluth University of Minnesota, Twin Cities University of St. Thomas Walden University Winona State University SOURCE: IPEDS adjusted to include programs which were coded in a different CIP code. 14 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota Children and adolescents with mental health needs attend Minnesota's schools making schools important sites for mental health and school personnel to partner in treatment and delivery of services. Mental health practitioner and support roles are educated at institutions throughout Minnesota. Many Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, private colleges, and the University of Minnesota offer programs at the certificate, diploma, associate and bachelor degree levels that can lead to careers in mental health such as human services, psychology, registered nurse, mental health behavioral aide II, etc. In addition, the Minnesota Department of Human Services offers an 80-hour training to become a certified peer specialist as well as the training to become a mental health behavioral aide I. Special Education: Children and adolescents with mental health needs attend Minnesota's schools making schools important sites for mental health and school personnel to partner in treatment and delivery of services. The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) has prioritized increasing educator awareness and skills in addressing student mental health needs. Mental health teacher standards are included in each of the special education teaching licenses and MDE has supported school-based initiatives to address student mental health (e.g., mental health grants, Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS), Children's Therapeutic Services and Support (CTSS)). Special education teachers and related services providers (e.g., social workers, school psychologists) are the school personnel who primarily support students with mental health needs within school settings. Minnesota special education teachers serve children and students from birth through age 21 with a variety of disabilities and abilities. MDE's Educator Licensing Division oversees the licensing of all educators, speech therapists, school psychologists, school social workers, and administrators working in Minnesota public schools. Candidates most often meet special education teacher licensure standards in teacher education programs in colleges or universities. The Minnesota Board of Teaching (BOT) approves college and university programs to prepare Minnesota teachers. The University of Minnesota Twin Cities and Duluth campuses and the institutions in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) System all have BOT-approved special education teacher licensure programs. In addition, seven Minnesota private colleges and universities currently offer BOT-approved programs leading to special education licensure (Augsburg College, Bethel University, Concordia University St. Paul, Hamline University, St. Mary's University, University of St. Thomas, and Walden University). Institutions are continually submitting special education programs to the BOT for approval. Colleges and universities offer licensure programs as part of undergraduate and graduate programs. Mental health concerns are present in all of the special education categorical areas, although they are most commonly identified in students in the emotional behavior disorders, early childhood special education, other health disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder categories. Many students with mental health needs are served by mental health providers from community and clinical providers in the school setting. There is an increased need for pre-service and ongoing professional development curricula and programs to increase clinician and educator competence, and enhance collaboration skills across mental health and school-based systems to meet complex student needs. Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 15The legislative charge includes a clear directive to expand cultural competency and diversity of the mental health workforce.DIVERSITY Minnesota, like most states, lacks a sufficiently diverse mental health workforce and too few child mental health professionals to meet the demand for services. It is especially important to develop and implement strategies that adequately address these challenges and to monitor progress over time as Minnesota's population becomes more diverse. Workforce development is critically important to ensure comprehensive mental health services and supports to diverse communities. To be effective, mental health treatment must be sensitive to the culture of the people being served. The need for culturally and linguistically diverse mental healthcare professionals poses two distinct but related challenges: (1) increasing the number of racial and ethnic minority mental healthcare professionals, and (2) ensuring that the mental health workforce is culturally and linguistically competent. It is critical to acknowledge the changing face of Minnesota and the importance of providing relevant and culturally appropriate services and treatments to the growing ethnic and culturally diverse population. African-Americans, Hmong, and Latinos represent the largest minority groups in the state of Minnesota. There are also growing numbers of other minority groups and immigrant and refugee groups living in Minnesota: Somali, Ethiopians, Karen, etc. The current workforce does not mirror the racial and ethnic diversity of the populations it serves. People experiencing mental health challenges often need treatment and support from mental health professionals who understand and are sensitive to their ethnic and cultural values, customs and practices. The 2007 Annapolis Coalition's report An Action Plan for Behavioral Health addressed this issue squarely: The need to improve the cultural diversity of the behavioral health workforce and increase the number of bicultural and bilingual service providers is reflected in the increasing discrepancy between the growth in minority populations and the number of service providers from each of the major communities of color. 9 The legislative charge includes a clear directive to expand cultural competency and diversity of the mental health workforce. Data on the diversity of the mental health workforce is often limited. However, for some of the mental health professional categories, the Minnesota Health Department's Office of Rural Health and Primary Care conducts post-license renewal surveys which provides self-reported race and ethnicity data as well as information on work locations, hours, and retirement plans, among other items. The table below summarizes data from the post-licensure survey showing race and ethnic diversity of the current mental health professional workforce in Minnesota.

MFT Source: Office of Rural Health and Primary Care, Minnesota Department of Health; 2012. APRN Source: Minnesota Department of Health, Office of Rural Health and Primary Care Workforce Survey, 2011. The percentages are based on responses from the survey respondents with a Minnesota mailing address. Percent diversity in MN is from the U.S. Census, 2013 estimates. In its publication, In the Nation's Compelling Interest: Ensuring Diversity in the Health-Care Workforce, the IOM (2004) reported that racial and ethnic minority healthcare professionals are significantly more likely than their white peers to serve minority and medically underserved communities, which would improve problems of limited minority access to care. This report also cites studies that found that minority patients who have a choice are more likely to select healthcare professionals of their own racial or ethnic background, and that they are generally more satisfied with the care that they receive from minority professionals. 10 A 2013 Health Affairs article on the mental health workforce highlighted the importance of addressing diversity issues: A strong consensus has emerged among federal and state policy makers and educators that there must be equitable access to culturally relevant care and that the entire mental health and addiction workforce must be competent to treat people from diverse cultures. Achieving these goals means that educators and supervisors must help providers develop sensitivity to cultural differences in perceptions about illness, treatment, and recovery, as well as the ability to adapt care to the personal goals, cultural beliefs, and primary language of each client. 11Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 17The importance of a culturally competent mental health workforce was underscored in the survey (described further in this report) of more than 500 Minnesota mental health stakeholders. In response to a question about the areas in which mental health professionals and practitioners needed more education and training, 72% of the non-White respondents identified cultural competence as a critical area for education and training compared to 38% of White respondents 12 suggesting that this is an area that may be more apparent to underserved populations than to the current workforce and to the majority population. CHILDREN Just as the diversity of the mental health workforce needs focused attention, so does the workforce that provides mental health care and services to children. Shortages of child psychiatrists have plagued psychiatry for decades with relatively little progress toward solution. In 1990, the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) estimated that the nation would need more than 30,000 child and adolescent psychiatrists by the year 2000. 13 A decade later, two reports by the Surgeon General on Mental Health and on Children's Mental Health14 decried the inadequacies in the child and adolescent psychiatry workforce that limited access to care. Another layer of this problem is the severe mal-distribution of child and adolescent psychiatrists, especially in rural and poor, urban areas. The American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry reports that the national average wait time to see a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist is 7.5 weeks. 15 In Minnesota, the wait for an appointment with a child psychiatrist can be even longer, with some providers reporting a wait time of up to 14 weeks for an appointment with a child psychiatrist. 16 Nationally, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship training programs are not being filled for reasons which include staggering medical student debt. 17 At the same time, the mean age of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists is 53 years, indicating that the shortage may soon grow even worse.18 Comparable problems of shortages of child and adolescent clinicians exist in the other mental health professions as well. In the Children's Mental Health Services, Gaps Analysis Survey (2013), counties were asked about their highest priority for service development for the next two years. 19 The counties' primary goals center on workforce issues, noting the lack of child psychiatrists, clinical nurse specialists/advance practice nurses, and mental health professionals. According to the Annapolis Coalition report, significant gaps exist in the core competencies of the children's mental health workforce. There often is a mismatch between educational preparation and actual service provision and a time lag between the development of evidence-supported interventions and their implementation in the field. 20 Shortages of child psychiatrists have plagued psychiatry for decades with relatively little progress toward solution.18 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota The Georgetown Brief 1, Transforming the Workforce in Children's Mental Health, concluded that \"the people who do this work need competencies in best community practices, child development, family and youth partnerships, cultural competencies and effective collaborative relationships with many agencies and disciplines. \" 21 The report highlights that the workforce issues for providers who work with children and adolescents are particularly challenging because: 1. Children and adolescents change constantly as they grow through largely predictable developmental stages; 2. Children and adolescents live in families and a \"whole family\" approach is needed for services and supports to be effective; 3. Mental health needs of children and adolescents are complex and linked to developmental stages; and 4. Children and adolescents with mental health needs often interact with multiple service systems (e.g., health, education, child welfare, juvenile justice). Workforce issues in the delivery of services for children, adolescents and their families are particularly critical in Minnesota as provider agencies identify similar issues to those highlighted in the Georgetown Briefs. Some employers stated they would like new graduates coming out of master's level programs to have more early childhood experience or specific training in child development than they currently have. There is an increased focus on training in evidence-based practices but very few, if any, resources to pay for staff to attend these intensive trainings. Agencies need to invest in administrative infrastructures to meet the compliance expectations of many government entities which reduce their budgets in the areas of workforce recruitment, compensation, development and retention. Agencies noted that they are losing seasoned, well-trained providers to private practice, or to systems that pay higher wages. COMMUNITY FORUMS In addition to the data analysis and the particular focus on diversity and children, it was important to gather input from stakeholders throughout Minnesota. To that end, 20 forums were held around the state to elicit input and recommendations from various mental health stakeholders. More than 290 educators, providers, advocates, family members of people with mental illnesses, students in mental health programs, mental health professional association members, licensing boards, special education teachers, state agencies, culturally-specific organizations, law enforcement representatives and others attended these forums. Community forum meetings were held in the following communities: Bemidji, Brainerd, Duluth, Grand Rapids, Mankato, Northfield, Pine City, Rochester, St. Cloud, Willmar, and Worthington. Three community forums were held in the Twin Cities metro area. In addition, meetings were held with the Minnesota Chapter of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, Minnesota Chapter of the American Psychiatric Association, Minnesota Coalition of Licensed Social Workers, Healthcare Education-Industry Partnership Council, Minnesota Association of Community Mental Health Programs, Native American Mental Health Advisory Council, and the Minnesota State Agencies noted that they are losing seasoned, well-trained providers to private practice, or to systems that pay higher wages. Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 19Operated Community Services. Each forum and meeting began with an overview of the legislation, the process and timeline being followed, and a brief history of mental health workforce initiatives in Minnesota and across the country. The majority of time, however, was devoted to stakeholder input, comments, and recommendations. Below are illustrative comments raised at these meetings: After hospitalization, his first psychiatric appointment was 3 months later because of booked schedule and too few psychiatrists in our area. ~Family member, northwest MN We could probably double the number of mental health case managers in some of our counties and still not have enough; same with psychiatrists, especially ones who work with children and adolescents. ~Mental health professional, community mental health center, Twin Cities We need more Mental Health Professionals who speak more than one language and who are more culturally competent. ~Supervisor, corporate foster care, southeastern MN Interns and recent graduates hold jobs working with the highest responsibility/risk, most vulnerable clients. These jobs are the lowest paid and the organizations operate with the least amount of support-supervision...when they need it the most. If they had more support they could provide better care, avoid burnout and give better services back to our communities. ~Mental health practitioner, community mental health setting, Twin Cities Concerns about wait times for appointments, the inability to access supervisory hours for licensure (particularly in social work), low reimbursement rates, low wages and the high cost of education, and the difficulty of recruiting professionals in greater Minnesota emerged as common themes in these discussions. Several community leaders acknowledged that there was no fallback plan if their clinic closed or their only psychiatrist left town. A more complete summary of the community forums is provided in the Appendix B. SURVEY While community forums and focused meetings allowed hundreds of mental health stakeholders to connect with this planning effort, not everyone who had valuable insights was able to participate. Therefore, an online survey was created and distributed by Steering Committee members to their distribution/contact lists. Via this mechanism, more than 500 Minnesotans completed the survey to make suggestions regarding the recruitment, education, and training and retaining mental health workers. A profile of the respondents finds: More than 50% identified themselves as mental health professionals. 20% either live with a mental illness or have a family member with a mental illness. 40% live in greater Minnesota. 10% identified their race/ethnicity as other than White.20 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota This survey yielded valuable insights into the mental health workforce and confirmed many challenges identified by the Steering Committee. Survey results included: Throughout the state, psychiatrists were identified as the profession for which it was most difficult to fill job vacancies. In Northeastern and Southwestern Minnesota, all respondents felt it took at least a year to fill a psychiatrist position. In other parts of the state, the perception was slightly better, but still quite problematic. Among all respondents, integrated dual diagnosis treatment, trauma, and working in/on teams and across agencies were ranked as the top three areas where mental health professionals and practitioners needed more education and training. However, for respondents who identified as non-white, cultural competence was identified as the area of greatest education and training need. For respondents who identified as living with mental illness or living with a family member with mental illness, working across teams and family engagement were the two areas with greatest need for education and training. Workforce recommendations provided by survey respondents ran the gamut\u2014that peer support specialists be used for cultural competence with diverse populations, that medical schools offer more mental health education, that graduate programs are more accessible to people in rural areas, that wages be raised to reflect the responsibility, training and hard work of the mental health workforce. Survey results, including the survey tool, are provided in Appendix C. 2014 MENTAL HEAL TH WORKFORCE SUMMIT As required by the legislation, a Mental Health Summit was held on May 28, 2014, at Hennepin Technical College. The Summit was attended by 150 stakeholders. Attendees represented: All regions of Minnesota were represented with approximately 70% from the metro and 30% from greater Minnesota. A detailed breakdown Development Council Hospitals Insurers/Health Plans State Elected Officials U.S. Senate staff Providers Foundations Advocacy groups People living with mental illness Family members of people living with a mental illness Private colleges and universities University of Minnesota Minnesota State Colleges and Universities School districtsGearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 21While many of the stakeholders either knew each other or had heard of each other, they had never, collectively, come together to focus on the issue of workforce development. It was noted by many that the presence of the educational institutions was especially valuable. The day-long summit included an overview of the work done over the course of this initiative, presentations from people who lived with mental illnesses or had a family member with a mental illness, and breakout workshops that focused on particular workforce development issues. The workshops were specifically aimed at generating recommendations for the Steering Committee in the areas of education, recruitment and retention in: rural areas, among culturally diverse communities, in special education, with older adults, in early childhood, with children, with adults in acute/residential settings, and adults in community settings. Participants were asked to focus discussion and recommendations in areas other than rate increases, which were acknowledged as a necessity, so that other areas where change is needed could be explored. Facilitated by members of the Steering Committee, the workshops were designed to generate concrete recommendations and action steps required to implement the recommendation. Note takers and flip charts were used to record the workshop results. More than 140 recommendations were generated at the Summit. Samples of recommendations include: Develop mental health career promotional campaign that exposes middle and high school students (especially from diverse communities) to mental health careers Determine ways that Certified Peer Specialist training can be offered so that it is accessible to the entire state Increase funding to Minnesota's Health Professionals Loan Forgiveness program Expand access to and affordability of supervisory hours Map a career ladder of progressive steps in education, certification and licensure for mental health workers Expand psychiatric residencies and psychiatric nurse practitioner programs in Minnesota The summit agenda and a summary of recommendations are provided in Appendix D.22 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota CALL TO ACTION From the first meeting of the Steering Committee, the importance of actionable and measurable recommendations was clear. The Steering Committee acknowledged the critical need for increased reimbursement rates to attract and retain a high quality mental health workforce and then turned its attention to areas needing attention, such as recruitment, training and education innovations, and cultural competence. Recommendations from community forums, survey responses, the Summit's breakout sessions, previous Minnesota mental health task forces, and other states' plans were considered, discussed, and developed. Recommendations were evaluated by the extent to which they addressed one or more of the goals outlined in the legislative charge, by the resources required, by the difference they would make, and by the likelihood they could be achieved. The Steering Committee achieved consensus on the following recommendations. Action steps that are included reflect the Steering Committee's best thinking on how to achieve the recommendation. Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 23 MINNESOTA MENTAL HEAL TH WORKFORCE RECOMMENDATIONS RECRUITMENT RECOMMENDATION 1: Expose middle and high school students to mental health careers, with a particular focus on those schools with diverse student populations. a. Target funding to School Linked Mental Health grantees that plan to implement an activity or event (such as a career day) related to mental health careers. This builds on the current DHS School Linked Mental Health grants program that has been in existence since 2008. A total of 36 mental health organizations will be providing school-linked mental health services to approximately 35,000 students in more than 800 schools across 257 school districts and 82 counties by 2018. Adding a component of mental health career introduction in conjunction with providing services is an efficient approach to getting information to this population who might otherwise not know of these careers. Grantees wishing to add this feature will be eligible for an additional funding. Administered by DHS. Timeline: 2015-2017 Funding: In existing budget b. Expand HealthForce Minnesota Scrubs Camps to reach all regions of the state and include mental health career exploration at each camp. HealthForce Minnesota has co-sponsored Scrubs Camps for high school and middle school students for the past eight years in Winona, Minneapolis and Saint Paul. More than 1000 high school students (at least half of whom are students of color) have attended Scrubs Camps. During camp, students are exposed to a wide variety of health careers\u2014nurse, radiologist, health information technologist, etc. in a variety of settings\u2014nursing home, hospital, pediatric ward. They visit a simulation lab and deliver a baby. They dissect a pig's heart. They type their own blood. In 2013, mental health professions (psychologist, social worker, peer specialist, etc.) were added to the menu of healthcare careers students discovered. To date, camp have been offered in Winona (with Winona State University) , Minneapolis (through Augsburg College) and St. Paul (at Saint Paul College). It is recommended to expand the reach of Scrubs Camps to students in all regions of the state and include mental health career exploration as part of the curriculum. Responsible party: HealthForce Minnesota Timeline: 2015-16 Funding: $50,000 c. Investigate health career fairs/internships sponsored by other healthcare organizations to determine whether mental health career exploration is being or can be included.24 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota Many organizations hold health career events including the Minnesota Hospital Association, which coordinates summer internships, Roosevelt High School's health magnet program, and others. Responsible party: HealthForce Minnesota Timeline: 2015-16 d. Investigate feasibility of running a program like the INPSYDE (Indians in Psychology Doctoral Education) Program Summer Institute, a two-week enrichment program for Native American junior and senior high school students, run by the University of North Dakota. The Summer Institute is designed to help students develop strong academic foundations in psychology and science which are vital to success in college behavioral science and psychology courses. The Summer Institute courses emphasize areas in psychology such as history, assessment, psychotherapy, cross-cultural psychology, research design, and statistics. Responsible Party: University of Minnesota Timeline: 2015 e. Create a clearing house of culturally-specific mental health professionals willing to speak to various audiences about mental health careers. Promote this resource and make it available in a variety of formats. Responsible parties: Minnesota Department of Health, Cultural Providers Network, Mental Health Professionals' Associations (i.e. MN Psychology Assn, etc.) Timeline: 2015 RECOMMENDATION 2: Authorize funding to support Project Lead the Way's biomedical science curriculum. Project Lead the Way (PLTW) is the nation's leading provider of K-12 STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs. PLTW's curriculum and teacher professional development model, combined with its network of educators and corporate and community partners, help students develop the skills necessary to succeed in our global economy. As a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization, PLTW delivers programs to more than 6,500 elementary, middle, and high schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 2013-14, more than 50,000 Minnesota students in middle and high schools took PLTW courses. Over 60 new schools expressed interest in PLTW implementation in the 2014-2015 academic year. This recommendation is for the biomedical science curriculum with the expectation that mental health will be one of the career choices that students would learn about. Action Steps: Offer grants to schools that are interested in implementation of PLTW's biomedical science curriculum. Responsible Party: Department of Education Funding Request: Cost of $50,000 per school to implement PLTW to 10 schools for a total of $500,000 Timeline: 2015-16 school year.Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 25RECOMMENDATION 3: Improve collection and dissemination of mental health workforce data at all levels. This report outlined many of the data limitations faced in describing the mental health workforce. Data is critical for benchmarking and measuring progress. While Minnesota has better data than many states, the following steps could improve what is collected for the mental health workforce. Action Steps: 1. Develop memoranda of understanding/interagency agreements to clearly operationalize the roles and responsibilities of Health Licensing Boards (HLB) and the Minnesota Department of Health Office of Rural Health and Primary Care (MDH ORHPC) as stated in statutes in collecting and analyzing data including data sharing agreements and processes. 2. Develop IT mechanisms to streamline data sharing between HLBs and MDH-ORHPC to increase data accuracy, and reduce inefficiencies. 3. With input from stakeholders (DEED, MDH, HLBs, professional associations, educators), design and launch a dissemination platform such as an online workforce dashboard/data portal to make mental health workforce data accessible and actionable. 4. Healthcare and social assistance organizations, which employ the vast majority of mental health practitioners and professions, shall provide data on employment and wages to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development for the purpose of developing employment and wage estimates by industry and occupation. Funding: $75,000 EDUCATION AND TRAINING: Supervision RECOMMENDATION 4: Ensure access to and affordability of supervisory hours. DHS will convene the relevant licensing boards and stakeholders to evaluate and develop recommendations in the following areas:a) A process for cross-discipline certification of supervisors b) Common supervision certificate in education programs c) Internship hours counting towards licensure d) Practicum hours counting toward supervisory experience e) Creation of a supervision training institute that would provide free supervision training throughout Minnesota f) Consideration of tax incentives for mental health professionals' preceptorships such as those set up in Georgia. In order to become a licensed professional, mental health practitioners need between 2,000-6,000 hours (depending on the profession) of supervision by a mental health professional. These hours come at a cost to the employer in terms of productivity loss, the student, in terms of additional cost to pay for the supervision, or both. The result is a bottleneck in the pipeline of mental health professionals. 26 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota Through a meeting of the above named stakeholders, it is hoped this bottleneck can be eased without compromising professional standards and care through consideration of the above listed recommendations proposed at the Mental Health Workforce Summit. Responsible Party: DHS Timeline: 2015 Funding: $50,000 (0.5 FTE) RECOMMENDATION 5: Require all third party payers/commercial insurers to reimburse in the same way that Medical Assistance does for supervision/internships so that services provided by mental health trainees, under the supervision of a mental health professional, are reimbursable by third-party payers/commercial insurance plans. Action steps: Draft legislation directing the above activity. Responsible Party: Dept. of Commerce Timeline: 2015 EDUCATION AND TRAINING: Expansion RECOMMENDATION 6: The Minnesota Private College Council, HealthForce Minnesota, and the Office of Rural Health and Primary Care will co-convene a discussion with representatives from Minnesota's higher education institutions to assess the availability of higher-level mental health degree programs in rural areas of the state. Specific areas to be addressed include:a. Expansion of psychiatric nurse practitioner programs b. Expansion of social work and mental health programs to tribal colleges c. Determination of the need for new programs and curriculum development d. Expansion and/or better promotion of existing weekend cohort or online master's programs e. Evaluate how grant funds for Minnesota higher education institutions could ensure access to mental health master's programs around the state, including rural areas. Responsible Parties: Private College Council, University of Minnesota, MnSCU, Office of Rural Health and Primary Care Timeline: 2015 RECOMMENDATION 7: Increase by four the number of psychiatric residency and fellowship slots in Minnesota over the next two years. There are three psychiatric residency programs in Minnesota: University of Minnesota, Regions Hospital/Hennepin County Medical Center, and Mayo Clinic. In 2012/2013, the programs had 13, 7, and 9 residents, respectively, for a total of 29. As noted in the Supply and Demand Conditions for Select Mental Health Occupations (included in Appendix A), projected demand for this occupation is expected to grow at nearly twice the statewide average job growth rate in the next ten years. Existing shortages are likely to worsen in the future unless supply increases. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis identifies psychiatry as one of three medical specialties in which per capita declines are anticipated by 2025. 22Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 27A physician residency is estimated to cost the organization $150,000/year. A psychiatric residency is approximately two thirds that cost or $100,000/year, which includes salary, fringe benefits, overhead, and administrative costs. Psychiatric residencies are four years. Thus, the cost to increase the number of psychiatric residencies by four would be $400,000 the first year, $800,000 the second year, $1,200,000 the third year, and $1,600,000 the fourth year. The cost would then remain $1,600,000. Timeline: 2015-2016. Budget: $400,000 for year 1, $800,000 for year 2, $1,200,000 for year 3, $1,600,000 for year 4. Total of $4 million over four years. The cost for the additional four residencies would be $1,600,000/year for subsequent years. RECOMMENDATION 8: Replicate and expand the Diversity Social Work Advancement Program to include additional mental health disciplines (e.g. marriage and family therapists, psychologists, etc.) and practice locations. Create training programs with stipends/scholarships and pathways to licensure targeted at students from diverse communities. The Diversity Social Work Advancement Program (DSWAP) has three primary goals: 1) To increase the number of licensed mental health professionals from immigrant, refugee and minority communities serving their own communities. 2) To expand the accessibility of culturally competent, trauma-informed mental health services to members of diverse communities. 3) To train and develop a cadre of supervisors with a deepened understanding of diverse cultures within the community and a greater understanding of the dynamics of cross-cultural supervision. The pilot DSWAP is operated by The Family Partnership, in collaboration with several partner organizations and the MSW programs at Augsburg College, St. Catherine University and the University of St. Thomas, and the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. It has been funded by a grant from the Minnesota Department of Human Services Adult Mental Health Division since 2010. Recommended action steps based on the current DSWAP pilot include:1. DHS initiate a Request for Proposals for agencies and collaborators to host mental health professional trainees in their capstone field placements, while replicating the essential DSWAP components. Field placement/practicum dedicated to providing services to members of immigrant, refugee or minority communities. Students in placement receive a stipend. Graduate level curriculum on trauma, immigrant, minority and refugee issues, and supervision (provided by the trainee's educational institution). Additional training in trauma-informed care, from providers identified in goal #2. 2. DHS initiate a Request for Proposals for educators/trainers to provide training in trauma-informed models designed specifically for immigrant and refugee communities. The selected trainer(s) will partner with agencies/students selected for Action step 1. 3. DHS initiate a Request for Proposals to provide training in in cross-cultural supervision. The selected trainer(s) partner with agencies/students selected for Action step 1. 4. That DHS initiate a Request for Proposals for agencies and collaborators to provide the following professional development support, in collaboration with the agencies/students selected for: Licensure exam training, specifically targeted to minority, immigrant and refugee trainees Monthly post-graduate supervision groups at no charge to trainee, while on pathway to Mental Health Professional licensure28 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota Goal: At the end of three years, up to 60 trainees from diverse races and ethnicities, immigrants and refugees, would have achieved or be on the pathway to Mental Health Professional licensure. Administered by: Department of Human Services Timeline: 2015-2018, with extension for successful programs Funding: $500,000 year to fund 2-4 settings training 20 students total, with funding renewed for at least 3 years = $1.5 million. ($500,000/year x 3 years) RECOMMENDATION 9: Expand capacity to train Certified Peer Specialists and Family Peer Specialists throughout the state with a particular emphasis on recruitment from communities of color. Peer specialists are an emerging profession in mental health care. Minnesota has certified 295 individuals as peer specialists since its first class was held in 2009. As the important role that peer specialists can play in recovery is recognized by providers, it is estimated that as many as 1200 could be employed within the next 6 years. The challenge will be to make sure that all persons throughout the state can avail themselves of this training with a particular emphasis on diverse and underserved communities. In 2007, the Minnesota Legislature directed DHS to establish the Medicaid-covered Certified Peer Specialist role. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recognizes peer support providers as a distinct provider type for the delivery of support services and considers it an evidence-based mental health model of care. The Certified Peer Specialist does not replace other mental health professionals, but rather is a complement to an array of mental health support services. Peer specialists have a lived experience with a mental illness and have taken the state's 80-hour certification program, which is offered over a two-week period. The training thus far has been paid for with State and Federal Block grant dollars. The program was developed by Recovery Innovations of Phoenix, AZ and used in a number of states. The Certified Family Peer Specialist was established in 2013 and offers similar peer support to families with children with a mental illness. This program has not yet started. MnSCU can be a valuable partner in the effort to train this workforce both by providing a venue for the training throughout the state as well as offering additional components to the training, such as motivational interviewing and documentation. By offering college credit for becoming a peer or family peer specialist, a career ladder is created to other types of mental health practitioner roles. Just 2% of the current certified peer specialist workforce is non-White. Recruitment efforts to communities of color should be enhanced through development of relationships with providers and organizations such as the Community Health Worker Alliance. In Minnesota and around the US, the community health worker (CHW) role is gaining recognition for its contributions to the Triple Aim and health equity. As trusted and knowledgeable members of the communities they serve, CHWs apply their unique understanding and training to a variety of roles including outreach, patient education, care coordination, advocacy and information and referral. As reported by the National Council of Behavioral Health, there are opportunities for CHWs to address the mental health and related needs of underserved populations in culturally-responsive ways as members of teams in mental health, primary care and integrated health settings. Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 29Action Steps: 1. Determine which classes currently offered through MnSCU could lead to certification for adult peer specialists and family peer specialists. 2. Determine what class(es) must be developed to meet this goal and how to integrate key components from Recovery Innovations. 3. Assess how ready mental health providers are to hire peers and what steps can be taken to increase the number of peers that are hired. Responsible Parties: Department of Human Services, Department of Health, HealthForce Minnesota Timeline: 2015-16 Funding: Not at this point RECOMMENDATION 10: Support efforts to expand and broaden mental health telemedicine, including using the technology in training programs, grants and funding to expand telemedicine capacity throughout the state. Commercial health plans should be required to cover services delivered via tele-health technology. Telemedicine has repeatedly been looked to as one part of the solution to making specialists available to a wider segment and to help close the workforce gap. This is particularly true in rural Minnesota where mental health professional shortages are most severe Responsible Party: Minnesota Legislature, Office of Rural Health and Primary Care RECOMMENDATION 11: Improve and expand cultural competency (awareness) training. Establish cultural competence (awareness) as a core behavioral health education and training requirement for all licensure/certification disciplines. All RFPs, accreditation requirements, supervision, education, and training must have evidence of components of cultural competence components. Racial and cultural minorities are a growing demographic, and reside in every county in Minnesota. There are no generally agreed upon standards for culturally competent training or services. The primary cultural groups are Caucasian, Native American, GLBT, Southeast Asian, Latino, African and African American. Traditional behavioral health training has not adequately prepared practitioners for effective work with minorities. Achieving cultural competence is not inexpensive. Some estimates place costs at ten-percent of training, education and supervision funds to achieve levels of cultural competence needed by the mental health workforce. Action Steps: 1. Integrate evidenced-based cultural competence curriculum into all education, training, and supervision. 2. Provide resources and incentivize training sites to incorporate cultural competency training in their curricula, to ensure all practitioners-in-training have knowledge, understanding, assessment, treatment planning, and counseling skills with minority cultural groups in the communities. 30 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 3. Establish a statewide behavioral health cultural competence taskforce and network of resources (American Psychological Assn. model). 4. Engage consumers of color and their families in workforce development, training, and advocacy. 5. Review nationally developed standards and best practices and use them to develop a training package for provider organizations to analyze their cultural competency and to develop a work plan to increase their cultural competence. 6. Assess all mental health education and training programs in the state as to their cultural competence training to develop benchmarks. Ensure that government and private providers of mental health services perform a cultural self-assessment, adopt cultural competence standards, embrace diversity, and adapt their services to address the needs of diverse populations. Goal: Within three years all new mental health professionals will demonstrate proficiency in culturally-competent behavioral health services. Responsible Parties: DHS, Public and private colleges and universities, mental health professional associations, mental health providers Timeline: Starting in 2015 and on-going. Budget: $100,000 to initiate action steps. RECOMMENDATION 12: Develop a faculty fellowship model to engage faculty in the newest understanding and treatment of mental illness in children, youth, adults and older adults. The purpose of this recommendation is to increase the quality of the mental health workforce by introducing students early to the latest research influencing advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses. The mental health workforce is as good as the training students receive during their graduate education and their ongoing field training and experience. In order to impact the workforce in a profound, long lasting way that truly creates reform in the field, it is imperative that student education and training is comprehensively targeted and given high priority on the state's workforce development agenda. Fellowship models exist within universities and colleges around the country, particularly in Schools of Social Work. The focus might be on pairing a faculty with a student or pairing an early career faculty with a credible research focused faculty. Features of either model include: a small stipend to early career faculty selected through an application process; a time limited commitment requiring early career faculty to dedicate a portion of their time to attend monthly topical seminars, forums, brown bags etc. where new developments in the field are discussed, a mentoring or matching requirement. A variation of the above occurred in North Carolina where a consensus panel on disruptive behavior models was established to encourage thinking in mental health about (i) enhancing skills in the workforce needed to be in place to do the work and (ii) addressing the overlap with parent training/behavior modification and treatment issues. Action Steps: Convene table of stakeholders including DHS, MnSCU, public and private colleges and universities, and providers to: (i) identify successful models, (ii) select a model for MN, (iii) identify associated costs, (iv) recommend a funding mechanism. Responsible Party: HealthForce Minnesota Budget: $150,000 Timeline: 2015Gearing Up Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 31RECOMMENDATION 13: Charge the Department of Human Services with establishing criteria and a payment mechanism to incentivize mental health settings committed to providing students with a practicum experience that features evidence-based treatment interventions. The Importance of Using Evidence-Based Practices and InterventionsEvidence-based practices (EBP) describe core intervention components that have been shown through rigorous research in the form of randomized control trials to produce desirable outcomes. EBPs have common elements including: a clear philosophy, specific treatment components, treatment decision making, structured service delivery components, and continuous improvement components. 23 According to the MN Department of Human Services (DHS) website, DHS is committed to the use of \"comprehensive diagnostic assessments and evidence-based treatments that consider children's characteristics, circumstances and culture\" with the goal of creating consistent quality in services, and reducing healthcare disparities among children. The Importance of Training on Evidence-Based Practices Early in a Clinician's Career Over the past three decades, effective psychosocial programs (EBPs) have been developed, and with them, the field of prevention and intervention research in children's mental health. However, the adoption rate of EBPs and prevention programs into community settings serving families is very low - about 1%. That is, the vast majority of practice in children's mental health (in settings including clinics, child welfare, education, and juvenile justice) is still not evidence-based. Through a survey conducted by the University of MN's Ambit Network, it was discovered that fewer than 3% of the over 20,000 licensed clinicians in Minnesota are trained in delivering EBPs (DHS and Ambit Network Data, 2014). Clinicians are using methods learned in their academic training and have not been updated on the most effective, research based, treatment methods. Benefits: Children, youth, and their families are given the tools, and receive the support they need, to remain and succeed in school and acquire the social-emotional development that leads to healthy, well-adjusted children, adolescents, and young adults and resulting in reduced costs. Outstanding, leading-edge training and education opportunities are available for students early in their career. Responsible Party: Department of Human ServicesTimeline: 2015-16Funding: $500,000 to fund grants of up to $10,000 per agency plus $100,000 for staff. Maximum of four trainees/therapist with amount of grant pro-rated if under four. Trainees on site for practicums of at least six continuous months and agreement in place with trainees' educational program that this placement satisfies program requirements. RECOMMENDATION 14: Increase exposure to psychiatric/mental health experiences for nursing and medical school students and through increased continuing education offerings for licensed nurses and physicians. Because people with mental illnesses present in all healthcare settings, not just psychiatric units or offices, nursing and medical students as well as already licensed nurses and physicians should have additional opportunities for exposure to treating patients with mental illnesses.32 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota Action steps: 1. Consider an incentive similar to the Georgia preceptor tax credit to retain and attract primary care preceptors for medical, advanced or practice nursing and physician assistant students. 2. Convene group of nursing and medical training programs, continuing education, mental health providers, and consumers to review current mental health training and continuing education requirements. 3. Provide incentives to nursing and medical training programs to increase mental health educational opportunities if a shortage is identified. 4. Increase the number of continuing education programs in mental health if a shortage is identified. 5. Create continuing education programs in mental health and promote them. 6. Offer incentives for providers to arrange mental health clinical educational opportunities for students and licensed providers. Timeline: 2015-16Responsible Party: Minnesota Department of Health, Private College Council RECOMMENDATION 15: Utilize Accreditation Council for g raduate Medical Education (AC gME) and American Psychological Association (APA) standards for psychiatry residency and accredited psychology internship programs, thus expanding access and program funding. Responsible Party: DHSTimeline: Include in review of rule 47. RECOMMENDATION 16: Provide support so that all psychology internships at state institutions are accredited by the APA. The standard for doctoral training of psychologists is completion of a doctoral program and internship accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA) Commission on Accreditation (CoA). Currently there are 12 APA-accredited internship programs in Minnesota. There is one accredited internship sponsored by the State of Minnesota at the State Operated Forensic Services in St. Peter and there are two at the University of Minnesota, though only the one at the University Counseling and Consultation Services receive state funding (the one at the Medical School does not). Currently there are two other internships in State of Minnesota facilities that are not accredited: (1) The Department of Corrections (DOC) in Stillwater and (2) the Minnesota Sex Offender Program in Moose Lake. Those programs should become and continue to be accredited. All internships sponsored by the federal government (e.g., Veterans Affairs Medical Centers) are required to be accredited. Goal: APA Accreditation of the Department of Corrections/Stillwater and Moose Lake internships by 2018. Action steps: 1. Commissioners of DHS and DOC to direct site administrators and internship staff to pursue accreditation for psychology doctoral internships. 2. Provide appropriation to provide administrative support, staffing, and consultation to these two programs to prepare them for accreditation. 3. Direct programs to develop plan for sustaining accreditation once it is achieved, including budgeting for annual accreditation fees.

RECOMMENDATION 17: Minnesota Department of Health will evaluate Medical Education and Research Costs (MERC) funding to identify changes needed to support mental health workforce development and will add Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors professions to the program. RECOMMENDATION 18: Promote a team-based healthcare delivery model for mental health treatment. ENCOURAGE JOB SEEKING IN HIGH NEED AREAS RECOMMENDATION 19: Add mental health professionals to the eligibility requirements for the Minnesota Health Professionals Loan Forgiveness program and increase funding by $750,000 a year; add requirement that 50% of this additional funding be made to mental health professionals from diverse ethnic and/or cultural backgrounds. Currently the only mental health professionals eligible for this program, which provides loan repayment in exchange for service in a rural or underserved urban area, are psychiatrists who agree to work in rural and underserved urban areas and advanced practice nurses who agree to work in rural areas. This recommendation would open eligibility to other mental health professionals, to include psychologists, marriage and family therapists, licensed social workers and licensed professional clinical counselors. Expanding eligibility must be tied to the expansion of funding as outlined below. Without additional funding, the recommendation's goal will not be met. This proposal also recommends that an additional $750,000 per year over the next two years (for a total of $1.5 million) be added to the program, to fund an additional 25 mental health professionals. One-half of those additionally funded, should represent diverse populations. Goal: Additional 25 mental health professionals working in areas underserved for mental health services areas in Minnesota, one-half from diverse communities. Action steps: 1. Funding Appropriation 2. Language change of statute (M.S. 144.1501) to include mental health professionals as eligible 3. Define diverse communities and define areas underserved for mental health services. Administered by: Office of Rural Health & Primary CareTimeline: 2015-2017Responsible Parties: Minnesota LegislatureFunding: $750,000/year x 2 years =$ 1.5 Million34 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota RECOMMENDATION 20: Continue funding of the Foreign Trained Health Care Professionals grant Program. This program, administered by DEED, helps foreign-trained healthcare professionals obtain their licensure in Minnesota. In addition to covering physicians, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists, it also covers mental health professionals and is a critical component to addressing the need for diversity among the mental health workforce. When awarding grants, the commissioner must consider the following factors: (1) whether the recipient's training involves a specialty that is in high demand in one or more communities in the state; (2) whether the recipient commits to practicing in a designated rural area or an underserved urban community, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 144.1501; (3) whether the recipient's language skills provide an opportunity for needed health care access for underserved Minnesotans. RETENTION RECOMMENDATION 21: Identify gaps in the educational, certification, or licensing systems that impede career movement from entry-level, paraprofessional positions to terminal degrees and licensure as an independent professional. Identify the special challenges of and barriers to incorporating persons in recovery and persons of diverse cultural backgrounds into traditional career ladders. Develop strategies, curricula, certifications to support these pathways. Goal: Creation of clear ladders in mental health from certificates to associate, baccalaureate, and masters' degree programs in the state. Action steps: 1. Convene table of stakeholders including DHS, MnSCU, public and private colleges and universities, and providers to identify needed competencies of entry level and paraprofessional mental health workers. 2. Identify gaps that impede career movement and develop strategies to bridge those gaps, with particular focus on persons in recovery and persons from diverse backgrounds. 3. Create additional certifications to ensure that each major educational advancement is accompanied by an associated reward or recognition of that advancement. 4. Develop curricula and other mechanisms specifically designed to support people in recovery and people of diverse cultural backgrounds in achieving success. Responsible Party: HealthForce MinnesotaTimeline: 2015-2016Funding: $50,000Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota 35RECOMMENDATION 22: Examine ways technology can be used to streamline paperwork and ensure necessary data capture. Mental health workers raised concerns at community forums about the amount of time spent on paperwork, how much of the paperwork seemed duplicative, and how that work meant they did not as much time with their clients as they felt would benefit their recovery. This is a concern found among healthcare workers at all levels and in all venues where health care is currently delivered and likely has multiple causes. Documentation of care is critical, in part to implement evidence-based practices, and education and training programs should ensure their students understand this as part of their job and the rationale behind it. However, duplication of paperwork is a frustration for both patients as well as the workforce and should be eliminated at all levels. Technology has advanced enough to eliminate this. Action Steps: DHS will offer small incentives to providers to pilot \"best practices\" in reduction of duplicative paperwork. These practices will then be promoted throughout the state. Timeline: 2015-2017 Administered by: DHSFunding: Appropriation from general fund. RECOMMENDATION 23: Increase reimbursement rates. The stigma and discrimination facing people with mental illness is reflected in the value placed on the work of the mental health workforce. Their wages and salaries do not adequately compensate for the responsibility of their jobs or the education and training required. Recruitment and retention will continue to be an issue, especially in greater Minnesota, until adequate resources are made available to fund needed services. The following suggestions begin to address the need to increase funding to the system. 1. Extend 23.7% increase to mental health providers beyond Community Mental Health Centers. 2. Implement a disproportionate-share type payment to mental health providers who serve high percentages of people on Medicaid. 3. Reduce Master's level automatic cutback in pay of 20%. 4. Ensure reimbursement rates are no lower than Medicare reimbursement rates. 5. Make Prepaid Medical Assistance Program (PMAP) reimbursement data publicly available; audit PMAP payments to ensure rates are correctly paid, and ensure current fee schedules are implemented immediately. ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATION 24: Assess the recommendations made in the mental health workforce state plan by July 2017, to determine progress being made on implementation and evaluate outcomes of the above recommendations.

Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 3 Background & Purpose During the last 15 years, there have been important ongoing policy discussions and initiatives focused on improving Minnesota's mental health care system . Though the discussions have been nuanced, focusing on different aspects of the system, there is broad agreement that the system is not adequately equipped to meet the growing need for mental health services in Minnesota. An important factor is the shortage of workers . In 2013, the Minneso ta legislature passed legislation (SF 1236) to improve the mental health workforce. The legislation mandates that : The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MNSCU) will convene a summit involving the Department of Human Services, MNSCU, U of M , private colleges, mental health professionals, special education representatives, child and adult mental health advocates and providers, and community men tal health centers. The purpose will be: To develop a comprehensive plan to increase the number of qualified people working at all levels of our mental health system; Ensure appropriate coursework and training; and Create a more culturally diverse mental health workforce. As the result of this legislation, in November 2013, MNSCU and HealthForce Minnesota convened a steering committee to organize the mental health workforce summi t and prepare the workforce plan. This report supports the work of the steering committee. Its purpose is twofold: (1) Document the current levels of supply and demand for core mental health occupations. (2) Propose specific, further areas of inquiry for the mental health workforce steering co mmittee. This report encourages the steering committee to consider not just the shortages of mental health services in Minnesota, but whether and how those are related to shortages of worker s. In very general terms, there are tw o possible reasons for the lack of adequate numbers of mental health workers. The first involves workforce supply and factors affect ing it . Supply-\u00adside factors include: (a) not enough people intere sted in entering the mental health fields; (b) not enough training available; (c) train ing that is inadequate to meet the needs of employer s and/or communities ; and (d) training not being offered in locations where the re is a need for more mental health workers. The second consideration for an inadequate workforce involves demand -\u00adside issues and the factors that affect it. For example, inadequate public or third party funding for mental health services may constrain hiring in those fields, or aspects of the jobs are unattractive to prospecti ve candidates (e.g. , wages or benefits are not competitive in some sectors or regions). Inadequate geographic concentration of consumers such that there is not an adequate number to financially support professionals is a related demand -\u00adside consideration. Supply and demand factors are not necessarily independent of one another in practice. MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 4 This report can only provide partial insight into supply-\u00ad and demand -\u00adside factors. Its goal is to document, in broad terms, what the quantitative data show about the b alance of supply of, and demand for, mental health workers in Minnesota. Where possible, it also highlights critical questions that are left unanswered by existing data. This can help guide further inquiry or data collection efforts that can occur during t he spring 2014 community forums and beyond. This report includes occupations that have been iden tified by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as \"core\" mental health occupations. In some cases, the occupations for which data are colle cted do not match one -\u00adto-\u00adone with HRSA occupational classifications . In those cases, the steering committee selected the nearest match: Psychiatrists Clinical, Coun seling, & School Psychologists Social Workers o Mental Health & Substance Abuse Social Workers o Child, Family, & School Social Workers o Healthcare Social Workers o Social Workers, All Other Marriage & Family Therapists Mental Health Counselors Advance d Practice Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners Data Sources and Limitations The data in this report come from several reliable sources. D ata on the supply of mental health workers comes from three main sources. First, the licensing boards for various profession s have provided counts of licensees and basic demographic information. Second, the Minne sota Department of Health, Of fice of Rural and Primary Care , conducts workforce surveys on a number of these profession s, affording richer insights on the employment patterns of some licensed mental health workers. Finally, the Integrated Postsecondary Educa tion Data System (IPEDS) includes counts of completers of educational program s based on a standard set of program categories. Data on the demand for mental health workers come from the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED), which relies on standard occupational categories to quantify and measure labor market co nditions. Together, t hese data sets provide the most comprehensive and sta tistically reliable sources of supply and demand inform ation currently available for Minnesota. However, the data sources also present some challenges for our purposes. MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 5 Challenge #1: Standard occupational classifications do not always correspond to the practitioner/professional divide in the mental health field. One key constraint is that the standard occupational classifications for which data are available include both licensed and non -\u00adlicensed workers. For example, there is no standard occupational class ification for Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor , an occupation the steering committee identified as important . Rather, this job title is subsumed in the broader cl assifi cation \"Mental Health Counselor.\" Not all Mental Health Counselors are LPCCs , although all LPCCs are code d as Mental Health Counselor s. Similarly, there a re some workers who provide social work services in Minnesota who are coded as \"Social Workers\" but do not have a license. The result is that, while these data give us important insights into the supply and demand for workers who are providing mental healt h services generally, they cannot identify shortages among licensed professionals as precisely as might be desired . Challenge #2: No residency data available A second limitation is that IPEDS does not collect data on residency programs \u2014the only clear source of information on the supply of new psychiatrists. Data from the three psychiatric residency programs in Minnesota were obtained to overcome this limitation . Challenge #3: Small sample sizes Although we are interested in studying supply and demand patterns b y region in Minnesota, the small sample sizes in some regions preclude analysis . When occupations employ a relatively small number of worker s, the data become too \"thin\" and/or identifiable and are, therefore, not released. These cases are indic ated by an \"N/A\" in the data tables. Small sample sizes also limit our ability to gauge changes in demand over time. Because small sample sizes result in greater sampling error and greater variability in estimates, it is difficult to discern true changes from \"noise\" in the estimates. The estimates of wage offers, for example, vary widely across time points. These estimates may not be terribly useful in providing support for the evidence of shortages, but even though they fail to confirm clear trend s, they can generate hypotheses regarding actual trends. Challenge # 4: Education program codes cross major categories making identification of programs difficult This challenge is most evident in identifying psychology and mental health counseling programs. Classification of Instruction Programs (CIP) codes for applicable programs have been coded into 13-\u00adEducation, 42 -\u00adPsychology, and 51-\u00ad Health Professions and Rel ated Programs. As noted in Challenge #1, completers in any individual education program may not be entering the mental health workforce which can result in an overstatement of supply.

Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 6 Minnesota Regions This report provides data about mental health care labor market conditions in six regions: northeast, northwest, central, Twin Cities, southeast and southwest Minnesota. These are the economic planning regions defined by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED). For refere nce, the regions are presented below. Minnesota's Economic Planning Regions MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 7 Summary of Findings Psychiatrists Demographics Minnesota p sychiatrists are generally older than the workforce at large: nearly half are 55 years of age or older, compared to 21 percent of the whole workforc e nationally. More than half, 55 percent , of psychiatrists plan to continue practicing for more than ten years. The majority of psychiatrists are male (65 percent ), and white (89 percent). Workforce Supply Licensing : There are 497 licensed psychiatrists with Minnesota mailing addresses, and another 161 Minnesota licensees with non -\u00adMinnesota mailing addresses. Education : There are three psychiatric residency programs in Minnesota: University of Minnesota, Regions H ospital/Hennepin County Medical Center, and Mayo Clinic. In 2012/2013, the programs had 13, 7, and 9 residents, respectively, for a total of 29. Workforce Demand Employment . Psychiatry has a limited workforce in Minnesota. Licensi ng and employment estimates differ somewhat , but considering both sets of estimates, it is likely that 500 or fewer psychiatrists are practicing statewide. Across regions, emp loyment estimates vary from 20 in Southwest Minnesota to 160 in the Twin Cities metro. (The number of practicing psychiatrists is too small to even be published in Northeast Minnesota.) Just over half of all psychiatrists are employed in physicians' offices and hospitals , and another 17.6 percent are employed in general medical and surgical hospitals . Current D emand . Because it has a relatively small workforce , the indicators of current demand (job vacancy rates and occupations -\u00adin-\u00addemand [OID] indicator) are unpublishable in many sub-\u00adstate regions within Minnesota . However, at the statewide level, th e data suggests that current hiring demand for psychiatrists is very high. The job vacancy rate for psychiatrists is 18.2 percent, compared to 2.8 percent across all occupations. The OID indicator is 4 out of 5, also indicating high current demand. On the other hand, wage estimates over time are not consistent with a picture of worker shortages. Economists argue that shortages often result in upward pressure on wages, but there is no evidence that psychiatrists ' wages have risen over the last ten years. 1 Future D emand . Overall, Minnesota's economy is projected to increase by 13 percent between 2010 and 2020. The growth rate for psy chiatrists is nearly twice that at 25.4 percent. There is 1 Wage offers for psychiatrists have fluctuated widely over the last ten years, likely due to a high level of sampling error in the Job Vacancy S urvey estimates. However, if there was pressure to increase wages to attract psychiatrists to openings, we would likely see some evidence of this in the findings. MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 8 also very high projected employment growth in Central, Northeast, No rthwest, and the Twin Cities metro regions (growth rates are not publishable for the two southern regions in the state). Avenues for Further Inquiry The high job vacancy rate for psychiatrists in Minnesota suggests that employers may struggle to find and hire psychiatrists, supporting the view of inadequate training levels . Additional work could be done to pinpoint and document the extent to which unfilled vacancies are a function of supply-\u00ad and demand -\u00adside conditions. For example, additional survey research or conversations with employers could explore : how long do psychiatry vacancies remain open? To what extent are unfilled vacancies a reflection of inadequate recruitment efforts, or lack of qualified candidates? If there is a lack of qualifie d candidates, are shortages more severe across region s or specia lties? Are salaries and remuneration rates for psychiatrists in Minnesota commensurate with rates across the country? Finally, what options do employers have to meet the demand for psychiatric services if psychiatrists with accredited training are not available in their area? Since projected demand for this occupation is projected to grow at nearly twice the statewide average job growth rate in the next ten years, any existing shortages are likely to worsen in the future unless supply increases . Therefore, the mental health steering committee would do well to consider how best to grapple with these potential shortages i n the longer -\u00adterm. The nature of psychiatrists' work patterns also affects the ability of the workforce to meet patient needs. A comprehensive analysis of psychiatrists' work in terms of the number of patients they see per day, the types of patients they see, the percent of their time devoted to clinical care, and related factors would provide additional insights by which to gauge the capability of the existing workforce to meet the demand for their services. Clinical, Counseling, and School Psychologists Demographics There is no comprehensive data available delineating the demographic s of licensed psychologists in the state of Minnesota. Workforce Supply Licensing : According to the Minnesota Board of Psychology, there are 2,145 doctoral level licensed psychologist s and 1,626 licensed master's psychologists2 in Minnesota, for a total of 3,771 licensed psychologists. In addition, there a re currently 1,123 school psychologists and 63 with limited licenses regulated through the Minnesota Department of Education. Education : In the 2012 school year, Minnesota schools produced 555 master's and 156 doctoral -\u00adlevel psychology graduates in a range of specialties. There are doctoral psychology 2 Minnesota no longer licenses psychologists at the master's level other than those grand-\u00ad parented under earlier versions of the Psychology Practice Act.

Border states may also add to Minnesota's supply of psychologists: Iowa produced 250, North Dakota 40, and South Dakota 62. Considering that the total projected openings for psychologists from 2010 through 2020 is 1,900 statewide (or 190 annually , assuming even growth over the decade ), these data indicate that Minnesota has the capacity to meet that demand. Workforce Demand Employment . This occupational category includes clinical, counseling, and school psychologists. This is a medium -\u00adsized occupation in the s tate of Minnesota, with an estimated 3,518 licensees and 2,240 professionals employed statewide.3 Regionally, employment of psychologists ranges from an estimated 130 in Northwest Minnesota to 1,500 in the Twin Cities metro. Approximately one half of all p sychologists are employed in three industries: offices of physicians, elementary and secondary schools, and offices of other healthcare practitioners. Current D emand . Some current demand indicators are unpublishable at regional levels due to small sample sizes. However, the available economic indicators suggest that psychologists are currently in high demand around the state. The current job vacancy rate is 5.5 percen t, compared to a vacancy rate of 2.8 percent across all occupations statewide. The occupations -\u00adin-\u00ad demand indicator generally ranges from 4 to 5 (out of 5) across all regions, with the exception of Southwest Minnesota where the OID indicator is 3. On the ot her hand, economists argue that high hiring demand and worker shortages often result in upward pressure on wages, and there is no evidence th at wage offers for psychologists have risen significantly over the last ten years. 4 Future D emand . Future demand appears to be extremely high for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists in Minnesota. This is a fast -\u00adgrowing occupation, expected to expand by 24.4 percent in Minnesota between 2010 and 2020, compared to an overall projected growth rate of 13.0 percent. There is a projected need for 1,900 new psychologists to fill new and replacement openings statewide. Avenues for Further Inquiry Although current and future demand levels for psychologists appear very high , with the large numbers of psychology graduate program completers, there is no clear quantitative evidence that the field is being undersupplied overall. In fact, there has been concern r aised about oversupplies nationa lly 5. If there are anecdotal reports of shortages in this occupation, further qualitative study may be helpful to pinpoint the reasons and geographic locations of shortages. 3 Differences between the number of licensees and the number of employees could be due to a variety of factors : (1) some licensees might not be working as psychologists; (2) some may be self -\u00ademp loyed, which the employment estimate does not include; or (3) the true employment estimate may be subject to some sampling error. 4 Wage offers for psychologists have fluctuated widely over the last ten years, likely due to a high level of sampling error in the survey estimates. However, if there was pressure to increase wages to attract psychiatrists to openings, we would likely see some evidence of this in the findings. 5 Robiner, W. N., & Crew, D. P. (2000).

MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 10 Additionally, it may be worth quantifying shortages in specific specialties (e.g., child psychology, geropsychology) within psychology. Social Workers Demographics Minnesota s ocial workers' ages vary widely, with substantial shares of at all ages. About half are under 45 years old, 19 percent are 45 -\u00ad54 years old, 22 percent are 55 -\u00ad64 years old, and 9 percent are 65 ye ars and older. They are just slightly older than the national workforce as a whole. Sixty -\u00adfive percent of licensed Minnesota social workers plan to continue practicing for more than ten years. More than 80 percent of Minnesota's licensed social workers are female. The vast majority \u201493 percent statewide \u2014are white. The remaining seven percent are evenly divided between Asian, Black, multiple races, and American Indian. Workforce Supply Licensing : The Minnesota Board of Social Work regulates 6,395 licensees. This comprises licensed clinical social workers, licensed social workers, and licensed graduate social workers. Education : Minnesota higher educational institutions (Augsburg Colleg e, Saint Cloud State University, St. Catherine University, St. Mary's University, University of Minnesota -\u00ad Duluth, University of Minnesota -\u00ad Twin Cities, University of St. Thomas) as well as non -\u00adtraditional programs (Capella University, Walden University) h ave master's and/or doctoral level programs. Together, all produced 487 social work master's and Ph.D. graduates in the 2011 -\u00ad2012 school year. Neighboring states produced another 506 (155 in Iowa; 68 in North Dakota; and 283 in Wisconsin). There are 18 bachelor's level programs. Employment . Many people who perform social work activities in their jobs, and are therefore counted as \"social workers\" in the Bureau of Labor Statistics categories, are not licensed social workers. In total, across the four spe cialties of social work, there were 6,395 licensees, but an estimated 10,810 people employed in these occupations. More than half \u20145,660\u2014 were employed as Child, Family, and School Social Workers. Another 2,580 were working as Healthcare Social Workers, 2,18 0 were employed as Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Workers, and 390 in the Social Workers, All Other occupational category. Social workers are employed in a wide variety of industries, including clinic/outpatient settings, schools, hospitals and m edical centers, government, and social service agencies. Workforce Demand A note on occupational classifications . The Bureau of Labor Statistics has four separate classifications for social workers: (1) Mental Health and Substance Abuse; ( 2) Child, Family, and School; (3) Healthcare and (4) Social Workers, All Other . The Mental Health Steering Committee MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 11 did not express particular interest in these breakouts, but since this is the way statewide demand indicators are published, this is how thes e occupa tions are presented in this report . Current Demand . Current demand indicators suggest that hiring demand in social work occupations ranges from modest to high. Job vacancy rates are lower than average for three out of the four social work specialties . Only the \"Social Workers, All Other \" category had a statewide vacancy rate that exceeded the statewide average, 3.7 percent ver sus 2.8 percent, respectively. Taken on its face, this statistic would not support a claim that employers are having difficulty re cruiting workers to fill social work positions. The occupations -\u00adin-\u00addemand indicator is another measure of current demand, taking into account job vacancies, employment size, and unemployment insurance claims. This indicator ranges from 3 to 5 (out of a pos sible 5) across regions, suggesting moderate to very high demand. Finally, there is no evidence that wage offers have increased over time, which , were it present, would be indicative of workforce shortages. Considering all three sets of indicators, there is mixed, and overall, probably weak evidence of a shortage of social workers to fill positions. Future Demand . There is a projected need for 4,360 new social workers across all four social work specialty areas to fill growth and replacement openings in Minnesota between 2010 -\u00ad2020. Assuming that growth is even across all ten years, that translate s into an annual need for approximately 436 new social workers. In Minnesota alone there were 487 soci al work Master's and Ph.D. level graduates in 2011 -\u00ad2012. While there may be regional shortages \u2014or shortages across different specialties \u2014the overall picture suggests relative parity between supply and demand for social work occupations . Avenues for Further Inquiry One question that this data leaves unanswered concerns the supply and demand of licensed social workers. As noted above, the estimates suggest that just under a half of all people who provide socia l work services are not licensed . Additional inquiry could delve into and/or document the extent to which non -\u00adlicensed practitioners or paraprofessionals are able to provide at least some of the services necessary to meet client s' or patients' needs. Additionally, this report has not doc umented whether there are regional and/or specialty area shortages, which also would be a fruitful line of inquiry . Marriage a nd Family Therapists Demographics Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists span the age distribution. As a workforce, they are slightly older than the workforce overall, with over one -\u00adthird being over the age of 55 (compared to one -\u00adfifth of the overall workforce). Three-\u00ad fourths of all licensed Marriage and Family Therapists are female. The vast majority \u201491 percent \u2014are white, wi th the remainder spread evenly between Asian, Black, and multiple races. MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 12 Workforce Supply Licensing : There are 1,489 licensed Marriage and Family Therapists with a Minnesota mailing address. The statewide employment estimate is 820.6 Education : In the 2011 -\u00ad2012 academic year, there were 238 Master's and Ph.D. level completers of Marriage and Family Therapy programs in Minnesota with programs at Argosy University -\u00adTwin Cities, Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, and St. Cloud State University. Ther e is also an online program at Capella University. Neighboring states had additional graduates: 43 in South Dakota and two in Wisconsin . Demand Employment . Statewide, this occupation employs an estimated 820 people, the vast majority of whom (680) are employed in the Twin Cities metro area, and the remaining distributed fairly evenly across other regions. Statewide, about three -\u00adquarters of these professional s work in three industry sectors: outpatient care centers, individual and family services, and offices of other healthcare practitioners. Current Demand . Current demand indicators suggest that overall , statewide demand for Marriage and Family Therapists is moderate. The vacancy rate in this occupation is 0.9 percent. Compared to the statewide average of 2.8 percent, this suggests that employers are not encountering difficulties filling these positions. The statewide occupations -\u00adin-\u00addemand indicator is 4 ou t of 5, indicating healthy \u2014but not overwhelming \u2014demand. Like the other mental health occupations included in this report, there is no evidence that wage offers for Marriage and Family Therapists have increased over the last ten years, indicating that any s hortages that might exist have not been reflected in upward pressure on wages. Future Demand . Between 2010 and 2020, the demand for Marriage and Family Therapists is projected to grow much faster than average occupations . The occupation is expected to ex pand by 50 percent (compared to an overall growth rate of 13 percent). This will translate into 640 growth and replacement openings during this period. Assuming an even growth across the ten -\u00ad year period, this translates into the need for about 64 new worke rs each year. In the 2011 -\u00ad2012 school year (the most recent year for which data are available) there were 238 Master's and Ph.D. level Marriage and Family Therapy program completers. Given these basic indicators, there is no evidence that this is a shortag e occupation , and indeed may be an area of surplus . Avenues for Further Inquiry For this particular occupational specialty, it does not appear that there is a shortage of workers . There may be a shortage of services available to families , but that is another matter that would fall outside the scope of labor market processes. If the mental health steering committee wishes to focus effort on increasing the number of Marriage and Family Therapists, it may need to 6 Differences between the number of licensees and the number of employees could be due to a variety of factors : (1) some might be licensed as psychologists; rather than MFTs (2) some may be self -\u00ademployed, which the employment estimate does not include; or (3) the true employment estimate may be subject to some sampling error. MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 13 consider whether , or where, there are enough viable employment opportunities to absorb an increased supply . Analysis of reimbursement and other operational factors could identify employment challenges/opportunities. Mental Health Counselors Demographics Licensed mental health counselo rs in Minnesota are just slightly younger than the U.S. workforce at large. An estimated 60 percent are under the age of 45. The vast majority \u201482 percent \u2014of licensed mental health counselors are female. Race data is not available for mental health counselors. Workforce Supply Licensing : There are 1,066 license d mental health counselors (Licensed Professional Counselors [LPCs] and Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors [LPCCs] ) in Minnesota. Education : In the 2011 -\u00ad2012 academic year, there were 262 master's level completers of mental health counseling programs from the only program in Minnesota, the online program at Capella University. There were a nother 170 completers of substance abuse/addiction counseling from a variety of programs. There were also small number s of completers from these two programs in neighboring states. Workforce Demand Employment . The BLS occupation al group \"Mental Health Counselor\" includes both licensed and non-\u00ad licensed workers who provide mental health counseling -\u00adrelated services. As noted above, there were 1,066 LPC and LPCC licensees in Minnesota, but this occupation employs about twice that (2,180) sta tewide. Employment ranges from a low of 80 in Southwest Minnesota to a high of 1,390 in the Twin Cities metro region. Current Demand . As indicated by job vacancy rates and the occupations -\u00adin-\u00addemand indicator, there is relatively high hiring demand for m ental health counselors in Minnesota. Job vacancy rates are not publishable for most regions due to small numbers , but statewide, there were 6.9 vacancies for every 100 mental health counselor jobs. This is more than twice the job vacancy rate across all o ccupations (2.8 percent). In addition, the OID indicator is 5 out of 5, indicating very high hiring demand. Finally, there is some evidence that wage offers have been increasing over the last ten years (the median wage offer in 2002 was $10.10, but had ris en to $17.55 by 2012). This is not conclusive evidence, but is consistent with the upward pressure on wages that can result from worker shortages. MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 14 Future Demand . This profession is projected to grow quickly over the 2010 -\u00ad2020 period, increasing by 34 per cent statewide, compared to an overall growth rate of 13 percent. This growth will result in a need for an estimated 1,130 new workers to fill openings resulting from both growth and replacement. Assuming that growth is steady over the ten year period, thi s translates into approximately 113 openings annually. Keeping in mind that there were 262 master's level completers of mental health counseling and 170 completers of substance abuse/addiction counseling programs, these data suggest that Minnesota has the capacity to produce the needed supply in this occupation. Avenues for Further Inquiry Based on the data presented, it appears that supply and demand are relatively balanced for Mental Health Counselors. However, as noted above, this occupational categor y includes both licensed and non -\u00adlicensed personnel. Therefore, one question that this analysis cannot answer is whether there are enough licensed counselors to meet employment demand in Minnesota. This is a very important question, given the wider latitud e of licensed professionals to provide mental health services. What is the hiring demand for the subset of mental health counselors who are licensed? The Mental Health Workforce Steering Committee may wish to undertake a more nuanced study or employer survey focu sing only on this question. Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurses Demographics Advanced practice psychiatric nurses, as a group, are older than the workforce at large. In Minnesota an estimated 57 percent of advance d practice psychiatric nurses are age 55 and over. This is an overwhelmingly female, overwhelmingly white occupation. The vast majority \u2014 94 percent \u2014are female, and 98 percent are white ( 1 percent are black and another 1 percent are American Indian). Wor kforce Supply Licensing: There are 303 licensed advanced practice nurses with specializations in psychiatry or mental health in Minnesota. Education: There are two Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner program s in Minnesota - the University of Minnesota and the College of St. Scholastica. According to IPEDS, in 2011 -\u00ad2012, there were only eight psychiatric -\u00admental health nurse practitioner graduates - all of these from the College of St. Scholastica. The University of Minnes ota had four graduates in that year which must have been coded in a different classification. Workforce Demand Because advanced practice psychiatric nursing is not an occupational category for which data are collected, no current or future demand infor mation is available statewide or regionally for this specialty. As a frame of reference, the category of 'Nurse Practitioner\" is identified as an MnSCU Mental Health Occupations Data Report . Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX A 15 occupation in high demand (5 on a scale of 1 -\u00ad5). The job vacancy rates for Nurse Practitioner range from 4.6 percent in the SE region to a high of 8.5 percent in the SW region. The overall state vacancy rate is 6.5percent. Avenues for Further Inquiry As a subset of a larger occupation, an analysis of Psychiatric /Mental Health Nurse Practitioners is limited. A special survey of program graduates or additional surveys by the Board of Nursing might provide useful information as to location of employment, utilization, and overall demand.

The Steering Committee used the report as a basis to develop a definition of the mental health workforce as well as to define bench - marks against which recommendations could be measured. This report was sent out to the 2014 Mental Health Summit participants. As a result, recommendations were made to amend the report. Those updates and amendments have been incorporated into the state plan. Budget constraints made it impossible to rewrite the data report, however. Changes are listed below. 1.

C ompletion of the Minnesota Department of Health workforce survey is optional for licensed health profes - sionals, so the data has limitations. 4. S ocial Workers: The Minnesota Board of Social Work is authorized by law to issue four licenses: 1) Licensed Social Workers (LSW), Licensed Graduate Social Worker (LGSW), Licensed Independent Social Worker (LISW), and Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker (LICSW). The Board currently regulates 13,347 licensees, as of June 30, 2014. For the purpose of this report the data is focused on three of the four social work licenses authorized by the Board to engage in \"clinical\" scope of social work practice, including differential diagnosis and treatment. These include the LGSW, LISW, and LICSW, which comprise a total of 6,395 licensees for the purpose of this report data (which is 7,533 licensees of June 30, 2014). 5. S ocial Workers: While the data in this report do not include the LSW bachelors social work license, these licensed professionals serve a critical role in the \"mental health workforce\" in the State of Minnesota. The Board licenses 5,814 LSWs as of June 30, 2014. While not authorized to engage in \"clinical social work practice\" , LSWs work in a variety of agencies such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, private non-profit agencies, and county social service agencies. They provide assessment, intervention, case management, client education, counseling, crisis intervention, referral, advocacy, development and administration of social service programs and policies, and community organization. They work with some of the most vulnerable populations and serve a vital role in the social service delivery system and the \"mental health workforce\" . 6. To be licensed as a social worker in Minnesota applicants must obtain a bachelors or graduate degree in social work from an academic institution accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE).Appendix B: Mental Health Workforce community ForumsGearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX B-1Held Between February and May 2014 FORUM LOCATIONS Bemidji Northfield Brainerd P ine City Duluth Rochester Grand Rapids S t.

Need paid reimbursable time for supervision to create a learning culture in agencies. Raise reimbursement rates so wages can rise. Need more loan forgiveness programs. Wages for mental health workers on the reservation aren't competitive so good people leave for the county positions. Difficulty of developing long term strategies (which is needed) when dependent on a biennial budget to make decisions. Supervisory hours for licensure are too expensive for employers and licensees. Recruitment Hard to find mental health care workers even in non-designated \"shortage\" areas Education needs to be brought to the students in rural areas if we want them to stay and work in rural areas. Develop job shadowing opportunities in community mental health clinics. Look at housing incentives as a way to recruit workforce to rural areas Working conditions Paperwork Implementation Recommendations have to be followed up with money and resources and a timeline for implementation.Education and Training Explain and popularize role of Certified Peer Specialist. More MH training is needed for law enforcement, along with a budget to pay for it. Develop a certificate for direct care mental health workers. Develop a certificate for adult foster care workers. All group home workers should have more mental health education/training. Need more specialists in the schools. More interpreters and bi-lingual professionals and practitioners. Incorporate cultural diversity training into all curricula. More and better education and training on substance abuse/mental health (dual diagnosis) for all. All primary care providers should have a mental health educational base to recognize and deal appropriately with symptoms. Explore credit for prior learning for DHS and NAMI classes and certifications. More internships as part of bachelor's and master's social work training. Create equivalencies for supervision among disciplines for masters licensed professionals. Need for better de-escalation training. Access to care Acute bed shortage Need for same day/next day appointments Stigma Housing and transportation needs of clients Extreme difficulty in finding services for children and young children Integrate behavioral health with primary health care\u2014 it works on the Bemidji State University campusAppendix C: 2014 Mental Health Workforce survey ResultsGearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-1Appendix C: 2014 Mental Health Workforce Survey Results Sur vey Instrument Sur vey Questions: Charts Sur vey Open-ended Questions CONTENTS Survey Instrument .............................................................................................................................................................................................

For retention: we try to provide a respectful, collegial and supportive work environment. 85 I wish this question asked us wha t is wrong with the system we worked in; like pay rates, insurance company incompetence, etc. The deep end of mental health is reimbursed unfairly too high and so they sometimes pay $20,000 more than we community providers. Is that what we wan? Everyone working at the deep end??? 86 Y ou have to pay them so well that it is difficult on the business due to historically declining reimbursement from 3rd party payers. 87 I f you found something successful, let me know. 88 W e partner with training institutions to give trainees and us a chance to \"audition\" each other, enhancing the chances of a good \"fit\" from the first date of hire. 89 1.

At this time, 1.5 years later, I have two new vacancies and have been able to make offers more quickly, as generic lists were available.

You need to ask this question to EMPLOYEES, not EM - PLOYERS. I am an doctoral-level psychologist employee of a community mental health center. The so-called \"pay for productivity\" model is a HUGE barrier to quality mental health service, much of in \"underserved\" populations. Although business management can appropriately be applied to mental health in some ways, mental health is not a \"business\" in the \"profit-making\" sense of the word. Under pay-for-production my salary is based on how many people I see. Therefore, my \"corporate\" incentive to is keep people coming back, NOT guide their healing so they no longer need my services. At the same time, this pay system allows NO compensated time for collateral contact, such as talking to the school counselors or school social workers of my young clients, in-depth phone conversa - tions w/ parents, conversations with ARHMS workers who see my SPMI clients, etc., etc. While ethics require these conversations to occur, in my pay-for-productively system (but there are others) does not count them in my \"pro - ductivity\" or \"billable hours\" or whatever you want to call them. This, too, is a significant barrier in helping people heal and have less need for services. Most importantly, it forces THE BEST CLINICIANS out of public mental health and into private practice. Even as as a mental health professional with a heart in community mental health, that's where I'm headed. I'll see rich white people with hangnails, rather than the huge issues facing the more-and-more folks near the poverty level. 107 this has been v ery difficult. I have not found any sure fire ways to do either. I am able to employ clinical trainees, but once licensed, they usually leave. 108 Hosting an in ternship program with local schools of social work Encouraging graduate education to promote from within 109 T he best method is through current staff. The issue with this is we are just shifting resources from one part of the state to another. There needs to be a statewide initiative. MH centers need to pay recruiters to access these profes - sionals. This is money we don't have and cannot recoup. 110 P ostings with Associations Groups, MACMHP , MCCCA, Association of Black Psychologists, Somali Psychological As - sociation, list serves at the U of M 111 w e recruit through internet, and newspapers. Retaining mental health staff has proven to be incredibly difficult in this rural area. 112 Ha ven't found a successful strategy yet. I pray a lot. 113 R eferral bonuses for employees and retention bonuses for new hires. 114 S tar tribune ads, a completive wage, which would be an adequate reimbursement from DHS for IRTS services. List above should include Mental Health Practitioners, bachelor level positions which provide numerous services in the twin cities and throughout the state. 115 I t is very difficult to recruit early childhood professionals, there are not enough to recruit. 116 B onuses for increased productivity, loan repayment 117 Recommendation; word of mouth. W e offer supervision for students so we can get a good look at them before making the choice to hire them on. By increasing the number of staff qualified to supervise students colleges hear about us. Flexible schedule. Positive team-very supportive of each other-feel good about co-workers professionally and personally. Flexible schedule, multidisciplinary practice, self-directed makes people happier and easier to work with. Access to administrative decisions\u2014\"Shared control.\" In private practice, the biggest barrier is reimbursement. Also, we are aware that good case coordination is paramount to patient care. In private practice, these services are not insurance reimbursable and take up a large portion of time given the population we serve. T his is often a deterrent for professionals. W ages, lack of benefits Pay benefits of a small business without grants to support practice--this is not a strategy, it's an issue that we encounter 118 fle xible work schedule, emphasizing work/life balance, competitive wages and benefits Recruit through active par - ticipation in relevant organizations, trainings, educational programs and through volunteer and internship options 119 T here are certain graduate schools that have a better reputation for producing high quality therapists who have strong ethics, integrity, and professionalism. These institutions interview candidates in some form before admittance to their program, this is essential to the field, however there are a few programs who do not do this and those stu - dents (even the good ones who attend for other reasons ) are not afforded the same field training opportunities.SURVEY QUESTION 2: If you are an employer of mental health professionals, what successful strategies have you used to recruit and retain mental health professionals?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-27120 W e have looked at increasing the rate of pay, increasing PTO time, and increasing training opportunities. 121 W e offer clinical supervision as a benefit and offer many options of advancing their career if they stay with the agency. 122 L ower productivity!

Increase supervision opportunities so people needing supervision come and stay. Pay more. Make mental health appealing to people.. Increase safety at in patient facilities especially the high acutity settings 2 W e are a Head Start program. We find that there is a significant lack of qualified professionals working with fami - lies, particularly that share the same philosophy and TX methods. 3 I w ould like to see graduate schools focus more on community mental health and school based health programs 4 S afer environment and competitive wages with similar professions that are with private sectors. 5 I nclude clinical supervision hours for LGSW to work toward LICSW. 6 I believ e that the Board of Behavioral Health requirements regarding LPCC licensure is inadvertently pushing potential practitioners out of the field. The current requirement that practicum sites for MA programs not be the same as the students existing work site means that only students who can afford to take significant time away from paid employment can afford to complete the programs, particularly since virtually no practicum sites offer any pay, and often require many hours per week for 9 months. This means that students who do not have family to support them are often unable to obtain this degree, which I believe results in a strong majority of students from upper-middle-class families who are, by default, overwhelmingly white. In my experience, the work of a mental health practitioner and the work of a practicum student are often very nearly comparable in scope and type. If the board would allow a system for existing employment to be expanded into practicum work, I think it would encourage a wider array of potential counselors to enter the field, and encourage diversity, as well as promoting the health and wellness of new professionals. 7 T uition reimbursement; provision of supervision prior to licensing 8 MN is o versupplied in its metropolitan areas and under-supplied in rural areas. This just caused a community resi - dential program to close down out in our area. First, better recruitment efforts in rural areas are necessary. Second, I suggest education in all training programs on rural behavioral health and rural culture. Third, unless we fund rural training opportunities such as internships, they won't exist to attract practitioners. Fourth, apply the state loan forgiveness program to psychologists and MSWs. Fifth, make tele-mental-health available to rural areas, but make sure that practitioners understand rural culture and behavioral health issues. Sixth, fund rural behavioral health research, so we know what works for rural people and communities. Seventh, fund rural behavioral health services at the level that will allow salaries commensurate with urban ones. 9 Gr ant funding to subsidize woefully inadequate insurance and Medicaid reimbursement. 10 H igher pay.

LicSWs, Psych nurses, Ladcs, Mental health Techs, etc. Hotlines and warm lines are good, but I'm leery of even doctors who diagnose by telephone, sight unseen. Also, we can create a clinic for mental health emergencies (some people say there is no such thing as a mental health emergency). The point is, we have GOT to do better than sending people through the ED. As far as training, there is so much disparity in our field. I envision our field will follow that of business: we will have lower-level skillset practitioners handling more people initially, for less money than someone with a higher skillset. Also, can we distinguish why LicSWs are allowed to practice individually vs. PsyDs who need to practice under a doctor for a longer period of time? This is so confusing for students who are certain they want to do counseling, vs train - ing for a position in Research. Make these programs lucrative! 71 br eaks on student loans 72 M aintain working connections 73 O ur agency provides a work-from home option which allows you to complete a report at home instead of going into the office.

Retention of those that want to be in the area is easier but being a \"great\" place to work really helps.

The lack of Pysch NP options at a reasonable cost is an issue. 91 Giv e incentives to providers to continue to work with clients who miss their appointments 92 Lic ensing requirements should be more consistent throughout all professions. Some of the rules regarding tasks that must be performed by a mental health professional in different settings are frustrating and make it difficult to do business. Allow those individuals who are on the track of being a mental health professional do the duties of the job with supervision. Rule 2960 allows a MHP trainee provide therapy and write treatment plans with supervi - sion, however they cannot approve restrictive interventions. This makes no sense at all. 93 the same as abo ve 94 Elimina te private insurance companies and increase reimbursement rates through medicare and medicaid for mental health professionals. 95 I believ e self-care is often downplayed or underestimated. I think insurance companies partnering with gym/fit - ness facilitites is a good start, but it may be helpful to see more alternative health partnerships. For example, a non-profit or business partnership with a yoga agency (e.g. core-power, Tula yoga, etc.), or companies providing other self-care services for relaxation or retreat (e.g. hotels for getaway, therapeutic massage services). This could also be further encouraged by payroll benefits (e.g. $ added to paycheck for participating in these regularly). 96 L OWER THE CASE LOAD NUMBERS 97 P ay them more.

What I have noticed is that many master's level graduates run into difficulties where organiza - tions require multiple years of experience before considering a candidate. Too few slots are available for entry level positions. At the same time, I have heard those who hire mental health professionals complain that there is a shortage of mental health candidates. The problem is NOT that there is a shortage. The problem is that organiza - tions do not want to hire students directly out of graduate programs.SURVEY QUESTION 3: What strategies, steps or ideas do you have to recruit and retain more mental health professionals?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-33100 P ay for fees for additional certifications which may be required, ie, Advance Case Management Certification for Social Workers; Certified Brain Injury Specialists, etc. Increase financial support for CEU training for LICSWs/mental health professionals to $2,500 or more per year to be used at MH professionals discretion - NOT the employers specified training. Administration/Management encouragement and support of more reasonable case loads - not emphasis on \"productivity, \" or focus on paperwork vs. direct service; and build in MH staff opportunities for self-care, clinical consultation and support without it \"counting against\" the MH professional's productivity; employer support for MH professionals to attend training to become MH clinical supervisors and provide the support staffing to help make provision of clinical supervision an integral part of the MH professional's practice opportunity.

However, skilled providers that are experienced in working with complex mental health issues are hard to find and when identified they often are not taking new clients (as they are highly in demand). There are many 'therapy' providers and medication management and diagnostic assessment providers that are sub-par. This speaks to training, education, licensing, and unrealistic case-loads across all professions that provide these services (LMFT, LICSW, LPCC , PsyD., etc.). Clients, therefore are not being effectively treated. This is extremely disappointing, when a client is motivated to work on their mental health, but remain stuck due to inef - fective interventions and miss-diagnosis. These Clients often do not know that they can question their providers interventions, how to advocate for better care, or what kind of results / outcome / changes that should accompany their treatment engagement. Nor do they always know that there should be a treatment plan in place for individu - al therapy, or they are left out of this process. Additionally, clients do not know or understand that there are various professions providing similar services and that various approaches are used (theoretical orientation and interven - tion) . For example, individual therapy can be provided by an LICSW, LPCC, APRN-CNS, or LMFT, and further, what their individual approach might be. If providers of all disciplines were assessed and ranked in areas of expertise, skill , and approach/theoretical lens by a signal out-side agency or organization and then this information was made available to the public (on-line), clients could make more informed decision about the care they seek and receive. This too would help other providers, such as case managers and in-patient discharge coordinators, make appropriate referrals or recommendations to clients. With this information publically available to the community through an on-line web site, an assessment tool could be developed to help clients identify treatment needs (e.g., medication management, individual therapy, group therapy, day treatment, long-term, or short-term interven - tions, male or female provider) and what theoretical lens and interventions that might be a good match or most effective for them. This on-line tool should also match client searches with insurance coverage. When potential clients are left with an overwhelming list of providers that are covered under their insurance plan, they are only given name address, phone number, and sometimes, areas the provider self-identifies to have expertise in by list - ing areas they \"specialize in\" (e.g., anxiety disorder, mood disorder, physical abuse). This list is like a shot in the dark, when clients pick up the phone; they are not given objective information on the provider, nor are they informed on what to expect from treatment other than what the provider shares - which is not standardized and influenced by their training, education, experience. Furthermore, new clients to mental health treatment, and many estab - lished clients, do not know what services or treatment they may need. Clients are likely to be in crisis when they first come into contact with mental health services and do not have help navigating the system.SURVEY QUESTION 3: What strategies, steps or ideas do you have to recruit and retain more mental health professionals?C-34 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX 106 P rovide adequate funding so more staff can be hired if the work load expectations exceeds the amount of time available each week (i.e. case load and paperwork requirements match a 40hr work week).

Profession - als are reprimanded if they do not meet the quota. This is wrong. I understand trying to see as many clients as possible, but it takes away from providing quality care and burns staff out. One idea would be to eliminate this in practice and put more emphasis on quality care! 117 Net working, advertising 118 it is v ery difficult--we try to provide internships that allow them us to know what we are hiring and they get great experience doing clinical work 119 I w ould suggest to go to the colleges and go to the schools of social work, family social science, trauma focused departments and talk with the students. Take the time to conduct and informational session about the field in real life and real time and how their degree can be utilized and/or how they can create a position within an organiza - tion. I would go to communities of color i.e. coffee shop \"Golden Time\" on Selby in St. Paul or other local meeting areas and ask the professionals in the room about their work experience and if they are happy where they are at, why or why not. 120 G ood job opportunities, capacity to grow in their own areas of interest, free clinical supervision. 121 I am not an emplo yer but my organization pays pretty well, offers some upward mobility, licensure supervision, generous PTO and good benefits.

This includes African American, Asian, Native American, Spanish speaking and LGBTQ. I would recommend a grandfathering for LMFT, LICSW, LPCC etc. I would recommend this as many people of color are not passing the exam not due to lack of knowledge but due to factors that are not taken into consider - ation such as social economics. People of color start off at a disadvantage because they are often raised in poverty or near it and they tend to have fewer experiences with academic language used in their homes/neighborhood schools. They tend to have linguistically dependent courses which makes passing standardized tests more of a challenge for them.SURVEY QUESTION 3: What strategies, steps or ideas do you have to recruit and retain more mental health professionals?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-35127 T he above strategy, mine, is anachronistic.

Is someone taking on this challenge. It is my understanding that for some disciplines (e.g., APRN's for example), educational requirements continue to climb and so do the politics around their ability to prescribe. See recently bills introduced to Senate to make NP's responsive to Medical Board and direction under MD's. IN addition, NP's who want to collaborate with MD's in some cases are required to pay MD $5-10K per year for the contract. That adds to the costs and directly affects the supply of NP's/CNSA's at our disposal. So, the costs need to shift somewhere. Our agency can't afford the additional $10K to establish collaborative relationships. Fortunately, here, we have MD's who agree to do this. 161 Lic ensing boards have gotten out of control with their requirements, simplify them and put them all under one entity. 162 W e are not currently planning to recruit or hire additional staff. 163 I ncrease pay, decrease paperwork 164 fle xible schedules, benefit package 165 S tudent loan repayment programs for working with children, SPMI, families w/ compllicated issues. See above: . I am a doctoral-level psychologist employee of a community mental health center. The so-called \"pay for produc - tivity\" model is a HUGE barrier to quality mental health service, much of in \"underserved\" populations. Although business management can appropriately be applied to mental health in some ways, mental health is not a \"busi - ness\" in the \"profit-making\" sense of the word. Under pay-for-production my salary is based on how many people I see. Therefore, my \"corporate\" incentive to is keep people coming back, NOT guide their healing so they no longer need my services. At the same time, this pay system allows NO compensated time for collateral contact, such as talking to the school counselors or school social workers of my young clients, in-depth phone conversations w/ parents, conversations with ARHMS workers who see my SPMI clients, etc., etc. While ethics require these conversa - tions to occur, in my pay-for-productivly system (but there are others) does not count them in my \"productivity\" or \"billable hours\" or what ever you want to call them. This, too, is a significant barrier in helping people heal and have less need for services. Most importantly, it forces THE BEST CLINICIANS out of public mental health and into private practice. INTERESTINGLY the insurance companies are paying upwards of $100,000 for psychologist who review my plans. Under pay-for-productivity model at my community mental health agency, a PHD level psychologist tops out a $50,000.

Especially in cultural communities. Often in cultural commu - nities there are people who the community go to for help. they are typically not mental health professionals, but have some knowledge and credibility in the community. Harness this model to increase access to help. My second idea would be to institute mental health education programs in jr high and high school. This introduces the con - cept to students and goes a long way toward dispelling the stigma that prevents would-be future mental health professionals from considering the field as a career option. When there was a shortage of teachers, money was made available to help pay for the pursuit of a teaching degree. I remember there was a particularly strong recruit - ment effort to get men into the field. I would suggest waging a similar effort to recruit mental health profession - als. The bigger issue is to look at why people are not going into the field. What specifically are the roadblocks and challenges that have successfully kept people out of the field, and who specifically are the roadblocks deterring. Once identified, start building a program from there. 170 Super visors needs to be aware of how people from different cultures may work and learn differently. We need to shift our ways of teaching- which can help people from different cultures and people who think and learn differ - ently for other reasons. 171 A ctively recruit by sharing more information about career opportunities. 172 r etain - better salaries however, with such low reimbursement rates for behavioral health care services, agencies can't afford to pay more.

Helping the work force gain the supervision needed to gain professional licensure. 173 W e try to be the kind of place where professionals want to work: nice facility, supportive staff. Sadly, pay levels and benefits are difficult in private practice because we completely rely on patient fees & third-party reimbursement for all income, so we try to be generous in scheduling and other ways. 174 B etter pay! 175 I t is difficult to get qualified staff to apply in this area - we try to \"sell\" the community to potential employees. 176 H igher compensation for bi-lingual bi-cultural practitioners. The added value of language, therapeutic, and re - source skills used, requires more work. Conversely, lack of recognition of this added value higher caseload burden and reproduces social inequalities in the MH system. 177 M ake it a more inviting environment for child/young adult psychiatrists to want to move to MN and stay. 178 R easonable working conditions, excellent wages (see above) and benefits 179 W e try to support the few early mental health providers we have with training. 180 Need t o look at insurance reimbursement policies, which affects pay and workload. The job is not desirable, be - cause they need to see too many patients for not enough time. It is hard to feel effective and to do a competent job under current conditions. The State of MN has not made mental health services a priority--funding has been grossly slashed--when we treat these individuals and have no place to send them for the home and community services they need, we're fighting a losing battle, which leads to burn-out and relocation. 181 B etter pay, including helping new therapists access and pay for supervision. 182 I ncrease salary, supervision, and training. Recruit through cultural mental health organizations. 183 H igher pay for all mental health professionals, loan repayment programs, being willing to certify them in certain therapy modalities, free supervision towards licensure.SURVEY QUESTION 3: What strategies, steps or ideas do you have to recruit and retain more mental health professionals?C-38 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX 184 W e tend to retain individuals for some time because we are a very flexible clinic and have a great team. I think that working with a multidisciplinary team is imperative to professionals feeling like they are not shouldering the entire burned of a case, which reduces burnout. I think that 3rd party payers need to truly understand the work we do--coordinated care is in the best interest of the patient, however we often are not getting paid for these case planning meetings, or attendance at an IEP meeting (for a child or adolescent), which greatly decreases the likelihood of a profes - sional to attend. The work we do is specialized and informed--we should be reimbursed for this. I think often people leave the field because the level of documentation and the time required to complete it takes away from the work with the patients. I also think that educating high school students early on about the MH field would be a way to encour - age them to go into the field so that when all of the older generations start retiring, we have people to replace us. I think that having more loan forgiveness in the field, perhaps for being trained in specific areas (i.e. trauma)--rather than having loan forgiveness be specific to geographic locations. It could perhaps be applied to the type of clinic you work for (i.e. non profit). I also think that it is very important to be able to bill for the work that students do. There is about 2 years between graduating and full licensure that students are going under utilized because their time is not billable -- and also, the person supervising them often does not get paid for this supervision. In private practice it is not realistic to ask someone to volunteer their time to train a student and not get any payment for that time. If we are going to train good professionals, we need to make it worthwhile to the individuals doing the training/supervising. . Number one barrier to recruitment of professionals is LOW REIMBURSEMENT. Payment systems for mental health diagnoses are too low to support independent practitioners. ALL mental health departments within larger medical systems are subsidized by more profitable departments. It is NOT POSSIBLE to earn an average income as a psychiatrist by supporting oneself through patient fees alone. It is NOT POSSIBLE to run a state-of-the-art practice with supporting professionals like nurses, receptionists, and billing specialists and have this supported through patient fees. Number two barrier to recruitment of professionals is the failure by insurance companies and other third-party payers to allow payment for trainees. This means that in addition to lengthy educational training, psychologists, clinical social workers and counselors must endure one to two years of unpaid or severely underpaid internships. During this time they must work under supervision, but there is little work for which they can bill third-party payers. This has led to a shortage of internship positions, as interns become a cost for any practice or clinic in which they work. Third-party payment struc - tures inhibit and discourage innovation that might make it possible to work with more patients more efficiently. For example, group therapy is an underpaid modality. It's difficult to be paid adequately for nurse education of patients, which would free up psychiatrist time to see more patients. Diagnostic reports are ridiculously lengthy and repetitive. Third party payers will not allow use of outside material as part of the patient record, and DHS now requires a particular format to their reports. This means that innovations that would save time (and add to the effectiveness of the clini - cal record) are actively discourage. All information must be incorporated into a single document and re-dictated or written by the practitioner, even if the information could be gathered and put into the patient record more efficiently through another format. Mental health professionals at our practice typically spend 7-15 hours per week in unreim - bursed time on documentation. Lack of reimbursement for services that are required to get the patient well is another barrier. With children, attending the school IEP conference can make a tremendous difference in the child's daily stress level by educating teachers about the child's mental health problems. This is not recognized as a medical service and is not reimbursed. Lack of reimbursement also means that the sickest children, in residential treatment programs, may not be attended by a psychiatrist at all, or may see a psychiatrist for only 15 minutes per month. LOW REIMBURSEMENT also limits our ability to offer generous benefits compared to other employers in town. 185 Gr eater involvement with local graduate MH degrees in Social Work, Psychology, and such. Sponsor their clinical supervision hours 186 C ase management had a therapeutic component to it, it would be useful if that was reimbursable at a reasonable rate as it would allow for higher pay for therapists which would improve retention. Also, this work is draining leading to therapist burn out, more paid time off (that is mandatory) would help reduce case loads and increase self care. 187 A llowing a more flexible work schedule. 188 F ellowships to allow more people to make advanced degrees more affordable (especially in psychiatry).

I think it is important to have them move to the community and \"buy in\" to the community. 196 Help pa y MH professionals to complete training on EBP's (through their employer, or through grants or other op - tions). Better pay for MH professionals at all levels. 197 P rovide a supportive, safe, collaborative work environment. 198 W e want these mental health providers to spend about one-half of their time in work that helps patients adapt to illness, helps other providers continue to provide balanced care including much of the behavioral health needs of patients and we ask the MH providers to teach skills and share knowledge with medical providers. 199 P utting pay on par with education and experience, mental health professionals are paid much less than equally trained medical professionals. 200 Networking 201 I ncrease pay level.

We also email St Mary's University MFT program, Adler Graduate School, St Thomas/St Kates as we have contact relationships with them for interns. We also have year round internships, and have developed a comprehensive intern training pro - gram in FACTS model of services, and we look to hire from interns that have demonstrated passion for services and ability to deliver services, and willingness to learn and received feedback. 209 W e need to get into high schools and talk about it as a career choice. Especially for males and ethnic minorities. 210 C urrently some of the documentation requirements and complexities of some electronic medical records discour - ages newer practitioners/professionals. Needing to complete extensive, complex documentation, often after work hours has been a drain on newer employees. We've been attempting to provide training on concurrent documen - tation to providers--works better for adolescent and adult clients vs. young child clients and families.

Many psychologists while adequately trained to provide competent psychological ser - vices end up in ethical dilemmas based on their lack of understanding or skill with paperwork (keeping good prog- ress notes), billing errors, and general business management. Examples of these issues include providing therapy to co-workers, multiple relationships, poor structural supports, poor internal policies that are out of compliance with state and federal law. 33 T oo many therapists are being educated. 34 C ontinue working cooperatively w/ other MH service providers to identify training needs, share information regarding training opportunities, employers support training by providing funding for training and continuing education 35 Gr aduate schools need to move away from traditional hour long clinical outpatient sessions, more team-based, col - laborative/integrated care. 36 make it manda tory, survey results thru the pharmacies for addictive medications. make it mandatory to join the controlled medication data base offered in most states 37 specific guidanc e during clinical practice on these matters needs to be made clear to supervising entity.

To become a professional they then are on a 'licensure track. \" This has become something of a 'racket\" with the boards who now have added a requirement that you have to have a 'supervisor's endorsement' and now we have a whole bunch of mental health professionals not helping people but providing costly licensure supervision. This all costs money and the rates are going down not up and employers cannot afford to pay people enough to recover their costs. With the cost of college and graduate school and now post degree supervision being a racket people are coming out with massive student debt. DON\"T ADD ANY MORE REQUIREMENTS.

My graduate taught a lot of theory, but not enough practice information. Understanding the real day to day tasks and activities before getting out into the field would have been helpful. In terms of diagnostic skills--tak - ing courses in abnormal psychology does not give a complete picture of a person who is living with mental illness. I think it would have been helpful to meet real people living with mental illness and understand their symptoms and their story, more so than reading a case example. Trauma is a topic that was not discussed in my graduate program at all--I am not specialized in treating trauma because it was part of almost every patient I saw. A lot of the children growing up in foster care, or being placed out of the home, have complex trauma histories. If the people working with them are not informed about trauma, and also are not working with the families/systems that these children live within--I do not believe these kids will successfully reunify. 276 -Enc ouraging training at an organization level 277 P rovide training on the process of special education - perhaps through MDE (Minnesota Dept. of Ed.) frequently schools receive reports from community providers of mental health that recommend an IEP , not understanding the process, this confuses and frustrates parents who then come to school with the diagnostic assessment expecting that their child will automatically get special education services. 278 R estucturing of all training programs to be \"dual liscnesed\" or at the very least increasing the number of hours that focus on addiction and co-occurring disorders, additional course work that explains the difference between Inte - grated behavioral health (the medical component) and co-occurring disorders.

For example, primary care clinics see clients every 10-15 min. and complete very brief, sometime one word assessments of client's reason for visit and often provides treatment recommendations in that same 10-15 min. time period. Mental Health completes at best a 50-60 min. brief diagnostic assessment before treatment begins at the next session.

The current requirement that practicum sites for MA programs not be the same as the students existing work site means that only students who can afford to take significant time away from paid employment can afford to complete the programs, particularly since virtually no practicum sites offer any pay, and often require many hours per week for 9 months. This means that students who do not have family to support them are often unable to obtain this degree, which I believe results in a strong majority of students from upper-middle-class families who are, by default, overwhelmingly white. In my experience, the work of a mental health practitioner and the work of a practicum student are often very nearly comparable in scope and type. If the board would allow a system for existing employment to be expanded into practicum work, I think it would encourage a wider array of potential counselors to enter the field, and encourage diversity, as well as promoting the health and wellness of new professionals. 8 M ake part of training from start. 9 M ake mental health treatment such a psychiatric services, therapies, and mental health workshops more afford - able so that low-income people can access them more readily 10 Br inging training tot he work site; having education classes distributed over just 1 or 2 hours a week and allowing staff to attend 11 On-line educa tion for some courses can be useful, but doesn't convey some of the interpersonal skills and values that are critical to behavioral health.

Everyone has a job supervisor since they are practitioners or clinical trainees. Boards should be re - quired to honor any supervision by a QMHP not just in one of the professional silos. There should be a tax credit for employers in this field to make up for the increased costs and then they can pay people more. Also lower tax rates or loan forgiveness for those working in this field. 200 as an e xample, the Board of Psychology is offering 7 free CEU hours this year to psychologists.

This is a internal - ized drive that cannot necessarily be programmed or mandated 217 1) This state has a dire shortage of psychiatry subspecialists, including child and adolescent psychiatry, foren - sic psychiatry, and neuropsychiatry. If the state offered fellowships that paid well and/or provided student loan forgiveness or repayment DURING THE FELLOWSHIP people would flock here for those programs. Service require - ments could be built into these programs so that participants have to work in the state for some period of time. 218 I think w e are blessed with really good continuing education options in Minnesota but we have allowed insurance companies to drop partial payments to training professionals. I am talking about people who have completed their degrees and passed their licensing exams but have to still have 1000-2000 hrs of supervised work to become fully licensed and bill insurance. 219 S ocial Work Education programs could offer a mental health specialty/focus to include current best practice train - ings.

The issue with this is that these programs provide care for the most ill MH clients who are community based. So I am hiring the least ex - perienced staff for clients with the highest need. Then these staff become MH practitioners and move too other programs. This is inevitable because the IRT is the only place that can include the cost of care of rehab workers. All other programs require use of practitioner to complete the service. 238 P lease see answers to #6 and#10. 239 M ore options for shorter, more affordable trainings and advanced levels.

Families should be incorporated in every level of care if they are supportive as they are a vital link to the coordination of care. 103 I think peer and family specialists c ould be VERY effective on the first-responder level, in a clinic setting outside of a hospital.

I would like to see train - ing on working with individuals who live in poverty and it should not be training on how to get them out but how to work with this population. In rural areas the training needs to focus on more than one ethnicity because there often are not large ethnic populations, however the diversity of a community can be great. Once again provide the training and resources in areas other than the Metro or Duluth. 124 On going tr aining 125 I believ e that we have a culturally competent workforce in this area 126 O ffer cultural trainings 127 tr aining and education for those already in. getting into high schools and colleges to recruit culturally to bring awareness to social work (that it isn't only child protection) and increase interest 128 I ncrease the entry level salary. 129 I think hitting things head on is wha t agencies need. Having real conversations about privilege, aversive racism and marginalization is what we need to do. Getting away from \"politically correct\" tendencies and being honest about our faults/biases, assisting each other to work through them. 130 R equire minimum cultural competence standards in both undergraduate and graduate programs, and require a minimum amount of continuing education hours in this area annually. 131 CEU 's and exposure. 132 M y observation has been that both faculty and students in many programs tend to be overconfident and under prepared. Increasing the documentation of educational inputs with regard to multiple forms of diversity across mental health professional curricula and courses is needed. Perhaps it might also help to have state mandated continuing education in diversity required on an annual basis. 133 R equire educational curriculum and clinical/practicum experience to incorporate focus on culture and identifying one's own cultural experiences, bias, weak areas of knowledge and offer consultation, mentoring, education, etc. to support ongoing learning and flexibility of changing one's practice to be respectful and reflective of the individuals and families one sees and works with. 134 build c oursework into the curriculum 135 C ontinue to require coursework in culturally competent practice for licensure in all mental health work. Consider requiring periodic CEU's after initial licensure. 136 T here is very limited if any prevocational programs that provide interpreters to clients that speak different languag - es or sign in ASL.

Further, culture should be more than a token part of assessments. 139 M ost mental health practitioners seem to be white middle class Americans so having more diversity in the work - force would probably be the best way to do so. However, if that isn't possible, maybe have more discussions about it to build cultural consideration. I feel like cultural competence is a lofty goal. 140 1.) M ore trainings related to this! 2.)

This area is tipped toed around because it creates a great amount of uncomfortability in the white,male,christian population, which has a great deal of power in our agencies. 152 I n addition to ongoing training around cultural competency, we need a diverse cultural workforce. 153 need tr ainings by people in the cultural group 154 S tudents coming out of grad programs hear a lot about being \"culturally competent\" , but what they often don't seem to get is what it means to be poor. Being \"broke\" as a grad student is not the same thing as living in poverty. Knowing how to speak Spanish is great, but it doesn't give you insight into what it's like to be hungry. We have to talk about \"class\" and culture. 155 a t this point, there is such a high demand for well trained MH professionals plus the fact that this is covered almost incessantly in graduate school, that this is the least of our worries 156 A dminister more meaningful trainings that the providers can apply to daily situations. 157 Y early in-services and making hiring culturally knowledgeable staff a priority. Hiring a Spanish speaking staff per - son would be very important as well as persons from other representative cultures and groups. 158 Emplo y individuals of color and from different cultures. 159 A sk culture leaders to assign a colleague to a cross cultural discussion. Twin cities only recently grew by incorpora - tion of diverse cultures. 160 ongoing tr ainings in these areas 161 C oncentrate on the rural counties. They receive little training maybe once per year and have little interactions with any other people with different cultural needs. When they do, it goes poorly. 162 Each emplo yee needs to complete more culturally competent classes/trainings. More education in secondary education regarding this, and then ongoing through our professional career. 163 dev elop internships that provide work experience working with diverse populations 164 r easonable, accessible training funding 165 T he tools and education that is out there is sufficient. You can't change a person's beliefs or values. Regardless of the training that is provided. If a person is bias this is something that was developed long before they became a professional. The issue is addressing issues of cultural bias when it happens while not minimizing the perceptions of the person who has reported a cultural bias. 166 O ffer trainings on line 167 I t is difficult to recruit culturally competent providers in rural settings. I think creating more opportunities for pro - viders to network and receive training would be beneficial. 168 Is \"cultural competence\" a training issue, as it is being treated now? Or is it best accomplished through experience in culturally diverse communities, supervised by experienced supervisors; and by having multicultural co-workers? I don't think \"diversity\" training accomplishes much in terms of real learning.SURVEY QUESTION 9: What suggestions do you have to create a more culturally competent workforce?C-82 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX 169 Ha ve training programs require students to work in more culturally diverse settings, similar to categories of train - ings that are currently often used (therapy practicum, assessment practicum, etc.) 170 P rovide incentives for people of multiple cultures to want to join the identified workforce and provide more anti- racism training in the work force to invite and support a more supportive work environment. 171 I nteract more with the American Indian Mental Health Advisory Council of MN, CLUES of St. Paul and African-Amer - ican Family Services and the MN Asian/American Health Coalition 172 T his would be part of the curriculum mentioned in question 6 above. 173 C reate a setting in which it's ok for people to ask questions, even if they're awkward or oblivious.

Have cultural competence be an item on annual evaluations. Develop each agency's cultural values, and how all staff will exemplify these values in their daily work. Identify where and how the experience can be obtained and articulate clearly the cultural competence expectations. Please note that this does not only pertain to race. Cultural competence is essential when working with elderly, GLBTQ people, or even youth. 210 M ore trainings available and required at agencies and at school.

These are used by practitioners who currently assume such responsibilities on an individual basis, often without in - stitutional support (see response 3 above). However, few practitioners or institutions use cultural humility. Cultural humility in combination with cultural competency could enhance community ties and become a powerful force for strengthening better treatment outcomes. 221 C ontinued training opportunities that are enlightening, experiential not just talk.

Unless they receive services, most kids aren't aware of the field until later in life. Highlight the fact that it's a \"helping profession\" . Kids tend to be curi - ous and inherently sympathetic, so they'll want to understand why someone behaves a certain way, why another person hears voices, why the kid down the hall needs special classes, why another is so excitable one week and grumpy the next. This could also help eliminate the stigma around mental illness.

Making services available to individuals in different areas would also be big. 117 Emplo yers should participate in and provide continuing education for employees on diversity issues. Also, initia - tives in which task forces composed of individuals with diverse cultural backgrounds work together to examine issues related to mental health (or other relevant issues), so that mental health professionals have the opportunity to experience other cultures directly and to learn from each other. 118 R ecruit diverse people, make pay rates and reimbursement more appealing to people. 119 L ook for employees from different areas. 120 I t's a long term process given the years of professional training and licensing. 121 M any master's programs are seen as major sources of income at many universities. Tuition tends to be high and scholarships are not readily available. Scholarships for diverse students and financial incentives for graduate pro - grams that effectively graduate diverse students and that provide demonstrably effective learning outcomes for majority students on cultural diversity are needed. 122 I ncrease the wages/salaries of the social services/mental health-related fields and jobs. Provide benefits and op - portunities for training/education to be paid for, perhaps in exchange for a work commitment of a certain amont of time. Assess students in high school and undergraduate programs and identify those who may have skills/interests in mental health/social services fields and create a financial incentive for them to want to pursue these areas as careers - means has to have a higher income potential and less work/job stress relative to demands of the profession. 123 F lexibility in educational and licensure expectations that take into account barriers for people of color 124 Ha ve access to interpreters. How can clients go to work if they cant speak english in the programs that we work with? Provide funding for the CADI waiver to provide this service. 125 R ecruitment from academic institutions that have higher ratios of students of color than local universities, includ - ing going out of the state.

There should be job shadowing, trainiing, internships etc to give them the interest and provide opportunity. Also some types of grants, scholarships would go a long way for some people to get engaged in a field that does not generally have a great financial payoff.SURVEY QUESTION 10: What ideas do you have to create a more culturally diverse workforce?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-91135 A div erse workforce will only happen if we support culturally diverse individuals getting into the field. This should start, at minimum, in the high school, but can start even earlier. There should be a specific focus on these areas directed throughout a person's education career. 136 M oney would help. 137 w e have free monthly trainings for staff and good clinical supervisors--see above 138 INTENTIONALL Y SEEK OUT DIVERSE POPULATIONS!!! Do not continue to give lip service by stating that efforts have been made to seek out culturally diverse staff but actually do it. 139 Expand publicit y re influx of immigrants 140 I ncrease the number of trainings and model them after the different reconciliation projects happening on a large scale. Being respectful of other cultures becomes more important to people once you know their story. 141 P eople coming from minority or the none dominant culture having access to education and employment experi - ences to compete with employment candidates from the dominate culture 142 r easonable, accessible training funding coaching/support during training 143 M ore people of color are needed. This includes African American, Asian, Native American, Spanish speaking and LGBTQ. I would recommend a grandfathering for LMFT, LICSW, LPCC etc. I would recommend this as many people of color are not passing the exam not due to lack of knowledge but due to factors that are not taken into consider - ation such as social economics. People of color start off at a disadvantage because they are often raised in poverty or near it and they tend to have fewer experiences with academic language used in their homes and neighbor - hood schools. They tend to have linguistically dependent courses which makes passing standardized tests more of a challenge for them. I recommend a grandfathering for one year to allow several unlicensed professionals the opportunity to be licensed. Many people refuse services due to the mental health professional not being able to releate to them due to cultural differences. Many professionals are not given the opportunity to work with people of color due to a perceived notion the professional who happens to be female and most of the time white repre - sents the \"system\" the client feels is against them. Or they believe the female mental health professional is unable to relate to them. Sadly, if they were raised in a rural area or in an area where they were never exposed to people of color until they started working in Twin Cities.....they don't relate. The same as a person being raised in the inner city may find it difficult to relate if they moved to rural MN. 144 Enc ourage at the high school level careers in health care. 145 C ollect data, please. Do young people of diverse backgrounds enter the mental health field at a smaller percent - age than they finish college, or is the real stumbling block at the college and pre-college level? We can't have more diverse MAs or PhDs if we don't have sufficient diverse BAs and BSs. 146 D evelop programs to recruit a more diverse workforce from a much earlier point, perhaps starting in k-12. This might include targeted scholarship programs or other similar measures to make the mental health provider work - force more diverse in a more appropriate manner. 147 T he entry point i.e. I believe a program's website can send a message of being culturally friendly (or not), the super - vision needs to reflect cultural diversity. Work of mouth is powerful so there also needs to be happy employees giving the message that it's culturally friendly work 148 R each out to the above-listed agencies to give in-services about NHSC Loan repayment and the state loan repay - ment programs. 149 R ecruit in higher education institutions 150 A ctive recruiting in all cultural groups will be necessary. This will involve working with educators to introduce young people to mental health professions as options. 151 -P ush professionals to think beyond basic cultural competence education. An attitude of \"it don't matter if you're black or white\" does not mean someone is culturally competent. -I think the \"grandfathering\" aspect of MSW licen - sure for people who are minorities who work with minority groups is a good step. My agency has taken advantage of this option and people are excited about it.SURVEY QUESTION 10: What ideas do you have to create a more culturally diverse workforce?C-92 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX 152 I think g randfathering in for licensure is helpful, but there needs to be follow up with what is expected as a licensed person. This was not the case with the board of social work. 153 O utreach to minority communities and financial aid or scholarships. 154 S olve the problems of poverty and the dysfunction it begets in people. Most of the 'culturally diverse staff we have had are not with us anymore because their lives are too chaotic and as soon as you hold them accountable some claim discrimination. So there are people coming into the field who lack competence. 155 P eer-to-peer training and support. Use model of Cultural Wellness Center in S Mpls. 156 H iring people from a diverse background. Having material in more than one language. 157 A ctive recruitment and possible incentives for professionals who are from a diverse background, or for profession - als who are willing and able to obtain competencies for working with culturally diverse populations. 158 Suppor t cultural diversity in all areas of leadership and decision-making. 159 None. 160 r eaching out to high school students is essential to cultivating culturally diverse MH professionals 5 years down the road 161 A c ommitment by agencies to increase hiring of culturally diverse staff 162 A gain, more loan repayment options and contracts to recruit people from all different backgrounds. 163 I mproved recruiting process. 164 unsur e...depends on the workplace 165 G et in the high schools and start talking about these jobs. Many kids and adults know nothing about these types of careers. 166 M entor-ship programs for students who wish to become a mental health professional to get through school, better school recruitment, better support for students once in grad school. 167 R ecruitment efforts that are much more intentional that focus in on those in, or considering graduate programs 168 I w ould consider this a bit out of my area of expertise. My best thought is to better use interpreters more often. From my work in schools I know that I have assumed someone was following what I was saying and they were not. If I were an immigrant I would stay close to the people I could communicate with. This one simple move could greatly limit mobility in the workforce. 169 Ha ving the flexibility to recruit, despite civil service systems. Utilize allowances made to more easily employ people of a given culture for which there is a client base. 170 R ecruit in undergrad and offer money 171 see abo ve 172 H igh school visits by Social Workers, I would volunteer if asked 173 F unding to offer scholarships to students who desire training in one of the mental health professions. 174 Close the high school achiev ement gap and adequately address poverty well before graduate school. More grants for education. 175 P ayment for the level of eduction is a bad investment. We have to make it worth while for people to get into the mental health field. Too much reliance on people doing it out of the goodness of their heart. Need to be some - what balanced. Providers who offer services in different languages are not paid at a higher rate, actually paid less than if a provider used a translator. 176 B e less rigid in edcuational requirements. 177 same as #7SURVEY QUESTION 10: What ideas do you have to create a more culturally diverse workforce?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-93178 None . I see no obstacles to anyone interested in entering the mental health field from doing so. Individuals tend to go into areas that are of interest to them and for which they have abilities. This is not done in a uniform way in all areas of employment, from mental health professionals to NBA basketball players. 179 be pr esent on college campuses and educate regarding the work field. 180 I ncrease wages. Start recruitment in junior high. 181 not sur e i have a great deal of difficulty with this. 182 A dvertise on employment sites targeting various ethnic populations 183 A mor e culturally diverse workforce would likely be more attainable by first enhance how culturally competent that workforce is (see above). 184 B y growing the workforce. 185 P lease see response to question #6. But overall, this is a huge systemic issue. Many students are kept out of the field, and out of good colleges because the schools they attend do not offer the courses required to gain entrance into the school. The standardized tests, though proven not to be predictive of future academic performance or success,have been roadblocks for many culturally diverse students. Basically, the system by which one gains entrance into academic institutions shaves off many layers of very competent culturally diverse people. My ideas, look at how culturally diverse people typically use and relate to the educational systems and use this information to modify or add programs, in essence,.meet people where they are at. 186 F iguring out ways to market mental health positions to high school students. Figuring out ways to make bachelor degrees more accessible and reasonable to people of color seeking social service/mental health degrees. Mentor - ing opportunities in high school, college, and the workplace. Figuring out ways to emphasize other strengths and other ways of doing things in a paperwork and billing driven system. 187 S eek out those interested in the field at colleges and community colleges. Offer information sessions about the work and the career possibilities. Seek out people working in the field who do not have degrees (ex: aides in the schools) who would make excellent mental health workers if given a clear path and support to get there. 188 P ay attention to the recommendations from the Governor's Advisory Council and the Subcommittee for Children's Mental Health who have been working on this issue year after year after year. 189 Suppor t practitioners of color in their licensure process 190 W ork should be done at the high school level to educate students around career options in the mental health field. Cultural values and beliefs need to be taken into account when recruiting and integrated into how we educate and train. 191 M any people from other cultures have health provider experience; seek them out and accept their methods that look different from ours. Hire promising people, young adults and up; offer them scholarships and loans for their training. 192 I ncrease recruitment to include areas where members of a minority populations will be inclined to see the posting. 193 R ecruit where the people are, where they shop, where they live, where they gather, where they worship. Do not use online or social media if you want to be effective. People, who have good reasons not to trust, depend on personal relationships. That means ask -and compensate- current bi-lingual bi-cultural persons to reach out to others 194 O ur agency has the office decorated with diverse items, photos. It is a directive and requirement not only from the home office, but also licensing. 195 D ont know 196 W e need culturally competent early childhood mental health professionals in rural MN. 197 T his really needs to start in early childhood, creating more equal opportunities for early education. However, I have heard from practitioners from non-caucasian backgrounds that Minnesota is not a very welcoming place, and the perception is there are not communities that are diverse in race and income level. I think this is improving, but it's made it difficult to recruit and retain diverse staff.SURVEY QUESTION 10: What ideas do you have to create a more culturally diverse workforce?C-94 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX 198 same as question #9 199 r ecruiting- but this is a challenging area. 200 A gain, teaching children in high school about the field and the need for culturally diverse professionals. 201 lo wer tuition rates 202 M ore educational opportunities for nondominant social groups.

Strive for our professional boards/leadership to be more reflective of our communities (and show you care at the state level by financially validating that). 207 W hen students are failing, student, family, school, therapist of similar color come together at school to address why they are under-performing. Students and parents come to school to hear spokespeople from trades and other businesses talking about careers, income, education, experience, behavior needed etc. 208 A gain this comes down to trying to recruit people to want to work in this rural area. 209 T argeted recruitment by colleges and universities. Need to figure out how to \"sell\" the MH professions so more people of color and people of other culturally diverse backgrounds feel more interested in pursuing MH careers. Peer mentorship can help also. 210 Engage minor ity providers and community members in discussions regarding how to make the workforce more welcoming and safe for minority clients. This will attract more minority providers to work there. 211 Expand health pr ofessional educational grants with a priority for those from a more diverse background and bo - nuses to all training programs that provide opportunities for these trainees. 212 S ame as above 213 c ontinue to allow people the ability to access education inexpensively. it was difficult for me to meet the educa - tion and licensure standards because of cost, I can only imagine how daunting it would have been had I been a immigrant 214 r ecruitment efforts outside of online postings 215 A ssist with educational cost for diverse students and set up pathways for students who are first generation by edu - cation them on possibilities.

An idea might be to have the review team for Ombudsmen Children Mental Review group by Culture share perspective from their experience in working with families. 221 see abo ve. The professions need to begin to reshape their practices to fit better with a culturally diverse workforce, or at least provide some bridges. 222 R ecognize that many potential providers from diverse communities have families to support and offer flexible training that is a good value for the time and expense. 223 W ork with licensing boards to help address cultural issues with licensure testing for Mental Health Professional level testing.SURVEY QUESTION 10: What ideas do you have to create a more culturally diverse workforce?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-951 I ncentives New professionals to fill jobs in necessary areas 2 Lic ensing/supervision requirements for social work at the LICSW level take a crazy amount if time to do as a part time worker. I am currently on my fifth year of supervision and have another 30months! I was paying for supervi - sion and driving an hour to get it for a while. It's discouraging and I feel you may loose a few to these requirements. Seven years of supervision I should have a doctorate!!! 3 I ncreased flexibility within the delivery of service system. Improving service delivery through a trans-disciplinary approach. 4 I appr eciate grant opportunities for evidence-based training that pays for provider time, like the Trauma Focused CBT. 5 Establish c onsumer operated support services in place of CSP , Support funding WRAP and WRAP training and technical assistance, Move away from the medical model to prevention and recovery. Psychiatry needs to look at a more holistic approach and be more collaborative in the recovery process. Psychiatry needs to be trained in recov - ery, nutrition, and non-drug approaches. 6 I 'm not sure. 7 Need t o pay mental health providers commensurate with training and experience. You get what you pay for. Need insurance reform. Too many limitations/barriers that impede effective access and treatment. 8 M ake it easier to access mental health resources by consolidating disparate and often difficult to find mental health services. Also more publicity re mental health issues, concerns, & legislation via radio & TV programs. I would rec - ommend Minnesota Public Radio and TPT (Twin Cities Public TV) for their informative and sympathetic programs dealing with various mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, bi-polar, and other issues. 9 P er 9/11/13, USA Today article says \"'Peers' may ease mental health worker shortage under Obamacare. \" I hope that the state of MN will be able to get funding to have more Certified Peer Mental Health Specialist training classes. My goal is to become a Certified Peer Mental Health Specialist. Also, provide more funding to NAMI-MN, so that more people can be trained as \"In Our Own Voice\" presenters....and/or provide funding for those NAMI-MN \"IOOV\" speak - ers to get paid. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/11/stateline-mental-health/2798535/ 10 Just w ant to stress that just having access is not enough. The competency and interpersonal skills of those profes - sionals proving MH treatment and supports is important. Need to focus on professionals developing good person centered skills and \"bedside manner\" . 11 C reate the funding for rural areas, and the professionals will follow. 12 D on't let insurance companies run our field. Best practices should be driving our field based on the needs of each individual client, not on what insurance companies deem appropriate. Insurance companies are also offering limited reimbursement for new health practitioners they're affecting the supply and demand chain, pushing many outpatient organizations to have waiting lists of a month and half long before new patient can be seen by provider. 13 W e are at a tipping point. We are working hard to reduce stigma and encourage help seeking behavior, yet we have no place to refer patients to that don't have a 6-8 week waiting list. Let's convene various community partners and work to develop a referral model to meet the needs of everyone. Let's train and employ mental health workers who may serve as a support to individuals and families when access to licensed professionals is a challenge. 14 I nclude more specializations. Spend a little money to save some money. There are many many trained Art, music, Dram etc. therapists unable to get gainful employment yet they are getting request to offer free services on a regu - lar bases. It's really unfair and wasteful. Spend some money to really look at these equivalencies and then hire them 15 L ower fees for services 16 T here is a shortage of mental health service providers 17 S creen for possible trauma, abuse, neglect in more comprehensive and family supportive ways. Supportive and fun parenting groups that focus on 'you are not alone' and expression for parents of own past. School based sup - port for the entire school culture and community in each school. Healthy expression through arts and relationship groups, healthy body and integrative nutrition groups and support for parents in interesting and fun community Ed offerings. Why wait until extreme difficulties and life patterns/worldview become trauma based.SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?C-96 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX 18 W orking in a CSP , I have noticed that there is a huge lack of affordable housing for people with SPMI. It seems dif - ficult to connect people to services when they do not have a stable place to live. 19 Ongoing medica tion management, after stabilization of mental health condition. Covered by the patients' health insurance. 20 Establishing funding- inadequa te payment is a big issue. 21 T o get MH professionals to come into our community they need to be paid the same salary they receive in the cit - ies to do the same work. 22 Rur al areas have a severe shortage. Waiting lists can be long. Many services can't be delivered due to the cost and time for travel. ACT teams can be very helpful, but impossible to implement in rural areas. Reimbursement is insuf - ficient to cover travel/ time costs. The shortage of psychiatrists and prescribing nurses is severe. Reimbursement is again an issue. In one week my children saw a neurologist for 10 minutes and was reimbursed $640. Later that week they saw their psychiatrist for 30 minutes each. the reimbursement was $78. This is not sustainable. Addition - ally, there are many individuals with neurodevelopmental disorder associated with exposure to alcohol in utero. There are few providers who are trained to recognize, diagnose and intervene. We need more training in this area. Finally, the caregivers are the largest workforce. They need training, support, respite and PCAs to keep children in the home where they are loved and have the best chance of health. We can't afford to have all these children in hospitals, residential centers, group homes. We need access in the homes. 23 Help simplify the insur ance process. ie a client can only see a therapist in their network 24 I nterns and recent graduates hold jobs working with the highest responsibility/risk, most vulnerable clients. These jobs are the lowest paid and the organizations operate with the least amount of support-supervision...when they need it the most. If they had more support they could provide better care, avoid burnout and give better services back to our communities. It is very problematic to me that only the poorest of the poor and the richest rich have access to mental health services. If you help children-people with milder mental health issues they will not develop into more costly mental health Dxs (BPD, ODD, Addicts) causing more societal problems. Inclusion of art therapy in schools, community centers has had huge positive impact in other cities. 25 M ore transportation assistance and options. Less paper work for insurance. Less administrative requirements that cost money to for practices to provide. 26 I ha ve worked in public service for many years and in the area of mental health services periodically since 1989, returning again in 2013. I was dismayed at the decline in MH services, lack of accessibility to psychiatry for persons not yet or newly diagnosed, the lack of inpatient hospital beds, limited hospital stays, costs being charged to coun - ties by State Operated Services for services needed by persons w/ limited options or court ordered admissions. Continued collaboration and a willingness by the medical community/psychiatry to consider providing services in new ways, increased PCP participation, competency in treatment of physical and mental health needs of persons w/ a diagnosis of mental illness, use of technology to increase access to services in rural, remote parts of MN, under resourced areas, etc 27 W e need to move all levels to the top of their license - psychiatrists/APRN's need to move to more consultation with primary care - move from seeing 400 patients to consulting/overview of 4,000; need to focus on the most difficult patients and Team with other professionals in and out of the clinic setting; leverage internet telepresence for tele - mental health 28 T rain more individuals in this field, support them in their practice, make the training mandatory. 29 A llow license holder to work at the top of their license. Develop this option at the licensure levels. 30 W e have many qualified educated 4 year and masters level personnel who are not getting hired due to inappropri - ate exclusion of their educational credentials. This includes people from other cultures. Task forced to clarify NOT ELIMINATE educational equivalencies. More flexibility not less. 31 I t would be great if Minnesota offered some sort of student loan repayment program that starts the day they are out of school. 32 tr ansportation expense provided in rural regions where it can be 30-50 miles each way to access mental health clinical servicesSURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-9733 P rovide more mental health services in the schools and domestic abuse shelters 34 Ear ly childhood and Infant Mental Health needs to be considered an area of increasing professionals in. When we can impact the family and child at this level so that we can decrease the long term needs for intensive mental health. If we can help resolve and support families when children are young it can decrease the number of people who need intensive mental health programming in the future.

There is a need for families on private insurance to have that in-home option as well 35 T he financial qualification of lower cost for people with mental illnesses 36 W e need to dramatically increase the number of workers trained to provide effective early intervention treatment for autism given the dramatic increase in ASD diagnoses. 37 P hysician Assistants can and are specializing in the field of Psychiatry under the supervision of Psychiatrists.

Currently PAs are being reimbursed by Medical assistance enrollees for inpatient psychiatric services- however- DHS has not agreed to reimburse for PAs serving MA patients in outpatient mental health settings. By allowing PAs to be reimbursed for outpatient mental health services- PAs will be able to recruited by outpatient mental health settings where prescribers are greatly needed. 38 W hile I realize it's impossible to have representatives from all organizations across the spectrum participate creat - ing in the Mental Health Workforce Development Plan, I believe the committee left out some major players. I was surprised and disappointed to learn that the steering committee for this initiative does not include more repre - sentatives from the MN Dept. of Human Services, in particular the Direct Care & Treatment administration (for - merly known as State Operated Services). With 5,000 employees and nearly 1,950 clients (1,550 inpatient and 450 residential), it's got to be one of the largest providers of behavioral health and chemical dependency services in the state. In addition, I feel the committee missed an opportunity to lead by example when it didn't include chemi - cal dependency professionals in the discussion. With IDDT such an important aspect of behavioral health care, it would be logical to seek input from the other side of the equation. I'm further amazed that the MN Center for Mental Health is not involved, especially since its part of the University of Minnesota and supported by DHS. Not to mention leadership from the Master's of Professional Studies in Integrated Behavioral Health degree program at the U of MN. 39 A dopt consistent use of \"mental health professional\" in all laws and rules governing access to and payment for mental health services. 40 Ha ving positive work environments and being treated as a professional Healthy organizational structure 41 r equire commercial to cover services as MA/MCOs-no real parity when it comes to ARMHS or CTSS 42 I r eally believe that working with schools - especially social work schools to educate students on the importance of direct practice and case management. 43 I nsurance needs to cover open-ended ongoing counseling!!! 6-12 week sessions is nothing when someone has suf - fered trauma or struggled with severe mental health symptoms. 44 M ore access to mental health services for the middle class as well as campaign for more acceptance of mental health concerns 45 C ities provide access. In rural areas, access to quality mental health treatment is difficult to locate, if it can be located at all. Example: In our area, when the advanced trained nurse retired, it was 11 months before another was found and hired.

These individuals have the same (if not more) amount of experience and education as Marriage and Family Therapists and Social Workers and are for some populations more qualified to serve as Mental Health Professionals. With the recent release of the updated CDC prevalence of autism as 1 in 68, we are finding ourselves in dire need of improved access to qualified Mental Health Professionals who can provide the evidence-based treatment most appropriate for this population. 59 S ame as answer above re: recruitment and retention 60 F or a young adult with a mental illness, the requirements needed are too strict before they can qualify for Adult Case Management with the county. Once a young adult finally accepts help, which is the only way in our mental health system he can get help even though as family members we know there is something wrong, unless they have been hospitalized 2 times and have a sever and persistent mental illness, they don't qualify for any help, financial, social, and vocational wise. The stress that this puts on families that love this person, is extremely difficult and potentially unsafe and life threatening. Sometimes, all the young adult needs is another caring person with access to helpful resources to get them on track to become responsible members of our society. After all, they are young adults and do not want to live with their parents and want to somehow figure out how to be able to be on their own if at all possible. 61 M ore ability to work with schools/families. Assistance with job training. 62 W e need more in-patient beds. When someone becomes very ill and requires inpatient care- they currently often have to wait or be placed far away from their home. This is a major breakdown in our delivery system. 63 T he ACA will hopefully result in more people having insurance and being able to afford care and meds. 64 P eople do much better when they can have frequent appointments if needed.(including more than once/week if needed). Have the same clinic offer coaching and crisis lines 365 days/year. This is actually cost-effective because it is flexible to the person's situation (which can change). It promotes recovery, decreases hospitalization and con - tinued downward spiraling. If we had more community based clinics like the one described; people could access quality care much sooner rather than having to wait until they deteriorate to the point of being committed. People would have a much better quality of life and it would save an enormous amount of money. .SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-9965 M aybe have a community resource day or fair to encourage networking, provide information in a non-threatening atmosphere, presentations 66 I think gener al practitioners and family doctors need to learn more about how mental health treatment and sup - ports are accessed so that when they make a referral, they can also offer insight into the amount of time it will take to get treatment. They should also know where to guide a person to start in their search for treatment and support -- it often isn't clear whether they need to call their insurance company, cold call a psychiatrist, drop in to a walk-in center, call the county, etc. 67 I mprove the process for registering complaints. Provide more surveillance regarding basic requirements of provi - sion of services. Attract quality people to the field by reducing stigma and increasing prestige and reimbursement of behavioral health professions. 68 I t would be a great help in our Region to be able to utilize those professionals available through the CBHH and assigned to the tribes, but not accessible to all other populations. They have time available - just not the ability to serve beyond the scope of their limited client contact. 69 I see the hear t of this problem as a fundamental lack of adequate resources at every level of the mental health treatment system combined with a very inequitable distribution of resources in both fuding and providers. The State of Minnesota has too long neglected the needs of our residents suffering from mental health disorders, espe - cially in rural areas. Whatever solutions may be proposed will need very substantial additional financial investment combined with a more equitable and regional distribution of those resources applied in a more flexible, tailored way to address the diverse needs of specific populations and communities. 70 I mprove crisis response by training emergency responders (including 911 operators) and by providing additional training on interacting with families to specific MH response teams. Support use of PBIS in schools and use of MH crisis response rather than police in case of emergency. Stop criminalizing mental health! 71 Ensur e they're provided in non-metro areas. 72 I mprove transportation in rural areas Allow phone contact to be billable to ARMHS 73 T here are areas that are needed that were specific to your list. Child Psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, in home counselors in rural areas to meet the specific and unique needs of families. 74 I am v ery happy with the CSP workers in International Falls. They do a great deal to support the mental wellness of the mentally ill. They pay is too low so there is a lot of turnover in those positions and that is tough on the popula - tions that they serve. 75 Diff erent counties do things differently. Perhaps making access to programs/funding/how laws are followed more uniform across the state. 76 w e are desperately short on placement resources and funding, and this also adds to lack of applicants of quality workforce, rural areas are in need 77 Y es. But you haven't listened. You have only select groups you work with and listen to., 78 3r d party billing works against poor individuals who face continual crises and challenges. Once individuals miss appointments, 3rd party mental health billers stop giving them appts. This is problematic. Billing is not the \"be all and end all\" for mental health services...particularly for guaranteeing access to people who face transportation challenges and multi-generational poverty. 79 I think M innesota needs to work on improving treatment settings that are also long term residential settings (old Rule 36 facilities). It takes a long time to \"recover\" from an SPMI that is considered to be a chronic illness. 80 C ontinued and increased funding for community-based supports, Evidence-based practices research. 81 U se of technology that is reimbursed by third party payers.

Instead of assigning someone to one intern or student practitioner, we may as well advocate a \"team\" of practitioners at the outset. It is traumatic for someone to build an effective rapport with one practitioner, only to have them transferred a couple of months later, and have to begin the process of building a rapport with someone new. The team could meet weekly and discuss clients, in order to be on the same page. 92 mor e professional staff to allow for more availability in services and programs which will reduce patient wait times, especially if someone is trying to access services for the first time (this is especially true for those seeking psychiat - ric services) 93 No 94 A gencies and Professionals need to be willing to be wrong and willing to learn from others, including their peers who are having positive results and the individual culture groups without judgment. 95 W e need to move our focus off of diagnosis and symptom suppression and onto RECOVERY! I also think that our emphasis on treatment settings needs to be de-centralized away from large institutions and out into the commu - nity into a smaller, more comfortable setting such as the clubhouse concept and neighborhood drop-in centers. I also think that some stigma busting and early intervention with proper treatment could go a long way toward re - ducing our current reliance on intensive care settings. In other words, put out the campfire before the whole damn woods goes up in smoke. 96 La ws pertaining to funding of resources that assist people better manage their illness need to be congruent from the county up to state level. How am I supposed to advocate for supports when a county says \"By law, the state must use up their resources first before we chip in!\" Then the state says, \"By law, the county must exhaust their resources before we chip in!\"?

I've known this person for some time, and know that he has been carefully dissecting the problem, publishing papers, presenting his data at state and national conferences, and has served on boards that seriously consider rural MH workforce issues. He has even been consulted by federal agencies and might possibility have the most solid understanding of the problem as anyone currently in the field. I asked him if he had been contacted by anyone at the state level or NAMI, and the answer was \"no. \" He hadn't been informed of this survey or this inquiry. I'm not trying to chastise but make aware that you have this resource and you are not using it. My fear is that you are also missing out on a considerable amount of quality research on this topic that really tells the story to those interested. He's easy to find - Dr. Paul Mackie, Department of Social Work, Minnesota State University Mankato. Until you talk to this person, you've not talked to the person who has a lot of informa - tion on this very topic. 101 I t is crucial that the state of Minnesota work to increase the community services needed so the forensic hospitals can discharge difficult patients back to the community so the access for new patients needing the care can be admitted. Until this is done there is a need for additional acute beds for the most difficult patients. 102 Hope t o see actual people doing the work in the field at the upcoming meeting- seemed like only ones invited were key stakeholders from the people at the top of those organizations- are they really the ones that you need to focus on to get info? 103 cr eate a school-based therapist position (like school psychologist or counselor or social worker) 104 C urrently there doesn't seem to be any or much follow-up when someone is discharged from a mental health unit. There should be a seamless transition to providing peer specialists and family support upon discharge. Also beds need to be made available in the area where the person w/mental illness lives. It's somewhat useless to hospitalize them in area far from their home. 105 T he overall health system has to place a higher value on behavioral healthcare professions by improving reim - bursement rates so employers can afford to pay better salaries. If you simply do the math-- reimbursement rates times reasonable productivity, you get a number that doesn't match up to the level of education and experience required to do the work. 106 D on't forget rural. 107 Br oaden the array of possible funding sources to reduce the reliance on MA as a source of payment for mental health services. 108 mor e accessibility for licensed providers, particularly LPC and LPCC to insurance panels so the community can benefit from their skills 109 T he lack of beds at the state systems is appalling. There needs to be long term safe treatment options for staff and patients. Violence has to be addressed in acute care across the continuum. Families should be a standard voice in treatment. I see plans made based on what a patient says with no realistic base of what is really going on because of HIPPA. There should be case coordinators across the mental health and CD systems (same one) who can actually coordinate and have access to beds, appointments, medications. There should be chronic addiction case coordina - tors. Focus on children. Special education is the beginning. The pressure on the schools hurts education and the community as a whole. 110 B etter pay so that more people go into the profession. Focusing on prevention.

Provide apartments with security at the front to act as a gate keeper. 119 F or employers to offer incentives for employees to stay rather than leave after life circumstances changes. At this agency, there is frequent turnover of mental health social workers due to lack of pay structure and benefits that adjust to an individuals changing life circumstances for example a new graduate social worker. This is a great place to start but once a person gets married or has children the pay scale and benefits are such, it's difficult to stay in this high stress job and get very little pay or recognition. 120 I think br eaking down the stigma is a big first step. NAMI-MN and other related agencies do great work, and we should all be partnering with them in these efforts on the ground. 121 Ha ving moved to MN only 18 months ago, I have had the opportunity to compare mental health services in this state with those of other states. I have been disappointed to find that the quality of services here is much lower than in other states. This appears to be directly related to the fact that much of what is offered here is offered by bachelor's level providers who lack professional competence. To compound the problem, these providers are frequently inadequately supervised (which includes both not enough supervision and supervisors who are not adequately trained). 122 T here are no specialist in RAD in most areas. Attachment therapist are in great need in most areas. 123 I f you pay people more, they will enjoy their work more and provide better services. 124 T he whole \"medical\" system/model and gatekeepers of the financial resources which might support mental health- related issues needs to change payment/funding sources to create more parity among all of the otherwise \"medi - cal\" identified areas of focus, for example, cardiovascular, orthopedic, internal medicine, etc. so that mental health-related treatments and support services are funded and given as much importance as any other area. 125 M ake it easier for clients to get Mental health CM. have a team that is an outreach team that can go out to clts houses to sign them up to work with a MHCM. Most people with SPMI don't want to go to a clinic that has a wait - ing period of an entire day to be told that they have to take medication etc.. Have a team that meets with a clt in their home, in a program and set up MHCM there on the spot. I think more people would be reached this way than asking them to show up to a clinic. IE: I have a friend that wants a MHCM but I cant encourage him to go to the clinic. Great give me his nbr and I will have a MHCM meet him for an intake. Look at reducing the amount of paperwork that is required by CM so that its minimal paperwork, so that more time is dedicated to the clients. I wish there were more in home programs ie: therapist that go to clients home, psychiatrists that go to clients home. We aren't reaching the clts that have a hard time leaving their house, that are off medications for a period and cant organize their thoughts or aren't good with keeping appointments. The new state forms for the new rate setting is limiting access to clients to work. First the CADI Cm has to request from the CAFC a rate form for the current hours for the client at the CAFC then another form from the CAFC to show what it would look like when the clt starts working. Then the CADI Cm has to request from the Work program a form for the clt to start their program. Then the CADI Cm has to turn in the new service agreement with all the forms and have an account clerk enter them for the services to start. I am finding out that the Foster care programs aren't wanting to give the form to me bc that means a decrease in rate for them. So, collecting forms is delaying services. I have currently been waiting 2 1/2 weeks on one CAFC to provide me the form. Before the rate forms started here is how it went. Clt said I want to work at this program, CADI Cm contacts work program, clt tours, all agree its a good fit. CM enters contracted rate onto service agreement for agreed amount of days. Clt starts working within 3-4 days. Again talking to Cm before a new plan is rolled out to see how the work would get done I think is very BENEFICIAL! Currently, all I am doing is collecting these rate forms and waiting on them so that I can set up services.SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-103126 R amsey County has no place for people with SPMI to connect with other people with SPMI, except the mental health center.

We need more Mental Health Professionals who speak more than one language and who are more culturally competent. 128 M ake social service work more lucrative.

Ournkw 6 yr old had to wait until 4 and required being hos - pitalized 132 I nform those seeking help for their loved ones about the differences between the types of mental health profes - sionals to enable them to seek the proper treatment. It's almost impossible to get an appointment with a psychiat - ric doctor. Family counselors are not enough when someone has bigger issues. 133 I nsurance denials, and pre-auths denied on whims, are big problems for providers. 134 I mprove sliding fees, accept all insurance. 135 K ids in the Juvenile Justice system often are not given the type of mental health services that would be provided if they were in a residential facility. Much of this is due to lack of financial support, lack of good education around the need to mental health services in locked facilities, and the traditional belief of consequences -v-rehabilitation. Many probation officers struggle with the lack of services provided/required of families prior to a kid becoming a \"criminal\" . Something is wrong when a county social worker wants a probation officer involved so the kid will get some mental health services. 136 None 137 decr ease cost barriers, reduce stigma, increase MA reimbursement so the MH professional field is more attractive (we can increase salaries), continued increase of intensive OP programing to reduce hospitalizations 138 Q uit allowing red tape from allowing the services to the consumer to happen. Meaning be creative on how it can be billed and document the material accurately with explanations if necessary on the reasoning for the service and the impact it has on the client, family, community and society as a whole. 139 leaders need t o know access to providers and family 140 I f people could have an easier way of maintaining MA and SNAP , that would be a good start. Housing with paid utilities, including a phone, would also improve access. People who have MA but no stable address can't schedule medical transportation effectively, and without a phone they can't confirm the ride. Services for people with any criminal background are even harder to find. Since clients of color are disproportionately involved with criminal justice, this makes it even harder for them to break out of this cycle of racism and poverty. Finally, a lot of people want to work but can't without supports, and employment programs are really scarce for people who do not have a CADI waiver. Also, when people work, reporting income can be very confusing. People find themselves in the position of having to maintain their disability rather than developing their abilities. If these services could be avail - able, all together, but in several locations (like in the health care home model), it might help. 141 M ore trained interpreters 142 T here are very little to none mental health providers in rural counties. This means that the families have to travel 30-50 miles for any appointments. These counties need to somehow have the mental health professionals come to them, or set up an office in the county. Also, increasing the reimbursement rates for an in-home diagnostic assess - ment would help with access to services, but also give a more accurate and complete diagnosis and recommenda - tions for services.SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?C-104 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX 143 Hopefully the health car e exchange will give the working poor greater access to mental health treatment as this population is currently the most underserved. 144 W ays of motivating people in more rural communities 145 A llocate more funds to mental health care. 146 C urrently there is a grandfathering for LICSW for people of color to apply. The theory sounds good but many County employees who have worked in the areas of Mental Health for several years are unable to be grandfathered in due to the county not being a part of this process. In addition, several nonprofits are not hiring people of color to fulfill the requirement of working at a nonprofit in order to get grandfathered. I know several people who have had no success in locating employment in a nonprofit the entire year 2013-2014. This type of gate keeping is mak - ing it difficult to allow access to people of color in the field. If the goal is for the client to reach a sense of wellness by managing mental health symptoms, It should not be a difficult task to have people of color represented in the population of service providers. Non-minority clients have the luxury of receiving service from people they identify with based on race, color, religion and social economics. That same option should be given to people of color. 147 Change the insur ance system so that all are insured at a cost people can do. 148 I t is important for Universities to produce qualified applicants, who have the training and experiences to be pre - pared to practice in multiple settings and competent to meet the needs of our populations. 149 T he model of mental health service delivery has gotten fragmented, in part because the service delivery model is dominated by private practice. Although I am in private practice, I do not find it to be a good way to deliver service to any but patients with the fewest needs. For high-needs patients (chronic mental illness, dual diagnosis, men - tally ill children and adolescents), service should be delivered where there is psychiatry or psychiatric nursing on site, where there are both degreed professionals and BA-level mental health workers. As mental health becomes increasingly housed in medical clinics, those clinics need to show a commitment to integrated care. As of now, mental health is seen by medical clinics as a sometimes-necessary adjunct to their \"real\" mission of medical care, so they have one or two entry-level psychologists or clinical social workers. Mental health will never be a good profit center for these corporate clinics compared to medical service delivery, so there must be other sources of income that subsidize the Allinas of the world for delivering mental health services. Fee-for-service for a psychologist will never measure up to what they can bill for a Family Medicine doc, much less a surgeon. 150 M ake it easier for providers in private practice to connect with county agencies as another option for services. 151 A. M isunderstanding mental illness and stigma are two barriers to WANTING TO ACCESS tx. 2. It is going to get harder to access services as it becomes harder to practice as individ. or in small groups due to requirements of electr. health records and health care homes, and the continual downward slide of insurance reimbursement rates. Some practitioners are going to just give up and quit--early retirement, etc. 152 P ass a law in MN providing prescription privileges to appropriately-trained psychologists. 153 O ften mental health services are just a piece of the treatment picture, especially with children. Mental health practitioners need to be able to work WITH other professionals (e.g., speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, skills workers, etc.) to better understand and treat the person from coordinated perspective. Professionals treating in isolation miss the full picture much of the time. 154 P sychiatrists are the most difficult group of mental health professionals to recruit and for patients to access. What makes them particularly valuable is their ability to prescribe. APRNs help with access because they prescribe, too. Adding prescribing ability to other mental professionals with appropriate training in clinical psychopharmacology would help both access and the effectiveness of integrated care. Appropriate education and training probably includes a master's degree in clinical psychopharmacology plus several hundred hours of supervised experience. This would all be on top of the education and training requirements that already exist for the mental health profes - sional. 155 T ransportation is a HUGE barrier for many of my clients, along with bilingual/bicultural services. 156 R educing stigma and increased funding.SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-105157 W e need to change the criteria/definition of mental health practitioner and drop the required hours of experience.

It is a fairly new license (about 10 years) and there needs to be more education around the training, competencies, requirements and scope of practice of a profes - sional and clinical professional counselor. This license is among the most well-trained to diagnose and treat mental illness across many situations. There are counselors willing and able to serve in underserved areas and working with underserved populations, but the insurance industry, legislators and other agencies have yet to recognize the value of the license in this state. 161 O ffer returning veterans grants for graduate level schools to work in the mental health field 162 C oncern is obtaining \"easy\" access and then finding a way to pay for mental health treatment. Often the people who need it, cannot afford to have it...or to continue it for any length of time.

Asking those communities the arenas and opportunities may be available 167 I am a psy chiatrist and I moved here from another state last year to start working in a rural psychiatric clinic and hospital. The following may be longer than you want, but it pertains directly to recruitment and retention of psychiatrists. Already I am thinking of leaving my job here because of the dire problems in this state related to mental health services. If Minnesota is serious about wanting to recruit and retain mental health professionals, then it is essential that the bed shortage crisis and the crisis affecting State Operated Services be resolved. Cur - rently, because of bed shortages in the state system, and backups of mental health patients in ERs, aggressive and persistently mentally ill patients are being shunted into private community hospitals that are ill-equipped to care for them. One of my colleagues has written to Governor Dayton about this problem and it is hardly news. There is a reason we need state facilities for some patients. It is to protect the public and the patients themselves. These facilities must be properly designed. For example, my hospital uses a converted medical ward as its psych unit. We do not have a well-designed seclusion room, we have no psych techs, and an aggressive patient could eas - ily harm or kill staff, other patients, or themselves. No hospital licensing agency would look at our unit and say we are \"equipped\" to treat dangerous patients, despite what many county attorneys, judges and ER docs seem to think. These critically ill patients SHOULD be going to STATE facilities, but invariably all state facilities, from Anoka to the smallest CBHH, claim they are \"full, \" or the patient is \"too aggressive. \" (These are the hospitals FOR aggressive patients!!!) THIS IS SOMETHING THE STATE SHOULD INVESTIGATE. There should be an audit of the state system to make sure the facilities are operating at capacity. To me and my colleagues it appears that some of them are not. Emergency rooms are affected by the bed shortages, and the patients pile up there, so emergency room doctors LIE to psychiatrists, concealing patients' aggressive tendencies to get them in the doors of any hospital that will take them. Patients we are assured are \"not aggressive\" often turn out to be highly aggressive. This is no different from sending a patient who has diabetes and also needs a liver transplant to a hospital that has no liver SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?C-106 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX transplant service, and getting them in by only mentioning that the patient needs treatment of \"diabetes. \" Patients die when that happens. They will die in psych hospital too. These inappropriately admitted patients then go to commitment hearings, and after being committed by the judge, the judge will tell us we \"have to take patient back because the state beds are full\" even though we DON'T treat committed patients. (For one thing we often don't get paid.) It is a medical decision to admit a patient to a hospital, not a legal one! Yet I would be in contempt of court if I didn't allow these inappropriate admissions made by judges and attorneys. Although I'm told that by state law, the Commissioner of Health is supposed to find beds for patients, I have never once been contacted by the Commis - sioner regarding a patient in need of a bed. Would a judge force a victim of a serious motor vehicle accident to be helicoptered back and \"readmitted\" to some small local hospital that doesn't provide trauma care just because \"HCMC is full?\" Of course not. Would a judge send a patient needing emergency coronary bypass surgery to a hos - pital that doesn't have a cardiac surgeon because \"Abbott Northwestern is too busy today?\" Of course not. But in psychiatry, judges make medical decisions, and these patients bounce back to us. As a result, they present a great risk to themselves, other patients and staff, as well as to my own career - and there you have the link to recruitment and retention. I fear the day when I am on call and a patient in our hospital kills another patient or a staff member and then I end up on the front page of the Star Tribune. A death occurred at St. Peter recently and I'm not surprised. Careers are ruined over incidents like that. I actually interviewed for a job at St. Peter, but decided for precisely that reason not to take the job. I was actually interested, but an event like that is exactly what I feared. And it happened. I don't plan to put my career at risk on an ongoing basis or take the fall for the State of Minnesota by having my en - tire life ruined over an incident that ought to be prevented, and I can't imagine other sane physicians want to take this risk for very long either. If you really want to recruit psychiatric providers, the system needs to be fixed. Either that or you need to pay A WHOLE LOT MORE. The same thing is true and only worse in child psychiatry. Recruit - ing nurse practitioners to fill the gaps will not solve the problem. It will make it worse. NPs have a role and are important, but they don't have the same training or knowledge. They may not always recognize serious medical sit - uations. Are they required to carry malpractice insurance? You can't drive a car without insurance - you better not be able to care for the most dangerous people in the state of Minnesota without it! (Unless the state doesn't mind being sued, I would guess, by the family of some future victim who was treated by a provider that had no liability.) No amount of experience as a nurse is enough to make one into a doctor. What doctors are trained to realize is how LITTLE we know, and to act accordingly. If legislators are ok with letting nurses manage the most dangerous people in the state, then go ahead. If Minnesota doesn't fix the system itself, then given enough time, the federal courts will. When patients are shunted into the WRONG facilities, they are often not treated properly, because those facilities can't manage their needs. For example, we do not have psych techs at our hospital. We cannot really be Jarvising patients and forcing medications safely without psych techs. And patients have a constitutional right to be TREATED when they are committed involuntarily to mental hospitals. If they sit in our hospital being unJarvised and untreated, and just imprisoned while we all await a bed for them at some non-existent state facility, then Min - nesota will make the news in a different way. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that commitment without treatment is a violation of patients' constitutional right to liberty. You don't think anyone will ever notice? We have already drawn attention to ourselves with the dubious sex offender treatment program this state is running. If legislators want an easy and cheap solution, they can overturn the laws that allow for commitment of the mentally ill. Then we will all see how that turns out in terms of public safety. (Remember this case? http://www.mprnews.org/story/2007/10/16/sjodinsettle ) Instituting caps on malpractice lawsuits might help with recruitment, but will only go so far. If our state wants to keep these laws in place, then doctors are needed, as well as appropriate facili - ties for them to work in. Those facilities must have beds. 168 A s an LMFT supervisor, if graduates seeking licensure could bill a partial payment under my supervision and licen - sure we could put well educated people into the mental health workforce immediately. This is the same for LPCC and LICSW licensure. The reason that the insurance companies stopped doing this was to \"market\" /compete for employers by saying they guaranteed providers with only the highest licensure. The healthcare field is inconsistent in reimbursement. Medical residents, radiology technicians, etc. receive reimbursement during training 169 D on't risk overloading productive and competent staff. 170 Ex tend the length of years a parent can be involved in their offspring's care. Automatically cutting it off at 18 (espe - cially if the patient is in a bad space and won't sign an ROI) diminishes a great deal of information available to help treatment.SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-107171 M oney, reimbursement needs to be higher. The mental health field has changed and we spend more time on paperwork and \"required\" documentation that less time is spent face to face with a client. Compensation is out of balance with the amount of work, hours and responsibilities that are placed on Mental Health Professionals and practitioners. The Mental Health field requires commitment and 45+ hours a week. There's a lot of burn out and exhaustion. Our own families pay the price for us Mental Health Professionals helping others. The medical field has higher reimbursement, but people helping those with severe and persistent mental illnesses get little compen - sation for the demands of their jobs. Hence, quality of work is down. You get what you pay for and when you can't afford educated people. 172 I nclude legislation that makes it harder for payer groups to deny psychological measurement (e.g., psych testing for ADHD) 173 I ncrease reimbursement rates for governmental insurance programs. They are the lowest in the profession. De - crease paperwork and red tape to make taking on government insured clients less painful administratively. Pay mental health professionals when government insured clients cancel late or don't show, just as in private practice. 174 v ery difficult to find mental health practitioners due to limited acceptable degrees and number of worked hours required by DHS. 175 I think this sur vey needed to be addressed to the specific stakeholders. My ideas/ comments are not the same as those of the \"corporate\" level of people in my organization. The tone of the survey is decided bent toward those levels starting w/ the second question. How about, \" If you are an employee.. \" If you are a parent, client, etc.? That said, thanks for looking into this. Recommendations: 1) Payment for collateral contact when working with children. 2) Review of efficacy of pay-for-performance models in community mental health. What are the CLIENT outcome measures. I'd love a year long experiment w/in my agency of so-call \"productivity\" of clinicians who must schedule upwards of 30 clients/week in order to meet a required caseload of 25+ per week. VS. someone who gets paid the same amount for, say minimum 20 clients per week, depending on difficulty of the case. 3) Research is available on what it takes to create a master therapist, and these clinicians are best for clients. 176 H ighlight the importance of preventive mental health services in children, youth and adolescents in schools. Educate school district administrators on the importance of mental and behavioral health services. Move agencies away from preferring LICSWs for positions that can be equally discharged by LMFTS or LPCS 177 M ore funding, so mental health professionals are not so overextended, and therefore often distracted by workload (i.e. - more resources so one person isn't doing the job of 3 people.) 178 W e need psychiatry and we need MH practitioners!!! We also need staff trained in supervision. The rules on super - vision have grown to be expensive and difficult to maintain. So to find people to head up day treatment services can be difficult. 179 T he system has to find a way to engage families and individuals with generational trauma...those who struggle to make it to appointments and access services. 180 W ork towards having rates of reimbursement/payment for mental health treatment and supports equivalent to other medical treatments and supports. 181 S tate regulations and rules can be overwhelming and daunting for professionals delivering services. It can be in - credibly difficult to navigate and complete required documentation. This can be a barrier to providing quality care, due to the cumbersome nature of understanding and abiding rules as well as a set up for burnout and turnover. The state needs to look to streamline systems and have a better system of communication to providers. There must be some way to ensure quality care without creating so many hurdles and layers for professionals to sort through. 182 I ncrease reimbursement! Increase reimbursement! Increase reimbursement! Allow graduates who are working toward licensing to be paid for their work -- combat the discrimination by insurance companies against reimburs - ing new graduates. Pass legislation requiring insurance companies to have in-network providers within 30 minutes or 30 miles of patients' homes. Pass legislation requiring adequate reimbursement for a full spectrum of services: inpatient, day treatment, group, family, individual therapy, and classes. Make insurance companies respond to efforts by practitioners to practice in a way that reaches more people and that evidence shows is effective. Recog - nize that mental illness is a chronic disease that requires multiple strategies to effectively combat -- For example, SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?C-108 Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX when working with children, it is often more effective to train parents than to do individual therapy with the child. Parents are best trained in groups, but to be reimbursed, one of the parents has to be identified as a \"therapy\" patient and the group has to be \"therapy. \" Group therapy is very effective, but difficult to put together because a minimum number of participants must be present each time in order for the facilitator to be adequately reim - bursed. Change the documentation requirements so that every new professional doesn't have to spend 4 hours generating a new, complete, diagnostic report. We should be able to build on previous reports that are adequate and accurate. Reimburse psychologists (and others) adequately for report-writing. Recognize that attending school conferences for children with serious mental illness is a legitimate function of a mental health professional. 183 M ore providers and not allowing for duplication of service by one provider. 184 S ome of us have been working in \"hard-to-reach\" areas of the state for many years. Areas with high poverty, high trauma, and too few mental health professionals. This burns out some people, but some of us thrive here. It would be nice if MA would pay a little more so my employer could give me a raise. Also, the paperwork demands are getting more and more and honestly, are a good incentive to get out of this line of work. Is there some way the paperwork could be simplified so that we can spend less time typing and more time seeing clients? 185 R each out specifically to youth in schools. Allocate more staff resources such as social workers in high schools to prevent criminalization of marginalized youth. 186 T he legislature taking some of the budget surplus and reinvesting in the mental health system in the state of mn, so that providers can pay reasonable wages to develop and recruit a culturally diverse workforce. 187 Y ou didn't even have the option of early childhood in this survey and there is a huge need and shortage of early childhood mental health professional in rural MN. 188 T his needs to start at the legislature, providing adequate funding to treat and care for individuals with mental health needs. We need the funding. 189 I ncrease the number of providers. Use groups more effectively. Add on-line resources and scheduling. 190 * W hat can be done to improve the mental health workforce/delivery system? Make paperwork more stream - lined-less documentation and more time with patients. Small community based practices. W e have to give new practitioners good training. Have a treatment team approach. THIRD-PARTY PAYERS need to sponsor and reward innovations in practice that improve service delivery and reduce barriers THIRD-PARTY PAYERS need to recognize that most mental health problems are chronic, recurring conditions Third party payers need to recognize that working with the family is essential to getting patients well and this work should be adequately re - imbursed. Third party payers need to recognize that psychological testing is an essential tool for diagnosing and treating mental illness and need to reimburse adequately for testing time, scoring, analysis and reporting of results. 191 S chool districts to hire more school social workers - having the mental health professionals be employees of the district and understanding school procedures. 192 A vailability for young children in high risk family situations to receive treatment and care quickly 193 W e could probably double the number of metal health case managers in some of our counties and still not have enough; same with psychiatrists, especially ones who work with children and adolescents. 194 *S chool based mental health is the single most effective way we can reach more people with mental health issues and intervene earlier. The reduced suspension rate also suggests that academic outcomes would be improved (and potentially would reduce our achievement gap). *Families and individuals need an information clearing - house to help them navigate an extremely obtuse and complicated system. Any information that case managers or providers can access to guide families should also be available more broadly to families, so that those who are capable can do more self-help. *In developing policies, pay special attention to families and individuals that fall in the \"grey area\" -- those who are lower middle class, have insurance, but face such high deductibles that access - ing services is unaffordable. Also grey area are children, youth and adults who have mental illness, but are not in the \"red zone\" but still need lots of help. Many grants, county programs, etc. tend to be focused only on the most extreme cases and don't help these \"grey area\" families. The result? Things spiral downward and we have more extreme and costly cases.SURVEY QUESTION 11: Do you have any other ideas or comments that you want to share about improving access to quality mental health treatment and supports?Gearing Up for Action: Mental Health Workforce Plan for Minnesota | APPENDIX C-109195 W e need to make it easier for families to get help for their family members who are suffering from mental health disorders. Family members should be able to get their loved ones court ordered treatment when the loved one cannot make the decision on their own. Risk of homelessness, suicide, overdose, child endangerment of children living with a mentally ill parent or sibling, and other issues need to be seen as a priority. Currently many folks can - not get help unless they are immediately suicidal or homicidal. These illnesses need to be seen as not just choice, but as a serious neurological problem in which the individual with the disorder is unable to make competent deci - sions to protect themselves and others. Early intervention is essential. We must recognize that families cry out for help because there are very real threats to the lives of their loved ones, not because they want to manipulate the loved one. 196 R eimbursement rates are low for mental health services - it is difficult to make programs work, do what is in the best interest of the client, pay people a fair wage and make the agency financially viable without overloading workers and creating burnout. If we were able to pay better and allow workers to have \"healthy\" client load we could retain workers and truly do what is helpful and right for our clients. 197 Smaller caseloads f or school counselors.

That kind of thing can't be allowed to happen. There is already much too limited MH services for greater MN (not to mention in the metro), and to close with essentially no backup plan for clients is unconscionable. How can the MH professions work better together? How can they communicate better, and be less siloed, to better support clients?

Psychology is not better than Marriage and Family Therapy, Social Work, Addictions Counselors, etc. -- nor are any of these better than Psychology. To pre - sume so is arrogant. All disciplines overlap, and all disciplines offer something that others do not. Interdisciplinary teams serve to role-model this for students (so that they do not become disciples to their own disciplinary choice), and provides patients with a diverse skill set that is better equipped to offer top-notch care. 207 A dd a bonus to those health care homes in MN that provide integrated care and add another added bonus to such sites that offer training in integrated care to both behavioral health and medical providers. 208 M ore psychiatrists willing to listen to patients and work with them to achieve their personal goals.

Compensation---making this work valued in financial terms. MA dollars are often very limited dollars......so perhaps the answer is really in : security---could the Legislature set up a special retirement type benefit that CTSS service providers could be vetted into?
