Survival in the mTSST-1-vaccinated group was higher, and bacterial counts in organs were significantly lower than those of control mice. Passive transfer of mTSST-1-specific antibodies also provided protection against S. aureus-induced septic death. Interferon (IFN)-gamma production in the serum samples and spleens from vaccinated mice was significantly decreased compared with that in controls, whereas interleukin-10 titers were significantly higher in vaccinated mice. IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in vitro were significantly inhibited by serum samples from mTSST-1-immunized mice but not from control mice. These results suggest that vaccination with mTSST-1 devoid of superantigenic properties provides protection against S. aureus infection and that the protection might be mediated by TSST-1-neutralizing antibodies as well as by the down-regulation of IFN-gamma production.
