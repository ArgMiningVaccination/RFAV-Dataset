In the beginning, Ayurveda played a leading role within a trend of deeply relaxing wellness therapies. While it is true that Ayurveda has many strengths in the field of well-being and health prevention, awareness has increased that it goes far beyond. It is a complex holistic system of medicine, which offers indigenous and effective therapy concepts, which are already helping many patients in Europe today, especially those suffering from chronic diseases. Today, even in medical circles, Ayurveda is widely recognized in this sense and has reached the threshold of entering into the realm of evidence-based science. In several European countries, such as Italy, the UK, and Germany, doctors can now study Ayurvedic medicine within the framework of postgraduate medical education recognized by medical councils and universities. As the director of an Ayurveda academy cum health and treatment center with more than 1000 patients per year, I experience this every day a new. I consider it our task to communicate these positive experiences and subsequently I foresee a blossoming future for Ayurveda. I appreciate the plurality in India's health-care system and we in Germany also have a long tradition in the development of medicine - traditional European medicine as well as so-called modern medicine, which are now coming closer together socially, academically, and scientifically. I see this as a great opportunity to develop even better methods to relieve the suffering of humanity and nature. A prerequisite is that these systems are not mixed arbitrarily. What is needed instead is a mutual understanding and cooperation of the different healing systems, which now complement each other for the benefit of humankind. Ayurveda can contribute a wealth of knowledge and experience here. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR AYURVEDA IN EUROPE Adapting to the environment, a patient is living in is a central concept in Ayurveda and also a requirement for its integration into European health systems. It is both necessary to fit Ayurveda into the legal framework and to respect the existing nature and climate. Until now, Europe is rather cautious when it comes to merging traditional with modern systems of medicine. Despite its obvious benefits, Ayurveda is not yet fully acknowledged as an official medical system in Europe. Following studies of the CAMbrella project, a European research network for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), the status of acknowledgment in European countries can roughly be defined into three groups: Even in those countries, where Ayurveda can be legally practiced by physicians, treatments are usually not covered by national health systems but have to be financed by the patients themselves, or by additional private insurance. At present, CAM in general is under pressure within the European Union (EU). Especially Homeopathy is confronted with the critical question of whether the active ingredients and the effectiveness are measurable or not. In comparison, Ayurveda as an allopathic medicine has clear advantages, as the forms of therapy (such as manual, phytopharmacological, and nutritional therapy) are visible and measurable. While in South Asia, the use of herbomineral preparations is in the foreground of the many Ayurvedic clinics and dispensaries, in the few European clinics, we generally see a more multimodal approach in treating patients. Diet and lifestyle advice, manual therapy (including massages, topical applications, and specific body therapeutic techniques including Yoga), and the \"prescription\" of Ayurvedic preparations are considered an entity. One reason for this might be that no complex pharmaceutical preparations are available on the EU market. No Ayurvedic preparation is licensed as a medicinal product nor registered as a traditional herbal medicinal product. As a result, there are often uncertainties about the quality and legal classification of the available preparations. According to survey results from the Allensbach demographic institute, more than 70% of Germans believe that naturopathic treatments are suitable as complementary therapy.[ [1]] The remaining 20% expressed their wish to be treated exclusively with an alternative or traditional medicine. This figure applies more or less for nearly all countries in Europe. Hence, a political reaction by the EU Parliaments to the patients' desire for complementary medicine is long overdue. Doctors, on the other hand, do respond to the high demand for natural medicine: According to statistical data published in 2021 by the Federal Medical Association, 13% of working physicians in Germany have an additional qualification in the field of alternative healing methods.[ [2]] Even the proportion of cancer patients who report experience with complementary medicine procedures is more than 50%.[ [3]] Patients and doctors alike seem to be convinced that traditional systems, and above all Ayurveda, make it possible for them to effectively treat many ailments, especially chronic and psychosomatic diseases. PATIENTS AS THE DRIVING FORCE FOR AYURVEDA IN EUROPE If there is a dimension that promotes the global spread of Ayurveda, then it is a stronger focus on the patients, and the needs of those to serve. That leads to the question, where actually do patients see advantages in complementary medicine? First of all, people suffering from illnesses are confronted with health systems that overemphasize treatment by medical devices and pharmaceutical medication. They often long for medical care and human attention given by doctors and therapists. In addition, patients want to understand how their ailments could arise. Based on my own experience as director of an Ayurveda competence center, I can confirm the gratitude and enthusiasm of our patients who, with the support of Ayurvedic medicine, have found relief, often even cure for chronic and psychosomatic illnesses, which could not be successfully treated by modern medicine. With its particular strengths, Ayurveda meets the patients' expectations thus filling a gap in existing health-care systems. This is especially true for chronic diseases such as neurological and stress-related illnesses, diabetes, and musculoskeletal complaints. Ayurveda has also gained ground in clinical treatment within Europe. Apart from Ayurveda treatment centers and hospitals, prestigious clinical projects have started, officially recognizing Ayurveda's value as a complementary medical system. To be successfully integrated into Western medicine, it seems promising to practice and publicly present Ayurveda as what it is, a holistic system of medicine. This is the approach successfully applied by institutions such as the Habichtswald Hospital,[ [4]] the Bad Ems Maharishi Clinic,[ [5]] or the Rosenberg Health and Treatment Centre in Germany,[ [6]] but also of many Indian hospitals and resorts who attract Western patients in large numbers. The examples of these model institutions prove that patients are ready to pay for the health services provided by systems of natural medicine. Between 10,000 and 20,000 patients, a year invests a considerable amount of money to promote their health by spending 1 or 2 weeks in an Ayurveda treatment center. The global spread of Ayurveda may be further stimulated by the fact that many people in the Western world are striving for a healthy and sustainable way of life and willing to invest time and money to improve their health and immunity. Here, lies the potential for further success of Ayurveda in Europe countries. WORKING WITH AYURVEDA IN EUROPE - CHANCES AND CHALLENGES To meet the demand for Ayurvedic medicine, massage, nutrition, and therapy, a multitude of seminars and training programs have been established throughout Europe. Thousands of graduates from leading European teaching institutions such as Ayurvedic Point School (Italy),[ [7]] Rosenberg European Academy of Ayurveda (Germany, Switzerland, Austria),[ [8]] Atreya Ayurveda School (France), and Delight-Ayurveda-Institute (The Netherlands)[ [9]] now make a full-time living from their fulfilling work with Ayurveda, whether as health and nutrition advisors, Ayurvedic mental and lifestyle coaches, panchakarma and massage therapists, alternative practitioners or doctors. About 70% of them work on a self-employed basis, while 30% as employees. Since Ayurveda therapy is yet not fully recognized as a profession, graduates are well advised to develop their career step by step and to leave the former profession only after the first success becomes visible, but in principle, they have a good chance of successfully offering their competences to clients and patients. However, in Switzerland and Germany, BAMS (Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery) can officially practice medicine after having acquired a license as a \"Heilpraktiker,\" a practitioner of natural medicine. A key factor is language skills because the state-regulated examination to become a Heilpraktiker in Germany is exclusively held in German. This qualification is recommendable for all Indian experts. For Ayurveda therapists in the fields of massage, nutrition, and herbal medicine, state regulations have been established in Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and Portugal. They differ from country to country and regulate the activities of Ayurveda graduates who strive to work in the paramedical field with Ayurveda, open their own centers and/or officially conduct Ayurveda therapies under the supervision of a medical professional. Otherwise, and in other European countries, the Ayurvedic expert unfortunately would only be allowed to work in the field of Ayurvedic wellness and health care and is not permitted to offer diagnosis or prescribe therapies. Here, several Ayurveda associations are working to get doors open for Indian graduates. It would be desirable to increase the number of Ayurvedic doctors practicing inside the EU, despite the obstacles described. India could facilitate the relocation of Vaidyas by selecting experienced Vaidyas and providing them with professional advice. When a critical mass of several hundred Vaidyas in the EU will be reached, bilateral talks at the government level on their state-regulated authorization will have a good chance of getting started or - if they already started - reach a dimension that is able to make an impact. AYURVEDA EDUCATION AS A KEY TO SUCCESS Basic, undogmatic education is a powerful tool for establishing Ayurveda in the industrialized nations of the 21st century. In this field, Ayurveda needs to seek a bridge to modern language and to the framework of contemporary medical science. This is possible without comprising the complexity of the teaching, as my experience as Director of the European Academy of Ayurveda (REAA) in Birstein, Germany, shows. The REAA established a successful Master of Science degree program for Ayurveda in the EU and serves as a model for a curriculum that takes into account the experience and interest of Western physicians without diluting the core of traditional teaching. On a global scale, it is most promising to teach and practice Ayurveda as classical as possible, but as modern as necessary. Over the past 12 years, hundreds of modern and physicians have enrolled in this 4-year (3200 h) course of study, which REAA has offered in cooperation with Middlesex University, London. Currently, a few projects which place Ayurveda at universities could be successfully launched, for example, the establishment of a chair for Ayurveda in Hungary and in Latvia, the integration of Ayurveda into the curriculum for physicians, and therapists as elective courses or research projects at European academies and universities. All these are important achievements. However, implementing innovation in state-regulated institutions is not easy. Besides Ayurveda takes the risk to be reduced to a few central aspects to fit in the tight corset of Western medicine, as has happened to some extent to Traditional Chinese Medicine where \"only\" Acupuncture achieved a limited official acceptance within the EU. In the course of the years, I have recognized the special value of a non-governmental, independent educational and research institute with an affiliated treatment center, which enjoys the freedom of taking the complexity of Ayurveda fully into account. Of course further research is most important. A non-profit organization in which leading Ayurveda experts and institutions from India as well as from abroad coordinate research projects could be of great support. BUILDING TRUST THROUGH QUALITY AND SAFETY At its core, Ayurveda is a medicine and it is precisely here that recognition and progress in integration into Western health systems, the academic world, and the international higher education system are needed. However, a defined quality and safety of Ayurveda-related products and services are imperative for its successful propagation. We have to build trust, especially since the reputation of Ayurveda is still suffering from incidents of contaminated products. A serious look at European good manufacturing practice, excellence in therapeutic practice, and maintaining the highest quality in education, research, and literature become essential for its legalization in the EU. For the pharmaceutical industry, I see the following goals for the next 3-5 years. They all have to do with the aspect of stabilization and anchoring: USE THE CURRENTLY POSSIBLE ROUTES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION For introducing Ayurvedic medicines to the European market, there are two possible ways, which can be pursued in parallel: On the one hand, to test the registration of Ayurvedic drugs, may it be according to the guidelines of the traditional herbal medicinal products directions or through other European Medicines Agency guidelines within the framework of a pilot project to set a precedence with the EU authorities. On the other hand, however, to make use of the already existing route, namely to distribute Ayurvedic herbs and simple combination preparations as dietary supplements on the EU market. This is the immediate and direct way to reach patients. To sum it up, there are three key factors when it comes to globally establishing Ayurveda on a global scale: - Effective treatment of patients - Sound education systems in Ayurveda medicine - Reliable quality of Ayurvedic herbs and medication. It is this bottom-up approach that has made Ayurveda and its established institutions successful so far. Last but not least, all progress requires active and professional communication and cooperation. We have already come a long way in this aspect. Apart from various Ayurveda associations in many EU countries, also umbrella organizations have been created to unity existing forces. So in Europe (EUAA)[ [10]], in Switzerland (TO Ayu CH)[ [11]] in Austria (OBA)[ [12]] and just resantly also in Germany the ADAVED - German Ayurveda Umbrella Association.[ [13]] Against this background, I all the more welcome the opening of the first Global WHO Centre for Traditional Medicine in Jamnagar (Gujarat) just these days. This is certainly another milestone for the AYUSH systems that are on the rise worldwide. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest. "}
