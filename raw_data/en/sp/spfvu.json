The below are all natural spider deterrents that won't cause them, or you, any harm. Find out if conkers really repel spiders in the home. The majority of [spiders](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/interiors/a28995962/uk-spiders/) are harmless to humans, but most people still don't like sharing their home with any eight-legged friends. You're likely to spot these creepy crawlies indoors during [ autumn](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/interiors/get-home-ready-autumn/), when shorter, darker days and colder temperatures see their annual migration from our gardens to our houses, but it's not unusual at any time of year. Fortunately, there are plenty of natural spider deterrents that will deter arachnids from setting up in your place without causing them any harm. Spider deterrents: 18 ways to get rid of spiders naturally \"Windows provide easy access for pesky spiders and bugs to enter our properties, but there's plenty of ways to deter them,\" says Adam Pawson, Head of Digital at [Safestyle UK](https://www.safestyle-windows.co.uk/). \"Spiders aren't big fans of strong scents, acidic concoctions or dark corners. By following a few of these simple hacks, you can sleep a little easier at night knowing the bugs are at bay.\" 1. Spider Catcher This [spider catcher](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X1520752&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lakeland.co.uk%2F63665%2Fpest-stop-led-spider-and-insect-vacuum) is one of Lakeland's best-selling spider deterrents. The clever battery-operated vacuum gently picks up creepy crawlies so you can take them outside without hurting them. There are other non-vacuum styles available too. 2. Peppermint oil Lots of strong scents are great spider deterrents and, happily, many are already used traditionally as home fragrances. Peppermint oil is a particularly popular remedy, as is tea-tree, lavender and rose. Add 15 to 20 drops to a spray bottle filled with water and spritz around the house, changing the oil used regularly to ensure the remedy remains effective. 3. Cinnamon Spiders also dislike the smell of cinnamon. This warm spice comes in various forms, including dried sticks used for cooking, fragrance oil and scented candles. With its rich, wintery scent, cinnamon is an especially good option for the festive period! 4. Vinegar While not as fragrant as the above solutions, vinegar can also assist in warding off spiders. Fill a spray bottle with half white vinegar and half water and spray in corners, cracks and crevices. Be careful to avoid varnished surfaces as it can cause damage. 5. Get cleaning Spiders like having somewhere to hide, so keep your house neat and tidy through regular tidying, cleaning and [decluttering](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/interiors/decluttering-one-weekend/) to prevent mess from building up. [Plastic storage containers](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X1520752&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunelm.com%2Fproduct%2Fcrystal-42ltr-box-lid-1000200162) are better than cardboard boxes as they are harder for spiders to crawl into. Make sure to dust and vacuum frequently to rid your house of unwanted webs. 6. Regularly check your fruit bowl Fruit flies are a delicious snack for spiders. Check your fruit bowl regularly for gone-off food that might attract them. 7. Protect the exterior of your house Stop spiders from getting indoors in the first place by moving anything they're likely to hide in, such as leaves, grass clippings, vegetation, compost or woodpiles, away from exterior walls. Check door openings and window sills for cracks they could crawl through and seal with caulk. Fix torn window screens and cover vents and chimneys with [fine mesh](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001VCJTZS). 8. Plan a eucalyptus tree in the garden This tree is low maintenance and smells wonderful, with the added perk that the leaves' strong medicinal scent also repels spiders. If you don't have room for a full tree, plant mint or [lavender ](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/wellbeing/aromatherapy-sleep/)underneath or near windows, as the smell will help drive spiders away. 9. Citrus Spiders supposedly hate all citrus scents, so rub orange or lemon peel along skirting boards, window sills and bookshelves. Use [ lemon-scented cleaners](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004RUHWOG) and [furniture polish](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X1520752&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fparker-bailey-lemon-oil-polish-473ml%2Fp3078066), and burn [citronella candles](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/gardens/citronella-candles/) both inside and outside of your home. 10. Turn off your lights While light itself doesn't attract spiders, it does attract the insects they feast on. Turn off outside lights when not needed and stop indoor bulbs from shining through windows by using opaque blinds and shades. If you do need to keep them on, use [yellow sodium vapour lights](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07TG8GDJT), as these are less likely to attract insects. 11. Conkers Old wives' tales have it that spiders are repelled by chestnuts. Unlike peppermint spray, scattering a few conkers on windowsills and in corners isn't scientifically proven to work, but it certainly won't do any harm and many people swear by it as a deterrent. Warning! Conkers can be poisonous so please consult your vet before putting these in your home if you have pets. 12. Cedar Another scent spiders are said to detest. Hauling a cedar plant into your home isn't practical, but there are many smaller cedar products available to help you give this one a try. As a bonus, the woody aroma should also repel clothes moths - so keep some of these disks in your wardrobe as well. Just sand them down every now and then to refresh the scent. 13. Garlic It's known for its vampire-repelling properties but, as it turns out, spiders don't like the smell of this pungent bulb either. Depending on how strong a scent you yourself can cope with, put whole or crushed cloves into a spray bottle filled with water and use to fragrance the corners, floors and skirting boards of rooms prone to unwanted guests. 14. Move your bins Spiders are attracted to flies and flies are attracted to bins. Make sure yours are kept as far from the house as possible - at least away from windows and doors. Always keep bin lids closed, too. 15. Consider a cat This method will undoubtedly harm the spider as [cats](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/wildlife/pets/g39406892/cat-toys/) are expert hunters, but it does prevent the use of insecticides and chemicals in the home. They won't be suitable for every household due to allergies and lifestyle but, if you are a cat person, they are excellent spider repellents. 16. Cover your pet food Talking of cats and all other household pets, it's important to keep their food covered and sealed so it doesn't attract flies and insects which will, in turn, draw in spiders. 17. Seal any cracks in exterior walls This will prevent unwanted pests entering your home and help keep your house warm at the same time. Survey for cracks in external walls and around door edges and windows, and [ seal them closed](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07S19ZXRC). 18. Take your recycling out regularly Leftover food or sugary drinks in discarded packaging attracts flies and, in turn, spiders. Empty bottles and cans also make good homes for arachnids so empty your [recycling boxes](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/interiors/how-recycle/) regularly. "}
