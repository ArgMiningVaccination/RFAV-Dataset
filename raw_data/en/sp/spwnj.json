Literature suggests that animal -assisted interventions are effective treatments for a variety of psyc hosocial and physical problems (Kaputska & Budzynska, 2020) . Animals can be great motivators during therapy for children . The use of animals to promote mental health might include a child being encouraged to gently pet and talk to an animal to teach appropriate touch, reduce anxiety, increase a sense of connectio n to a living being, reduce loneliness, and develop a variety of skills (C handler 2005 ). The use of an animal in therapy may be beneficial because animals seem to have a natural tendency to create a bond with people (Nimer & Lundahl, 2015) . A good thera py animal will seek affection and interaction with the client. Studies have demonstrated that goats respond to subtle behavioural changes by humans (Nawroth, 2017). Animals promote a warm and safe atmosphere that can be independently therapeutic and hel p clients accept interventions offere d by the treatment provider. Animal assisted therapy/intervention are not generally viewed as a stand -alone treatment; animals are used as a supplement or in conjunction with other mental health interventions (Nimer & Lundahl, 2015). SET Outdoors The aim of SET Outdoors is to support South Eastern Health & Social Care Trust (SEHSCT ) Children's Services to improve the health, wellbeing and quality of life of vulnerable young people (aged 0 -24*) via engagement in purposeful, outdoor , nature -based and/or animal -facilitate activities/ therapy. *0-18 unless Looked After Child /Prison Healthcare 3 From the SET Outd oors perspective, t he main objectives for this animal facilitated intervention are to: 1. For young peo ple who have been adopted to participate in animal - facilitated therapy with the goal of impro ving mental health, emotional regulation, attachment and attune ment . 2. To design and deliver, in as sociation with SET Connects , The Adoption & Permanence Service and Castlescreen Farm, a high quality healthcare intervention. 3. To develop ways of effectively evaluating the impact of the 'Goat Yoga' programme on participants and staff. The SEHSCT is an organisational member (level 3) of The Institute for Outdoor Learning (IOL) . As such, SET Connects & Social Work staff will be expected to adhere to The IOL 'Members Code of Conduct' and 'Statements of Good Practi ce'. Further details can be found at https://www.outdoor -learning.org/ SET Outdoors will operate in accordance with the Outdoor Mental Health Interventions Model ( Richards, Hardie and Anderson 2019). This intervention is facilitated by a clinical psychologist in collaboration with animal handlers/experts and will therefore sit within Zone 3 of the Outdoor Mental Health Interventions Model. 4 'Goat Yoga ' sessions with be co -facilitated by: Bridget Tiernan (Clinical P sychologist & Yoga Instructor) Hannah Kelly (Social Worker, Adoption & Permanence Service) Jackie & Damien Tumelty (Castlescreen Farm). SET Connects SET Connects is a specialist therapeutic and consultation service for children aged 0 -18, who are in foster care or adopted. Service delivery is guided by models of attachment, child development and complex trauma. The service offers consultation and tra ining to professionals, parents and carers, as well as therapeutic support to parents/carers and children to strengthen their relationships and support the child's social and emotional development. The Adoption & Permanence Team The Permanence Service be lieve that a genuine partnership between all parties involved in an adoption is essential to deliver the best outcomes for children & young people . Adoption is an evolving life -long pr ocess for everyone in the adoptive family. The Permanence Service recognises that sensitive issues raised by adoption may resurface at different times and stages throughout an individual's life. Young p eople who are adopted should have access to information & services to enable them to address adoption -related matters throughout their life. The Permanence Services within the SEHSCT provide interventions to promote the welfare of all parties involved in adoption and work in partnership with young people and their families. Interventions include financial support , wor kshops and training on adoption - specific issues, therapeutic services for ch ildren, counselling, advice & information, assistance with contact arrangements and tele phone consultations. 5 Castlescreen Farm Jackie Gibson and Damien Tumelty run Castlescreen Farm; a small family farm on the outskirts of Downpatrick. The focus of Castlescreen Farm is sustainability, with the family taking a regenerative approach to looking after every inch of every field for the welfa re of the animals and the benefit o f the planet. Castlescreen Farm is the only PFLA certified Dexter farm in N orthern Ireland. As well as selling PFLA certified D exter beef, lamb, pork and chicken from the on -site farm shop, the family love welcoming peo ple onto the farm for farm tours. Castlescreen Farm work with NI Food Tours, Farm to Fork tours and are currently registering as a Social Farm.

Young people attending t he group programme must be 6 -9 years of age. Pre-group outcome measures must be completed prior to acceptance onto the programme. Exclusion Criteria : A young person who has not consented to engage i n this therapeutic intervention, or wh o is outside of the 6 -9 year age range. A history of harm ing animals is not a reason to exclude a young person from participation. However, this should be brought to the attention of the clinical psychologist prior to intervention commencing . NB - medical history will be requested to ensure safe participation in therapeutic activities 7 The Just Right State Programme The Just Right State Programme is based on Sensory Attachment Intervention (SAI). SAI is an integrative approach to the treatment of children and adults who have suffered abuse or severe neglect. The Just Right State Children's & Parent' Programme The Just Right State programme looks at the use of sensory activities and foods, to help children learn how to self -regulate their emotional states and behaviour. C artoon character s called 'The Scared Gang' are used to represent the different survival and attachment patterns of behaviour. The different characters tell the children how they react to situations and what eac h of them does to achieve the \"Just -Right S tate\". The Just Right State Parent's Programme The aim of the programme is to enhance parents' awareness of their own engagement patterns and how this impacts on their child's emotional states. Parents learn how to regulate their child from sensory and attachment perspectives. The Just Right State | ebsaic (sensoryattachmentintervention.com) The clinical psychologist will use key principles from these progra mmes alongside yoga techniques during the group intervention. 8 SET Connects & Permanence Service 'Goat Yoga ' Session Plan: Session Programme of Activities 1 19/5/21 4 -6pm (Session begins 4.15 pm) Welcome and Introductions How we start to get to know each other (thinking about starting to get to know the goats).

The Emotional Regulation Checklist ( Shields & Cicchetti, 1995 ) [Appendix 4] The Emotion Regulation Checklist was developed by Shields & Cicchetti (1995) to assess the children's emotion regulation at the age of 5 -12. The Emotion Regulation Checklist can be administered to teachers, school counsellors , and parents to assess and monitor children's emotion regulation. The Checklist consists of 24 items and items are scored on a 4 - point Likert scale (1=Never; 2=Sometimes; 3=Often; 4=Almost always). The et al, 2016) [Appendix 5]. The Human -Animal Interaction Scale (HAIS) (Appendix 2) is a 24 -item self - report instrument designed to describe and quantify a human's interaction with a non -human animal. The interactions that are measured by the HAIS play a critical role in personal growth & development, physical health as well as mental health and wellbeing . Total scores can range from -24 to 76 with higher scores indicating a greater quantity of positive human -animal interaction (Fournier et al, 2016). Group members will be encouraged to complete the HAIS Participant Form at the end of each goat yoga session. 12 References: Balis LE Marshall C Malcolm A Harden SM (2019).
