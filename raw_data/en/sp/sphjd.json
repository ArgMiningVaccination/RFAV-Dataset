This month I'm talking to you about the spiritual nature of anxiety and how it shows up as a separation of the spirit from the body. The invitation is integration, to call yourself back into alignment with your body, your heart and your spirit. I hope you enjoy the video. I'd love to know your thoughts on this topic. Drop a comment below and let me know! The Spiritual Nature of Anxiety TRANSCRIPT: Hey guys, it's Kim Burris. Today I want to talk to you about the spiritual nature of anxiety and what the process of integration looks like. So, how I view healing is really it's this process of integration. So that's what I mean when I say integration. So anxiety... anxiety is really an up and out energy. So even as I'm saying the word and feeling into it I can start to sense that energy in my body. It's really an up and out energy... So you might sense it in your gut, often symptoms of anxiety are a racing heart, feeling faint, maybe even fainting, feeling like you're dying. It's a separation of the spirit from the body, so it can come from...there are always so many layers of a root cause, there's never one, it's not an apples-to-apples... this happened to me and now I have anxiety. It's your own unique constellation of your constitution, what you've come in with, what you've experienced, the culture and environment you've been raised with and what your journey is, what you're processing and learning. So this experience of up and out energy (anxiety) is the separation of your spirit from your body. And what's in the middle of your spirituality... your spiritual Soul Essence... that's bigger and larger than this body? And what is that, that connects you to this body... to yourself? It's the heart. So the heart is the bridge between the soul and the body. And what happens is when the soul is not in alignment with the mind and the heart and the body, we can experience anxiety or depression. Right now we're just talking about anxiety. So again, this is that constellation of this separation, and so the body panics, the spirit panics... the spirit wants to be here. We want to be embodied and experience our self in the here and now in the body, that's why we're here. So if you're here, you're here and you're watching this... you're in a body and you're in this body and this time for a reason. So the upward and outward energy is really a call to move into alignment and move deeper into your body through your heart. And so moving into our bodies looks so different for everyone but there's a lot of really great practices that can start the process of integration and I want you to think of it as a process and a practice. There's not 'I do this when I have anxiety' and now it's gone because anxieties are symptoms of something that's happening. Right? It's the separation of your spirit from your body. So I want you to think, when you start to have symptoms of anxiety if you're experiencing any panic attacks, or overwhelm, of feeling unsettled or feeling stress even, the invitation is to return to yourself, to call yourself back into your body and to your heart and to your connection with your higher self. So really great ways to do that would be to do some deep belly breathing. That's to soften the muscles in your belly which softens your pelvic floor muscles, which softens your legs down to your feet, and your toes into the Earth. I have a great [guided meditation](https://www.kimburris.com/blog/anxiety/heart-belly-breathing-guided-meditation) for that on my blog you can find it [HERE](https://www.kimburris.com/blog/anxiety/heart-belly-breathing-guided-meditation) if you need some guidance with that. The simplest way to do it would be to go outside. Take your shoes off. Take your socks off put your feet on the earth, real earth, real dirt ,real grass. Ideally you can lay down, and if you can lay down naked ...do that! Go outside and let the Earth hold you and support you and feel yourself breathing. There's nothing better for the separation happening than to put yourself horizontal. So...laying down. Don't underestimate the power of a simple practice to reconnect you with who you are and where you are... to locate yourself. So, deep belly breathing. Laying down outside in nature. These are going to be really beautiful practices for slowing you down. I'm noticing myself even slowing down talking about the practices. So there are many many more things to be done to support you while you're dealing with anxiety symptoms. I always like to think about supporting the self... I want you to think about supporting and resourcing yourself before you have any [symptoms of anxiety](/anxiety). So if you know that you're prone to this kind of separation from the self (aka anxiety), start to think about ways to incorporate nourishment and receiving, so bringing an in and down energy into your life. So that can be these ways we're talking about... meditation, movement and exercise practices, time in nature, warm nourishing foods, even drinking a cup of hot water or tea... in and down...something nourishing.
