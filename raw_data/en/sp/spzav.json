While glass shower doors and walls are stylish and practical (showcasing beautiful tile work), they also get dirty frequently. After every shower, water droplets, shower products, and body soil cling to their surface. If you aren't diligent about cleaning your glass shower door and removing the splatters after every shower, soap scum created by the minerals in the water, soap, and body soil can permanently etch the glass, leaving a foggy mess. One option is to use a soap scum remover. Or, follow these steps for a clean glass shower door that shines, using a cleaning solution made with household items. How Often to Clean Glass Shower Doors Glass shower doors should be cleaned after every use. This is the best way to keep them clean. Just a quick spray with a DIY or commercial shower cleaner that is then removed with a squeegee keeps soap scum from accumulating. You can also spray your shower door with a daily glass cleaner that doesn't even need to be wiped off or squeegeed. Or skip using cleaners and simply wipe the surface clean to remove water and buildup. If daily cleaning is not manageable, deep clean your glass shower door weekly\u2014at a minimum.

Do not use this method on showers with stone. Step 1: Mix a Cleaning Solution Mix two parts of distilled white vinegar with two parts of distilled water in a spray bottle. Add 1/4 teaspoon of dishwashing liquid to help the solution cling to the glass. Step 2: Spray the Glass Starting at the top of the glass door, liberally spray the solution onto the glass. Let the solution work for at least five minutes to break down the soap scum. If you use this cleanser after every shower while the glass is wet, there is no need to wait. Step 3: Wipe the Glass Starting at the top, use a non-abrasive sponge or squeegee to wipe the glass down. If the vinegar solution has dried, add a bit more. Step 4: Rinse and Dry If using a sponge for cleaning, rinse the glass with water, then dry it with a lint-free microfiber towel. If you are cleaning with a squeegee, use the towel to remove any smudges or smears. How to Clean Glass Shower Doors With Lemon Juice Lemon juice contains citric acid (not as strong as the acetic acid in vinegar) and can be used for daily cleaning. However, even though it is milder, it should not be used around natural stone showers. Step 1: Mix a Cleaning Solution Mix equal parts lemon juice and distilled water in a spray bottle. Add 1/4 teaspoon of dishwashing liquid. Step 2: Spray the Glass Start at the top of the glass door and spray the surface with the solution. Let it work for about five minutes. Step 3: Wipe the Glass Starting at the top, wipe the glass with a non-abrasive sponge or squeegee. Working from the top down helps avoid smudging and streaks. Step 4: Rinse and Dry Rinse away any solution with water. (If using a squeegee, rinsing may not be necessary.) Use a microfiber towel to dry the glass and remove streaks and smudges. How to Clean Glass Shower Door Tracks With Vinegar Shower door tracks catch all of the soap scum and dirt that slides down the glass. Be sure to clean them each time you deep clean the glass shower doors. Step 1: Plug the Drainage Hole Locate the drainage hole or slit in the shower door track. Plug it with an old washcloth or paper towel. Step 2: Fill Track With Vinegar Pour undiluted distilled white vinegar into the track. Let it sit and work for at least four hours or overnight. Step 3: Scrub the Track Once the vinegar has been allowed to break down the soap scum, unplug the drainage holes to drain the vinegar. Use a toothbrush to scrub away the soap scum and dirt. Step 4: Rinse and Dry Rinse the shower door track with distilled water. Scrub again (if needed) with a toothbrush dipped in vinegar. Rinse and dry with a microfiber towel. Removing Water Stains From Glass Shower Doors If you haven't cleaned your shower door regularly, the soap scum or water spotting from minerals can be tough to remove. After cleaning the door using vinegar or lemon juice, tackle the water stains with either gentle abrasives or more potent cleaners for glass shower doors. If one method doesn't work, move to the next one. With Lemon Dip the cut half of a lemon in baking soda.Gently scrub the stained areas of the glass.Rinse well and dry with a lint-free cloth or towel.

There will be some fizzing, but it will quickly dissipate.Rinse well and dry the glass with a lint-free cloth. With Ammonia Ammonia is a common ingredient in commercial shower and bathroom cleaners. It has a very strong odor and should not be combined with other cleaning products. However, it is effective on water stains. Open a window and be sure to have ventilation when cleaning with ammonia.

How to Keep Your Glass Shower Doors Clean Longer To help your shower door stay clean longer, try these tips. Use a squeegee or microfiber towel to wipe dry your glass shower doors after every use, even if you don't use a cleaner. Mix a cleaning solution in a spray bottle and keep it in the shower for daily use. To reduce soap scum, switch to liquid body wash. It is less likely than bar soap to react with minerals in water and create water stains. Consider installing a water-softening system in your home if you live in an area with hard water.
