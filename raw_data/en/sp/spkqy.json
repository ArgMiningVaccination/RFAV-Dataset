Please note, there is no cost to students with UC SHIP. If you would like a COVID-19 vaccination through UC SHIP, please follow these steps. Contact Student Health Services (SHS) at 951-827-3031 to obtain a referral. No appointment is needed. SHS medical staff will complete the referral in three to five business days. You will receive a message in your patient portal that your referral is complete. If you've already received your COVID-19 vaccination at this time, we strongly recommend that you upload your proof of completion by August 1, 2021. The proof of completion will be kept on file by SHS. If at least 75% of the student body uploads their vaccination record by the August 1, 2021 deadline, students may receive $5 to their R'Card or they can choose to donate the $5 to R'Pantry. Please note, a valid proof of vaccination must be uploaded to be eligible for the reward. When we reach this goal, a link will be provided to students based on their selection to ensure the reward is received or donated. Our goal is to maintain a comprehensive list of all students vaccinated to keep our campus and each other safe. Please watch the following [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koK5qtw5OMU) for detailed instructions. SHS is accepting all [international COVID-19 vaccines](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/Status_COVID_VAX_04May2021.pdf) that have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).
