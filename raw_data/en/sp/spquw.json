The ancient Chinese recognized the vital energy behind all of life's processes. It is believed that this energy, called \"qi\" (pronounced \"chee\"), circulates throughout the body along meridians or channels; if this energy flow is disrupted, normal physiological function can be affected, resulting in pain or chronic illness. WHAT IS ACUPUNCTURE? Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body via needles, or pressure, to restore the proper circulation of 'qi', helping to bring the body back into a balanced and healthy state. While Western medicine focuses on treating symptoms, Chinese medicine's goal is to treat the root cause of the illness while alleviating accompanying symptoms.
