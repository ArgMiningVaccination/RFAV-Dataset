The Equity-First Vaccination Initiative (EVI) aims to reduce racial disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rates in the United States and, over the longer term, to strengthen the public health system to achieve more-equitable outcomes. To accomplish these goals, The Rockefeller Foundation has committed $20 million over one year to fund anchor partners in five major cities\u2014the Open Society Institute\u2014Baltimore in Baltimore, Maryland; the Chicago Community Trust in Chicago, Illinois; Houston in Action in Houston, Texas; United Way of Greater Newark in Newark, New Jersey; and Roots Community Health Center in Oakland, California\u2014to plan and implement hyper-local, place-based strategies to increase vaccine confidence and access for communities that identify as Black, Indigenous, and people of color. This interim report introduces the initiative and the anchor partners in each of the five demonstration sites, highlights the initial work of selected community-based organizations (CBOs) to which the anchor partners are making subgrants, synthesizes lessons learned across the EVI in its first three months, and suggests policy actions for decisionmakers to consider as they seek to support hyper-local, community-driven efforts to reduce inequities in COVID-19 vaccination. In just the first few months of the EVI initiative, the CBOs in the five demonstration sites held nearly 1,200 vaccine-related events, provided assistance (e.g., transportation, registration) more than 42,000 times to get people vaccinated, made almost 2 million connections with community members through campaigns and information sessions, and administered almost 16,000 COVID-19 vaccinations.
