Commissioner Comments : Commissioner Green suggested using 2019 data as a baseline to compare data on the graphs with more recent data, due to the impact of COVID -19. Commissioner Chow suggested that the graphs show the differences between deficiencies and non -deficiencies. 2 4) CARE EXPERIENCE STRATEGIC PLAN Aiyana Johnson, Chief Experience Officer , and Jeff Critchfield, M.D., Chief Medical Experience Officer , presented the item. Commissioner Comments : Commissioner Green asked if there are best practice on how to phrase questions to get the best patient data. Ms. Johnson stated that ZSFG switched vendors and noted that the hospital was not previously receiving enough patient responses to make conclusions about various populations. ZSFG staff want to continue to survey patients in threshold languages. Customization of questions is limited so data can be compared to other peer hospitals. Dr. Critchfield added that qualitative remarks have been important for learning and to boost staff morale. Commissioner Chow asked if paper surveys are sent to all patients. Ms. Johnson stated that paper surveys are sent to patients that are admitted. 5) ZSFG CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REPORT , EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT & NURSING NEWSLETTER THE STETHO -SCOOP Terry Dentoni, Chief Nursing Officer , presented the item. San Francisco, similar to the rest of California, the U.S., and the world, is in a rapidly changing environment with respect to COVID -19. The following are the latest changes and updates in our COVID -related operations; we are continually assessing these policies and practices: Omicron Coronavirus Variant Update The Omicron variant has become a major focus of attention for SFDPH, ZSFG and the world. The Omicron coronavirus variant was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in November 2021 and has now been detected in at least 89 countries and is spreading rapidly. It has overtaken Delta to become the dominant variant in several locations worldwide. On December 1, 2021, San Francisco was the first U.S. location where Omicron was reported after an isolate from a returned tr aveler was sequenced in a UCSF laboratory. As of 12/20/2021, it is estimated that COVID -19 cases due to Omicron are doubling every two to four days and Omicron is expected to become the dominant variant shortly. Omicron is substantially more infectious th an the Delta variant but its relative severity compared with Delta is not yet clear. Omicron causes a greater number of breakthrough infections than Delta in people who have received two doses of COVID -19 vaccines, but receipt of a third, mRNA booster vacc ine appears to provide substantial additional protection against Omicron infection. COVID -19 cases are rising in San Francisco, and we know that Omicron is circulating. The degree of impact on hospitalizations and emergency department and urgent care vis its is not known at this point but we are expecting to see an increase in healthcare utilization. At ZSFG we still have our surge plan in place and will utilize it as appropriate. As we always do, ZSFG is working with colleagues across SFDPH and at UCSF to respond to the Omicron threat. There will be a significant effort across the DPH to promote boosters, with a goal of boosting 90% of eligible staff by 1/15/22. This is generally in line with a goal that UCSF is pursuing, and that will be shared b y all hospital systems across SF. COVID -19 Basic Health and Safety Training At the end of October, DHR made important updates to the COVID -19 Basic Health and Safety Training, teaching employees how to prevent the spread of COVID -19 in the workplace and a dding the most current Cal/OSHA workplace safety regulations. All staff were enrolled and required to watch the updated training video by November 12th. Departments with limited access to computer stations were able to watch the training video in a group s etting and submit the list of participating employees to DHR. SAFETY 1. COVID -19 -Returning Safely Together3 Vaccination for Children Ages 5 -11 On November 5th, ZSFG began administering vaccinations to children ages 5 -11. These vaccinations were offered both in the 6M Children's Health Center and the patient vaccination clinic in the B30 Learning Center. A week prior, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 5 - 11. This is an important step forward - the vaccine is effe ctive and safe in children and will help to further protect our community. The patient vaccination clinic also opened for additional hours on Saturday, November 13th, to ensure that all children ages 5 -11, who wanted to receive the Pfizer vaccine, were able to do so. Below is the children's vaccine corner within the Learning Center, created by our thoughtful nurses! Staff Holiday Gathering Guidelines On November 16th, ZSFG released the 2021 Staff Holiday Gathering Guidelines to ensure that holiday cel ebrations are done in a safe manner. This included the following protocols: In-person gatherings are allowed but must observe masking and social distancing Gift exchanges are safe Make individually -boxed lunches or treats, instead of shared food or dri nk Put on virtual contests, like ugly sweaters, or take -home decorating kits Try online celebrations which could include: online caroling or online opening of gifts Our deepest gratitude to our staff for celebrating safely together this holiday season! Many thanks to all our staff for their incredible work throughout and beyond the pandemic, as well as their unwavering dedication to one another, our patients and community! Throughout November, two drives took place at ZSFG in support of our community: the Holiday Coat Drive and Blood Drive. From November 1st through December 10th, ZSFG participated in the Community Assessment Services Center's (CASC) annual holiday coat drive. Each year, CASC accepts men and women's warm coats to distribute to our City's most vulnerable population in preparation for the winter season. Additional ly, on November 10th and 11th, ZSFG held a blood drive in partnership with Vitalant. Staff were able to make appointments through Vitalant's website and donate blood in our Blood Mobile in the Building 4 AVON parking lot. The team had a goal of 15 donors, which would equate to 19 lifesaving units of blood! SAFETY2. Coat and Blood Drives at ZSFG4 Many religious and spiritual traditions recognize this time of year as a time to remember those who have died. Here in the Mission, many of our neighbors will honor the dead through the spiritual and cultural tradition of Dia de los Muertos. On Tuesday, November 2nd, from 6:30am to 7:30pm, our staff were invited to join one another in the Prayer and Meditation room to honor and remember those who have died. There they could light a candle or a dd a flower, name, or initials to the altar, to honor patients, colleagues and loved ones who have passed. Staff were also encouraged to stop by to see the altar and take a moment to reflect on the losses encountered this past year. Since 2015, ZSFG has been home to Solid Start, an initiative with an aspirational vision: to fundamentally change the way healthcare is delivered for pregnant people and families with young children. Solid Start promotes health, wellness and equity, and develops and evalu ates innovative models of integrated and collaborative care. It works across the community and the hospital to deliver equitable, patient and family -centered, whole person care. Solid Start represents a wonderful partnership between the UCSF departments of psychiatry, family medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology; the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation; many community partners; ZSFG; SFDPH and the individuals they serve. In mid -November, Solid Start held its annual summit, attended by an amazing cross -section of operational, community, academic and philanthropic leaders. The audience heard the voices of our patients and heard about programs with which Solid Start works closely - Team Lily and the Pregnancy Pop -Up Village. They also heard about the planning grant that Solid Start received this past year from the California Department of Public Health, to develop a perinatal trauma - informed network of care. ZSFG may be best known as a trauma center, a psychiatric emergency department, or a place for critical care. Those are important and true, but our wellness mission is just as important for the people of all ages who come to us for care. Solid Start makes it clear, too, that wellness is best achieved with the \"special sauce\" that makes us ZSFG: the partnership with UCSF, SFGHF and ZSFG, with a holistic, equitable, and laser focus on and with our patients, their families and networks of support. EQUITY3. Dia De Los Muertos DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE4. Solid Start Summit5 This past month, ZSFG celebrated the following healthcare recognition in honor of our staff and the incredible work they do every single day! Spiritual Care Week October 25th-31st is Spiritual Care week. During this week, Chaplains offered the \"Blessing of the Hands\" to staff who wanted to receive them. Additionally, staff and patients could view the display case on the wall next to the cafeteria to learn more about Spiritual Care and the staff chaplains here at ZSFG. Spiritual Care is both an ancient dimension of medicine and an evolving field in medicine. At ZSFG, Sojourn Chaplaincy leads the Spiritual Care department, which was created during the AIDS epidemic that the hospital battled almost 40 years ago. Spiritual Care is now a fundamental dimension of the whole person care provided at ZSFG and is available for staff and patients 7 days a week, 24 hours per day. The department is also working on their newest project - Code Lavender, which partners Spiritual Care and the Department of Medicine to create a new code system focused on staff wellness. Many thanks to all our wonderful staff in all departments that go above and beyond to provide the highest level of care to our patients and community! DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE5.

Dr. Day stated that the ZSFG EPIC system communicates with the state COVID -19 data base to determine the rate of staff vaccination data. This should be available a week after the meeting. He estimated that the ZSFG staff booster rate is approximately 75%. Commissioner Chow asked for more information regarding the diversion rate. Ms. Dentoni stated that due to staff COVID cases, the hospital has reduced the number of open beds in order to maintain staffing ratios. This has increased diversion. She and Dr. Day are continuing to find creative solutions to this situation. 6) ZSFG HIRING AND VACANCY REPORT Karrie Johnson, Departmental Personnel Officer, DPH , presented the item. Commissioner Comments : Commissioner Green congratulated the hospital staff on its low vacancy rate this month. Commissioner Chow asked how the large number of DPH behavioral health staff hires will impact the ZSFG Human Resources staff. Ms. Johnson stated that ZSFG Human Resou rce staff are assisting with processing and onboarding for some of the new hires. Commissioner Chow asked for more information regarding the psychiatric technician vacancies. Ms. Johnson stated that some of these positions are being changed to nurses for the BERT team. She noted that the applicant pool for the psychiatric technicians has been small. 7) MEDICAL STAFF REPORT Lisa Winston , M.D., Chief of Medical Staff , presented the item. Commissioner Comments : Commissioner Chow asked how ZSFG is doing with timely discharge summaries and hand -offs. Dr. Winston stated that health managers are notifying staff in a timely manner and providers are responding. She noted that currently medical students are not doing di scharge summaries; it is hoped that they will be able to do so with the oversight of attending physicians in the future. Regarding the Medicine Services Rules and Regulations, Commissioner Chow noted the term \"LCR\" is used on page 49. Dr. Winston stated that this will be corrected. Regarding the Emergency Department Registered Nurse Standardized Procedure and Protocols, Commissioner Green noted concern that all the screening questions are assigned to triage nurses. She also asked if there are protocol s for pregnant patients in the Emergency Department. Dr. Winston stated that the Emergency Department and OB/GYN team have a very close relationship and have developed a variety of protocols for pregnant trauma patients. OB/GYN staff are consulted immediat ely when there is any trauma with a pregnant patient. Ms. Dentoni stated that a Labor and Delivery nurse accompanies a pregnant patient from the Emergency Department to any test or procedure; this includes transfer of a pregnant patient to the ICU. Commissioner Chow stated that he appreciates the extensiveness of protocol 36 under the Nurse Standardized Procedure and Protocols. He shared Commissioner Green's concern about the lack of specific written protocols for pregnant patients in the Emergency D epartment. Dr. Critchfield stated that it is important that policies be developed so that they are realistically implemented. Mr. Smith noted that ZSFG policies and protocols are reviewed regularly to catch any changes that need to be made. 24 Page 24 Action Taken : The Committee unanimously approved the following: Medicine Service Rules and Regulations Emergency Department RN Standardized Procedures 8) OTHER BUSINESS This item was not discussed.. 9) PUBLIC COMMENT There was no public comment. 10) CLOSED SESSION A) Public comments on All Matters Pertaining to the Closed Session B) Vote on whether to hold a Closed Session (San Francisco Administrative Code Section 67.11) C) Closed Session Pursuant to Evidence Code Sections 1156, 1156.1, 1157, 1157.5 and 1157.6: Health and Safety Code Section 1461; and California Constitution, Article I, Section 1 .
