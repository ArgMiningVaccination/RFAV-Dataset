We are at a critical juncture as a society, and psychologists must play a key role. We know that in order for a vaccine to have an impact, it must be administered to a large percentage of the population. But a variety of factors have swirled to create a swath of people who have become susceptible to misinformation and conspiracy theories around the COVID-19 vaccines (see page 44). This is where psychological science can be a great benefit to our fellow citizens. It will be our job to fight vaccine hesitancy based on the evidence and the data we have, then communicate that with our fellow citizens. Science will be a crucial factor. We now have the science about what helps prevent the spread of the virus. Science has shown us that wearing a mask, washing our hands, and physical distancing work. Science has also shown these vaccines to be safe and effective. What is missing for groups who are hesitant about taking the vaccine is behavioral change. We can play a key role in helping people understand that it is safe to accept the data, the science, and behave accordingly by rolling up their sleeves. At the same time, we must acknowledge and address the importance of trust and acceptance, given the historical contexts in diverse communities. I remember my first interview about COVID-19 with a local radio station in Atlanta about a year ago. Much of our focus over the last year has been about getting through this quarantine with our mental health intact. Now, we face the next step in this battle. It is up to us to make sure the vaccine is widely accepted through every group of society. We know that behavioral change will play a central role in getting us out of this terrible pandemic. That type of change fits directly into what we do as psychologists. We have to position ourselves as professionals who can help change behaviors if we are to really see an end to this pandemic. "}
