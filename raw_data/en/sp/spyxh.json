Depending on their personality traits and leadership style, it may be a private matter or it may be expressed openly. They may also have varying degrees of being able to articulate their spiritual view of life. As executives, they might be in positions such as Chairman, Board Member, CEO, COO, Vice President, General Manager, or Director. As spiritual-based leaders, they may be expressing their intention to lead from their spiritual view of life in any of the following ways: - They are taking their first steps to bring their spiritual view of life into their leadership - They are in the process of integrating their spiritual view of life with their leadership - They consciously lead from their spiritual view of life During each of our interviews with business executives and other leaders, a specific 1-1/2 to 2-hour interview format (see the left column to download the interview template) was followed. We began by asking them to share their career history and current responsibilities, and then asked in-depth questions about their spiritual view of life and personal spiritual evolution. From there, we focused on the more practical aspects of their leadership and asked them to share stories that demonstrated how they lead from a spiritual basis. Finally, in the last portion of the interview, we asked a variety of questions about general issues of leading an organization, such as their views on the purpose of business and their inner processes for making decisions. Typically, an interview often strayed from the sequence of questions. However, the final transcripts were organized according to the structured interview guide in order to make it easier to compare and contrast the various interviews, question by question. A promise was made to every leader interviewed: he or she would be able to read the full transcript and edit it before it was published in the knowledge-base. This provided a trusted environment in which the leaders could express themselves openly, and later be able to affirm what they wanted published for public reading. Therefore, every word of every interview transcript has been fully approved by the interviewed leader. Interview format The interview protocol started by gaining basic information about the leader, and proceeded in four sections.
