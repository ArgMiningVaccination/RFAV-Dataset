In early times disease was regarded as sent by the gods or produced by the influence of evil spirits. Treatment and prevention were based largely on religious practices, such as prayers, incantations, and exorcism; at a later date drugs and bloodletting were also employed. Beginning in 608 ce, when young Japanese physicians were sent to China for a long period of study, Chinese influence on Japanese medicine was paramount. In 982, Tamba Yasuyori completed the 30-volume Ishinh, the oldest Japanese medical work still [extant](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extant). This work discusses diseases and their [treatment](https://www.britannica.com/science/therapeutics), classified mainly according to the affected organs or parts. It is based entirely on older Chinese medical works, with the concept of [yin and yang](https://www.britannica.com/topic/yinyang) underlying the theory of disease causation. In 1570 a 15-volume medical work was published by Menase Dsan, who also wrote at least five other works. In the most significant of these, the Keitekish (1574; a manual of the practice of medicine), diseases\u2014or sometimes merely symptoms\u2014are classified and described in 51 groups; the work is unusual in that it includes a section on the diseases of [old age](https://www.britannica.com/science/old-age). Another distinguished physician and teacher of the period, Nagata Tokuhun, whose important books were the I-no-ben (1585) and the Baika mujinzo (1611), held that the chief aim of the medical art was to support the natural force and, consequently, that it was useless to persist with [stereotyped](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stereotyped) methods of treatment unless the physician had the cooperation of the patient. European medicine was introduced into Japan in the 16th century by Jesuit missionaries and again in the 17th century by Dutch physicians. Translations of European books on anatomy and [internal medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/internal-medicine) were made in the 18th century, and in 1836 an influential Japanese work on physiology appeared. In 1857 a group of Dutch-trained Japanese physicians founded a medical school in Edo (later Tokyo) that is regarded as the beginning of the medical faculty of the Imperial [University of Tokyo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Tokyo). [ More From Britannica How Does A Ventilator Work? ](/story/how-does-a-ventilator-work) During the last third of the 18th century it became government policy to Westernize Japanese medicine, and great progress was made in the foundation of medical schools and the encouragement of research. Important medical breakthroughs by the Japanese followed, among them the discovery of the plague bacillus in 1894, the discovery of a [dysentery](https://www.britannica.com/science/dysentery) bacillus in 1897, the isolation of [adrenaline](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adrenaline) ( [epinephrine](https://www.britannica.com/science/epinephrine)) in crystalline form in 1901, and the first experimental production of a tar-induced [cancer](https://www.britannica.com/science/cancer-disease) in 1918. [E. Ashworth Underwood](/contributor/E-Ashworth-Underwood/3022) [Philip Rhodes](/contributor/Philip-Rhodes/2449) The roots of Western medicine Early Greece The transition from magic to [science](https://www.britannica.com/science/science) was a gradual process that lasted for centuries, and there is little doubt that [ancient Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece) inherited much from [Babylonia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babylonia) and Egypt and even from India and China. Modern readers of the Homeric tales the [Iliad](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Iliad-epic-poem-by-Homer) and the [Odyssey](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Odyssey-epic-by-Homer) may well be bewildered by the narrow distinction between [gods](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-religion) and humans among the characters and between historical fact and poetic fancy in the story. Two characters, military surgeons Podaleirius and Machaon, are said to have been sons of [Asclepius](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Asclepius), the god of medicine. The divine Asclepius may have originated in a human Asclepius who lived about 1200 bce and is said to have performed many miracles of healing. Asclepius was worshipped in hundreds of temples throughout Greece, the remains of which may still be seen at Epidaurus, Cos, Athens, and elsewhere. To these resorts, or hospitals, sick persons went for the healing ritual known as [incubation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/incubation-religion), or temple sleep. They lay down to sleep in the dormitory, or abaton, and were visited in their dreams by Asclepius or by one of his priests, who gave advice. In the morning the patient often is said to have departed cured. There are at [Epidaurus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Epidaurus) many inscriptions recording cures, though there is no mention of failures or deaths. Diet, baths, and [exercises](https://www.britannica.com/topic/exercise-physical-fitness) played their part in the treatment, and it would appear that these temples were the [prototype](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prototype) of modern health resorts. Situated in a peaceful spot, with gardens and fountains, each had its theatre for amusements and its stadium for athletic contests. The cult of incubation continued far into the Christian era. In Greece, some of the Aegean islands, Sardinia, and Sicily, sick persons are still taken to spend a night in certain churches in the hope of a cure. It was, however, the work of the early [philosophers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/pre-Socratic-philosophy), rather than that of the priests of Asclepius, that impelled Greeks to refuse to be guided solely by supernatural influence and moved them to seek out for themselves the causes and reasons for the strange ways of nature. The 6th-century philosopher [Pythagoras](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pythagoras), whose chief discovery was the importance of numbers, also investigated the physics of sound, and his views influenced the medical thought of his time. In the 5th century bce [Empedocles](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Empedocles) set forth the view that the universe is composed of four elements\u2014fire, air, earth, and water\u2014and this [conception](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception) led to the doctrine of the four bodily [humours](https://www.britannica.com/science/humor-ancient-physiology): blood; phlegm; choler, or yellow bile; and [melancholy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/melancholy), or black bile. The maintenance of health was held to depend upon the harmony of the four humours. [Hippocrates](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hippocrates) Medical thought had reached this stage and had partially discarded the [conceptions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conceptions) based upon magic and religion by 460 bce, the year that [Hippocrates](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hippocrates) is said to have been born. Although he has been called the father of medicine, little is known of his life, and there may in fact have been several men of this name, or Hippocrates may have been the author of only some, or none, of the books that make up the [Hippocratic Collection](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hippocratic-Collection) (Corpus Hippocraticum). Ancient writers held that Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine in [Cos](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cos-island-Greece), the island of his birth, and in other parts of Greece, including Athens, and that he died at an advanced age. Whether Hippocrates was one man or several, the works attributed to him mark the stage in Western medicine where disease was coming to be regarded as a natural rather than a supernatural phenomenon and doctors were encouraged to look for physical causes of illness. Some of the works, notably the [Aphorismi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aphorismi) (Aphorisms), were used as textbooks until the 19th century. The first and best-known [aphorism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aphorism) is \"Life is Short, Art long, Occasion sudden and dangerous, Experience deceitful, and Judgment difficult\" (often shortened to the Latin tag \"Ars longa, vita brevis\"). This is followed by brief comments on diseases and symptoms, many of which remain valid. The [thermometer](https://www.britannica.com/technology/thermometer) and the [stethoscope](https://www.britannica.com/technology/stethoscope) were not then known, nor indeed did Hippocrates employ any aid to [diagnosis](https://www.britannica.com/science/diagnosis) beyond his own powers of observation and logical reasoning. He had an extraordinary ability to foretell the course of a malady, and he laid more stress upon the expected outcome, or prognosis, of a disease than upon its identification, or [diagnosis](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diagnosis). He had no patience with the idea that disease was a punishment sent by the gods. Writing of [epilepsy](https://www.britannica.com/science/epilepsy), then called \"the sacred disease,\" he said, \"It is not any more sacred than other diseases, but has a natural cause, and its supposed divine origin is due to human inexperience. Every disease,\" he continued, \"has its own nature, and arises from external causes.\" Hippocrates noted the effect of food, of occupation, and especially of climate in causing disease, and one of his most interesting books, entitled De a\u00ebre, aquis et locis ( [Air, Waters and Places](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Air-Waters-and-Places)), be classed as a [treatise](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/treatise) on [human ecology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-ecology). Pursuing this line of thought, Hippocrates stated that \"our natures are the physicians of our diseases\" and advocated that this tendency to natural cure should be fostered. He laid much stress on diet and the use of few drugs. He knew well how to describe illness clearly and concisely and recorded failures as well as successes; he viewed disease with the eye of the naturalist and studied the entire patient in his [environment](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment). Perhaps the greatest [legacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legacy) of Hippocrates is the charter of [medical](https://www.britannica.com/topic/medical-ethics) conduct embodied in the so-called [Hippocratic oath](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hippocratic-oath), which has been adopted as a pattern by physicians throughout the ages: I swear by Apollo the physician, and Asclepius, and Health, and All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses...to reckon him who taught me this Art equally dear to me as my parents, to share my substance with him, and relieve his necessities if required; to look upon his offspring in the same footing as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee or stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode of instruction, I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and those of my teachers, and to [disciples]bound by a stipulation and oath according to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will follow that system of [regimen]which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is [deleterious]and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion...Into whatever houses I enter, I will go into them for the benefit of the sick, and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption; and, further from the seduction of females or males, of freemen and slaves. Whatever, in connection with my professional practice or not, in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not [divulge], as reckoning that all such should be kept secret. Not strictly an oath, it was, rather, an [ethical](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethical) code or ideal, an appeal for right conduct. In one or other of its many versions, it has guided the practice of medicine throughout the world for more than 2,000 years. "}
