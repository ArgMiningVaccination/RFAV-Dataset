Use this handy guide to get started on your path to eating more real food. When you think about it, it's quite simple. Why do we obsess over restrictive diets and fads that remove entire macronutrient groups from our diet or make us count the calories in every bite? Those diets may work in the short term, but long-term health needs to be sustainable for years to come. A healthy diet needs to be focused on crowding out the bad food with nutrient-dense clean food. Think about what you eat and make whole food choices as much as possible. As a student at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, I have learned why we can't eliminate entire macronutrient groups and why eating a balanced diet is important. It's not about the calories. Clearly, we all know that we need to eliminate processed food and steer clear of the Standard American Diet (SAD- appropriately named). Jump to: What is Clean Eating? Clean eating means eating simple, whole, unprocessed, and unrefined real foods. According to the Mayo Clinic, clean eating means eating foods as close to their natural state as possible. That means you are probably good to go if it came out of the ground, is growing on a tree, or is grazing in a pasture. Eating clean means eating lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, eggs, whole grains, lean protein, and fish. Some choose to go [gluten free](https://www.seasonalcravings.com/pros-and-cons-of-a-gluten-free-diet/), but that is not necessary as long as you stick to whole grains. Meghan Punda, NP at [Nourished + Well](https://www.nourishedandwellco.com/), says, \"While there may be different variations of clean eating, it generally encourages you to focus on consuming nutrient-dense natural whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. By avoiding processed foods, you eliminate artificial ingredients, unhealthy fats, added sugars, and inflammatory oils.\" Personally, I am gluten free because I feel better removing it from my diet. You can learn more about that in my [Gluten Free Guide](https://www.seasonalcravings.com/gluten-free-diet-everything-you-need-to-know/). There are no strict guidelines to eating clean, which can mean different things to different people. This is one of the reasons I love recommending this way of eating to my clients. Just skip the packaged junk food and go for the real stuff. Some people use the 80/20 rule when eating clean, which means 80% of the time, they eat clean, while the other 20% of the time, they let themselves indulge a bit. I find this balance works really well with health coaching clients. Diets that restrict all \"treat\" foods tend not to work. For those clients who may have food intolerances or sensitivities, I like to recommend a Whole30 reset. [Whole30](https://www.seasonalcravings.com/is-the-whole30-diet-for-you-a-health-coachs-guide/) is a strict 30-day diet program focusing on resetting your health and relationship with food. After the thirty days of restriction, there is a ten-day reintroduction of foods where you monitor and assess which foods may have been bothering you. What are the Benefits of Eating Clean? Eating a clean diet has many health benefits, including more energy, clearer skin, less brain fog, fewer cravings, weight loss, better mental health, and stronger hair and nails. Who doesn't want that? Eating whole foods ensures that you get loads of vitamins and minerals that are missing from processed foods. The more variety you eat, the more likely you are to meet your nutritional needs. Eat the rainbow! Here is just a sampling of the nutrients you get from WHOLE FOODS... - Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. - Water soluble vitamins like B and C. - Minerals like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur. - Trace minerals like copper, chromium, iodine, iron, and zinc.
