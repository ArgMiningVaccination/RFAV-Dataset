And after few weeks they have update to replace it. And the new one never arrived... I had the original detox tea (pre-pandemic)and it worked. It was smooth and efficient. This tea is a joke, it's like drinking water, nothing distinctive. It is NOT effective and therefore I am SO disappointed. I feel scammed, in the fact that I was told these \"new herbs \" are just as good as the old receipe but that is not the case. This new formula is worthless. I recently bought the detox tea after about a year's wait as it had been out of stock. But the new tea is very different in effect - it hasn't helped relieve digestive issues at all! I'm not sure why the tea has changed but unless this is explained and refunded, I would no longer recommend this tea! I want to back in stock again "}
