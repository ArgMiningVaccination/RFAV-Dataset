Antivirals (such as Tamiflu) are the only treatments known to be effective against the influenza virus. Symptoms of the flu are similar to those of the common cold (coughing, sore throat, fatigue, etc.). But the flu usually causes more serious illness, potentially leading to complications, especially in high-risk groups. In some cases, the flu can be deadly. If you think you could have the flu, do not self-treat. Get evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider. And if you want to consider the use of natural remedies for the flu alongside treatments recommended by your healthcare provider, discuss them with your practitioner first. Some may be contraindicated based on medications you take, health concerns you have, or other reasons. Further research is needed on the effectiveness and safety of herbs and supplements for influenza. Here are some of the natural remedies that are being studied for the flu. Elderberry Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) is an herb that has a long history of use as a folk remedy for colds, sinus infections, and the flu. In preliminary lab studies, elderberry extracts have been found to fight off viruses. Researchers believe that anthocyanins, compounds found naturally in elderberries, may be the active component that strengthens the immune system and blocks the flu virus from sticking to cells. A 2019 meta-analysis found black elderberry can substantially reduce upper-respiratory symptoms and may be a safer alternative to prescription drugs for routine cases of the common cold and influenza. Other studies on elderberry have been small, have tested only one commercially available product, or have received financial support from the manufacturer. Health food stores carry elderberry juice, syrup, gummies, and capsules. Side effects, although rare, may include mild indigestion or allergic reactions. Only commercially prepared extracts of the berry should be used, because the fresh leaves, flowers, bark, young buds, unripe berries, and roots contain cyanide and could potentially result in cyanide poisoning. TYNZA / Getty Images Oscillococcinum Oscillococcinum, also known as Anas barbariae hepatitis and Cordis extractum 200 c, is a brand-name homeopathic product that's manufactured in France. The rationale for its use comes from the homeopathic principle \"like cures like.\" The concept is that a substance that causes specific symptoms in a healthy person can be used (in a very dilute dose) to treat those symptoms in a sick person. One example is using poison ivy to treat pain or itchy skin disorders. Although there isn't evidence it works to treat these conditions, it has been shown effective in preventing or minimizing poison ivy dermatitis. Oscillococcinum is made from 200 dilutions of duck heart and liver extracts, which are believed to be particularly vulnerable to influenza viruses. Molecules of the extracts are non-existent after processing, which critics of homeopathic remedies in general say means there is no chemical basis for a product's purported action. According to a 2015 review, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of Oscillococcinum for the treatment of flu. Researchers included six studies with a total of 1,523 children and adults and found no statistically significant difference between the effects of Oscillococcinum and placebo in the prevention or treatment of influenza-like illness. But according to homeopathic theory, molecules of the active ingredient don't have to be present in the remedy to provide therapeutic value. In fact, more diluted remedies are considered more potent. Oscillococcinum is the most popular over-the-counter (OTC) product for the flu in France and is one of the most popular homeopathic products on the market. The Health Benefits of Oscillococcinum Echinacea Although recent findings question the use of echinacea for colds and flu, it's still one of the most popular herbs used today. One study by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine found that echinacea did little to prevent or shorten the common cold. There were many critics of the study, however, who say that it shouldn't be used as evidence that echinacea doesn't work. A 2014 meta-analysis of 15 studies found no significant benefit to taking echinacea for the prevention of colds. It may, however, provide a slight benefit in treating symptoms. There are several types of echinacea, including Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea Angustifolia, and Echinacea pallida. leaves, flowers, and stems) of Echinacea purpurea have the best supporting evidence. One study tested two different doses of Echinacea purpurea (450 mg and 900 mg) and found that the higher dose was significantly better than a placebo at reducing the severity of flu symptoms on days three and four. Herbalists often recommend taking echinacea every two to three hours with a total daily dose of three or more grams per day at the first sign of symptoms. After several days, the dose is usually reduced and continued for the following week. Echinacea is also an ingredient in Airborne, an OTC immune support supplement containing vitamins and herbs. Ginseng Although there are many types of ginseng, one cultivated in North America called Panax quinquefolius (North American ginseng) has become popular as a remedy for colds and flu. Compounds called polysaccharides and ginsenosides are thought to be the active components in ginseng. A systematic review of five trials involving 747 patients found insufficient evidence to support the use of ginseng to reduce the incidence or severity of a cold. However, researchers noted that one study found a 25% reduction in the number of colds when taking ginseng compared to a placebo, and two studies found ginseng reduced the duration of colds by 6.2 days compared to a placebo. There are some concerns regarding the use of ginseng, including that it may reduce the effectiveness of certain medications and is thought to have estrogen-like properties (problematic for those with hormone-related conditions). People with heart conditions, schizophrenia, or diabetes shouldn't take ginseng root unless under a healthcare provider's supervision. Ginseng can be found in the OTC cold medicine, Cold-fX. The manufacturer claims that because its product isn't a whole-plant extract but contains a certain compound found in ginseng, it doesn't have the side effects and safety concerns commonly associated with ginseng. Although that's possible, there isn't published safety data confirming these claims. What to Know Before Taking American Ginseng Zinc Oral zinc may reduce the length and severity of a cold but has not been shown to be effective against the flu. Zinc is available in two forms: Oral zinc: lozenges, tablets, and syrupIntranasal zinc: swabs and gels A 2015 analysis of clinical trials found that oral zinc helps to reduce the length of colds when taken within 24 hours after symptoms start. The study authors commented that zinc lozenges have been widely studied at a dose of 75 milligrams per day. They also noted that for those considering using zinc, it would be best to use it at this dose throughout the cold. Oral zinc can cause side effects, including nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms. Long-term use of zinc, especially in high doses, can cause copper deficiency. Zinc may also interact with drugs, including antibiotics and penicillamine (a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis), so always talk with your healthcare provider before taking a zinc supplement. Intranasal zinc Intranasal zinc has been linked to a severe side effect\u2014irreversible loss of the sense of smell\u2014and should not be used. Vitamin C Like zinc, vitamin C has no effect on the flu. It may reduce the length and severity of cold symptoms slightly but does not prevent colds. A 2013 review of scientific literature found that taking vitamin C regularly (before getting a cold) was linked to small improvements in cold symptoms. However, in studies where people took vitamin C only after they got a cold, vitamin C did not improve their symptoms. Green Tea Green tea contains high levels of natural polyphenols and antioxidants called catechins. These compounds provide health benefits that may include preventing or reducing flu symptoms. A review found a few studies that suggest tea catechins may have a preventive effect on the flu and common cold, the researchers noted that the number of studies is limited. These studies provided tea catechins either in the form of green tea (1 to 5 cups/day) or in capsule form. Since green tea is low in caffeine, doesn't pose any harm, and can provide much-needed fluids when people are sick, it's a reasonable remedy to consider. Topical Ointments If your flu symptoms include cough and congestion, topical ointments may be helpful. One study found vapor rub containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oil applied to the neck and chest reduced nighttime cough and improved sleep in children and adults. However, the study authors also cautioned that some study participants experienced side effects, such as a burning sensation to the skin (28%), nose (14%), and eyes (16%). Rash and redness of skin each occurred in 5% of people using vapor rub. Natural Flu Prevention Tips The best defense is a good offense. Do what you can to protect yourself from the flu, including getting your annual flu vaccine. Natural prevention strategies can also go a long way in helping protect you from the influenza virus: Drink plenty of fluids: Water is best.Wash your hands frequently: Be sure to wash thoroughly and rinse well. Use a hand sanitizer if you don't have access to soap and water.Get rest: Lack of sleep may lower your immunity.Stay active: Regular, moderate aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, boosts your immune system.Reduce your stress level: Stress has been shown to temporarily lower your immunity. When to See a Healthcare Provider If you are pregnant, 65 years or older, or are at high risk of flu-related complications, you should talk with a healthcare provider right away. Other reasons to contact a healthcare provider include: Trouble breathing or fast breathingDehydrationFever that lasts longer than four daysSymptoms that last more than 10 days without improvementSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that improve but then return or worsenWorsening of chronic medical conditions Note that this list is not all-inclusive. You should see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. If symptoms of pneumonia develop at any time, such as high fever, severe cough, phlegm, or sharp pains when breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Summary There is currently no cure for the flu, but various home remedies may help relieve symptoms. A small amount of evidence suggests some remedies may shorten the duration of an illness, but more research is needed. When possible, take steps to prevent the flu by getting the yearly vaccine and practicing healthy habits to keep your immune system strong. Talk to a healthcare provider if you are concerned about any symptoms, if symptoms get worse, or if symptoms don't improve after 10 days. 26 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
