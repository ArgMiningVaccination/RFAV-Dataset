{"title": "Case Series of Three Neurological Side Effects in Younger-Aged Individuals After Pfizer's mRNA Vaccine", "author": "Elliot Dinetz", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "With the worldwide goal of ending the pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been introduced as a valuable tool to help achieve both herd immunity and protect the most vulnerable. Neurological side effects from such vaccines have been increasingly documented, but to date, they are still deemed rare with no caution advised per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As more of the younger population (under 40) are getting vaccinated according to recent approval and CDC recommendations, the real-world safety reporting data on adverse events have yet had time to catch up. We present three distinct neurological events that occurred after the Pfizer mRNA vaccine (BioNTech, Mainz, Germany), without identifiable alternate etiologies, in patients with an average age of 36 years presenting to an urban Florida clinic, all within eight weeks of one another. The presented cases occurred within hours of the second dose and, in one case, after the third booster dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. These cases illustrate rising concerns of risks in widely recognized very low-risk age categories. A clearly delineated risk-benefit strategy likely needs to be implemented.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-04-03", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
